A single heterozygous missense variant in this gene has been reported in the literature to cause Fanconi renotubular syndrome 3.\n\n*EHHADH* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Fanconi renotubular syndrome 3 in 2014. (Klootwijk et al, PMID: 24401050). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only report of a genetic defect in *EHHADH* identified in a family with the disease. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (2.5 points):\nA heterozygous missense variant has been reported in 1 family with nine affected individuals in 2 publications (PMIDs: 24401050, 1627757). Functional evidence shows that this primarily peroxisomal protein is mistargeted to the mitochondria as the variant, Glu3Lys, creates a mitochondrial-targeting signal and interferes with mitochondrial function by interacting with the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (PMID: 24401050, 27160910). The mechanism for disease is expected to be dominant negative.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (1 point):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by limited experimental evidence. The *EHHADH* protein is shown to be expressed in the renal proximal tubules, which are tissues relevant to the disease (PMIDs: 24401050, 10336479). In addition, experiments with the variant expressed in proximal tubular cells show functional impairment and confirm mistargeting of the protein to the mitochondria (PMIDs: 24401050, 10336479).   \n  \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *EHHADH* and Fanconi renotubular syndrome 3. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f938d7bc-f717-438c-bc27-962ba62dde93"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
