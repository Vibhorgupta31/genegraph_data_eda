These diseases are genetically diverse and associated with rare mutations in a large number of genes, many of which overlap among the phenotypes. To better investigate the genetic overlap between these three phenotypes and to identify new genotype-phenotype correlations, we designed a custom gene panel consisting of 115 genes known to be associated with cardiomyopathic phenotypes and channelopathies. A cohort of 38 unrelated patients, 16 affected by DCM, 14 by HCM and 8 by ARVC, was recruited for the study on the basis of more severe phenotypes and family history of cardiomyopathy and/or sudden death. We detected a total of 142 rare variants in 40 genes, and all patients were found to be carriers of at least one rare variant. Twenty-eight of the 142 rare variants were also predicted as potentially pathogenic variants and found in 26 patients. In 23 out of 38 patients, we found at least one novel potential gene-phenotype association. In particular, we detected three variants in OBSCN gene in ARVC patients, four variants in ANK2 gene and two variants in DLG1, TRPM4, and AKAP9 genes in DCM patients, two variants in PSEN2 gene and four variants in AKAP9 gene in HCM patients. Overall, our results confirmed that cardiomyopathic patients could carry multiple rare gene variants; in addition, our investigation of the genetic overlap among cardiomyopathies revealed new gene-phenotype associations. Furthermore, as our study confirms, data obtained using targeted next-generation sequencing could provide a remarkable contribution to the molecular diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, early identification of patients at risk for arrhythmia development, and better clinical management of cardiomyopathic patients.","dc:creator":"Forleo C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing detects novel gene-phenotype associations and expands the mutational spectrum in cardiomyopathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28750076","rdfs:label":"ARVD patient 1812"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"class 3 (highly conserved and not in gnomAD)"},{"id":"cggv:6aef3ba6-bf87-4e55-aeda-2bf802abf402_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bfc8a4d2-c977-4641-b0f8-865ae2e6e35c","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","phenotypeFreeText":"The majority (n=54, 78%) of study subjects were first-degree relatives of ARVD/C probands who were identified through family screening.

The goal of this paper is to review a single-center experience with pediatric ARVC/D and propose modifications of current diagnostic criteria to appropriately include pediatric ARVC/D. We identified 16 pediatric cases of ARVC/D from our tertiary care center. Patient demographics, presentation, course, genetic testing, and family history were reviewed. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with ARVC/D through the modified diagnostic criteria, genetic testing, and pathology. Five patients had positive family histories. Five patients presented with cardiac arrest, and six were found to have ventricular tachycardia. Two patients presented with heart failure. Six autopsies, six explanted hearts, and three biopsies found massive fibro-fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall. Six patients underwent heart transplantation, and two have received automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Two patients had identifiable genetic mutations previously noted in the literature. One patient had a novel mutation of a known ARVC/D gene. Many pediatric patients do not meet the current ARVC/D diagnostic criteria, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment. The current criteria need further revision to encompass pediatric manifestations of ARVC/D. In our opinion, pathological and clinical findings alone are sufficient for accurate diagnosis of pediatric ARVC/D. Creating modified pediatric criteria would facilitate prompt diagnosis and management of ARVC/D and facilitate structured research with the goal of improving outcomes.

Three publications from the same research group found linkage to chromosome 1q42-q43 and variants in RYR2 in families with right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC2) also described as CPVT with fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricle   (Rampazzo A et al., Hum Mol Genet 1995; 4(11):2151–2154; 11078270; 11159936). A mouse model made from one of the variants (RyR2 R176Q/_ ) found in family 105 that has two variants on one allele (R176Q/T2504M),  showed a CPVT like phenotype without evidence of fibrofatty infiltration or structural abnormalities characteristic of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (16873551). In several papers RYR2 missense variants were described in possible ARVD index patients. Some of these variants were also relatively often present in reference alleles from the gnomAD  database, clear ARVD diagnosis is not provided, segregation information is not informative and/or CPVT was also present in the family  (28750076, 26743400, 25041964, 16084945, 27005929). In a recent review it was also recognized that the observed phenotype in the original three publications that reported RYR2 variants in ARVD for the first time should be catecholamine-induced ventricular tachycardia rather than ARVD, and this gene is no longer considered as ARVD causing (29543670). This gene is therefore refuted as a candidate for ARVD.\nThis classification was refuted because the observed phenotype in the original publications that reported RYR2 variants in ARVD  should be catecholamine-induced ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) rather than ARVD. Subsequent variants found in this gene in ARVD patients were uninformative or too frequent to be disease-causing.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:52fa7dee-4daa-4685-9461-f39c57a22f05"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
