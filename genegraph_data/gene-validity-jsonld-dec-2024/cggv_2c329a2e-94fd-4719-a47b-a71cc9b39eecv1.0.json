However, the risks of other (extracolonic) cancers for MUTYH mutation carriers are not well defined. We identified 266 probands (91% Caucasians) with a MUTYH mutation (41 biallelic and 225 monoallelic) from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Mutation status, sex, age and histories of cancer from their 1,903 first- and 3,255 second-degree relatives were analyzed using modified segregation analysis conditioned on the ascertainment criteria. Compared with incidences for the general population, hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers were: urinary bladder cancer 19 (3.7-97) and ovarian cancer 17 (2.4-115). The HRs (95% CI) for monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers were: gastric cancer 9.3 (6.7-13); hepatobiliary cancer 4.5 (2.7-7.5); endometrial cancer 2.1 (1.1-3.9) and breast cancer 1.4 (1.0-2.0). There was no evidence for an increased risk of cancers at the other sites examined (brain, pancreas, kidney or prostate). Based on the USA population incidences, the estimated cumulative risks (95% CI) to age 70 years for biallelic mutation carriers were: bladder cancer 25% (5-77%) for males and 8% (2-33%) for females and ovarian cancer 14% (2-65%). The cumulative risks (95% CI) for monoallelic mutation carriers were: gastric cancer 5% (4-7%) for males and 2.3% (1.7-3.3%) for females; hepatobiliary cancer 3% (2-5%) for males and 1.4% (0.8-2.3%) for females; endometrial cancer 3% (2%-6%) and breast cancer 11% (8-16%). These unbiased estimates of both relative and absolute risks of extracolonic cancers for people, mostly Caucasians, with MUTYH mutations will be important for their clinical management.","dc:creator":"Win AK","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Risk of extracolonic cancers for people with biallelic and monoallelic mutations in MUTYH."},"rdfs:label":"MUTYH Ovarian Cancer Win et al."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","dc:description":"The cohort population is not focused on ovarian cancer.

Biallelic and monoallelic variants in *MUTYH* were linked to multiple types of cancer and/or tumor, including hereditary breast cancer, familial ovarian cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split these associations into different curations due to phenotypic differences and/or inheritance mechanism . Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer. \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point** \nTo date, this gene-disease relationship has been studied in one cohort studies at the aggregate variant level. This cohort studies suggested no increased risk for ovarian cancer in monoallelic *MUTYH* variant carriers compared to controls (PMID: 27194394). \n\n**Overall Summary**\nIn summary, given that the only one cohort study showed no increased risk for ovarian cancer in monoallelic *MUTYH* variant carriers, and no experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *MUTYH* plays in autosomal dominant ovarian cancer. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 11/29/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 06/23/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\nGiven that the only one cohort study showed no increased risk for ovarian cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers, and no experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association.
