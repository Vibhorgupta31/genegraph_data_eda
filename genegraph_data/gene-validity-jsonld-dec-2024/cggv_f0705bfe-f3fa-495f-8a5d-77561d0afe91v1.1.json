KIZ mRNA levels were assessed on blood and serum-deprived human fibroblasts from a control individual and a patient, compound heterozygous for the c.52G>T (p.Glu18*) and c.119_122del (p.Lys40Ilefs*14) mutations in KIZ.

In addition, PLK1S1 immunolocalization was conducted in mouse retinal cryosections and isolated rod photoreceptors. Analyses of additional RCD patients enabled the identification of two homozygous mutations in KIZ, the known c.226C>T (p.Arg76*) mutation and a novel variant, the c.3G>A (p.Met1?) mutation. Albeit the expression levels of KIZ were three-times lower in the patient than controls in whole blood cells, further analyses in control- and mutant KIZ patient-derived fibroblasts unexpectedly revealed no significant difference between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the averaged monocilia length in the two fibroblast cell lines was similar, consistent with the preserved immunolocalization of KIZ at the basal body of the primary cilia. Analyses in mouse retina and isolated rod photoreceptors showed PLK1S1 localization at the base of the photoreceptor connecting cilium. In conclusion, two additional patients with mutations in KIZ were identified, further supporting that defects in KIZ/PLK1S1, detected at the basal body of the primary cilia in fibroblasts, and the photoreceptor connecting cilium in mouse, respectively, are involved in RCD. However, albeit the mutations were predicted to lead to nonsense mediated mRNA decay, we could not detect changes upon expression levels, protein localization or cilia length in KIZ-mutated fibroblast cells. Together, our findings unveil the limitations of fibroblasts as a cellular model for RCD and call for other models such as induced pluripotent stem cells to shed light on retinal pathogenic mechanisms of KIZ mutations.","dc:creator":"El Shamieh S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Further Insights into the Ciliary Gene and Protein KIZ and Its Murine Ortholog PLK1S1 Mutated in Rod-Cone Dystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"ElShamieh_CIC07875"},{"id":"cggv:4ea77866-282b-41aa-850a-48af24540746","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4ea77866-282b-41aa-850a-48af24540746_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"- homozygous\n- large allele frequency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a0f838a2-cf86-4656-ae87-f72c0b634754_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0f838a2-cf86-4656-ae87-f72c0b634754","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":32,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c7ff7629-fe68-4a02-9b14-90a1e919f318"},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient\nreported nyctalopia with difficulty navigating in dimly lit environments since her teenage years.

Our results suggest that in patients presenting with either irregular ring shapes or asymmetric disease, emphasis should be placed in targeted gene sequencing of genes known to cause adRP, such as RHO and RP1.","dc:creator":"Jauregui R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Disease asymmetry and hyperautofluorescent ring shape in retinitis pigmentosa patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Jauregui_Case3"},{"id":"cggv:f5d12489-5a00-4add-9ebe-8469226d2824","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f5d12489-5a00-4add-9ebe-8469226d2824_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"- homozygous\n- unsure of genotyping method\n- large allele frequency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c558a4bc-edf9-4544-894b-f756d9be14eb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c558a4bc-edf9-4544-894b-f756d9be14eb","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7ff7629-fe68-4a02-9b14-90a1e919f318"},"detectionMethod":"Whole exomes of three affected (II:2, II:4 and II:6) and to unaffected family members (I:6, II:3) were sequenced using Agilent Sure Select V1 probes (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

The unique physiology and relationship to the photoreceptors make the RPE a critical determinant of human vision. Therefore, we performed a global expression profiling of native and cultured human fetal and adult RPE and determined a set of highly expressed 'signature' genes by comparing the observed RPE gene profiles to the Novartis expression database (SymAtlas: http://wombat.gnf.org/index.html) of 78 tissues. Using stringent selection criteria of at least 10-fold higher expression in three distinct preparations, we identified 154 RPE signature genes, which were validated by qRT-PCR analysis in RPE and in an independent set of 11 tissues. Several of the highly expressed signature genes encode proteins involved in visual cycle, melanogenesis and cell adhesion and Gene ontology analysis enabled the assignment of RPE signature genes to epithelial channels and transporters (ClCN4, BEST1, SLCA20) or matrix remodeling (TIMP3, COL8A2). Fifteen RPE signature genes were associated with known ophthalmic diseases, and 25 others were mapped to regions of disease loci. An evaluation of the RPE signature genes in a recently completed AMD genomewide association (GWA) data set revealed that TIMP3, GRAMD3, PITPNA and CHRNA3 signature genes may have potential roles in AMD pathogenesis and deserve further examination. We propose that RPE signature genes are excellent candidates for retinal diseases and for physiological investigations (e.g. dopachrome tautomerase in melanogenesis). The RPE signature gene set should allow the validation of RPE-like cells derived from human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells for cell-based therapies of degenerative retinal diseases.","dc:creator":"Strunnikova NV","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Transcriptome analysis and molecular signature of human retinal pigment epithelium."},"rdfs:label":"Strunnikova_Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2dd46b13-d9d0-40f9-a11a-a5d139680cc7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4adc2e71-6cf3-471d-99f5-2448c1445001","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Each gene has been reported to function in cilia by previous biocurators.

KIZ is a protein necessary for centromere stabilization during mitosis. Mutations in *KIZ* are thought to cause defects in photoreceptor connecting cilium, leading to retinal disorders such as RP. There is significant heterogeneity in RP,  however patients with *KIZ*-associated retinopathy have been reported to have fundus findings typical of RP, that is, vascular attenuation and peripheral retinal atrophy with pigment migration. A perifoveal ring of increased autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence imaging and a rod-cone dystrophy have also been described.\n\nFour suspected pathogenic variants (two nonsense, one frameshift, and one found in the *KIZ* initiation codon) that have been reported in 14 probands across six publications (PMIDs: 24680887, 29057815, 32052671, 31556760, 28837078, 32098976) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *KIZ* is non-specifically expressed in retina tissue (PMID:25613900). Multiple RT-PCR experiments have confirmed the expression of *KIZ* in human retina samples (PMIDs: 24680887 and 29057815). Finally, using microarray and RT-PCR data, Strunnikova et al. found that *KIZ* was highly expressed in the RPE layer of the retina (PMID: 20360305). Experiments have also shown that KIZ colocalizes with the cilium markers α-tubulin and γ-tubulin in the basal body of cilia in photoreceptors in mouse retina (PMID: 29057815) and in human fibroblasts (PMID: 24680887).\n\nIn summary, *KIZ* is definitively associated with KIZ-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on February 2, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f0705bfe-f3fa-495f-8a5d-77561d0afe91"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
