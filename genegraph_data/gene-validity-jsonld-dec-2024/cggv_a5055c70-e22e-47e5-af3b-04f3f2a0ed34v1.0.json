Malformations of sperm flagella can cause male infertility. Men with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) have abnormal spermatozoa with absent, short, coiled, bent, and/or irregular-caliber flagella, which impair sperm motility. The known human MMAF-associated genes, such as DNAH1, only account for fewer than 45% of affected individuals. Pathogenic mechanisms in the genetically unexplained MMAF remain to be elucidated. Here, we conducted genetic analyses by using whole-exome sequencing and genome-wide comparative genomic hybridization microarrays in a multi-center cohort of 30 Han Chinese men affected by MMAF. Among them, 12 subjects could not be genetically explained by any known MMAF-associated genes. Intriguingly, we identified compound-heterozygous mutations in CFAP43 in three subjects and a homozygous frameshift mutation in CFAP44 in one subject. All of these recessive mutations were parentally inherited from heterozygous carriers but were absent in 984 individuals from three Han Chinese control populations. CFAP43 and CFAP44, encoding two cilia- and flagella-associated proteins (CFAPs), are specifically or preferentially expressed in the testis. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated two knockout models each deficient in mouse ortholog Cfap43 or Cfap44. Notably, both Cfap43- and Cfap44-deficient male mice presented with MMAF phenotypes, whereas the corresponding female mice were fertile. Our experimental observations on human subjects and animal models strongly suggest that biallelic mutations in either CFAP43 or CFAP44 can cause sperm flagellar abnormalities and impair sperm motility. Further investigations on other CFAP-encoding genes in more genetically unexplained MMAF-affected individuals could uncover novel mechanisms underlying sperm flagellar formation.","dc:creator":"Tang S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Biallelic Mutations in CFAP43 and CFAP44 Cause Male Infertility with Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Sperm Flagella."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a5055c70-e22e-47e5-af3b-04f3f2a0ed34_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1851d3a9-12ab-4ac6-92d0-8d9d552d81ae_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1851d3a9-12ab-4ac6-92d0-8d9d552d81ae","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":39,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d72db331-5ae3-4c8a-a55b-aa786b00e091","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025145.7(CFAP43):c.1577_1578del (p.Thr526SerfsTer43)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5680869"}},"detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing was performed to verify the selected variants in all the available family members.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0033525","obo:HP_0012207","obo:HP_0012868","obo:HP_0000798","obo:HP_0033524","obo:HP_0032558","obo:HP_0032562","obo:HP_0012864","obo:HP_0012208","obo:HP_0032560","obo:HP_0012865","obo:HP_0003251","obo:HP_0033393","obo:HP_0034011","obo:HP_0032559"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b1e4e4f0-ec7a-445c-8c04-0ba5975d65ba_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d72db331-5ae3-4c8a-a55b-aa786b00e091"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34100391","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) is a specific type of asthenoteratozoospermia, presenting with multiple morphological anomalies in spermatozoa, such as absent, bent, coiled, short, or irregular caliber flagella. Previous genetic studies revealed pathogenic mutations in genes encoding cilia and flagella-associated proteins (CFAPs; e.g., CFAP43, CFAP44, CFAP65, CFAP69, CFAP70, and CFAP251) responsible for the MMAF phenotype in infertile men from different ethnic groups. However, none of them have been identified in infertile Pakistani males with MMAF. In the current study, two Pakistani families with MMAF patients were recruited. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of patients and their parents was performed. WES analysis reflected novel biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CFAP43 in both families (Family 1: ENST00000357060.3, p.Arg300Lysfs*22 and p.Thr526Serfs*43 in a compound heterozygous state; Family 2: ENST00000357060.3, p.Thr526Serfs*43 in a homozygous state). Sanger sequencing further confirmed that these mutations were segregated recessively in the families with the MMAF phenotype. Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to detect the effect of the mutation on mRNA of the affected gene. Previous research demonstrated that biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CFAP43 accounted for the majority of all CFAP43-mutant MMAF patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report CFAP43 biallelic loss-of-function mutations in a Pakistani population with the MMAF phenotype. This study will help researchers and clinicians to understand the genetic etiology of MMAF better.","dc:creator":"Khan I","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Novel biallelic loss-of-function mutations in "}},"rdfs:label":"Khan Family 2 IV-3"},{"id":"cggv:b1e4e4f0-ec7a-445c-8c04-0ba5975d65ba","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b1e4e4f0-ec7a-445c-8c04-0ba5975d65ba_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b1e4e4f0-ec7a-445c-8c04-0ba5975d65ba_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"To determine the effects of the frameshift mutation (c.1577_1578del) on CFAP43 expression, authors measured CFAP43 mRNA in spermatozoa of the patient using the sperm sample from a fertile male as control.

Individuals with Spermatogenic Failure 19 present with a combination of sperm flagellar malformations (absent, short, coiled, bent, and/or irregular-caliber flagella), unassembled sperm fibrous sheaths, and defects in axoneme structure (a lack of or misalignment of the central pair microtubules, disorganized double microtubules) (PMIDs: 31781811, 31210147).\n\nMutations were first reported in the *CFAP43* (*Cilia-and Flagella-Associated Protein 43*) gene in association with Spermatogenic Failure 19 in 2017 by Tang et al. (PMID: 28552195). Whole exome sequencing was used to identify biallelic *CFAP43* mutations in men with MMAF. The specific disease entity, Spermatogenic Failure 19, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the *CFAP43* gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and autosomal recessive mode of inheritance to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases of primary male infertility caused by inherited *CFAP43* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, Spermatogenic Failure 19 (MONDO: 0054723, OMIM: 617592).\n\nEvidence from 15 probands in 3 publications has been included in this curation representing 16 unique *CFAP43* variants (3 missense, 5 nonsense, 6 frameshift, 2 splice site, and 1 large deletion). The mechanism of pathogenicity in *CFAP43* mutations appears to be biallelic loss of function. There is additional case-level evidence available in the literature, but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points).\n\nThe gene-disease association between *CFAP43* and Spermatogenic Failure 19 is supported by gene expression and protein localization studies. RNAseq studies in humans (PMID: 24309898) show a high level of *CFAP43* expression in testis.  Murine RNAseq studies during sperm development show a pattern of increasing *CFAP43* expression during the progression of spermatogenesis (PMID: 31781811). Immunoelectron and stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy performed on TbCFAP43 and TbCFAP44 in the flagellated protozoan *Trypanosoma brucei* show that both proteins are located between the doublet microtubules 5 and 6 (DMT 5-6) and the paraflagellar rod (PMID: 3319078). The paraflagellar rod runs parallel to the axoneme along most of its length and is connected to axoneme doublet microtubules 4-7. The DMT 5-6 bridge limits inter-doublet sliding, offering a firm plane that is vertical to the bending plane of the flagella. Were CFAP43 to also be localized to the DMT 5-6 bridge in humans (as has been shown in *T. brucei*), the absence of CFAP43 in human patients could destabilize this complex, producing both peri-axonemal and axonemal defects that are consistent with the defective sperm phenotypes seen in patients with Spermatogenic Failure 19.\n\nTwo animal models have been used to support the gene-disease relationship between *CFAP43* and Spermatogenic Failure 19. Frameshift mutations in the mouse *CFAP43* ortholog, *Cfap43*, were induced by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. *Cfap43*-deficient male mice, like human male patients with biallelic mutation in *CFAP43*, exhibited male infertility and reduced or no sperm motility (PMID: 28552195). Almost all spermatozoa of *Cfap43*-deficient male mice had flagellar abnormalities. These flagella had short, coiled, or other distorted shapes, consistent with the clinical phenotypes seen in human patients with MMAF. In addition, these mice showed ultrastructural defects consistent with those seen in human patients: disorganized axoneme, no central pair complex (CPC), disarranged outer dense fibers and peripheral microtubules. *Trypanosoma brucei* was used as a model organism to characterize the role of TbCFAP43 in the structure and beating of the trypanosome flagellum (PMID: 29449551). Inducible RNA interference knockdown of *TbCFAP43* in *T. brucei*  produced cells with abnormal flagellar beating, multi-flagellated cells, a reduction in cell proliferation, and severe ultrastructural defects: disorganized axoneme ultrastructure, 90° rotated CPC, displaced CPC and DMTs, and abnormally enlarged flagellar pocket with multiple flagella. The ultrastructural defects and abnormal flagellar beating seen in trypanosome *TbCFAP43* knockdown are consistent with the abnormal sperm motility, abnormal sperm axoneme morphology, and central pair defects seen in patients with *CFAP43* mutations and suggest that CFAP43 is required for axonemal organization in sperm flagella.\n\n*Cfap43*-deficient mice were used to demonstrate that Cfap43 plays an important role in intra-manchette transport (IMT) during spermeogenesis (PMID: 33046149). Intra-manchette transport (IMT) transfers structural and functional proteins via microtubule tracks and motor proteins to the basal body region. The manchette is essential for the shaping of the sperm head and formation of the sperm tail. A role for CFAP43 in intra-manchette transport is consistent with the defects seen in sperm morphology and motility in *CFAP43* patients.\n\nIn summary, there is **definitive** evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in *CFAP43* and Spermatogenic Failure 19. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on October 13, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a5055c70-e22e-47e5-af3b-04f3f2a0ed34"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
