Whole genome sequence from one affected subject was filtered using linkage data and variant databases. A single gene, MEGF10, contained nonsynonymous mutations that co-segregated with the phenotype. Affected subjects were compound heterozygous for missense mutations c.976T > C (p.C326R) and c.2320T > C (p.C774R). Screening the MEGF10 open reading frame in 190 patients with genetically unexplained myopathies revealed a heterozygous mutation, c.211C > T (p.R71W), in one additional subject with a similar clinical and histological presentation as the discovery family. All three mutations were absent from at least 645 genotyped unaffected control subjects. MEGF10 contains 17 atypical epidermal growth factor-like domains, each of which contains eight cysteine residues that likely form disulfide bonds. Both the p.C326R and p.C774R mutations alter one of these residues, which are completely conserved in vertebrates. Previous work showed that murine Megf10 is required for preserving the undifferentiated, proliferative potential of satellite cells, myogenic precursors that regenerate skeletal muscle in response to injury or disease. Here, knockdown of megf10 in zebrafish by four different morpholinos resulted in abnormal phenotypes including unhatched eggs, curved tails, impaired motility, and disorganized muscle tissue, corroborating the pathogenicity of the human mutations.

At least 11 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data,\nand experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least nine probands in four publications (PMIDs: 22101682, 22371254, 23453856, 27460346). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members plus several sibling pairs. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached.The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function, with MEGF10 deficency reducing the proliferation and migration of muscle sattelite cells, impeding muscle repair, and supporting premature differentiation in myoblasts during development. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in a form of multiminicore myopathy with generally reduced phenotypic severity and later age of onset. This entity is considered part of the MEGF10-related myopathy spectrum.\nThis gene-disease association is supported by two animal models, expression studies, biochemical function evidence, and myoblast alteration. Models in both zebrafish and mice displayed some phenotypes of MEGF10 myopathy, but were ultimately limited in scope. Expression data showed clear expression in myoblasts during development and sattelite cells in mature organisms further supporting the disease mechanism. Biochemical function studies demonstrated the MEGF10 pathogenic mechanism. Mouse myoblasts were altered and found to have reduced migration, proliferation, and premature differentiation in the absence of MEFG10. \nIn summary, MEGF10 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MEGF10-related myopathy. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Working Group on 01/27/20 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1d00193c-b0fd-40b4-b5d5-51eecece9669"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
