However, the knowledge about the associated clinical picture remains fragmentary. In this study, two individuals with de novo TCF20 sequence variants were identified in a cohort of 313 individuals with intellectual disability of unknown aetiology, which was analysed by whole exome sequencing using a child-parent trio design. Both detected variants - one nonsense and one frameshift variant - were truncating. A comprehensive clinical characterisation of the patients yielded mild intellectual disability, postnatal tall stature and macrocephaly, obesity and muscular hypotonia as common clinical signs while ASD was only present in one proband. The present report begins to establish the clinical picture of individuals with de novo nonsense and frameshift variants of TCF20 which includes features such as proportionate overgrowth and muscular hypotonia. Furthermore, intellectual disability/developmental delay seems to be fully penetrant amongst known individuals with de novo nonsense and frameshift variants of TCF20, whereas ASD is shown to be incompletely penetrant. The transcriptional co-regulator gene TCF20 is hereby added to the growing number of genes implicated in the aetiology of both ASD and intellectual disability.

TCF20 deletion significantly reduces the number of neurons, which leads to abnormal brain functions. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis and ChIP-qPCR reveal that the DNA demethylation factor TDG is a downstream target gene of TCF20. As a nonspecific DNA demethylation factor, TDG potentially affects many genes. Combined TDG ChIP-seq and GO analysis of TCF20 RNA-Seq identifies T-cell factor 4 (TCF-4) as a common target. TDG controls the DNA methylation level in the promoter area of TCF-4, affecting TCF-4 expression and modulating neural differentiation. Overexpression of TDG or TCF-4 rescues the deficient neurogenesis of TCF20 knockdown brains.

Western blotting, RT–qPCR, and immunostaining of brain slices confirmed that TCF20 was successfully deleted in TCF20 KO mice (Fig 4B–F). During development, the homozygous TCF20 KO mice showed severe global development delay, decreased body weight and brain size from embryo to P14. Over 80% of homozygous TCF20 KO mice died before P14. Compared with WT pups, the ultrasonic vocalization recordings showed that call numbers and total call durations were significantly reduced in HET and KO pups (Fig. 5). Open field tests showed that TCF20 HET mice did not have movement ability defects (Fig 5E–H). In the Y-Maze test, HET mice had a decreased tendency to enter the new arms, and the total time of HET mice remaining in each arm was similar, suggesting a defect in working memory (Figs 5I and EV4J). In the elevated plus maze, the moving time of HET mice in the open arms was significantly reduced, indicating anxiety-like behavior following loss of TCF20 (Figs 5J and K and EV4K). In the three-chamber test, HET mice did not prefer to interact with new novel wild-type mice, suggesting social interaction defects or social interest reduction (Fig 5M–Q). The marble burying test results showed that HET mice buried more marbles than WT mice, which indicated that HET mice exhibited repetitive behaviors (Figs 5L and EV4L). In their home cage, HET mice would also run in circles.

TCF20 regulates gene transcription by acting as a coactivator for a variety of other transcription factors. TCF20 was first associated with autosomal dominant developmental delay with variable intellectual impairment and behavioral abnormalities in 2014 (Babbs et al., PMID 25228304). More than 50 unrelated cases have been reported. The core phenotype of this disorder includes developmental delay / intellectual disability; autism spectrum disorder or other neurobehavioral concerns (e.g. ADHD); dysmorphic facial features; congenital hypotonia; variable neurological disturbances including ataxia, seizures, and movement and sleep disorders; and variable additional features affecting other organ systems. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Haploinsufficiency has been suggested as the mechanism for disease, but a potential dominant-negative mechanism has not been ruled out. This curation included eight unique variants (five frameshift, two stop-gained, one missense) identified in eight unrelated probands from four publications (Babbs et al., 2014 PMID 25228304; Schäfgen et al., 2016 PMID 27436265; Vetrini et al., 2019 PMID 30819258; Torti et al., 2019 PMID 30739909). In the majority of reported cases, variants occurred de novo, but rare cases of a variant inherited from an affected parent have been reported. Notably, two independent evaluations demonstrated that variant transcripts predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) escaped from NMD. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by TCF20 expression in the brain, a shared structure and biochemical function with another gene associated with a similar phenotype (RAI1) (Vetrini et al., 2019 PMID 30819258), a role in neurogenesis and neural differentiation, and behavioral abnormalities related to autism observed in a heterozygous knockout mouse model (Feng et al., 2020 PMID 32510763). In summary, TCF20 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant developmental delay with variable intellectual impairment and behavioral abnormalities. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on 7.28.2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:619ae2be-5ab6-418d-8824-373369337faa"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
