None of these children had the GCDH c.1262C-->T mutation that causes GA1 among the Amish. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, we identified a shared homozygous 4.7 Mb region on chromosome 7. This region contained 25 genes including C7orf10, an open reading frame with a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence and coenzyme-A transferase domain. Direct sequencing of C7orf10 revealed that the three Amish individuals were homozygous for a nonsynonymous sequence variant (c.895C-->T, Arg299Trp). We then sequenced three non-Amish children with GA3 and discovered two nonsense mutations (c.322C-->T, Arg108Ter, and c.424C-->T, Arg142Ter) in addition to the Amish mutation. Two pathogenic alleles were identified in each of the six patients. There was no consistent clinical phenotype associated with GA3. In affected individuals, urine molar ratios of glutarate to its derivatives (3-hydroxyglutarate, glutarylcarnitine, and glutarylglycine) were elevated, suggesting impaired formation of glutaryl-CoA. These observations refine our understanding of the lysine-tryptophan degradation pathway and have important implications for the pathophysiology of GA1.","dc:creator":"Sherman EA","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Genetic mapping of glutaric aciduria, type 3, to chromosome 7 and identification of mutations in c7orf10."}},"rdfs:label":"German Proband"},{"id":"cggv:faa8ca30-119f-4977-971f-bb8a4bfa4c5c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:faa8ca30-119f-4977-971f-bb8a4bfa4c5c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:faa8ca30-119f-4977-971f-bb8a4bfa4c5c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The variant was functionally characterized in PMID: 23893049: the mutation led to the production of insoluble and inactive protein both in E. coli and in HEK293T cells."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"In this asymptomatic patient the homozygous recurrent Arg299Trp missense variant was identified."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8120ab99-6c90-44ce-a9f0-e9212869bba5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8120ab99-6c90-44ce-a9f0-e9212869bba5","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:373d1d7d-1b72-4ca0-b760-cf69d9b16cd6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001193313.2(SUGCT):c.514C>T (p.Arg172Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115229"}},{"id":"cggv:880ccaa8-d8dd-4cf1-a4b2-55206b4308ff"}],"detectionMethod":"The candidate gene SUGCT (here referred to as C7orf10) was subjected to PCR amplification of the coding regions and adjacent intron-exon boundaries and Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003150","previousTestingDescription":"GA1 excluded on basis of normal urinary 3-hydroxyglutarate, glutarylcarnitine, and glutarylglycine values.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:6d91f0ef-645c-4e2e-affe-846f49e09f70_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:373d1d7d-1b72-4ca0-b760-cf69d9b16cd6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18926513"},{"id":"cggv:d85ce3e8-dd3f-490d-aa90-5822a98afaa0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:880ccaa8-d8dd-4cf1-a4b2-55206b4308ff"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18926513"}],"rdfs:label":"American Proband"},{"id":"cggv:6d91f0ef-645c-4e2e-affe-846f49e09f70","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d91f0ef-645c-4e2e-affe-846f49e09f70_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":" The variants were not confirmed to be biallelic. \n\nThe nonsense variant (referred to as Arg172Ter) occurs at a MAF of 0.00006458 (1/15484 alleles) in the gnomAD African population."},{"id":"cggv:d85ce3e8-dd3f-490d-aa90-5822a98afaa0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d85ce3e8-dd3f-490d-aa90-5822a98afaa0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d85ce3e8-dd3f-490d-aa90-5822a98afaa0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functionally characterized in PMID: 23893049: the mutation led to the production of insoluble and inactive protein both in E. coli and in HEK293T cells.

GA3 remains less well known, characterised and understood than glutaric aciduria types 1 and 2. It is generally considered a likely \"non-disease,\" but this is based on limited supporting information, with only nine individuals with GA3 described in the literature. Clinicians encountering a patient with GA3 therefore still face a dilemma of whether or not this should be dismissed as irrelevant.We have identified three unrelated Canadian patients with GA3. Two came to clinical attention because of symptoms, while the third was identified by a population urine-based newborn screening programme and has so far remained asymptomatic. We describe the clinical histories, biochemical characterisation and genotypes of these individuals. Examination of allele frequencies underlines the fact that GA3 is underdiagnosed. While one probable factor is that some GA3 patients remain asymptomatic, we highlight other plausible reasons whereby this diagnosis might be overlooked.Gastrointestinal disturbances were previously reported in some GA3 patients. In one of our patients, severe episodes of cyclic vomiting were the major problem.

The enzyme catalyzing this conversion has not been formally identified. However, a benign form of glutaric aciduria (glutaric aciduria type III) is due to mutations in C7orf10, a putative member of the coenzyme A transferase class III family. In the present work, we show that recombinant human C7orf10 catalyzes the succinyl-CoA-dependent conversion of glutarate to glutaryl-CoA. C7orf10 could use many dicarboxylic acids as CoA acceptors, the best ones being glutarate, succinate, adipate, and 3-hydroxymethylglutarate. Confocal microscopy analysis of CHO cells transfected with a C7orf10-GFP fusion protein indicated that C7orf10 is a mitochondrial protein, in agreement with the presence of a predicted mitochondrial propeptide at its N-terminus. The effect of a missense mutation (p.Arg336Trp) found in the homozygous state in several patients with glutaric aciduria type III and present in the general population at a low frequency was also investigated. The p.Arg336Trp mutation led to the production of insoluble and inactive C7orf10 both in Escherichia coli and in HEK293T cells. These findings indicate that C7orf10 is implicated in the metabolism of glutarate, but possibly also of longer dicarboxylic acids.

However, there were differences in the gut microbiome, in particular there was an increase in firmicutes relative to bacteroidtes in Sugct KO mice, with changes closely resembling observed microbiome disbalance in metabolic diseases like diabetes. Additionally, when aged 52 weeks the Sugct KO mice had increased body fat accumulation and progressive renal tubular vacuolation, which was accompanied with increased macrophage levels, fat accumulation in liver, and adipocyte death.

To study the disease mechanism, we generated SugctKO mice and uncovered imbalanced lipid and acylcarnitine metabolism in kidney in addition to changes in the gut microbiome. After SugctKO mice were treated with antibiotics, metabolites were comparable to WT, indicating that the microbiome affects metabolism in SugctKO mice.

This is associated with an obesity-related phenotype that is accompanied by lipid accumulation in kidney and liver, as well as \"crown-like\" structures in adipocytes. Furthermore, we show that the SugctKO kidney pathology is accelerated and exacerbated by a high-lysine diet.

SUGCT catalyzes the succinyl-CoA-dependent conversion of glutaric acid into glutaryl-CoA preventing urinary loss of the organic acid; in patients with deficiency of SUGCT there is a consequent accumulation of glutaric acid. Glutaric aciduria type 3 is a biochemical phenotype with uncertain clinical relevance. Evidence supporting the relationship between *SUGCT* and glutaric acidemia type 3 includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 18926513, 28766179, 29421601, 2779420, 37920852, 39101156). At least 7 unique missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of *SUGCT* which is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities observed in individuals with glutaric acidemia type 3 (PMID: 23893049) and the biochemical features of a Sugct knockout mouse (PMID: 31722069). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
