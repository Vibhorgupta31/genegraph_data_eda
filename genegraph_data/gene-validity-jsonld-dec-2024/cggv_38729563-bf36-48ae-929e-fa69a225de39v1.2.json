We employed a recently developed genotyping microarray, the ABCR400-chip, to search for known ABCA4 mutations in patients with isolated or autosomal recessive CRD (54 cases) or RP (90 cases). We performed detailed ophthalmologic examinations and identified at least one ABCA4 mutation in 18 patients (33%) with CRD and in five patients (5.6%) with RP. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and subsequent DNA sequencing revealed four novel missense mutations (R24C, E161K, P597S, G618E) and a novel 1-bp deletion (5888delG). Ophthalmoscopic abnormalities in CRD patients ranged from minor granular pigmentary changes in the posterior pole to widespread atrophy. In 12 patients with recordable electroretinogram (ERG) tracings, a cone-rod pattern was detected. Three patients demonstrated progression from a retinal dystrophy resembling STGD1 to a more widespread degeneration, and were subsequently diagnosed as CRD. In addition to a variable degree of atrophy, all RP patients displayed ophthalmologic characteristics of classic RP. When detectable, ERG recordings in these patients demonstrated rod-cone patterns of photoreceptor degeneration. In conclusion, in this study, we show that the ABCA4 mutation chip is an efficient first screening tool for arCRD.","dc:creator":"Klevering BJ","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Microarray-based mutation analysis of the ABCA4 (ABCR) gene in autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa."}},"rdfs:label":"12608"},{"id":"cggv:789b0bc4-2038-4928-af4a-f27353012782","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:789b0bc4-2038-4928-af4a-f27353012782_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:04d3386f-8206-4f06-a3e8-16f22783c75a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04d3386f-8206-4f06-a3e8-16f22783c75a","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:999d9d39-3fb8-4cd0-b2e8-d71b8f8a5041"},{"id":"cggv:3688861b-0267-4506-bd9b-4ddd1785556d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000350.2(ABCA4):c.5882G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA119132"}}],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:3625a3ec-24fd-4bd2-ad30-23aeb18aab93_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:999d9d39-3fb8-4cd0-b2e8-d71b8f8a5041"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18285826","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute a family of large membrane proteins, which transport a variety of substrates across membranes. The ABCA4 protein is expressed in photoreceptors and possibly functions as a transporter for N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-retinylidene-PE), the Schiff base adduct of all-trans-retinal with PE. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been initially associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. Subsequent studies have shown that mutations in ABCA4 can also cause a variety of other retinal dystrophies including cone rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. To determine the prevalence and mutation spectrum of ABCA4 gene mutations in non-Stargardt phenotypes, we have screened 64 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive cone (arCD) and cone rod dystrophy (arCRD) applying the Asper Ophthalmics ABCR400 microarray followed by DNA sequencing of all coding exons of the ABCA4 gene in subjects with single heterozygous mutations. Disease-associated ABCA4 alleles were identified in 20 of 64 patients with arCD or arCRD. In four of 64 patients (6%) only one mutant ABCA4 allele was detected and in 16 patients (25%), mutations on both ABCA4 alleles were identified. Based on these data we estimate a prevalence of 31% for ABCA4 mutations in arCD and arCRD, supporting the concept that the ABCA4 gene is a major locus for various types of degenerative retinal diseases with abnormalities in cone or both cone and rod function.","dc:creator":"Kitiratschky VB","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"ABCA4 gene analysis in patients with autosomal recessive cone and cone rod dystrophies."}},{"id":"cggv:d57aef4c-9226-4d14-96e4-aaa72369215c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3688861b-0267-4506-bd9b-4ddd1785556d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18285826"}],"rdfs:label":"ZD85/5862"},{"id":"cggv:d57aef4c-9226-4d14-96e4-aaa72369215c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d57aef4c-9226-4d14-96e4-aaa72369215c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:3625a3ec-24fd-4bd2-ad30-23aeb18aab93","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3625a3ec-24fd-4bd2-ad30-23aeb18aab93_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2f9d7974-0053-4c2f-90de-2227edb8a759_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f9d7974-0053-4c2f-90de-2227edb8a759","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":39,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:abce5dd1-7ff3-4b46-89f3-86f235ccd286","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000350.3(ABCA4):c.6445C>T (p.Arg2149Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA227404"}},{"id":"cggv:ad7fa8f9-ce2e-49f1-94c3-a6b45836b2a3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000350.2(ABCA4):c.[1622T>C;3113C>T]","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA119135"}}],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:415de019-1978-4660-83c3-4427647151d0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:abce5dd1-7ff3-4b46-89f3-86f235ccd286"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28559085","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To devise a comprehensive multiplatform genetic testing strategy for inherited retinal disease and to describe its performance in 1000 consecutive families seen by a single clinician.","dc:creator":"Stone EM","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Clinically Focused Molecular Investigation of 1000 Consecutive Families with Inherited Retinal Disease."}},{"id":"cggv:479d6514-b7e7-44af-98b3-6a69c689ed03_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ad7fa8f9-ce2e-49f1-94c3-a6b45836b2a3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28559085"}],"rdfs:label":"664"},{"id":"cggv:479d6514-b7e7-44af-98b3-6a69c689ed03","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:479d6514-b7e7-44af-98b3-6a69c689ed03_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:415de019-1978-4660-83c3-4427647151d0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:415de019-1978-4660-83c3-4427647151d0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:448de3b1-ed3d-46bf-afeb-f253245d6aeb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:448de3b1-ed3d-46bf-afeb-f253245d6aeb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:94be895a-cdcf-4f11-8431-10c91a1ddddf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000350.3(ABCA4):c.4539+1G>T (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA227207"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"\"classical retinitis pigmentosa (RP) picture\" Note: evaluated at age 57, though onset reported to be around age 6","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000662","obo:HP_0000512","obo:HP_0000533"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:58978afa-6c7f-42f3-97d7-535a461ff01e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:94be895a-cdcf-4f11-8431-10c91a1ddddf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9466990","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Ophthalmological and molecular genetic studies were performed in a consanguineous family with individuals showing either retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or cone-rod dystrophy (CRD). Assuming pseudodominant (recessive) inheritance of allelic defects, linkage analysis positioned the causal gene at 1p21-p13 (lod score 4.22), a genomic segment known to harbor the ABCR gene involved in Stargardt's disease (STGD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We completed the exon-intron structure of the ABCR gene and detected a severe homozygous 5[prime] splice site mutation, IVS30+1G->T, in the four RP patients. The five CRD patients in this family are compound heterozygotes for the IVS30+1G->T mutation and a 5[prime] splice site mutation in intron 40 (IVS40+5G->A). Both splice site mutations were found heterozygously in two unrelated STGD patients, but not in 100 control individuals. In these patients the second mutation was either a missense mutation or unknown. Since thus far no STGD patients have been reported to carry two ABCR null alleles and taking into account that the RP phenotype is more severe than the STGD phenotype, we hypothesize that the intron 30 splice site mutation represents a true null allele. Since the intron 30 mutation is found heterozygously in the CRD patients, the IVS40+5G->A mutation probably renders the exon 40 5[prime] splice site partially functional. These results show that mutations in the ABCR gene not only result in STGD and AMD, but can also cause autosomal recessive RP and CRD. Since the heterozygote frequency for ABCR mutations is estimated at 0.02, mutations in ABCR might be an important cause of autosomal recessive and sporadic forms of RP and CRD.","dc:creator":"Cremers FP","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy caused by splice site mutations in the Stargardt's disease gene ABCR."}},"rdfs:label":"7023 (V-3)"},{"id":"cggv:58978afa-6c7f-42f3-97d7-535a461ff01e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58978afa-6c7f-42f3-97d7-535a461ff01e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downscore homozygous per retina GCEP "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:95273ea4-7fce-4f06-b09d-3a881d370ce5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95273ea4-7fce-4f06-b09d-3a881d370ce5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":37,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:f30cd05d-662a-4f73-bc4e-117789fcbec1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000350.3(ABCA4):c.6148-698_6670del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10576058"}},{"id":"cggv:3688861b-0267-4506-bd9b-4ddd1785556d"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Scattered flecks, peripapillary sparing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0007663","secondTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:9259fa9b-fca1-4541-b6ae-8f75a7aa5d7d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3688861b-0267-4506-bd9b-4ddd1785556d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26527198","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Over 800 mutations in the ABCA4 gene cause autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. Due to extensive genetic heterogeneity, observed variant-associated phenotypes can manifest tremendous variability of expression. Furthermore, the high carrier frequency of pathogenic ABCA4 alleles in the general population (~1:20) often results in pseudo-dominant inheritance patterns further complicating the diagnosis and characterization of affected individuals. This study describes a genotype/phenotype analysis of an unusual family with multiple macular disease phenotypes spanning across two generations and segregating four distinct ABCA4 mutant alleles. Complete sequencing of ABCA4 discovered two known missense mutations, p.C54Y and p.G1961E. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a large novel deletion combined with a small insertion, c.6148-698_c.6670del/insTGTGCACCTCCCTAG, and complete sequencing of the entire ABCA4 genomic locus uncovered a new deep intronic variant, c.302+68C>T. Patients with the p.G1961E mutation had the mildest, confined maculopathy phenotype with peripheral flecks while those with all other mutant allele combinations exhibited a more advanced stage of generalized retinal and choriocapillaris atrophy. This family epitomizes the clinical and genetic complexity of ABCA4-associated diseases. It contained variants from all classes of mutations, in the coding region, deep intronic, both single nucleotide variants and copy number variants that accounted for varying phenotypes segregating in an apparent dominant fashion. Unequivocally defining disease-associated alleles in the ABCA4 locus requires a multifaceted approach that includes advanced mutation detection methods and a thorough analysis of clinical phenotypes.

disease (STGD) and late-onset fundus flavimaculatus (FFM) are autosomal recessive conditions leading to macular degenerations in childhood and adulthood, respectively. Recently, mutations of the photoreceptor cell-specific ATP binding transporter gene (ABCR) have been reported in Stargardt disease. Here, we report on the screening of the whole coding sequence of the ABCR gene in 40 unrelated STGD and 15 FFM families and we show that mutations truncating the ABCR protein consistently led to STGD. Conversely, all mutations identified in FFM were missense mutations affecting uncharged amino acids. These results provide the first genotype-phenotype correlations in ABCR gene mutations.","dc:creator":"Rozet JM","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Spectrum of ABCR gene mutations in autosomal recessive

photoreceptor cell-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter gene (ABCA4; previously denoted \"ABCR\") is mutated, in most patients, with autosomal recessive (AR) Stargardt disease (STGD1) or fundus flavimaculatus (FFM). In addition, a few cases with AR retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and AR cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) have been found to have ABCA4 mutations. To evaluate the importance of the ABCA4 gene as a cause of AR CRD, we selected 5 patients with AR CRD and 15 patients from Germany and The Netherlands with isolated CRD. Single-strand conformation-polymorphism analysis and sequencing revealed 19 ABCA4 mutations in 13 (65%) of 20 patients. In six patients, mutations were identified in both ABCA4 alleles; in seven patients, mutations were detected in one allele. One complex ABCA4 allele (L541P;A1038V) was found exclusively in German patients with CRD; one patient carried this complex allele homozygously, and five others were compound heterozygous. These findings suggest that mutations in the ABCA4 gene are the major cause of AR CRD. A primary role of the ABCA4 gene in STGD1/FFM and AR CRD, together with the gene's involvement in an as-yet-unknown proportion of cases with AR RP, strengthens the idea that mutations in the ABCA4 gene could be the most frequent cause of inherited retinal dystrophy in humans.","dc:creator":"Maugeri A","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mutations in the ABCA4 (ABCR) gene are the major cause of autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"9371"},{"id":"cggv:7f342fbd-c572-48f1-b2f3-782e2625c030","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f342fbd-c572-48f1-b2f3-782e2625c030_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:705a3520-bf78-4202-ba82-ee740901b12f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:705a3520-bf78-4202-ba82-ee740901b12f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":18,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:999d9d39-3fb8-4cd0-b2e8-d71b8f8a5041"},{"id":"cggv:3688861b-0267-4506-bd9b-4ddd1785556d"}],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:695c722e-8687-4bc2-ba86-050f1084014c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:999d9d39-3fb8-4cd0-b2e8-d71b8f8a5041"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28559085"},{"id":"cggv:e8aa7468-1db2-485c-bd3f-302dcb5e3d86_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3688861b-0267-4506-bd9b-4ddd1785556d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28559085"}],"rdfs:label":"675"},{"id":"cggv:e8aa7468-1db2-485c-bd3f-302dcb5e3d86","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8aa7468-1db2-485c-bd3f-302dcb5e3d86_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:695c722e-8687-4bc2-ba86-050f1084014c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:695c722e-8687-4bc2-ba86-050f1084014c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:38729563-bf36-48ae-929e-fa69a225de39_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38729563-bf36-48ae-929e-fa69a225de39_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92ba56d1-3677-46e4-b807-cc7b91b4252c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aec28d14-0c81-4de8-9c39-8023ac57d096","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunocytochemical and biochemical studies indicate localization of rim ABC protein to rod outer segment ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9092582","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Outer segments of mammalian rod photoreceptor cells contain an abundantly expressed membrane protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 220 kDa by SDS-gel electrophoresis.

Although essential for vision, 11-cis-retinal like all-trans-retinal is highly toxic due to its highly reactive aldehyde group and has to be detoxified by either reduction to retinol or sequestration within retinal-binding proteins. Previous studies have focused on the role of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4 associated with Stargardt macular degeneration and retinol dehydrogenases (RDH) in the clearance of all-trans-retinal from photoreceptors following photoexcitation. How rod and cone cells prevent the accumulation of 11-cis-retinal in photoreceptor disk membranes in excess of what is required for visual pigment regeneration is not known.

The clinical phenotype of Stargardt disease was first described in 1909 by Karl Bruno Stargardt [Stargardt, K. \"Über familiäre, progressive Degeneration in der Maculagegend des Auges.\" Albrecht von Graefes Archiv für Ophthalmologie 71.3 (1909): 534-550]. Stargardt disease phenotype can vary greatly, though the condition often presents with bilateral, progressive central or pericentral vision loss starting in adolescence or young adulthood, macular atrophy, and characteristic yellow/white retinal flecks around the macula seen on fundus exam (PMIDs: 9054934, 9781034, 28044389, 34874912). Stargardt disease, one of the most common inherited retinal disorders, has an estimated prevalence of 1/8,000-1/10,000 (PMID: 30578500), and *ABCA4* carrier frequency in the general population has been estimated to be as high as 1/10 to 1/40, although not all combinations of variants are expected to cause disease (PMIDs: 11379881, 14517951, 31964843).\n\nIn addition to Stargardt disease 1 (MIM: 248200), *ABCA4* has been associated with the following autosomal recessive disease entities: cone-rod dystrophy 3 (MIM: 604116), fundus flavimaculatus (MIM: 248200), retinal dystrophy, early-onset severe (MIM: 248200), and retinitis pigmentosa 19 (MIM: 601718). For this curation, the autosomal recessive disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, *ABCA4*-related retinopathy. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. It has been suggested that these autosomal recessive *ABCA4*-related retinopathies comprise a phenotypic spectrum, with disease severity depending in part on the combination of variants and variant types present (PMIDs: 9466990, 33261146, 34874912). Many individual disease-causing *ABCA4* variants have been associated with multiple phenotypes (PMID: 34874912). Of note, while we included cases from the literature with all of the aforementioned autosomal recessive *ABCA4*-related diagnoses, the Retina GCEP members feel that there is not strong evidence that *ABCA4* causes classic retinitis pigmentosa. It has been suggested that cases of retinitis pigmentosa-like disease related to biallelic *ABCA4* variants are more likely to be representative of advanced/severe cone-rod dystrophy with panretinal degeneration, rather than typical retinitis pigmentosa (PMID: 23755871). To account for a spectrum of retinal phenotypes that may be caused by variants in this gene, and in accordance with the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, the disease entity used for this curation is *ABCA4*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800406).\n\nThe *ABCA4* gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant age-related macular degeneration (MIM: 153800; PMIDs: 10458172, 10880298). However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the association of *ABCA4* and age-related macular degeneration (PMIDs: 10958763, 11346402, 26720470). This potential autosomal dominant association will be assessed separately in a future curation.\n\n27 variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site, large deletion, deep intronic, and complex alleles) that have been reported in 23 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 9054934, 9466990, 9781034, 10958761, 15494742, 18285826, 26527198, 28559085) are included in this curation. Probands included in this curation were reported to have the following clinical diagnoses: Stargardt disease, fundus flavimaculatus, cone-rod dystrophy, cone dystrophy, pattern dystrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa. More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, the Retina GCEP opted to exclude the common hypomorphic and/or low penetrant variants, *ABCA4* c.5603A>T (p.Asn1868Ile), *ABCA4* c.2588G>C (p.Gly863Ala), and *ABCA4* c.5882G>A (p.Gly1961Glu) from being included as countable variants in this curation given the abundance of other genetic evidence and remaining uncertainty regarding penetrance of those variants. However, we recognize that p.Asn1868Ile, p.Gly863Ala, and p.Gly1961Glu have been reported to be disease causing in certain contexts, especially when in trans with another severe/LOF *ABCA4* variant (PMIDs: 10090887, 28327576, 28446513, 29971439).\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity for autosomal recessive *ABCA4*-related retinopathy is reported to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (e.g. animal models, expression studies, *in vitro* functional assays, etc.) (PMIDs: 9054934, 9092582,10412977, 10888868, 20238056, 22735453, 22886305, 24707049). ABCA4 is transporter of retinoid compounds, and it prevents accumulation of 11-cis-retinal and facilitates clearance of all-trans-retinal following photoexcitation (PMIDs: 22735453, 24707049). *ABCA4* gene expression is localized to photoreceptors. While the ABCA4 protein was initially found to be localized to the outer segment of rods, it was later demonstrated to localize to foveal and peripheral cone cells as well (PMIDs: 9054934, 9092582, 10888868). *Abcr-/-* mice have features consistent with human disease, including accumulation of lipofuscin pigment in RPE, photoreceptor degeneration, and delayed dark adaptation (PMID: 10412977, 20238056, 22886305), and nanoparticle-mediated *ABCA4* delivery showed improved recovery of dark adaptation and reduced lipofuscin accumulation in knockout mice (PMID: 22886305). More experimental evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, *ABCA4* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive *ABCA4*-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on the meeting date October 6, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:38729563-bf36-48ae-929e-fa69a225de39"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
