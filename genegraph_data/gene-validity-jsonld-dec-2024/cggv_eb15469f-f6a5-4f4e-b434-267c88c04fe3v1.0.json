The highly conserved enzyme NAD(P)HX dehydratase (NAXD) is essential for intracellular repair of NAD(P)HX. Here we present a series of infants and children who suffered episodes of febrile illness-induced neurodegeneration or cardiac failure and early death. Whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing identified recessive NAXD variants in each case. Variants were predicted to be potentially deleterious through in silico analysis. Reverse-transcription PCR confirmed altered splicing in one case. Subject fibroblasts showed highly elevated concentrations of the damaged cofactors S-NADHX, R-NADHX and cyclic NADHX. NADHX accumulation was abrogated by lentiviral transduction of subject cells with wild-type NAXD. Subject fibroblasts and muscle biopsies showed impaired mitochondrial function, higher sensitivity to metabolic stress in media containing galactose and azide, but not glucose, and decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Recombinant NAXD protein harbouring two missense variants leading to the amino acid changes p.(Gly63Ser) and p.(Arg608Cys) were thermolabile and showed a decrease in Vmax and increase in KM for the ATP-dependent NADHX dehydratase activity. This is the first study to identify pathogenic variants in NAXD and to link deficient NADHX repair with mitochondrial dysfunction. The results show that NAXD deficiency can be classified as a metabolite repair disorder in which accumulation of damaged metabolites likely triggers devastating effects in tissues such as the brain and the heart, eventually leading to early childhood death.","dc:creator":"Van Bergen NJ","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"NAD(P)HX dehydratase (NAXD) deficiency: a novel neurodegenerative disorder exacerbated by febrile illnesses."}},{"id":"cggv:5fb56f82-7df4-4850-97cd-6475d3bd51bd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:88074449-df79-4379-95f3-113e24db5834"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30576410"}],"rdfs:label":"Van Bergen_Case 6"},{"id":"cggv:9e3eacca-c4a3-4f1d-9d62-397bdc6f8480","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e3eacca-c4a3-4f1d-9d62-397bdc6f8480_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:5fb56f82-7df4-4850-97cd-6475d3bd51bd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5fb56f82-7df4-4850-97cd-6475d3bd51bd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:710c886a-f61e-490e-98ff-406beb80fa12_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:710c886a-f61e-490e-98ff-406beb80fa12","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a764d178-3d12-4ee4-9104-8faf6443a883","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001242882.2(NAXD):c.54_57del (p.Ala20PhefsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7051028"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"This is an Indian girl healthy until 2.5y ​when she developed  vomiting followed by unsteady gait, intermittent jerky movements, and lethargy​.

Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Disorders of NAD metabolism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:eb15469f-f6a5-4f4e-b434-267c88c04fe3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f410ba2b-8294-4129-8b2e-93abc554eba7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f09ca024-404b-464d-a7e4-c0099b6ce9ce","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Subject fibroblasts and muscle biopsies showed impaired mitochondrial function (reduction in expression of CI, CIV subunits, reduced COX activity, CI activity not affected), higher sensitivity to metabolic stress in media containing galactose and azide, but not glucose (significant decrease in the growth rate of fibroblasts in glucose-free, galactose-azide medium to induce mitochondrial stress), and decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production (decrease in rotenone-inhibited complex I superoxide production)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30576410","rdfs:label":"Van Bergen_Functional alteration patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:1bfc737a-c075-4b91-b060-3e1f3a5eac0e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4096ba8d-d2b5-4131-b25c-412e7aa7eecf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Performed whole-cell proteomic profiles in adult patient and previously reported patients and showed ‘mitochondrial distress signature’​\n\nA significant number of dysregulated proteins were identified, including the elevation of four proteins related to mitochondrial apoptotic processes (SOD2, BAX, CYCS and AIMF2), reduction in complex-I, complex-IV and small and large mitoribosome ​\n\nMuscle biopsies demonstrated the deficiency of AMP deaminase, which is part of the purine nucleotide cycle","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36834994","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have previously reported that pathogenic variants in a key metabolite repair enzyme NAXD cause a lethal neurodegenerative condition triggered by episodes of fever in young children.

While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NAXD*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NAXD* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 11 unique variants reported in eight cases from three publications (PMIDs: 30576410, 32462209, 31755961). The maximum score for case-level data was reached in this curation; however we note that, in total, there appear to be 14 affected individuals from 13 families reported in the medical literature (additional PMIDs: 33224489, 34161859, 35231119, 36834994, 38214124). Six missense, one splice, and four frameshift variants were included in this curation. Age of onset in reported individuals was typically early childhood although one case had longstanding milder features and did not have a serious event until his 30s (PMID: 36834994). Features in affected individuals include typically severe neurodegeneration and multisystem disease after illness (with periods of improvement and subsequent deterioration), cardiac involvement, skin lesions, movement disorder, gait changes, seizures, anemia, pancytopenia, ophthalmoplegia, sensorineural hearing loss, and cataracts. Most affected individuals died early in life, however some had a more stable course. Treatment with niacin has been proposed, with reported stabilization of features in at least one individual (PMID: 35231119). Muscle biopsy results were variable including low to normal respiratory chain enzyme activities. Imaging showed basal ganglia changes, temporal and frontal lobe atrophy, and cerebellar atrophy. Elevated lactate and creatine kinase levels were also seen. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 33340416, 30576410, 24717771).   \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NAXD* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 22, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
