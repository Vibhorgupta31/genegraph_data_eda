(PMID: 26238514), who reported four individuals with truncating variants. Common phenotypes include mild to moderate intellectual disability, variable behavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic facial features with coarsening that becomes more apparent with age. The majority of variants are *de novo*, although in at least one individual the variant was inherited from a mildly affected mother (PMID: 35813374). Heterozygous truncating variants in seven patients, reported in three publications, are included in this curation (PMIDs: 26238514, 28124119, 35813374). More evidence is available in the literature (PMIDs: 28884947, 29698805,34205270), but the maximum genetic evidence score (12 points) has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function, supported by a pLI score of 1 (gnomAD v2.1.1). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function, protein interaction, a mouse model and *in vitro* functional assays. ARID2 is an intrinsic component of polybromo brahma-associated factor (PBAF), a SWI/SNF subcomplex involved in chromatin remodeling. *Arid2* haploinsufficient mice exhibit learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze and reduced body size (PMID: 33051312). *ARID2* haploinsufficiency also enhanced RAS-MAPK pathway activity in vitro (PMID: 33051312). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ARID2* and autosomal dominant Coffin-Siris syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 7, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ae1a697f-8dcd-4edf-a25b-e5e0593e7e61"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
