Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs.

Among these disorders, isolated complex I deficiency is the most frequently diagnosed, accounting for one-third of all cases of respiratory chain deficiency. We chose to focus on complex I deficiency, caused by mutation in the assembly factor chromosome 6, open reading frame 66 (C6ORF66; NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] complex I assembly factor 4 [NDUFAF4]) protein. We used the approach of cell- and organelle-directed protein/enzyme replacement therapy, with the transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide as the moiety delivery system. This step will enable us to deliver the wild-type assembly factor C6ORF66 into patient cells and their mitochondria, leading to the proper assembly and function of complex I and, as a result, to a functional OXPHOS system. We designed and constructed the TAT-ORF fusion protein by gene fusion techniques, expressed the protein in an Escherichia coli expression system and highly purified it. Our results indicate that TAT-ORF enters patients' cells and their mitochondria rapidly and efficiently. TAT-ORF is biologically active and led to an increase in complex I activity. TAT-ORF also increased the number of patient cells and improved the activity of their mitochondria. Moreover, we observed an increase in ATP production, a decrease in the content of mitochondria and a decrease in the level of reactive oxygen species. Our results suggest that this approach of protein replacement therapy for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders is a promising one.","dc:creator":"Marcus D","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Replacement of the C6ORF66 assembly factor (NDUFAF4) restores complex I activity in patient cells."},"rdfs:label":"TAT Rescue Experiment"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:2df4e73b-a8a5-4ce2-bab6-2be732d3c542_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2df4e73b-a8a5-4ce2-bab6-2be732d3c542_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3274f462-602b-418a-a9b2-7fb87ffbfc9a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a09c55f1-b429-4289-9491-e3ed9660f3ef","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Brain MRI revealed diffuse bilateral signal alterations in the basal\nganglia and thalami, indicative of Leigh syndrome.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 28853723). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 18179882, 25613900, 23670274).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
