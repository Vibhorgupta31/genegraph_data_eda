During mouse embryonic development, a subpopulation of neural crest cell-derived melanocytes migrates and incorporates into a subregion of the cochlear epithelium, forming the intermediate cell layer of the stria vascularis. The relation of this developmental process to stria vascularis function is currently unknown. In characterizing the molecular differentiation of developing peripheral auditory structures, we discovered that hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf) is expressed in the future stria vascularis of the cochlear epithelium. Its receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, is expressed in the cochlear epithelium and melanocyte-derived intermediate cells in the stria vascularis. Genetic dissection of HGF signaling via c-MET reveals that the incorporation of the melanocytes into the future stria vascularis of the cochlear duct requires c-MET signaling. In addition, inactivation of either the ligand or receptor developmentally resulted in a profound hearing loss at young adult stages. These results suggest a novel connection between HGF signaling and deafness via melanocyte deficiencies.","dc:creator":"Shibata S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Hepatocyte Growth Factor-c-MET Signaling Mediates the Development of Nonsensory Structures of the Mammalian Cochlea and Hearing."},"rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:84d2f47a-9e9e-4991-9819-45280f89c3d3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:890110be-2ddc-4115-a5cc-0d70c616127b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Malformed outer hair cells and thinned stria vascularis in the cochlea are contributing factors that may explain the hearing loss observed in patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27488639","rdfs:label":"Developmental defects and defective auditory hair cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:f0e6f9ac-f807-48fd-a5b6-bf67c4607e14_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62ba218a-29ac-4320-b4ed-ff03b02dcb2d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e96d612f-2457-41a3-a7fd-bcb14d483cbd","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both mice and humans experience hearing loss.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27488639","rdfs:label":"Conditional KO Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because shows conditional KO of MET leads to HL phenotype but so far the cases seen in humans are missense variants but the functional impact of these missense variants is unclear."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":2483,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":4.25,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0c578768-8da1-4608-8faf-eda3234060c6","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:7029","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.1","dc:description":"MET was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in 2015 (Mujtaba et al., PMID: 25941349). This association was made using case-level data only. Three missense variants that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 25941349, 27717089, 31801140) are included in this curation. Only one missense variant was scored as the probands with the other variant had inconsistent phenotypes with nonsyndromic hearing loss and the minor allele frequency of the other variant was too high to be considered pathogenic. One missense variant in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members (PMID: 25941349). While no variant-level functional evidence has been published, this gene-disease association is supported by an expression study, a biochemical study consistent with the phenotype, and an animal model (PMID: 27488639). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 3/26/2021 (SOP Version 8). This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 12/19/2017. It was\nreevaluated on 3/26/2021.
