A number of individuals with SBBYSS also have thyroid abnormalities and cleft palate. The condition usually occurs sporadically and is therefore presumed to be due in most cases to new dominant mutations. In individuals with SBBYSS, a whole-exome sequencing approach was used to demonstrate de novo protein-truncating mutations in the highly conserved histone acetyltransferase gene KAT6B (MYST4/MORF)) in three out of four individuals sequenced. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm truncating mutations of KAT6B, clustering in the final exon of the gene in all four individuals and in a further nine persons with typical SBBYSS. Where parental samples were available, the mutations were shown to have occurred de novo. During mammalian development KAT6B is upregulated specifically in the developing central nervous system, facial structures, and limb buds. The phenotypic features seen in the Qkf mouse, a hypomorphic Kat6b mutant, include small eyes, ventrally placed ears and long first digits that mirror the human phenotype. This is a further example of how perturbation of a protein involved in chromatin modification might give rise to a multisystem developmental disorder.","dc:creator":"Clayton-Smith J","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Whole-exome-sequencing identifies mutations in histone acetyltransferase gene KAT6B in individuals with the Say-Barber-Biesecker variant of Ohdo syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78e1fb24-f70a-462a-b410-9b10b7a8bd39_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78e1fb24-f70a-462a-b410-9b10b7a8bd39_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb87b072-5290-468e-b555-49d338402c3f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7515f89-3e09-428a-a6a9-0b711c5bc05e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"immunohistochemistry on mice of various developmental ages to assess the expression pattern of Myst4 (murine KAT6B homolog) in organs known to be affected by Genitopatellar syndrome. \nMyst4 is strongly expressed in the telencephalic vesicles, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, digestive tract, pancreas liver, and ribs of developing embryos.

The KAT6B gene is located on chromosome 10 at 10q22.2 and encodes the Lysine acetyltransferase 6B. KAT6B codes for histone acetyltransferase and component of the MOZ/MORF protein complex and functions to regulate genes important for early development, including the development of the skeleton and nervous system. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern, with minimal difference in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities, Say–Barber–Biesecker–Young–Simpson syndrome (SBBYSS) and Genitopatellar Syndrome (GPS), have been lumped into one disease entity, Genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome. 15 variants (nonsense, frameshift, small deletion/insertions) that have been reported in 18 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22265014, 22077973, 29899993, 23436491) are included in this curation. The majority of variants occur in sporadic cases de novo and are predicted to result in premature termination and loss of the highly conserved transcription activation domain. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and functional alteration studies. (PMIDs: 22265017, 22265014, 22077973). Mice carrying a gene trap insertion in the mouse ortholog Kat6b mutant displayed a number of defects that reflected SBBYSS syndrome with a milder phenotype.  Additionally, immunohistochemistry on mice of various developmental ages demonstrated the expression of the murine KAT6B homolog, Myst4. Finally, the truncated form of KAT6B expressed in skin fibroblast from patient cells were demonstrated to have significant reductions in H3 and H4 acetylation. In summary, KAT6B is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen CAKUT GCEP on the meeting date 08/08/22 (SOP Version 9).  \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:78e1fb24-f70a-462a-b410-9b10b7a8bd39"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
