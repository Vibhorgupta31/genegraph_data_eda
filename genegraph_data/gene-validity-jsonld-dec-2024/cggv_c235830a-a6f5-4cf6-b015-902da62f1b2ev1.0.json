Changes in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in AS suggest that the type IV collagen matrix, the major structural component of GBM, is disrupted. We recently isolated the genes for two type IV collagens, alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV), that are encoded head-to-head on human chromosome 2. These chains are abundant in normal GBM but are sometimes absent in AS. We screened for mutations in families in which consanguinity suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Homozygous mutations were found in alpha 3(IV) in two families and in alpha 4(IV) in two others, demonstrating that these chains are important in the structural integrity of the GBM and that there is an autosomal form of AS in addition to the previously-defined X-linked form.","dc:creator":"Mochizuki T","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Identification of mutations in the alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) collagen genes in autosomal recessive Alport syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c235830a-a6f5-4cf6-b015-902da62f1b2e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c235830a-a6f5-4cf6-b015-902da62f1b2e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd51fe37-9177-4cce-87d3-2e726d020954","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:39ec6cc3-e9ae-4f4f-b573-7eb31f604e79","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RT-PCR using primers from exons 28 and 32 on whole kidney RNA.

Staining with a monoclonal antibody whose epitope requires proper assembly of α3α4α5(IV) NC1 domains into hexamers was weaker vs. WT, but clearly positive in the mutant. This confirmed that some mutant α4 was synthesized and capable of at least partial assembly with α3 and α5 into protomers that could interact with each other via their NC1 domains to form hexamers.

These mice exhibit a rapid increase of urinary albumin at an early age associated with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial nephritis, and tubular atrophy. The mutation was mapped to a location on chromosome 1 containing the Col4a3 and Col4a4 genes, for which mutations in the human orthologs cause the hereditary nephritis Alport syndrome. DNA sequencing identified a G-to-A mutation in the conserved GT splice donor of Col4a4 intron 30, resulting in skipping of exon 30 but maintaining the mRNA reading frame. Protein analyses showed that mutant collagen α3α4α5(IV) trimers were secreted and incorporated into the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), but levels were low, and GBM lesions typical of Alport syndrome were observed. Moving the mutation into the more renal damage-prone DBA/2J and 129S1/SvImJ backgrounds revealed differences in albuminuria and its rate of increase, suggesting an interaction between the Col4a4 mutation and modifier genes. This novel mouse model of Alport syndrome is the only one shown to accumulate abnormal collagen α3α4α5(IV) in the GBM, as also found in a subset of Alport patients. These mice will be valuable for testing potential therapies, for understanding abnormal collagen IV structure and assembly, and for gaining better insights into the mechanisms leading to Alport syndrome, and to the variability in the age of onset and associated phenotypes.

We have identified early differences in disease progression, including expression of podocyte-specific genes and podocyte morphology. In C57BL/6J mice podocyte effacement is delayed, prolonging normal renal function. The slower disease progression has allowed us to begin dissecting the pathogenesis of murine Alport Syndrome in detail.

A total of 10 of these calls, all homozygous, were validated by capillary sequencing. One of the validated mutations disrupted splicing of the Col4a4 transcript. Genetic mapping by bulk segregation analysis excluded all mutations but this one as the cause of renal disease in Aoba mice.

To date, mutation screening in the two genes has been hampered by the lack of genomic structure information. We report here the complete characterization of the 48 exons of the COL4A4 gene, a comprehensive gene screen, and the subsequent detection of 10 novel mutations in eight patients diagnosed with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. Furthermore, we identified a glycine to alanine substitution in the collagenous domain that is apparently silent in the heterozygous carriers, in 11.5% of all control individuals, and in one control individual homozygous for this glycine substitution. There has been no previous finding of a glycine substitution that is not associated with any obvious phenotype in homozygous individuals.","dc:creator":"Boye E","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Determination of the genomic structure of the COL4A4 gene and of novel mutations causing autosomal recessive Alport syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:83f02ea7-c384-4c78-a376-82903d08f401_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d47b2d3a-a469-4814-806b-cc6d2c66585d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9792860"}],"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"AR18"},{"id":"cggv:d8a983c3-2ca2-4d5f-b27c-042d69e6d88d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8a983c3-2ca2-4d5f-b27c-042d69e6d88d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:83f02ea7-c384-4c78-a376-82903d08f401","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:83f02ea7-c384-4c78-a376-82903d08f401_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:59bc4702-81b2-46eb-b255-b65ec2646183_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59bc4702-81b2-46eb-b255-b65ec2646183","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":66,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c1e08e29-6f3d-40bc-923c-64142026dd2d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000092.5(COL4A4):c.3688G>T (p.Gly1230Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/974376"}},"detectionMethod":"A customized capture-based gene panel including 316 genes causative of IKD was designed using NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice Library (NimbleGen; Roche) for a final targeted region of 2.02Mb.

The predominant form of Alport syndrome is X-linked; more than 160 different mutations have yet been identified in the type IV collagen alpha 5 chain (COL4A5) gene, located at Xq22-24 head to head to the COL4A6 gene. The autosomal recessive form of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes, located at 2q35-37. Recently, the first mutation in the COL4A4 gene was identified in familial benign hematuria. This paper presents an overview of type IV collagen mutations, including eight novel COL4A5 mutations from our own group in patients with Alport syndrome. The spectrum of mutations is broad and provides insight into the clinical heterogeneity of Alport syndrome with respect to age at renal failure and accompanying features such as deafness, leiomyomatosis, and anti-GBM nephritis.","dc:creator":"Lemmink HH","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"The clinical spectrum of type IV collagen mutations."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"III-10"},{"id":"cggv:3c653932-de80-47df-8073-3e95d5e7b52a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c653932-de80-47df-8073-3e95d5e7b52a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:772d7921-7b6b-4947-916a-959626241a07_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:772d7921-7b6b-4947-916a-959626241a07","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":30,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3a1aa4b7-a89b-4173-9700-469c62f662e9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000092.5(COL4A4):c.3205G>C (p.Gly1069Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/974517"}},"detectionMethod":"A customized capture-based gene panel including 316 genes causative of IKD was designed using NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice Library (NimbleGen; Roche) for a final targeted region of 2.02Mb.

The clinical and pathologic features of this syndrome resemble those of early Alport syndrome (AS), and for this reason a common molecular defect has been proposed. The COL4A3/4 genes seem to be involved in both autosomal AS and FBH. This study involves a linkage analysis for the COL4A3/4 loci and a search for mutations within these genes in 11 biopsy-proven FBH families. Haplotype analysis showed that linkage to the COL4A3/4 locus could not be excluded in eight of nine families. One family was not linked to this locus; however, it included three affected women who could be X-linked AS carriers. Two families were too small to perform linkage analysis. COL4A3 and COL4A4 mutation screening disclosed six new pathogenic mutations, two in the COL4A3 gene (G985V and G1015E) and four in the COL4A4 gene (3222insA, IVS23-1G>C, 31del11, and G960R). It is the first time that mutations within the COL4A3 gene are described in families with FBH. This study clearly demonstrates the main role of the COL4A4 and COL4A3 genes in the pathogenesis of FBH.","dc:creator":"Badenas C","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mutations in theCOL4A4 and COL4A3 genes cause familial benign hematuria."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"I1"},{"id":"cggv:ecd7af0d-2d92-4b9b-9250-f84ac07b06c8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ecd7af0d-2d92-4b9b-9250-f84ac07b06c8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2e21061d-b0eb-44f0-93bd-34041c728519_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e21061d-b0eb-44f0-93bd-34041c728519","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c1cb0062-6bb5-4448-829c-e1216a03d223","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000092.5(COL4A4):c.491G>A (p.Gly164Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/974381"}},"detectionMethod":"A customized capture-based gene panel including 316 genes causative of IKD was designed using NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice Library (NimbleGen; Roche) for a final targeted region of 2.02Mb.

Alport syndrome is characterized by hearing loss, anterior lenticonus, and glomerular basement membrane defects that may progress to end-stage kidney disease. Patients often present with hematuria and worsening proteinuria. Kidney biopsy may identify focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and thin glomerular basement membranes with abnormal ultrastructure. Autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported, leading to an isolated renal phenotype of hematuria, with or without structural changes and progressive disease course. Case reports of digenic inheritance with *COL4A3* or *COL4A5* variants also exist. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism between the reported disease entities and noted that affected families show phenotypic variability with variable expressivity. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into a single disease entity: Alport syndrome 2, autosomal recessive (OMIM:203780) and Hematuria, benign familial (OMIM:141200). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘Alport Spectrum - *COL4A4*’. Twenty seven pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that have been reported in 22 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 7987396, PMID:9195222, PMID: 9792860, PMID:11961012, PMID:33532864) are included in this curation. No functional data of these variants were provided in these studies. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression (PMID: 10534397, PMID: 24522496, PMID: 31892712), protein interaction (PMID: 24522496) and biochemical studies (PMID: 10534397), and animal models (PMID: 10534397, PMID: 21196518, PMID: 24522496, PMID: 31892712). In summary, *COL4A4* is definitively associated with Alport Spectrum. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c235830a-a6f5-4cf6-b015-902da62f1b2e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
