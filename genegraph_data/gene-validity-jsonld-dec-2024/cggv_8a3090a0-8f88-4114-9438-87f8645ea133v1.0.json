In a bioinformatics approach, we now identified a new family of protein sequences from animals, plants, and fungi and characterized these sequences biochemically by expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This resulted in the identification of the enzyme sphingolipid Delta4-desaturase (dihydroceramide desaturase) from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Candida albicans, in addition to a bifunctional sphingolipid Delta4-desaturase/C-4-hydroxylase from M. musculus. Among the sequences investigated are the Homo sapiens membrane lipid desaturase, the M. musculus degenerative spermatocyte, and the Drosophila melanogaster degenerative spermatocyte proteins. During spermatogenesis, but not oogenesis of des mutant flies, both cell cycle and spermatid differentiation are specifically blocked at the entry into the first meiotic division, leading to male sterility. This mutant phenotype can be restored to wild-type by complementation with a functional copy of the des gene (Endo, K., Akiyama, T., Kobayashi S., and Okada, M. (1996) Mol. Gen. Genet. 253, 157-165). These results suggest that Delta4-desaturated sphingolipids provide an early signal necessary to trigger the entry into both meiotic and spermatid differentiation pathways during Drosophila spermatogenesis.","dc:creator":"Ternes P","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Identification and characterization of a sphingolipid delta 4-desaturase family."},"rdfs:label":"Ternes et al, 2002, DEGS1 function in body"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8a3090a0-8f88-4114-9438-87f8645ea133_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6f481c5-c4e1-4511-96c9-4ddb5e04b67d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c6e7b2c-8f23-4792-a935-baedc105cd53","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both humans and Zebrafish were observed to have the abnormal ratio of DhCer/Cer as well as physical findings such motor impairment and impaired myelination)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30620337","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sphingolipid imbalance is the culprit in a variety of neurological diseases, some affecting the myelin sheath. We have used whole-exome sequencing in patients with undetermined leukoencephalopathies to uncover the endoplasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the causative gene in 19 patients from 13 unrelated families. Shared features among the cases include severe motor arrest, early nystagmus, dystonia, spasticity, and profound failure to thrive. MRI showed hypomyelination, thinning of the corpus callosum, and progressive thalamic and cerebellar atrophy, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 in myelin development and maintenance. This enzyme converts dihydroceramide (DhCer) into ceramide (Cer) in the final step of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. We detected a marked increase of the substrate DhCer and DhCer/Cer ratios in patients' fibroblasts and muscle. Further, we used a knockdown approach for disease modeling in Danio rerio, followed by a preclinical test with the first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya). The enzymatic inhibition of Cer synthase by fingolimod, 1 step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, reduced the critical DhCer/Cer imbalance and the severe locomotor disability, increasing the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes in a zebrafish model. These proof-of-concept results pave the way to clinical translation.","dc:creator":"Pant DC","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Loss of the sphingolipid desaturase DEGS1 causes hypomyelinating leukodystrophy."},"rdfs:label":"Pant et al 2019, Knockout DEGS1 Zebra fish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Non-human or mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:8a3090a0-8f88-4114-9438-87f8645ea133_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2647f3d0-74c5-4a10-bc2a-b2b490709253_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2647f3d0-74c5-4a10-bc2a-b2b490709253","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:93f53f93-9764-4bfb-bdc3-a02268f730ad","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003676.4(DEGS1):c.764A>G (p.Asn255Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1413680"}},"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0007371","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0001347","obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0033044"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3162e824-95db-4c90-b00a-9425506aa276_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:93f53f93-9764-4bfb-bdc3-a02268f730ad"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31186544","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sphingolipidoses are monogenic lipid storage diseases caused by variants in enzymes of lipid synthesis and metabolism. We describe an autosomal recessive complex neurological disorder affecting consanguineous kindred. All four affected individuals, born at term following normal pregnancies, had mild to severe intellectual disability, spastic quadriplegia, scoliosis and epilepsy in most, with no dysmorphic features. Brain MRI findings were suggestive of leukodystrophy, with abnormal hyperintense signal in the periventricular perioccipital region and thinning of the body of corpus callosum. Notably, all affected individuals were asymptomatic at early infancy and developed normally until the age of 8-18 months, when deterioration ensued. Homozygosity mapping identified a single 8.7â€‰Mb disease-associated locus on chromosome 1q41-1q42.13 between rs1511695 and rs537250 (two-point LOD score 2.1). Whole exome sequencing, validated through Sanger sequencing, identified within this locus a single disease-associated homozygous variant in DEGS1, encoding C4-dihydroceramide desaturase, an enzyme of the ceramide synthesis pathway. The missense variant, segregating within the family as expected for recessive heredity, affects an evolutionary-conserved amino acid of all isoforms of DEGS1 (c.656A>G, c.764A>G; p.(N219S), p.(N255S)) and was not found in a homozygous state in ExAC and gnomAD databases or in 300 ethnically matched individuals. Lipidomcs analysis of whole blood of affected individuals demonstrated augmented levels of dihydroceramides, dihydrosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate and dihydrosphingomyelins with reduced levels of ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate and monohexosylceramides, as expected in malfunction of C4-dihydroceramide desaturase. Thus, we describe a sphingolipidosis causing a severe regressive neurological disease.","dc:creator":"Dolgin V","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"DEGS1 variant causes neurological disorder."}},"rdfs:label":"Dolgin 2019 Family 1 individual IV1"},{"id":"cggv:3162e824-95db-4c90-b00a-9425506aa276","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3162e824-95db-4c90-b00a-9425506aa276_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3162e824-95db-4c90-b00a-9425506aa276_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional data supports this to decrease DEGS1 function "}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7802fb8d-aac7-447c-b7c8-3f168adf405d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7802fb8d-aac7-447c-b7c8-3f168adf405d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:93f53f93-9764-4bfb-bdc3-a02268f730ad"},{"id":"cggv:3ba6337b-6d43-4a2a-95ff-9d53c30b7771","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003676.4(DEGS1):c.341_342del (p.Leu114ProfsTer11)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913189807"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012411","obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0006808","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0002134","obo:HP_0000570","obo:HP_0001332","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0002808","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0007371"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:0da506a7-db1c-4eae-88f5-1c56ba7992fa_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:93f53f93-9764-4bfb-bdc3-a02268f730ad"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30620337"},{"id":"cggv:a0ac5fda-cced-4231-be73-ed4d629f2b33_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3ba6337b-6d43-4a2a-95ff-9d53c30b7771"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30620337"}],"rdfs:label":"Pant 2019 Family 3 Patient 4"},{"id":"cggv:a0ac5fda-cced-4231-be73-ed4d629f2b33","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0ac5fda-cced-4231-be73-ed4d629f2b33_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:0da506a7-db1c-4eae-88f5-1c56ba7992fa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0da506a7-db1c-4eae-88f5-1c56ba7992fa_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0da506a7-db1c-4eae-88f5-1c56ba7992fa_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional data supports that variant decreases function of DEGS1"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8a3090a0-8f88-4114-9438-87f8645ea133_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:8a3090a0-8f88-4114-9438-87f8645ea133_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:808f0c83-285b-4a47-81a6-f96bc79ff29a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:808f0c83-285b-4a47-81a6-f96bc79ff29a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ee98e5f6-284e-4a37-b460-c276952014af","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003676.4(DEGS1):c.839C>T (p.Ala280Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344710668"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0001276","obo:HP_0005781","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0033454","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0030177","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0006808","obo:HP_0002650"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"normal karyotype, microarray, and metabolic screening for lysosomal storage disorders","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c69cb27f-0edf-4938-8e72-42f613f74fe1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ee98e5f6-284e-4a37-b460-c276952014af"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30620338","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sphingolipids are important components of cellular membranes and functionally associated with fundamental processes such as cell differentiation, neuronal signaling, and myelin sheath formation.

was first reported in relation to an autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy in 2019 (Pant et al., PMID: 30620337). DEGS1 encodes for the enzyme sphingolipid Î”4-desaturase. This enzyme is responsible for converting dihydroceramide (DhCer) into ceramide (Cer) (PMID: 11937514). This disease is characterized by early onset global developmental delays, specifically language and motor delays, intellectual disability, spasticity, dystonia, and seizures. Brain imaging shows hypomyelination, atrophy, and frequent basal ganglia abnormalities.  \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore the one disease entity has been maintained: hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 18 (OMIM:618404). Eight variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) that have been reported in 7 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 30620337, 31186544, 30620338, 37195341, 33597727) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental data via biochemical functioning, model systems, and rescue. Loss of the DEGS1 gene alters the ratio of DhCer:Cer (PMID: 11937514). Affected patient cultured cells have demonstrated the altered ratio (PMID: 30620338, 31186544) and knockout animal models have demonstrated the same biochemical alterations and phenotype (PMID: 30620337).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between DEGS1 and autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy GCEP on the meeting date September 23, 2024 (SOP Version 11). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8a3090a0-8f88-4114-9438-87f8645ea133"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
