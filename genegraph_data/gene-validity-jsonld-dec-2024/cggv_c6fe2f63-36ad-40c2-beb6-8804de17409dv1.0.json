PC mutants were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for the evaluation of PC secretory activity and function. The subcellular location was visualised by immunofluorescence assay. The structural analysis of mutation was performed as well.Compound heterozygous mutations of Arg178Trp and Asp255His with reduced PC activity and antigen levels were identified in Proband 1, a 28-year-old male with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. The other mutations of Leu-34Pro and Thr295Ile with reduced PC activity and antigen levels were identified in Proband 2, a 19-year-old male with DVT. The PC activities with Arg178Trp, Asp255His, Leu-34Pro and Thr295Ile mutations decreased significantly. Immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that only trace amount of PC with novel Thr295Ile mutation was transported to the Golgi apparatus.

Gene deletion(s) or gross rearrangement(s) was not demonstrable by Southern blot hybridization to cDNA probes. However, two unrelated patients showed a variant restriction pattern after Pvu II or BamHI digestion, due to mutations in the last exon: analysis of their pedigrees, including three or seven heterozygotes, respectively, with approximately 50% reduction of both enzymatic and antigen level, showed the abnormal restriction pattern in all heterozygous individuals, but not in normal relatives. Cloning of protein C gene and sequencing of the last exon allowed us to identify a nonsense and a missense mutation, respectively. In the first case, codon 306 (CGA, arginine) is mutated to an inframe stop codon, thus generating a new Pvu II recognition site. In the second case, a missense mutation in the BamHI palindrome (GGATCC----GCATCC) leads to substitution of a key amino acid (a tryptophan to cysteine substitution at position 402), invariantly conserved in eukaryotic serine proteases. These point mutations may explain the protein C-deficiency phenotype of heterozygotes in the two pedigrees.","dc:creator":"Romeo G","dc:date":"1987","dc:title":"Hereditary thrombophilia: identification of nonsense and missense mutations in the protein C gene."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2437584","rdfs:label":"Patient M.L."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The heterozygous missense variant Trp444Cys (referred to by the authors as Trp402Cys) was not supported by functional evidence and the full gene was not sequenced so the possibility of additional mutations can not be excluded.

Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidating how genome variation contributes to disease. Here we present BioPlex 2.0 (Biophysical Interactions of ORFeome-derived complexes), which uses robust affinity purification-mass spectrometry methodology to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of protein-coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest such network so far. With more than 56,000 candidate interactions, BioPlex 2.0 contains more than 29,000 previously unknown co-associations and provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering of interacting proteins identified more than 1,300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness are enriched within 53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified 442 communities associated with more than 2,000 disease annotations, placing numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome organization.","dc:creator":"Huttlin EL","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks."},"rdfs:label":"PROC/PROS1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"PROS1 encodes a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that functions as a cofactor for the anticoagulant protease, activated protein C (APC) to inhibit blood coagulation.

In the current investigation, we have used a novel transgenic strategy to generate different mouse models expressing 1-18% of normal PC levels. In contrast to PC-/- mice, mice with only partial PC deficiency survived beyond birth and also developed thrombosis and inflammation. The onset and severity of these phenotypes vary significantly and are strongly dependent on plasma PC levels. Our findings additionally provide the first evidence that maternal PC is vital for sustaining pregnancy beyond 7.5 days postcoitum, likely by regulating the balance of coagulation and inflammation during trophoblast invasion.
