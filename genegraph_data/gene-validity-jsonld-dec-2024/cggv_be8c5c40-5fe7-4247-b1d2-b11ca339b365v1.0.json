Clinical features in reported probands include neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder. Other features are highly variable, reported only in one or few individuals. \n\nAt least 24 unique variants (7 nonsense, 3 frameshift, 12 missense, 2 large deletions) have been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 25363768, 28135719, 28554332, 28867142, 31398340, 31981491, 31999386, 33057194). In 26 unrelated probands reported, 19 (73%) variants were *de novo*, 1 inherited from an unaffected parent, and the rest of unknown inheritance. While *BAZ2B* is intolerant to truncating variants (pLI 0.98, gnomAD v2.1.1), it is not significantly constrained for missense variants (Z = 1.33). Thus, in the absence of functional evidence of pathogenicity, missense variants were not scored. Probands with other potential genetic explanations for their neurodevelopmental phenotypes, deletions of *BAZ2B* that encompass additional genes, mosaic variants at low allele frequencies, and truncating variants reported in gnomAD or inherited from reportedly unaffected parents were also not scored since the impact of *BAZ2B* on the phenotype is unclear. Six truncating *de novo* variants in 6 probands from 5 publications (PMIDs: 25363768, 28554332, 31981491, 31999386, 33057194) are included in this curation. \n\nAlthough the total points contained within this curation meet the threshold for a “Moderate” classification, the expert panel elected to downgrade the overall classification to “Limited” while we await additional human genetic evidence.  In summary, there is limited evidence at this time to support the relationship between *BAZ2B* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Additional studies are required to verify this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 19, 2022 (SOP Version 9). \n \n\n\nAlthough the total points contained within this curation meet the threshold for a “Moderate” classification, the expert panel elected to downgrade the overall classification to “Limited” while we await additional human genetic evidence.
