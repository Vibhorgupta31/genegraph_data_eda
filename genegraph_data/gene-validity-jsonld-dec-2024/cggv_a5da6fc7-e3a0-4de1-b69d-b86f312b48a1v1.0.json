Whilst PAH most often manifests in adulthood, paediatric disease is considered to be a distinct entity with increased morbidity and often an unexplained resistance to current therapies. Recent genetic studies have substantially increased our understanding of PAH pathogenesis, providing opportunities for molecular diagnosis and presymptomatic genetic testing in families. However, the genetic architecture of childhood-onset PAH remains relatively poorly characterised.

Variant aggregation analysis revealed a significant burden (p=0.0000172) of likely gene damaging *PDGFD* variants in the IPAH cohort as compared to a group of 18,819 European controls (PMID:33971972). Gelinas et al. also reported a missense *PDGFD* variant in a proband with IPAH (PMID:33187088). There is currently no functional evidence demonstrating a damaging effect of any of the reported *PDGFD* variants in humans.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by GTEx data, which shows expression in human lung tissue. Gladh et al. (PMID:27032083) reported a transgenic mouse model with a phenotype of increased blood pressure but PH-specific phenotypes were not assessed. Thus, the model received a score of zero in terms of evidence for a PAH relationship. \n\nIn summary, *PDGFD* has a limited association with autosomal dominant PAH.
