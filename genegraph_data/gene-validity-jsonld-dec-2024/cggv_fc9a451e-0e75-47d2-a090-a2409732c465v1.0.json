We identified de novo germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. These include 2 mutations in AKT3, 1 recurrent mutation in PIK3R2 in 11 unrelated families with MPPH and 15 mostly postzygotic mutations in PIK3CA in 23 individuals with MCAP and 1 with MPPH.

was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes in 2012 (Riviere et al., PMID: 22729224). At least 4 unique de novo missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship including case-level data, case-control data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 35 probands in at least 4 publications (PMIDs: 22729224, 26520804, 26860062, 23745724) with the vast majority of cases accounted for by recurrent a c.1117G>A (p.G373R) mutation (PMID: 26520804). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximal score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is heterozygous gain of function (PMID: 28086757). This gene-disease relationship is supported by cell culture assays using patient derived cells. In summary, PIK3R2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and it has been upheld over time.
