Assembly of the enzyme relies on several assembly factors in addition to the constituent subunits and prosthetic groups. We studied fibroblast cultures from patients carrying mutations in the assembly factors COX10, SCO1, or SURF1. COX10 is involved in heme A biosynthesis. SCO1 is required for formation of the Cu(A) center. The function of SURF1 is unknown. Immunoblot analysis of native gels demonstrated severely decreased levels of holoenzyme in the patient cultures compared with controls. In addition, the blots revealed the presence of five subassemblies: three subassemblies involving the core subunit MTCO1 but apparently no other subunits; a subassembly containing subunits MTCO1, COX4, and COX5A; and a subassembly containing at least subunits MTCO1, MTCO2, MTCO3, COX4, and COX5A. As some of the subassemblies correspond to known assembly intermediates of human cytochrome c oxidase, we think that these subassemblies are probably assembly intermediates that accumulate in patient cells. The MTCO1.COX4.COX5A subassembly was not detected in COX10-deficient cells, which suggests that heme A incorporation into MTCO1 occurs prior to association of MTCO1 with COX4 and COX5A. SCO1-deficient cells contained accumulated levels of the MTCO1.COX4.COX5A subassembly, suggesting that MTCO2 associates with the MTCO1.COX4.COX5A subassembly after the Cu(A) center of MTCO2 is formed.

A neuron-specific COX-deficient mouse was generated by the Cre-loxP system, in which the COX10 gene was deleted by a CamKIIalpha promoter-driven Cre-recombinase.

These KO mice showed an age-dependent COX deficiency in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Surprisingly, COX10 KO mice exhibited significantly fewer amyloid plaques in their brains compared with the COX-competent transgenic mice. This reduction in amyloid plaques in the KO mouse was accompanied by a reduction in Abeta42 level, beta-secretase activity, and oxidative damage. Likewise, production of reactive oxygen species from cells with partial COX activity was not elevated.

Patients with isolated COX deficiency are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in several different assembly factors have been found to cause specific clinical phenotypes. Two of the most common clinical presentations, Leigh Syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, have so far only been associated with mutations in SURF1 or SCO2 and COX15, respectively. Here we show that expression of COX10 from a retroviral vector complements the COX deficiency in a patient with anemia and Leigh Syndrome, and in a patient with anemia, sensorineural deafness and fatal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A partial rescue was also obtained following microcell-mediated transfer of mouse chromosomes into patient fibroblasts. COX10 functions in the first step of the mitochondrial heme A biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing the conversion of protoheme (heme B) to heme O via the farnesylation of a vinyl group at position C2. Heme A content was reduced in mitochondria from patient muscle and fibroblasts in proportion to the reduction in COX enzyme activity and the amount of fully assembled enzyme. Mutation analysis of COX10 identified four different missense alleles, predicting amino acid substitutions at evolutionarily conserved residues. A topological model places these residues in regions of the protein shown to have important catalytic functions by mutation analysis of a prokaryotic ortholog. Mutations in COX10 have previously been reported in a single family with tubulopathy and leukodystrophy.

Six unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar.  Complex IV deficiency is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2 different publications (PMID 12928484, 15455402). This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product, expression, and studies in patient cell lines and COX10 mouse models.
