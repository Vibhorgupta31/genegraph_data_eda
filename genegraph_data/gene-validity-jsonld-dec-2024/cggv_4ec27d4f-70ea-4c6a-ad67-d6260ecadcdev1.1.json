More than 30 genes have been reported to cause DCM. To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, a mutational screening on 4 DCM-causing genes (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3 and LMNA) was performed in a cohort of 105 unrelated DCM (64 familial cases and 41 sporadic cases) using a High Resolution Melting (HRM)/sequencing strategy. Screening of a highly conserved arginine/serine (RS)-rich region in exon 9 of RBM20 was also performed. Nineteen different mutations were identified in 20 index patients (19%), including 10 novels. These included 8 LMNA variants in 9 (8.6%) probands, 5 TNNT2 variants in 5 probands (4.8%), 4 MYH7 variants in 3 probands (3.8%), 1 TNNI3 variant in 1 proband (0.9%), and 1 RBM20 variant in 1 proband (0.9%). One proband was double-heterozygous. LMNA mutations represent the most prevalent genetic DCM cause. Most patients carrying LMNA mutations exhibit conduction system defects and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Our study also showed than prevalence of mutations affecting TNNI3 or the (RS)-rich region of RBM20 is lower than 1%. The discovery of novel DCM mutations is crucial for clinical management of patients and their families because pre-symptomatic diagnosis is possible and precocious intervention could prevent or ameliorate the prognosis.","dc:creator":"Millat G","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Clinical and mutational spectrum in a cohort of 105 unrelated patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846512","rdfs:label":"15"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"reduced default missense score, not reduced to 0.1 due to missense variation as established pathogenic mechanism in MYH7"},{"id":"cggv:1120a781-faa3-4eb5-b8f8-239ff6ebc142_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a607c1d-3901-4066-a3ff-9e1828c0dc24","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":55,"detectionMethod":"Molecular analysis included\n15 genes (LMNA, MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, ACTC1, TPM1, CSRP3, TCAP, SGCD, PLN, MYL2, MYL3, TNNI3, TAZ, and LDB3)\nusing next-generation sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"55yo M, NYHA Class II, LVEF 39%, LVED 56mm","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:1120a781-faa3-4eb5-b8f8-239ff6ebc142_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:57a77ded-ecb2-46a4-9a59-5009ddd4a3a8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000257.4(MYH7):c.5623G>T (p.Val1875Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA389034842"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31179125","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratification in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), even though SCD may occur with LVEF > 35%.

Over a 13 year period, molecular autopsy was undertaken in 96 sudden cardiac death cases. A total of 46 cases aged 1-40 years had normal hearts and suspected arrhythmic death. Seven (15%) had likely pathogenic variants in ion channelopathy genes [KCNQ1 (1), KCNH2 (4), SCN5A (1), RyR2(1)]. Fifty cases aged between 2 and 67 had a cardiomyopathy. Twenty-five had arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), 10 dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 15 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Likely pathogenic variants were found in three ARVC cases (12%) in PKP2, DSC2 or DSP, two DCM cases (20%) in MYH7, and four HCM cases (27%) in MYBPC3 (3) or MYH7 (1).

Of the 19 mutations identified in 12 families, mutations in TPM1 (32%) and TNNT2 (21%) were the most commonly found. Of the 6 patients diagnosed before 1 year of age, 3 had mutations in TPM1 (including a set of identical twins), 1 in TNNT2, 1 in MYH7, and 1 with multiple mutations (MYH7 and TNNC1).

Yet it is not known how TnT mutation causes dysfunction of sarcomere microdomains and how these events contribute to misalignment of sarcomeric proteins in presence of DCM TnT-R173W. Using a human iPSC-CM model combined with CRISPR/Cas9-engineered isogenic controls, we uncovered that TnT-R173W destabilizes molecular interactions of troponin with tropomyosin, and limits binding of PKA to local sarcomere microdomains. This attenuates troponin phosphorylation and dysregulates local sarcomeric microdomains in DCM iPSC-CMs. Disrupted microdomain signaling impairs MYH7-mediated, AMPK-dependent sarcomere-cytoskeleton filament interactions and plasma membrane attachment. Small molecule-based activation of AMPK can restore TnT microdomain interactions, and partially recovers sarcomere protein misalignment as well as impaired contractility in DCM TnT-R173W iPSC-CMs. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic direction targeting sarcomere- cytoskeleton interactions to induce sarcomere re-organization and contractile recovery in DCM.","dc:creator":"Dai Y","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Troponin destabilization impairs sarcomere-cytoskeleton interactions in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from dilated cardiomyopathy patients."},"rdfs:label":"troponin destabilization impairs sarc-cyto interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9e1ad031-4d04-409e-a4ab-8ce5567aaec5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c0f7c02-17d9-43db-9d32-61cf584d55e9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"REDUCED FORCE MECHANICS CONSISTENT WITH REDUCED SYSTOLIC FUNCTION, A CORE FEATURE OF THE DCM PHENOTPYE.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29666183","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can cause arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac death.

For example, different mutations gave enhanced or reduced rate constants of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, or ADP release or exhibited altered ATP, ADP, or actin affinity. Local effects dominated, no common pattern accounted for the similar mutant phenotype, and there was no distinct set of changes that distinguished DCM mutations from previously analyzed HCM myosin mutations. That said, using our data to model the complete ATPase contraction cycle revealed additional critical insights. Four of the DCM mutations lowered the duty ratio (the ATPase cycle portion when myosin strongly binds actin) because of reduced occupancy of the force-holding A·M·D complex in the steady state. Under load, the A·M·D state is predicted to increase owing to a reduced rate constant for ADP release, and this effect was blunted for all five DCM mutations. We observed the opposite effects for two HCM mutations, namely R403Q and R453C. Moreover, the analysis predicted more economical use of ATP by the DCM mutants than by WT and the HCM mutants.

Single-molecule laser trap experiments revealed that the lower V(actin) in the S532P mutant was due to a reduced ability of the motor to generate a step displacement and an alteration of the kinetics of its chemomechanical cycle.

MYH7 is composed of 1935 amino acids, including 41 exons, 38 of which are protein coding and contains a head region and a tail domain, which represent key regions for variation.  The encoded beta myosin heavy chain protein, expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, forms part of the myosin complex which generates the mechanical force needed for contraction. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, case-control data, and segregation data. MYH7 is not known to be haploinsufficient, and DCM has been associated with variants that produce an abnormal protein with reduced function, but not  variants that introduce a premature termination codon and would be predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay.  Many variants have been reported in humans with DCM and non-truncating variants are enriched in DCM cases (Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID: 31983221) and truncating variants in MYH7 are unlikely to be disease causing (pLI=0; LOEUF=0.57). Of note, distinct alleles in MYH7 have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy through different molecular mechanisms than DCM-causing MYH7 variants.   Accordingly, case data and segregation data with MYH7 missense variation observed in DCM was evaluated. For example, Kamisago et al (2000, PMID: 11106718) reported NM_000257.4:c.1594T>C (p.Ser532Pro) to segregate in 16 individuals in a family with DCM and NM_000157.4:c.2292C>G (p.Phe764Leu) to segregate in 3 individuals in another DCM pedigree.  Additional DCM-segregating variants have also been published by other investigative groups, including the NM_000257.4:c.2773A>G (p.Arg925Gly) variant in 3 related individuals (Vasilescu et al, 2018, PMID: 30384889).  In addition, the p.Asn1918Lys variant has also been reported in multiple in 7 affected individuals of Dutch ancestry, including 6 pedigrees reported by van der Linde et al (2017, PMID: 28864942), one family in whom 7 individuals with DCM were shown to segregate the variant with the phenotype. Multiple other singleton and small pedigree DCM cases have also been reported in the literature with missense variation with MYH7 that have some evidence supporting a pathogenic effect (Rampersaud et al, 2011, PMID: 21483645; Petri et al, 2019, PMID: 30874888; Millat et al, 2011, PMID: 21846512; Vasilescu et al, 2018, PMID: 30384889; Garcia-Giustiniani et al, 2015, PMID: 25935763; van Spaendonck-Zwartz et al, 2014, PMID: 24558114; Cann et al, 2017, PMID 27000522; Sausa et al, 2019, PMID: 31179125; Merlo et al, 2013, PMID: 24119082; Sajid et al, 2017, PMID: 27965028). Additional evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by experimental evidence, including biochemical function, functional alteration, non-human model organism, and protein interaction data.  MYH7 has been shown to interact with other key proteins associated with the DCM phenotype (Dai et al, 2020, PMID: 31937807). Further, Ujfalusi et al (2018, PMID: 29666183) showed reduced force mechanics in the presence of abnormal MYH7 variation and Vikorev et al (2017, PMID: 29093449) isolated human cardiac myofibrils with the MYH7 Glu1426Lys variant and observed significantly reduced passive stiffness through kinetic studies.  The DCM phenotype has also been demonstrated in heterozygous mouse models harboring the MYH7 S532P and S764L variants (Schmitt et al, 2006, PMID: 16983074). Of relevance, the investigators in the Schmitt et al murine models targeted Myh6 to mimic the DCM-associated MYH7 S532P and S764L variants, as Myh6 is the predominant myosin gene expressed in adult murine heart tissues. MYH7 has also been curated by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) expert panel (Definitive, 12/2/2017). In summary, MYH7 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on November 4, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4ec27d4f-70ea-4c6a-ad67-d6260ecadcde"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
