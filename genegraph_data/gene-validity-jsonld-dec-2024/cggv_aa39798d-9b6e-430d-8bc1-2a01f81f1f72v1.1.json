Together with other proteins involved in DNA repair processes and cell division, the FA proteins maintain genome homeostasis, and germline mutation of any one of the genes that encode FA proteins causes FA. Monoallelic inactivation of some FA genes, such as FA complementation group D1 (FANCD1; also known as the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2), leads to adult-onset cancer predisposition but does not cause FA, and somatic mutations in FA genes occur in cancers in the general population. Carcinogenesis resulting from a dysregulated FA pathway is multifaceted, as FA proteins monitor multiple complementary genome-surveillance checkpoints throughout interphase, where monoubiquitylation of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer by the FA core complex promotes recruitment of DNA repair effectors to chromatin lesions to resolve DNA damage and mitosis. In this Review, we discuss how the FA pathway safeguards genome integrity throughout the cell cycle and show how studies of FA have revealed opportunities to develop rational therapeutics for this genetic disease and for malignancies that acquire somatic mutations within the FA pathway.","dc:creator":"Nalepa G","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Fanconi anaemia and cancer: an intricate relationship."},"rdfs:label":"BRCA1, BRIP1, RAD51C, PALB2 have been established as FA gene"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"0.5 point for each genes (BRCA2, PALB2, BRIP1 and RAD51C)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:aa39798d-9b6e-430d-8bc1-2a01f81f1f72_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d7c99bf1-1b9e-4889-af5d-c576c535da07","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b24d7ea3-f800-43de-8d45-f020636f3a44","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"both the mother carrying the p.Arg1699Gln mutation and the patient with both the p.Cys61Gly and the p.Arg1699Gln mutations are compromised in protecting nascent DNA from nucleolytic degradation during replication stress, whereas defective RAD51 foci formation postirradiation and olaparib hypersensitivity was observed with patient cells only.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31347298","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Biallelic BRCA1 mutations are regarded either embryonically lethal or to cause Fanconi anemia (FA), a genomic instability syndrome characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and cancer predisposition.

Complete loss of its function is lethal during early embryonic development. Patients who are compound heterozygous for BRCA1 truncating mutations and missense alleles that retain some DNA repair capacity may survive, albeit with very high risk of early onset breast or ovarian cancer and features of Fanconi anemia. However, a mechanism enabling survival of patients homozygous for BRCA1 truncating mutations has not been described. We studied two unrelated families in which four children presented with multiple congenital anomalies and severe chromosomal fragility. One child developed T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and a second child developed neuroblastoma. Each of the four children was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in BRCA1 exon 11. Homozygosity for the nonsense mutations was viable thanks to the presence of a naturally occurring alternative splice donor in BRCA1 exon 11 that lies 5' of the mutations. The mutations did not affect the alternative splice site, but transcription from it produced an in-frame BRCA1 message with deletion of 3,309 bp. The translated BRCA1 protein was only 40% of normal length, but with intact N- and C-terminal sequences. These patients extend the range of BRCA1-related phenotypes and illustrate how naturally occurring alternative splicing can enable survival, albeit with severe consequences, of otherwise lethal

anemia complementation group S (FANCS, OMIM:617883) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental delay apparent from infancy, short stature, microcephaly, and coarse dysmorphic features. Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in BRCA1 have been reported to be associated with FANCS. In total, eight affected individuals with FANCS from six unrelated families were curated here. All three adult probands have breast or ovarian cancer diagnosed before age of 30 (PMID: 23269703; 25472942; 31347298). Two out of five younger probands were diagnosed with cancer: one with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia at age 5 and one with neuroblastoma at age 2 (PMID:29712865). BRCA1, BRIP1, RAD51C, PALB2 have also been established as FA genes in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Multiple reports of functional assays using patients cells have consistent/similar results. For example, Sawyer SL, et al., 2015 (PMID: 25472942) indicated patient primary skin fibroblast cells showed reduced BRCA1 and Rad51 foci formation at IR induced damage sites and exhibited deficiency in DSB recognition. Rescue studies of PARP inhibition by Olaparib were also reported. In summary, BRCA1 is definitively associated with the autosomal recessive FANCS disorder. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aa39798d-9b6e-430d-8bc1-2a01f81f1f72"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
