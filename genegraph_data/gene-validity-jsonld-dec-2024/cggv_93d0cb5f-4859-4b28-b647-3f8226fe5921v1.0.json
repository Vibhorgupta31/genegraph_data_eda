Cells from individuals with Fanconi anemia are highly sensitive to DNA-crosslinking drugs, such as mitomycin C (MMC). Fanconi anemia proteins function in a DNA damage response pathway involving breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2 (refs. 1,2). A key step in this pathway is monoubiquitination of FANCD2, resulting in the redistribution of FANCD2 to nuclear foci containing BRCA1 (ref. 3). The underlying mechanism is unclear because the five Fanconi anemia proteins known to be required for this ubiquitination have no recognizable ubiquitin ligase motifs. Here we report a new component of a Fanconi anemia protein complex, called PHF9, which possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and is essential for FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vivo. Because PHF9 is defective in a cell line derived from an individual with Fanconi anemia, we conclude that PHF9 (also called FANCL) represents a novel Fanconi anemia complementation group (FA-L). Our data suggest that PHF9 has a crucial role in the Fanconi anemia pathway as the likely catalytic subunit required for monoubiquitination of FANCD2.","dc:creator":"Meetei AR","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"A novel ubiquitin ligase is deficient in Fanconi anemia."},"rdfs:label":"Fanconi anemia proteins coimmunoprecipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:46ef250a-4b60-4e31-89f5-c8e2c161a0e3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d090d21b-060f-4249-9007-db53389c5d18","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Fanconi anemia proteins function in a DNA damage response pathway involving breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2.

FANCL gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that was first reported in 2003 to be a member of the Fanconi Anemia Complex (Meetei et al. PMID: 12973351). Various types of variants (e.g. in-frame indel, frameshift, insertion, putative synonymous, etc.) that have been reported in multiple unrelated probands in publications (PMID:12973351,19405097,25754594,31513304). A putative synonymous c.1107G>A, p.Lys369= (NM_001114636.1 ) variant was demonstrated to induce aberrant splicing and was suggested to be a founder mutation in the South Asian population (PMID: 31513304). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is FANCL protein loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by FANCL-deficient patient cell lines, rescue cell culture model, protein interaction and expression studies. In summary, FANCL is definitively associated with autosomal recessive FA complementation group L. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:93d0cb5f-4859-4b28-b647-3f8226fe5921"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
