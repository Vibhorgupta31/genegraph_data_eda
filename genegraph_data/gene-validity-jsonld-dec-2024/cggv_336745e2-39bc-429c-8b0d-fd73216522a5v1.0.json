Many B cell defects have not yet been well characterized. Our objective was to create reliable in vivo and in vitro assays to routinely analyze human B cell differentiation, proliferation, and Ig production and to define reference ranges for different age categories. The in vitro assays were applied to classify the developmental and/or functional B cell defects in patients previously diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency. Apart from standard immunophenotyping of circulating human B cell subsets, an in vitro CFSE dilution assay was used for the assessment of proliferative capacity comparing T cell-dependent and T cell-independent B cell activation. Plasmablast/plasma cell differentiation was assessed by staining for CD20, CD38, and CD138, and measurement of in vitro Ig secretion. At young age, B cells proliferate upon in vitro activation, but neither differentiate nor produce IgG. These latter functions reached adult levels at 5 and 10 y of age for T cell-dependent versus T cell-independent stimulations, respectively. The capacity of B cells to differentiate into plasmablasts and to produce IgG appeared to be contained within the switched memory B cell pool. Using these assays, we could categorize common variable immunodeficiency patients into subgroups and identified a class-switch recombination defect caused by an UNG mutation in one of the patients. We defined age-related reference ranges for human B cell differentiation. Our findings indicate that in vivo B cell functionality can be tested in vitro and helps to diagnose suspected B cell defects.","dc:creator":"aan de Kerk DJ","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Identification of B cell defects using age-defined reference ranges for in vivo and in vitro B cell differentiation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23585684","rdfs:label":"Patient 10"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The homozygous, by consanguinity, c.630_632del variant results in the in-frame deletion of Leu212, in this patient with lack of uracil-DNA glycosylase activity."},{"id":"cggv:c48b8e0f-3956-44d6-9340-d86880f18031_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17a53ba8-2061-430b-aed3-bd0b31de0e39","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"clinical suspicion of primary immunodeficiency disease, further details not provided","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c48b8e0f-3956-44d6-9340-d86880f18031_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6656b144-a250-4170-82c0-9698f5625c72","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_080911.3(UNG):c.748G>A (p.Val250Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6772751"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32135276","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of monogenic inborn errors of immunity.
