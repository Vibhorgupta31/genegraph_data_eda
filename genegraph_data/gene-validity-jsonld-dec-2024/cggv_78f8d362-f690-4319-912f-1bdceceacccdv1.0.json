In the present study, we investigated the role of two genes, encoding the Z line proteins PDZ and LIM domain protein 3 (PDLIM3) and myozenin-1 (MYOZ1), in the etiology of DCM. The coding regions of PDLIM3 and MYOZ1 were first amplified from the genomic DNA of 185 unrelated DCM patients by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis. The samples that exhibited abnormal peaks on DHPLC were re-amplified, purified and sequenced using a Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing system. Interestingly, a 2-bp insertion (178insCA) in exon 2 of PDLIM3 was identified in one patient who presented with DCM during pregnancy and died a year later awaiting heart transplant. No other significant mutations were found in either PDLIM3 or MYOZ1. The mutation probably resulted in an unstable protein, since no exogenous protein could be detected in transfected murine myoblastoid cells by immunohistochemical or Western blot analyses. We conclude that mutations in PDLIM3 and MYOZ1, encoding myocyte Z line proteins, do not play any significant role in the genetic etiology of idiopathic DCM. The exact mechanism by which the mutation identified in the present study is linked to DCM phenotype remains unknown. The hemodynamic burden of pregnancy and/or other genetic or environmental factors could have precipitated heart failure symptoms in an individual with defective myocardial cytoarchitecture.","dc:creator":"Arola AM","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Mutations in PDLIM3 and MYOZ1 encoding myocyte Z line proteins are infrequently found in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17254821","rdfs:label":"Proband A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No segregation data, no information about genetic background (variants in other DCM associated genes)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantNullVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":1205,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7c5cf8c5-680c-4873-b9d7-c9ddfdc29ab1","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:20767","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PDLIM3 was evaluated for autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There is no supporting human genetic evidence demonstrating this gene-disease relationship in the literature at the time of curation.  Wang and colleagues (2019, PMID: 31424159) designed a case‐control study in 111 idiopathic DCM patients and 137 healthy controls.  PDLIM3 and PDLIM5 exons were amplified by polymerase chain reactions. Authors identified five synonymous polymorphisms showing statistical distribution differences between DCM patients and controls. In addition, Arola and colleagues (2007, PMID: 17254821) investigated 185 unrelated DCM patients by polymerase chain reaction and identified a truncating variant (c.178insCA) in PDLIM3. However, lack of segregation data and additional info related to other genes, the DCM GCEP excluded this variant as supporting evidence.  There is no experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship. In summary, the evidence presented for this gene-disease relationship does not provide convincing human genetic evidence in support of or refuting the role of PDLIM3 and autosomal dominant DCM. The relationship of PDLIM3 with DCM is unclear and therefore classified as disputed.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on October 4, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\nOnly a variant identified in one patient without segregation data and experimental evidence.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
