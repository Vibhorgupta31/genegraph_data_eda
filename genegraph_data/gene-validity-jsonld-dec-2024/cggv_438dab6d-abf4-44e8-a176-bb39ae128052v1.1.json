Each of the MPS-III types is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder with considerable variation in severity of clinical phenotype. The incidence of Sanfilippo syndrome has been estimated at 1:24,000 in The Netherlands with MPS IIIA (MIM #252900) the most common. MPS-IIIA is the predominant MPS-III in the United Kingdom, and has a similar high incidence to that found in The Netherlands (E. Wraith, personal communication). There is a particularly high incidence of a clinically severe form of MPS-IIIA in the Cayman Islands with a carrier frequency of 0.1 (ref. 4). Due to the mild somatic disease compared to other MPS disorders there is difficulty in diagnosing mild cases of MPS-III, hence Sanfilippo syndrome may be underdiagnosed, especially in patients with mild mental retardation. Here, we report the isolation, sequence and expression of cDNA clones encoding the enzyme sulphamidase (EC 3.10.1.1).

MPS I, a similar neurodegenerative disease accumulating HS, is treated successfully with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but this treatment is ineffectual for MPS IIIA.

LV-WT-HSCT results in 10% of normal brain enzyme activity, near normalization of brain HS and GM2 gangliosides, significant improvements in neuroinflammation and behavioral correction. Both WT-HSCT and LV-IIIA-HSCT mediated improvements in GM2 gangliosides and neuroinflammation but were less effective at reducing HS or in ameliorating abnormal HS sulfation and had no significant effect on behavior.

About 40 mutations have been reported in the sulfamidase gene, with a very uneven distribution in different patient populations. We have previously described the high prevalence of mutation 1091delC in a small number of Spanish Sanfilippo A patients. The aim of the present work is to extend the mutational study to a total of 26 unrelated patients and perform haplotype analysis in order to study the origin of some mutations. The whole coding region of the gene was scanned by SSCP analysis and sequencing. This allowed the identification of 14 different mutations, corresponding to 90% of the mutant alleles. Seven of these mutations were only found in this Spanish group of patients, three of which, R150W, R433Q and R433W, are described here for the first time. We have also analyzed four internal polymorphisms and constructed the corresponding haplotypes. Chromosomes bearing mutation 1091delC show a conserved haplotype suggesting a common origin for this mutation. Moreover, all other mutations found twice or more also have conserved haplotypes for those polymorphic markers.","dc:creator":"Chabás A","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutation and haplotype analyses in 26 Spanish Sanfilippo syndrome type A patients: possible single origin for 1091delC mutation."}},{"id":"cggv:ef1c54b2-97d4-4e57-bab9-6e196cdb5a8e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ab63ac41-8839-4be4-af0b-1023667164c5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343308"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient SFA-17"},{"id":"cggv:138ba925-6006-45bb-8f70-5b5a18a25fcd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:138ba925-6006-45bb-8f70-5b5a18a25fcd_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:138ba925-6006-45bb-8f70-5b5a18a25fcd_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 15146460: CHO cells transfected with mutant show non-detectable enzymatic activity "}],"strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ef1c54b2-97d4-4e57-bab9-6e196cdb5a8e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ef1c54b2-97d4-4e57-bab9-6e196cdb5a8e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ef1c54b2-97d4-4e57-bab9-6e196cdb5a8e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 15542396: Sf9 insect cells transfected with the mutant show 10% wild-type enzymatic activity "}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:05fc8983-5b43-45a7-8548-b25d492878ef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05fc8983-5b43-45a7-8548-b25d492878ef","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:f76d4b4d-fded-4d95-9604-004b53b0c1e3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"SGSH, 11-BP DEL, NT1284","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/5116"}},{"id":"cggv:9cceccce-e8d7-43aa-bb62-a6e675802215","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000199.5(SGSH):c.734G>A (p.Arg245His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA117257"}}],"detectionMethod":"PCR and sequencing of cDNA ","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"diagnosed with MPS IIIA on basis on deficient N-sulphoglucosamine sulphohydrolase enzymatic activity in cultured fibroblasts (exact level not noted)","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:70bb4428-2d21-4bb9-9085-c718a951990a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f76d4b4d-fded-4d95-9604-004b53b0c1e3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9158154","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sanfilippo A syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, MPS-IIIA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder due to an enzymatic defect of the lysosomal enzyme sulphamidase (EC 3.10.1.1) required for the degradation of heparan sulphate. In this study, molecular defects in the sulphamidase gene of MPS-IIIA patients were investigated in a group of 10 patients of Australian and American origin. The entire coding region of the sulphamidase gene was RT-PCR amplified and one polymorphism (R456H), four novel mutations (S66W, R245H, E447K, 1307 del 9) and one previously described mutation (1284 del 11) were identified by direct PCR sequencing. R245H was present in six patients including one severely affected homozygote. In three of the other patients with R245H, second mutant alleles were identified as S66W, 1284 del 11 and E447K, respectively. S66W was also detected in another patient where the other mutant allele remains undefined. In addition, 1307 del 9 was also detected in a patient with the other mutant allele remaining undefined. Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridisation was used to determine the incidence of these in a population of 26 MPS-IIIA patients (Australian and American) and 60 normal controls (Australian).

This is the first study of the molecular defects in MPS-IIIA patients and will greatly assist the development of molecular analysis for MPS-IIIA patients and studies concerned with genotype to phenotype relationships.","dc:creator":"Blanch L","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Molecular defects in Sanfilippo syndrome type A."}},{"id":"cggv:aae631df-f10c-4c29-bbea-0f582bab962a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9cceccce-e8d7-43aa-bb62-a6e675802215"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9158154"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 3469"},{"id":"cggv:70bb4428-2d21-4bb9-9085-c718a951990a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:70bb4428-2d21-4bb9-9085-c718a951990a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:70bb4428-2d21-4bb9-9085-c718a951990a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experimental data: chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and human fibroblasts transfected with the variant respectively show 1% and non-detectable enzyme activity (PMID: 7493035)"}],"strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:aae631df-f10c-4c29-bbea-0f582bab962a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aae631df-f10c-4c29-bbea-0f582bab962a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:aae631df-f10c-4c29-bbea-0f582bab962a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 10601282: supporting experimental data - recombinant human enzyme, p.R245H variant results in 0.05% of wild-type expression and 83% of wild-type enzyme activity in CHO cells; hypothesized to cause disease via rapid degradation of mutant enzyme (vs reduced enzyme activity)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:96ad347d-da1c-46cf-882e-7abecc2761d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96ad347d-da1c-46cf-882e-7abecc2761d6","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:3745f3ca-1d0a-4e51-ad57-61caf00743bc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000199.5(SGSH):c.1080del (p.Val361fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8817678"}},{"id":"cggv:3aad6232-5678-4c94-81e7-39bacb8d1ce6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000199.5(SGSH):c.364G>A (p.Gly122Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8818041"}}],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Enzymatic activity for subjects said to be substantially reduced or non-detectable","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:634c1847-11cf-45c5-ae95-628562d71dca_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3745f3ca-1d0a-4e51-ad57-61caf00743bc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27590925","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mucopolysaccharidosis type III is a group of four autosomal recessive enzyme deficiencies leading to tissue accumulation of heparan sulfate. Central nervous system disease is prominent, with initial normal development followed by neurocognitive decline leading to death. In order to define outcome measures suitable for gene transfer trials, we prospectively assessed disease progression in MPS IIIA and IIIB subjects >2years old at three time points over one year (baseline, 6 and 12months). Fifteen IIIA (9 male, 6 female; age 5.0±1.9years) and ten IIIB subjects (8 male, 2 female; age 8.6±3years) were enrolled, and twenty subjects completed assessments at all time points. Cognitive function as assessed by Mullen Scales maximized at the 2.5 to 3year old developmental level, and showed a significant age-related decline over a 6month interval in three of five subdomains. Leiter nonverbal IQ (NVIQ) standard scores declined toward the test floor in the cohort by 6 to 8years of age, but showed significant mean declines over a 6month interval in those <7years old (p=0.0029) and in those with NVIQ score≥45 (p=0.0313). Parental report of adaptive behavior as assessed by the Vineland-II composite score inversely correlated with age and showed a significant mean decline over 6month intervals (p=0.0004). Abdominal MRI demonstrated increased volumes in liver (mean 2.2 times normal) and spleen (mean 1.9 times normal) without significant change over one year; brain MRI showed ventriculomegaly and loss of cortical volume in all subjects. Biochemical measures included urine glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels, which although elevated showed a decline correlating with age (p<0.0001) and approached normal values in older subjects. CSF protein levels were elevated in 32% at enrollment, and elevations of AST and ALT were frequent. CSF enzyme activity levels for either SGSH (in MPS IIIA subjects) or NAGLU (in MPS IIIB) significantly differed from normal controls. Several other behavioral or functional measures were found to be uninformative in this population, including timed functional motor tests. Our results suggest that cognitive development as assessed by the Mullen and Leiter-R and adaptive behavior assessment by the Vineland parent interview are suitable functional outcomes for interventional trials in MPS IIIA or IIIB, and that CSF enzyme assay may be a useful biomarker to assess central nervous system transgene expression in gene transfer trials.","dc:creator":"Truxal KV","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"A prospective one-year natural history study of mucopolysaccharidosis types IIIA and IIIB: Implications for clinical trial design."}},{"id":"cggv:118848dd-9fab-483d-a338-c72ee2366ced_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3aad6232-5678-4c94-81e7-39bacb8d1ce6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27590925"}],"rdfs:label":"MPS-02"},{"id":"cggv:118848dd-9fab-483d-a338-c72ee2366ced","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:118848dd-9fab-483d-a338-c72ee2366ced_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:118848dd-9fab-483d-a338-c72ee2366ced_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 10727844: expression of p.Gly122Arg mutant in COS cells (transfected with the mutant) resulted in undetectable enzyme activity "}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:634c1847-11cf-45c5-ae95-628562d71dca","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:634c1847-11cf-45c5-ae95-628562d71dca_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:634c1847-11cf-45c5-ae95-628562d71dca_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 15542396: Sf9 insect cells transfected with the mutant shown non-detectable enzymatic activity "}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0be94814-78f6-4010-a38c-59d55a615b3b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0be94814-78f6-4010-a38c-59d55a615b3b","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:59ea8b67-8bd9-4145-abc8-0356dfcd3816","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000199.5(SGSH):c.892T>C (p.Ser298Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129225"}},{"id":"cggv:e8a34cb0-1b78-4895-8a56-c298db895318","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000017.11:g.80212070C>G (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA401359601"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Clinically diagnosed with MPS type IIIA on basis of enzyme activity (exact level unspecified)","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b955338e-9b59-4b60-bc3c-cb50e1566d6d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e8a34cb0-1b78-4895-8a56-c298db895318"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21671382","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA, Sanfilippo syndrome) is a fatal inherited lysosomal storage disease accompanied by progressive neurologic degeneration. The gene underlying MPS IIIA, SGSH, encodes a lysosomal enzyme, N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (sulfamidase). Mutational analysis of a large cohort of MPS IIIA patients showed a correlation of the missense mutation p.Ser298Pro and a slowly progressive course of the disease. We report here on the expression of the mutant p.Ser298Pro sulfamidase in BHK cells retaining low residual activity. Pulse-chase experiments showed that rapid degradation is responsible for the low steady state level of the mutant protein. Processing and secretion of p.Ser298Pro sulfamidase suggests that small amounts of the newly synthesized enzyme are transported to lysosomes. Most of the mutant sulfamidase exits the endoplasmic reticulum for proteasomal degradation. The ability to predict the clinical course of MPS IIIA in patients with the p.Ser298Pro mutation, as well as the residual enzymatic activity, and the reduced stability of the mutant sulfamidase suggest that this subgroup of patients is especially well suited to early sulfamidase replacement therapy or treatment with selective pharmacological chaperones.","dc:creator":"Muschol N","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Residual activity and proteasomal degradation of p.Ser298Pro sulfamidase identified in patients with a mild clinical phenotype of Sanfilippo A syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:d6ef8885-b268-4433-8dcb-07b968f01370_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:59ea8b67-8bd9-4145-abc8-0356dfcd3816"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21671382"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 16"},{"id":"cggv:b955338e-9b59-4b60-bc3c-cb50e1566d6d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b955338e-9b59-4b60-bc3c-cb50e1566d6d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d6ef8885-b268-4433-8dcb-07b968f01370","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d6ef8885-b268-4433-8dcb-07b968f01370_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d6ef8885-b268-4433-8dcb-07b968f01370_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 18407553: BHK cells transfected with the p.Ser298Pro variant show 2.3% of wild-type enzyme activity and reduced enzyme expression, shown to reflect increased proteosomal degradation of the mutant enzyme"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4817,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5c1dac9c-6175-4102-9be8-557d5c08a3a0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009655","gene":"hgnc:10818","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The relationship between the SGSH gene and mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 30, 2022. SGSH encodes N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, a lysosomal enzyme that involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate, through catalyzing the release of the sulfate groups linked to the amino group of glucosamine (PMID: 7493035). SGSH deficiency, which is present among individuals with MPS type IIIA, leads to accumulation of incompletely degraded oligosaccharides in lysosomes in the brain and other tissues, resulting in neurodegeneration with variable extra-neurologic manifestations (PMID: 18392742) \n\nThe disease mechanism of MPS IIIA is loss of function. MPS IIIA was first reported in 1971 (PMID: 4252428) and the first report of biallelic variants in SGSH among patients with MPS IIIA was published in 1995 (PMID: 7493035). Since then, at least 68 unique variants have been identified (PMID: 11668611). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between MPS IIIA and SGSH. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants. In total, 10 variants from five probands in five publications were curated (PMID: 9158154, PMID: 21671382, PMID: 15146460, PMID: 27590925, PMID: 11343308); although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between SGHS and MPS IIIA includes the biochemical function of the gene product (the MPS IIIA enzyme) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with MPS IIIA (PMID: 7493035, PMID: 18392742), the biochemical and clinical features of a mouse animal model homozygous for the p.D31N variant (PMID: 11181566, PMID: 15698885, PMID: 17913701), and the impact of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy in a MPS IIIA mouse model (PMID: 22547151). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, SGSH is definitively associated with MPS type IIIA. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time.
