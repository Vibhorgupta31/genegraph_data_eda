The E3 ligase Listerin (LTN1/Ltn1) acts in a specialized protein quality control pathway-Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC)-by mediating proteolytic targeting of incomplete polypeptides produced by ribosome stalling, and Ltn1 mutation leads to neurodegeneration in mice. Whether neurodegeneration results from defective RQC and whether defective RQC contributes to human disease have remained unknown. Here we show that three independently-generated mouse models with mutations in a different component of the RQC complex, NEMF/Rqc2, develop progressive motor neuron degeneration. Equivalent mutations in yeast Rqc2 selectively interfere with its ability to modify aberrant translation products with C-terminal tails which assist with RQC-mediated protein degradation, suggesting a pathomechanism. Finally, we identify NEMF mutations expected to interfere with function in patients from seven families presenting juvenile neuromuscular disease. These uncover NEMF's role in translational homeostasis in the nervous system and implicate RQC dysfunction in causing neurodegeneration.","dc:creator":"Martin PB","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"NEMF mutations that impair ribosome-associated quality control are associated with neuromuscular disease."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67f2bf82-cc3e-4006-a8e6-3f6f1dcb2513_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff42733a-948e-4eac-bf6c-adddc959f7b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff42733a-948e-4eac-bf6c-adddc959f7b6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a0c2896e-aaf8-4f17-9bbb-529fd1f281e0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004713.6(NEMF):c.2451del (p.Ala818ProfsTer7)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2580618011"}},"detectionMethod":"WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Intellectual disability, global developmental delay, speech delay, distal muscle atrophy, hypotonia.","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:4c80e5fe-48db-41de-846f-227fcfdf6e99_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a0c2896e-aaf8-4f17-9bbb-529fd1f281e0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32934225"},"rdfs:label":"IRN1-II:1"},{"id":"cggv:4c80e5fe-48db-41de-846f-227fcfdf6e99","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c80e5fe-48db-41de-846f-227fcfdf6e99_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduce 0.5 points for homozygosity and 0.5 points for consanguinity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7b173076-feff-475e-b025-a71c3ee519ef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7b173076-feff-475e-b025-a71c3ee519ef","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":{"id":"cggv:4fd53f4a-4645-4218-ac84-24be124187c7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004713.6(NEMF):c.807-2A>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA389629381"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c8ddd264-795d-42e7-af5e-503d924f878c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4fd53f4a-4645-4218-ac84-24be124187c7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33048237","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We aimed to detect the causative gene in five unrelated families with recessive inheritance pattern neurological disorders involving the central nervous system, and the potential function of the NEMF gene in the central nervous system. Exome sequencing (ES) was applied to all families and linkage analysis was performed on family 1. A minigene assay was used to validate the splicing effect of the relevant discovered variants. Immunofluorescence (IF) experiment was performed to investigate the role of the causative gene in neuron development. The large consanguineous family confirms the phenotype-causative relationship with homozygous frameshift variant (NM_004713.6:c.2618del) as revealed by ES. Linkage analysis of the family showed a significant single-point LOD of 4.5 locus. Through collaboration in GeneMatcher, four additional unrelated families' likely pathogenic NEMF variants for a spectrum of central neurological disorders, two homozygous splice-site variants (NM_004713.6:c.574+1G>T and NM_004713.6:c.807-2A>C) and a homozygous frameshift variant (NM_004713.6: c.1234_1235insC) were subsequently identified and segregated with all affected individuals. We further revealed that knockdown (KD) of Nemf leads to impairment of axonal outgrowth and synapse development in cultured mouse primary cortical neurons.

Biallelic variants in NEMF were first reported in relation to autosomal recessive intellectual developmental disorder with speech delay and axonal peripheral neuropathy in 2020 (Martin et al., PMID: 32934225). Affected individuals typically present with developmental delay with speech delay, axonal neuropathy, ataxia, distal muscle atrophy, hypotonia, respiratory distress, abnormal brain imaging, and hand and foot deformities. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 individuals from two publications, including 6 unique loss of function variants and 1 missense variant included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least two families, including a LoD score of 4.5 in one large consanguineous family (PMID: 32934225; Ahmed et al., 2021, PMID: 33048237).  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by in vitro functional assays and mouse models which recapitulate the clinical phenotype.\n \nIn summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between NEMF and autosomal recessive intellectual developmental disorder with speech delay and axonal peripheral neuropathy. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the assertion to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted.
