Studies in Drosophila have shown that the Slit-Robo signaling pathway controls cardiac cell shape changes and lumen formation of the heart tube. Here, we demonstrate by in situ hybridization that multiple Slit ligands and Robo receptors are expressed in the developing mouse heart. Slit3 is the predominant ligand transcribed in the early mouse heart and is expressed in the ventral wall of the linear heart tube and subsequently in chamber but not in atrioventricular canal myocardium. Furthermore, we identify that the homeobox gene Nkx2-5 is required for early ventral restriction of Slit3 and that the T-box transcription factor Tbx2 mediates repression of Slit3 in nonchamber myocardium. Our results suggest that patterned Slit-Robo signaling may contribute to the control of oriented cell growth during chamber morphogenesis of the mammalian heart.","dc:creator":"Medioni C","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Expression of Slit and Robo genes in the developing mouse heart."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse in situ hybridization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Scored by other articles"},{"id":"cggv:b9e694f4-d984-4729-80a7-78bc67890190","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9647b4b4-6e91-4276-92fa-493ce157064b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Fly tissue expression","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16360689","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Basic aspects of heart morphogenesis involving migration, cell polarization, tissue alignment, and lumen formation may be conserved between Drosophila and humans, but little is known about the mechanisms that orchestrate the assembly of the heart tube in either organism. The extracellular-matrix molecule Slit and its Robo-family receptors are conserved regulators of axonal guidance. Here, we report a novel role of the Drosophila slit, robo, and robo2 genes in heart morphogenesis. Slit and Robo proteins specifically accumulate at the dorsal midline between the bilateral myocardial progenitors forming a linear tube. Manipulation of Slit localization or its overexpression causes disruption in heart tube alignment and assembly, and slit-deficient hearts show disruptions in cell-polarity marker localization within the myocardium. Similar phenotypes are observed when Robo and Robo2 are manipulated. Rescue experiments suggest that Slit is secreted from the myocardial progenitors and that Robo and Robo2 act in myocardial and pericardial cells, respectively. Genetic interactions suggest a cardiac morphogenesis network involving Slit/Robo, cell-polarity proteins, and other membrane-associated proteins. We conclude that Slit and Robo proteins contribute significantly to Drosophila heart morphogenesis by guiding heart cell alignment and adhesion and/or by inhibiting cell mixing between the bilateral compartments of heart cell progenitors and ensuring proper polarity of the myocardial epithelium.","dc:creator":"Qian L","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Slit and Robo control cardiac cell polarity and morphogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Fly expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:08d895d5-2798-4a84-88b4-9a83ce9c11a1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3076cf47-65d8-4e5d-9e98-f1acdc84a4e7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Mouse in situ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23255421","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The Slit-Roundabout (Robo) signaling pathway has pleiotropic functions during Drosophila heart development.

Unexpectedly, in Robo mutant mice, the primary defect preceding organ misplacement and diaphragm malformation is a delayed separation of foregut from the dorsal body wall. Foregut separation is a rarely considered morphogenetic event, and our data indicate that it occurs via repulsion of Robo-expressing foregut cells away from the Slit ligand source.

Mislocalization of Slit outside the apical domain causes ectopic lumen formation and the mislocalization of cell junction proteins, E-cadherin (E-Cad) and Enabled, without disrupting overall CB cell polarity. Ectopic lumen formation is suppressed in robo mutants, which indicates robo's requirement for this process. Genetic evidence suggests that Robo and Shotgun (Shg)/E-Cad function together in modulating CB adhesion. robo and shg/E-Cad transheterozygotes have lumen defects. In robo loss-of-function or shg/E-Cad gain-of-function embryos, lumen formation is blocked because of inappropriate CB adhesion and an accumulation of E-Cad at the apical membrane. In contrast, shg/E-Cad loss-of-function or robo gain-of-function blocks lumen formation due to a loss of CB adhesion.
