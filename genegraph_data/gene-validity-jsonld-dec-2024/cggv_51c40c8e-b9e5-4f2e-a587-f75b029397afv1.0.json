We determined the molecular basis for ocular cystinosis in four individuals. All had mutations in the cystinosis gene CTNS, indicating that ocular cystinosis is allelic with classic nephropathic cystinosis. The ocular cystinosis patients each had one severe mutation and one mild mutation, the latter consisting of either a 928 G-->A (G197R) mutation or an IVS10-3 C-->G splicing mutation resulting in the insertion of 182 bp of IVS10 into the CTNS mRNA. The mild mutations appear to allow for residual CTNS mRNA production, significant amounts of lysosomal cystine transport, and lower levels of cellular cystine compared with those in nephropathic cystinosis. The lack of kidney involvement in ocular cystinosis may be explained by two different mechanisms. On the one hand (e.g. the G197R mutation), significant residual cystinosin activity may be present in every tissue. On the other hand (e.g. the IVS 10-3 C-->G mutation), substantial cystinosin activity may exist in the kidney because of that tissue's specific expression of factors that promote splicing of a normal CTNS transcript. Each of these mechanisms could result in minimally reduced lysosomal cystine transport in the kidneys.","dc:creator":"Anikster Y","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Ocular nonnephropathic cystinosis: clinical, biochemical, and molecular correlations."}},"rdfs:label":"Ani-2"},{"id":"cggv:8fe20b2b-fb09-47d2-bc70-d71b702ec003","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8fe20b2b-fb09-47d2-bc70-d71b702ec003_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8fe20b2b-fb09-47d2-bc70-d71b702ec003_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional studies show variant results in reduced cystine transport (PMID 15128704)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c3b65b99-d148-4419-bccf-7c5a48ed8edc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3b65b99-d148-4419-bccf-7c5a48ed8edc","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:cc71cb96-cbc0-4cce-b7bc-80c6a355260a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000017.11:g.3600934_3658165del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/4445"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"Nephropathic Cystinosis by ‘standard criteria’ with symptoms manifesting in infancy","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:65b7a160-4a08-4db5-99cb-036c3230b373_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cc71cb96-cbc0-4cce-b7bc-80c6a355260a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9537412"},"rdfs:label":"Town"},{"id":"cggv:65b7a160-4a08-4db5-99cb-036c3230b373","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:65b7a160-4a08-4db5-99cb-036c3230b373_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"No points deducted for homozygosity/consanguinity as reported multiple times in comp. het and also in families without consanguinity.\nVariant present in ~50% of cases of Northern European ancestry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:51c40c8e-b9e5-4f2e-a587-f75b029397af_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:cb4da746-2107-4993-9b96-980b2bc0bd03_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb4da746-2107-4993-9b96-980b2bc0bd03","type":"Proband","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3e3f3479-4007-4fe6-8a63-8e5ca65821c5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004937.3(CTNS):c.1015G>A (p.Gly339Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA278067"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"Vomiting and dehydration, polyuria, polydipsia, and failure to thrive. \nMetabolic acidosis, hypophosphataemia, hypokalaemia, and glucosuria.

Late-onset cystinosis, a rarer form of the disorder, is characterized by onset of symptoms between 12 and 15 years of age. We previously characterized the cystinosis gene, CTNS, and identified pathogenic mutations in patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis, including a common, approximately 65 kb deletion which encompasses exons 1-10. Structure predictions suggested that the gene product, cystinosin, is a novel integral lysosomal membrane protein. We now examine the predicted effect of mutations on this model of cystinosin. In this study, we screened patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis, those with late-onset cystinosis and patients whose phenotype does not fit the classical definitions. We found 23 different mutations in CTNS; 14 are novel mutations. Out of 25 patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis, 12 have two severely truncating mutations, which is consistent with a loss of functional protein, and 13 have missense or in-frame deletions, which would result in disruption of transmembrane domains and loss of protein function. Mutations found in two late-onset patients affect functionally unimportant regions of cystinosin, which accounts for their milder phenotype. For three patients, the age of onset of cystinosis was <7 years but the course of the disease was milder than the infantile nephropathic form. This suggests that the missense mutations found in these individuals allow production of functional protein and may also indicate regions of cystinosin which are not functionally important.","dc:creator":"Attard M","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Severity of phenotype in cystinosis varies with mutations in the CTNS gene: predicted effect on the model of cystinosin."}},"rdfs:label":"Att–L36"},{"id":"cggv:83c6685e-ffeb-46ee-adfc-107d85e5999c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:83c6685e-ffeb-46ee-adfc-107d85e5999c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:83c6685e-ffeb-46ee-adfc-107d85e5999c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional studies show variant results in reduced cystine transport (PMID 15128704)\ncDNA analysis demonstrates in-frame insertion of 9 bp before exon 8."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:51c40c8e-b9e5-4f2e-a587-f75b029397af_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:51c40c8e-b9e5-4f2e-a587-f75b029397af_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:447c36a5-fb71-4fdf-982c-6528f2ab608b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e46e3ff5-6959-4878-bd4a-8683f58d1afa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"In the absence of a functional cystinosin protein, cystine accumulates and crystallizes in the lysosomal lumen.

However, the causative gene, CTNS, encodes a seven transmembrane domain lysosomal protein, cystinosin, unrelated to known transporters. To investigate the molecular function of cystinosin, the protein was redirected from lysosomes to the plasma membrane by deletion of its C-terminal GYDQL sorting motif (cystinosin-DeltaGYDQL), thereby exposing the intralysosomal side of cystinosin to the extracellular medium. COS cells expressing cystinosin-DeltaGYDQL selectively take up L-cystine from the extracellular medium at acidic pH. Disruption of the transmembrane pH gradient or incubation of the cells at neutral pH strongly inhibits the uptake. Cystinosin-DeltaGYDQL is directly involved in the observed cystine transport, since this activity is highly reduced when the GYDQL motif is restored and is abolished upon introduction of a point mutation inducing early-onset cystinosis. We conclude that cystinosin represents a novel H(+)-driven transporter that is responsible for cystine export from lysosomes, and propose that cystinosin homologues, such as mammalian SL15/Lec35 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERS1, may perform similar transport processes at other cellular membranes.","dc:creator":"Kalatzis V","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Cystinosin, the protein defective in cystinosis, is a H(+)-driven lysosomal cystine transporter."},"rdfs:label":"cystinosin protein function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"CTNS only known gene to function in transporting cystine, central to disease development"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:51c40c8e-b9e5-4f2e-a587-f75b029397af_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7631467-6c7b-4020-8302-a20bc9f73d9a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da60bd9f-867b-4462-8cd1-80cb54728a60","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice developed ocular changes and bone defects similar to those observed in affected human individuals, but did not develop any clinical or biological signs of a proximal tubulopathy or renal failure.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12370309","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an accumulation of intralysosomal cystine.

Cystinosin functions to transport cystine, a by-product of lysosomal protein hydrolysis, out of lysosomes and into the cytoplasm where it is reduced to cysteine. In the absence of a functional cystinosin protein, cystine accumulates and crystallizes in the lysosomal lumen.\n\nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern or phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Cystinosis, nephropathic (OMIM:219800); Cystinosis, late-onset juvenile or adolescent nephropathic (OMIM:219900); and Cystinosis, ocular non-nephropathic (OMIM:219750). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘Cystinosis - *CTNS*’.\n\n*CTNS* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cystinosis in 1998 (Town et al., PMID: 9537412). In the most frequent form, infantile nephropathic cystinosis, individuals typically present during the second half of the first year of life, with short stature and failure to thrive, renal Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemic/calcipenic rickets, and corneal crystals that eventually cause photophobia. Left untreated, kidney function will continue to deteriorate, eventually progressing to kidney failure at 10-12 years of age. Adult-onset, ocular non-nephropathic cystinosis is characterized solely by corneal cystine crystal accumulation. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity for cystinosis is known to be loss of function, with milder phenotypes generally associated with mutant cystinosin that retains some residual function (PMID: 15128704). The exact mechanisms that cause clinical symptoms remain incompletely understood, but cystine crystal accumulation, macrophage activation, enhanced oxidative stress, and inflammasome pathway activation are all driving factors (PMID: 35053306).\n\nMore than 150 pathogenic variants (missense, nonsense, splice altering variants, small indels, promoter variants, and large deletions), located throughout the gene, have been reported (summarized in PMID: 30554218). Of note, a 57kb deletion accounts for 50% of mutant alleles in patients of Northern European ancestry, with the following variants also recognised as founder/recurrent variants in certain populations: c.1015G>A, c.971–12G>A, c.681G>A, and  c.414G>A. A total of 9 variants identified in 8 probands over 8 publications are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models that recapitulate the human phenotype. A FVB/N knockout mouse model showed accumulation of cystine in all organs tested, with mice also developing ocular changes and bone defects (PMID: 12370309). A C57BL/6 knockout mouse model showed accumulation of cystine in multiple organs, as well as proximal tubulopathy, focal tubular lesions, and progressively developed chronic renal failure (PMID: 19846395). A knock in zebrafish model of a homozygous nonsense mutation showed cystine accumulation, impaired glomerular permselectivity and defective tubular reabsorption, with podocytes showing partial foot process effacement and narrowed slit diaphragmatic space (PMID: 28198397). A total of 5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CTNS* and autosomal recessive cystinosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:51c40c8e-b9e5-4f2e-a587-f75b029397af"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
