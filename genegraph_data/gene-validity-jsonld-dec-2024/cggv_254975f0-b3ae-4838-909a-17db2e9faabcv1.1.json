Virus-directed deletion or overexpression of FRRS1l strongly impact synaptic transmission in adult rat brain by decreasing or increasing the number of AMPARs in synapses and extra-synaptic sites.

Most patients with LGS do not respond well to drug treatment and show poor long-term prognosis. Approximately 30% of patients without brain abnormalities have unidentifiable causes. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and treatment of LGS remain challenging. To identify causative mutations of LGS, we analyzed the whole-exome sequencing data of 17 unrelated Korean families, including patients with LGS and LGS-like epilepsy without brain abnormalities, using the Genome Analysis Toolkit. We identified 14 mutations in 14 genes as causes of LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. 64 percent of the identified genes were reported as LGS or epilepsy-related genes. Many of these variations were novel and considered as pathogenic or likely pathogenic.

The predominance of autosomal-recessive causes allowed us to make several key observations. We highlight 155 genes that we propose to be recessive, disease-related candidates. We report additional mutational events in 64 previously reported candidates (40 recessive), and these events support their candidacy. We report recessive forms of genes that were previously associated only with dominant disorders and that have phenotypes ranging from consistent with to conspicuously distinct from the known dominant phenotypes. We also report homozygous loss-of-function events that can inform the genetics of complex diseases. We were also able to deduce the likely causal variant in most couples who presented after the loss of one or more children, but we lack samples from those children. Although a similar pattern of mostly recessive causes was observed in the prenatal setting, the higher proportion of loss-of-function events in these cases was notable. The allelic series presented by the wealth of recessive variants greatly expanded the phenotypic expression of the respective genes. We also make important observations about dominant disorders; these observations include the pattern of de novo variants, the identification of 74 candidate dominant, disease-related genes, and the potential confirmation of 21 previously reported candidates. Finally, we describe the influence of a predominantly autosomal-recessive landscape on the clinical utility of rapid sequencing (Flash Exome). Our cohort's genotypic and phenotypic data represent a unique resource that can contribute to improved variant interpretation through data sharing.","dc:creator":"Monies D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Lessons Learned from Large-Scale, First-Tier Clinical Exome Sequencing in a Highly Consanguineous Population."}},"rdfs:label":"18-2393"},{"id":"cggv:57f0ea2e-9749-4494-b5a0-c5f9bc7f6059","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57f0ea2e-9749-4494-b5a0-c5f9bc7f6059_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:28d91b53-e915-44a1-9204-c415bdb92cc7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:28d91b53-e915-44a1-9204-c415bdb92cc7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:34669345-4967-4647-a403-66f816fa9687","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014334.4(FRRS1L):c.283dup (p.Ile95AsnfsTer10)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10575815"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0002072","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0020221","obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0001336"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:3edf5c0b-6631-470c-9791-a611742b4a7d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:34669345-4967-4647-a403-66f816fa9687"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27236917"},"rdfs:label":"4-II-2"},{"id":"cggv:3edf5c0b-6631-470c-9791-a611742b4a7d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3edf5c0b-6631-470c-9791-a611742b4a7d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"homozygous variant in consanguineous family"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:254975f0-b3ae-4838-909a-17db2e9faabc_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:05be9417-56ec-415e-b4de-33073af7d56c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05be9417-56ec-415e-b4de-33073af7d56c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","allele":{"id":"cggv:d9c8b1ce-34fd-4bca-8248-ad5735eee56b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014334.4(FRRS1L):c.227dup (p.Ser77ValfsTer28)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695211021"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0002353","obo:HP_0025405","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0001266","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0009890","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0030890","obo:HP_0002266","obo:HP_0001290"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:512c8e40-a5f7-4813-a470-22077992a4e7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d9c8b1ce-34fd-4bca-8248-ad5735eee56b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815844","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Mir A","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Continuous Spikes and Waves During Sleep (CSWS), Severe Epileptic Encephalopathy, and Choreoathetosis due to Mutations in "}},"rdfs:label":"2"},{"id":"cggv:512c8e40-a5f7-4813-a470-22077992a4e7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:512c8e40-a5f7-4813-a470-22077992a4e7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Homozygous in a consanguineous family.

PMID: 27239025). Typical phenotypes of individuals affected with FRRS1L-related DEE include severe intractable seizures, global developmental delay, regression, hypotonia, and movement disorders such as choreoathetosis. Eleven homozygous variants (missense and truncations) reported in 11 probands in eight publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 27236917, 27239025, 28675162, 30525197, 31130284, 33584793, 35815844, 36703223). While a founder variant from Saudi Arabia, NM_014334.4 c.808C>T p.Gln270* (CA10575812), was found in the homozygous state in affected individuals from at least four families in three publications (PMID: 27239025, 27236917, 31054490), only one of the probands was included in the scoring as the level of relatedness between these two families is unclear (PMID: 27239025). Other variants segregated with disease in two different families resulting in a total LOD score of 5.86. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knockout mouse model that showed spontaneous seizures (PMID: 30692144). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between FRRS1L and autosomal recessive DEE. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification has been approved by ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date, September 17, 2024 (SOP version 11).
