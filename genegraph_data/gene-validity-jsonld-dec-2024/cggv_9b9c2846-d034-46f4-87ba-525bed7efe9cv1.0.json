As one of eleven polypeptides required for Q production in yeast, Coq5 has also been shown to assemble with the multi-subunit complex termed the CoQ-synthome. In humans, mutations in several COQ genes cause primary Q deficiency, and a decrease in Q biosynthesis is associated with mitochondrial, cardiovascular, kidney and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we characterize the human COQ5 polypeptide and examine its complementation of yeast coq5 point and null mutants. We show that human COQ5 RNA is expressed in all tissues and that the COQ5 polypeptide is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane on the matrix side. Previous work in yeast has shown that point mutations within or adjacent to conserved COQ5 methyltransferase motifs result in a loss of Coq5 function but not Coq5 steady state levels. Here, we show that stabilization of the CoQ-synthome within coq5 point mutants or by over-expression of COQ8 in coq5 null mutants permits the human COQ5 homolog to partially restore coq5 mutant growth on respiratory media and Q6 content. Immunoblotting against the human COQ5 polypeptide in isolated yeast mitochondria shows that the human Coq5 polypeptide migrates in two-dimensional blue-native/SDS-PAGE at the same high molecular mass as other yeast Coq proteins. The results presented suggest that human and Escherichia coli Coq5 homologs expressed in yeast retain C-methyltransferase activity but are capable of rescuing the coq5 yeast mutants only when the CoQ-synthome is assembled.","dc:creator":"Nguyen TP","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Molecular characterization of the human COQ5 C-methyltransferase in coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis."},"rdfs:label":"COQ5 Mitochondrial Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Since expression is ubiquitous in all tissues and it is known to be mitochondrial, the experts feel that no points should be awarded.

Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"COQ5 Function in COQ10 Biosynthesis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This is in agreement with Genereviews (PMID: 28125198) and was experimentally demonstrated in S. cerevisiae (PMID: 9083049)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9b9c2846-d034-46f4-87ba-525bed7efe9c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d3de13bc-ce57-41f4-95f2-045fc4353ca7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23603d85-a2ec-4f2d-9022-23650b5af452","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is caused by reduced levels of CoQ10 due to biallelic variants in any of the genes encoding proteins involved directly in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q. Patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency typically have heterogeneous clinical manifestations that progress if untreated and certain phenotypes such as severe neurologic and/or renal damage may be irreversible. Malicdan et al. reported clinical improvements in 3 patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency who received high dose oral treatment of ubiquinol (15 mg/kg/d divided into 3 dosages) for 6 months. Clinical improvements included cognitive and behavioral features such as quicker response rates in conversation and  improved alertness. Additionally, leukocyte coenzyme Q10 levels increased above the normal range for all affected individuals after 3 months of treatment. A combination of these improvements resulted in significantly decreased ICARS scores (quantification of impairment due to cerebellar ataxia; out of 100, where higher scores indicate higher levels of impairment). However, the patients stopped treatment 2 weeks before the 6 month evaluation and, subsequently, there was a slight deterioration in scoring results (patient 1: −22, patient 2: −8, patient 3: −11).\n\nUbiquinol has also been administered via nasal spray in a patient with CoQ10 deficiency and was well-tolerated (PMID: 37599337). This patient showed gradual improvement in motor condition (improved muscle strength, the patient sits up on her own from a lying position, stands on her own, decreased ptosis), and CoQ10 levels normalized with treatment. However, she has not acquired the ability to walk and cognitive development remains at a low level.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29044765","rdfs:label":"CoQ10 Supplementation in Patients with CoQ5 Deficiency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Also supported by the genereviews paper (PMID: 28125198), which describes high-dose oral CoQ10 supplementation (ranging from 5 to 50 mg/kg/day) as a pharmocologic treatment.

The *COQ5* gene encodes coenzyme Q5, methyltransferase which is involved in mitochondrial ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10, CoQ10) biosynthesis. Coenzyme Q10 is critical for many processes in the cell, including in the mitochondrial respiratory chain transferring electrons from complexes I and II to complex III. CoQ10 deficiency is a multisystem primary mitochondrial disease characterized by variable clinical manifestations that include encephalopathy, seizures, movement disorder, hypotonia, nephrotic syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, retinopathy and sensorineural hearing loss. Laboratory findings include reduced CoQ10 biosynthesis and reduced activity of mitochondrial complex I+II and I+III and II+III (PMID: 28125198). \nThree variants (1 large tandem duplication, 1 canonical splice-site, 1 missense) that have been reported in 2 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 29044765, 37599337) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of ubiquinone biosynthesis that is shared with other known genes in the disease of interest (PMIDs: 9083048, 33340416, 28125198), protein interaction with *COQ4* which is another ubiquinone biosynthesis gene that has a definitive classification for mitochondrial disease (PMID: 25152161), and a human rescue model where high-dose oral supplementation of CoQ10 was shown to improve the clinical manifestations and Q10 levels in patients with *COQ5*-related coenzyme Q10 deficiency (PMID: 29044765). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
