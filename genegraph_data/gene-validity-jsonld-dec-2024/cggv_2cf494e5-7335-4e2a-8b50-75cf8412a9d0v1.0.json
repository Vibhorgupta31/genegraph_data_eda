In the mouse, a null allele of Rdx encoding radixin is associated with hearing loss as a result of the degeneration of inner ear hair cells as well as with hyperbilirubinemia due to hepatocyte dysfunction. Two mutant alleles of RDX [c.1732G>A (p.D578N) and c.1404_1405insG (p.A469fsX487)] segregating in two consanguineous Pakistani families are associated with neurosensory hearing loss. Both of these mutant alleles are predicted to affect the actin-binding motif of radixin. Sequence analysis of RDX in the DNA samples from the original DFNB24 family revealed a c.463C>T transition substitution that is predicted to truncate the protein in the FERM domain (F for 4.1, E for ezrin, R for radixin, and M for moesin) (p.Q155X). We also report a more complete gene and protein structure of RDX, including four additional exons and five new isoforms of RDX that are expressed in human retina and inner ear.

Earlier biochemical results suggested that a protein of this family occurs in the hair bundle, the cluster of actin-filled stereocilia that serves as the mechanoreceptive organelle of each hair cell in the inner ear. We prepared antipeptide antisera directed against chicken radixin and ezrin and demonstrated their specificity and absence of crossreactivity. When used in immunocytochemical studies of isolated hair cells, anti-radixin produced an intense band of labeling at the bases of hair bundles from the chicken, frog, mouse, and zebrafish. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry disclosed that radixin labeling commenced in the stereociliary taper, peaked in the lower stereociliary shaft, and declined progressively toward the hair bundle's top. Labeling with anti-ezrin produced no signal in hair bundles. Radixin is thus a prominent constituent of stereocilia, where it may participate in anchoring the \"pointed\" ends of actin filaments to the membrane.","dc:creator":"Pataky F","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Radixin is a constituent of stereocilia in hair cells."},"rdfs:label":"Pataky Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fd68e554-f5d2-4cff-a11e-d4dfeba303ab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bde6d0b4-c58c-4803-9f56-dba5e5d44ffa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Radixin expression was detected in one row of IHC sterocilia and three rows of OHC stereocilia in mouse cochlea by immunofluorescent microscopy and by scanning EM.
