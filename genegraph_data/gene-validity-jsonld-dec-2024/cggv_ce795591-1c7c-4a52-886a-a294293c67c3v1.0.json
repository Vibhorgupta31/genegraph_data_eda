Most human vEDS cases result from a missense mutation substituting a crucial glycine residue in the triple helical domain of the Î±1(III)-chains. The mechanisms by which these mutant type III collagen molecules cause dermal and vascular fragility are not well understood. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing mutant type III collagen, containing a typical helical glycine substitution (p.(Gly182Ser)). This Col3a1Tg-G182S mouse line displays a phenotype recapitulating characteristics of human vEDS patients with signs of dermal and vascular fragility. The Col3a1Tg-G182S mice develop severe transdermal skin wounds, resulting in early demise at 13-14weeks of age. We found that this phenotype was associated with a reduced total collagen content and an abnormal collagen III:I ratio, leading to the production of severely malformed collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix of dermal and arterial tissues.

During pregnancy and delivery, maternal mortality rates up until 25% have been reported. However, recent pedigree analysis reported a substantial lower pregnancy-related mortality rate of 4.9%. Here, we describe an extended vEDS family with multiple uneventful pregnancy outcomes. In the proband, a 37-year-old woman, DNA-analysis because of an asymptomatic iliac artery dissection revealed a pathogenic mutation in COL3A1 (c.980G>A; p. Gly327Asp). She had had three uneventful vaginal deliveries. At the time of diagnosis, her 33-year-old niece was 25 weeks pregnant. She had had one uneventful vaginal delivery. Targeted DNA-analysis revealed that she was carrier of the COL3A1 mutation. Ultrasound detected an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta with likely a dissection. An uneventful elective cesarean section was performed at a gestational age of 37 weeks. The 40-year-old sister of our proband had had one uneventful vaginal delivery and an active pregnancy wish. Cascade DNA-screening showed her to carry the COL3A1 mutation. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of her aorta revealed a type B dissection with the most proximal entry tear just below the superior mesenteric artery. Pregnancy was therefore discouraged. This familial case illustrates the complexity and challenges of reproductive decision-making in a potentially lethal condition as vEDS, and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach. Moreover, it suggests that previous pregnancy-related risks of vEDS may be overestimated.

Although other fibrillar collagen-gene mutations that lead to allele instability or failure to incorporate proalpha-chains into trimers-and that thus reduce the amount of mature molecules produced-result in clinically apparent phenotypes, no such mutations have been identified in COL3A1. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for Col3a1 \"null\" alleles have no identified phenotype. We have now found three frameshift mutations (1832delAA, 413delC, and 555delT) that lead to premature termination codons (PTCs) in exons 27, 6, and 9, respectively, and to allele-product instability. The mRNA from each mutant allele was transcribed efficiently but rapidly degraded, presumably by the mechanisms of nonsense-mediated decay. In a fourth patient, we identified a point mutation, in the final exon, that resulted in a PTC (4294C-->T [Arg1432Ter]). In this last instance, the mRNA was stable but led to synthesis of a truncated protein that was not incorporated into mature type III procollagen molecules. In all probands, the presenting feature was vascular aneurysm or rupture. Thus, in contrast to mutations in genes that encode the dominant protein of a tissue (e.g., COL1A1 and COL2A1), in which \"null\" mutations result in phenotypes milder than those caused by mutations that alter protein sequence, the phenotypes produced by these mutations in COL3A1 overlap with those of the vascular form of EDS. This suggests that the major effect of many of these dominant mutations in the \"minor\" collagen genes may be expressed through protein deficiency rather than through incorporation of structurally altered molecules into fibrils.","dc:creator":"Schwarze U","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Haploinsufficiency for one COL3A1 allele of type III procollagen results in a phenotype similar to the vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11577371","rdfs:label":"P1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:0aab5ea7-09b6-48d7-a81f-d5fed263a563_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c1051af-94a5-44d7-b1b3-f2da568d6836","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":22,"detectionMethod":"For initial screening for mutations, 5 single-stranded cDNA probes spanning the entire coding sequence of the human alpha1(III) chain were prepared and S1 nuclease protection experiments were performed.

Variants in COL3A1 were first reported in\nhumans with this disease as early as 1988 (Superti-Furga et al., PMID 2834369). At least 600 unique variants are found in the Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Variant Database and ~250 more in ClinVar (Byers, 1999; PMID 20301667). This is a well-known gene-disease relationship and there is a significant amount of case-level, segregation and experimental data in the literature, therefore the maximum points for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is mainly gain-of-function as most cases result from missense variants leading to the substitution of a crucial glycine in the repetitive Gly-X-Y sequence of the triple helix domain, resulting in only 1 in 8 normal mature collagen homotrimers. About 5% of cases are due to haploinsufficiency and are associated with milder phenotypes (Frank et al., 2015; PMID 25758994).  This gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro assays, expression studies,  and animal models. In summary, COL3A1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, vascular type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on February 27, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ce795591-1c7c-4a52-886a-a294293c67c3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
