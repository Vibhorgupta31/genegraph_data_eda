We identified recessive mutations in EPG5 (previously KIAA1632), indicating a causative role in Vici syndrome. EPG5 is the human homolog of the metazoan-specific autophagy gene epg-5, encoding a key autophagy regulator (ectopic P-granules autophagy protein 5) implicated in the formation of autolysosomes. Further studies showed a severe block in autophagosomal clearance in muscle and fibroblasts from individuals with mutant EPG5, resulting in the accumulation of autophagic cargo in autophagosomes. These findings position Vici syndrome as a paradigm of human multisystem disorders associated with defective autophagy and suggest a fundamental role of the autophagy pathway in the immune system and the anatomical and functional formation of organs such as the brain and heart.","dc:creator":"Cullup T","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Recessive mutations in EPG5 cause Vici syndrome, a multisystem disorder with defective autophagy."}},{"id":"cggv:4346f909-9358-410e-926a-ac6092920316_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0da37376-b858-4922-9f64-0657b724a587"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222957"}],"rdfs:label":"Cullup et al.

We report genetic, clinical, neuroradiological, and neuropathological features of 50 children from 30 families, as well as the neuronal phenotype of EPG5 knock-down in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 39 different EPG5 mutations, most of them truncating and predicted to result in reduced EPG5 protein. Most mutations were private, but three recurrent mutations (p.Met2242Cysfs*5, p.Arg417*, and p.Gln336Arg) indicated possible founder effects. Presentation was mainly neonatal, with marked hypotonia and feeding difficulties. In addition to the five principal features (callosal agenesis, cataracts, hypopigmentation, cardiomyopathy, and immune dysfunction), we identified three equally consistent features (profound developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, and failure to thrive). The manifestation of all eight of these features has a specificity of 97%, and a sensitivity of 89% for the presence of an EPG5 mutation and will allow informed decisions about genetic testing. Clinical progression was relentless and many children died in infancy. Survival analysis demonstrated a median survival time of 24 months (95% confidence interval 0-49 months), with only a 10th of patients surviving to 5 years of age. Survival outcomes were significantly better in patients with compound heterozygous mutations (P = 0.046), as well as in patients with the recurrent p.Gln336Arg mutation. Acquired microcephaly and regression of skills in long-term survivors suggests a neurodegenerative component superimposed on the principal neurodevelopmental defect. Two-thirds of patients had a severe seizure disorder, placing EPG5 within the rapidly expanding group of genes associated with early-onset epileptic encephalopathies. Consistent neuroradiological features comprised structural abnormalities, in particular callosal agenesis and pontine hypoplasia, delayed myelination and, less frequently, thalamic signal intensity changes evolving over time. Typical muscle biopsy features included fibre size variability, central/internal nuclei, abnormal glycogen storage, presence of autophagic vacuoles and secondary mitochondrial abnormalities. Nerve biopsy performed in one case revealed subtotal absence of myelinated axons. Post-mortem examinations in three patients confirmed neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features and multisystem involvement. Finally, downregulation of epg5 (CG14299) in Drosophila resulted in autophagic abnormalities and progressive neurodegeneration. We conclude that EPG5-related Vici syndrome defines a novel group of neurodevelopmental disorders that should be considered in patients with suggestive features in whom mitochondrial, glycogen, or lysosomal storage disorders have been excluded. Neurological progression over time indicates an intriguing link between neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, also supported by neurodegenerative features in epg5-deficient Drosophila, and recent implication of other autophagy regulators in late-onset neurodegenerative disease.","dc:creator":"Byrne S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"EPG5-related Vici syndrome: a paradigm of neurodevelopmental disorders with defective autophagy."}},{"id":"cggv:f59f81e9-824e-47bf-bb21-d7507f388366_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0f37e7cd-629a-4675-a923-2aad0ae0d651"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26917586"}],"rdfs:label":"Byrne et al. 23.1"},{"id":"cggv:38b2c296-9a59-40d5-bfdb-4796c2112b91","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38b2c296-9a59-40d5-bfdb-4796c2112b91_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Variant has a groupmax filltering allele frequency of 0.000001240 based upon the European (Non-Finnish) population"},{"id":"cggv:f59f81e9-824e-47bf-bb21-d7507f388366","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f59f81e9-824e-47bf-bb21-d7507f388366_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ac0ddbfd-2197-4e27-b61f-c01573fee685_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac0ddbfd-2197-4e27-b61f-c01573fee685","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:755b5734-92c8-4384-9687-111da63f8aae","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020964.3(EPG5):c.1253-1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA402349797"}},{"id":"cggv:9e778fff-5f1b-4c13-a4cc-35bdbdf9dbc0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020964.3(EPG5):c.5110-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA402345963"}}],"detectionMethod":"Exome and Sanger sequence analysis in a cohort of 18 patients","phenotypeFreeText":"agenesis of the corpus callosum, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, again with left ventricular\nemphasis, hypopigmentation, immunodeficiency.

EPG5 also binds to LC3/LGG-1 (mammalian and C. elegans Atg8 homolog, respectively) and to assembled STX17-SNAP29 Qabc SNARE complexes on autophagosomes. EPG5 stabilizes and facilitates the assembly of STX17-SNAP29-VAMP7/8 trans-SNARE complexes, and promotes STX17-SNAP29-VAMP7-mediated fusion of reconstituted proteoliposomes. Loss of EPG5 activity causes abnormal fusion of autophagosomes with various endocytic vesicles, in part due to elevated assembly of STX17-SNAP25-VAMP8 complexes.

Epg5 deficiency blocks the maturation of autophagosomes into degradative autolysosomes, slows endocytic degradation and also impairs endocytic recycling.

This condition is characterized by central features of agenesis or thinning of corpus callosum, developmental delay/intellectual disability, comined immunodeficiency with signs of thymic aplasia/hypoplasia, cardiomyopathy, cataracts, and microcephaly. To date approximately 90 individuals have been reported with biallelic variants in *EPG5* (Dafsari, Gene reviews 2022). In this curation, 12 variants were scored including frameshift, missense, nonsense, and splice site variants across 7 probands from 4 publications (PMIDs:26395118, 23222957, 26917586, 344762) to reach a maximum score of genetic evidence. Heterozygous parents and siblings were unaffected. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by the biochemical function of EPG5 (PMID:27588602).EPG5 is a protein involved in autophagy, which facilitates fusion specificity of autophagosomes with late endosomes and lysosomes. Patient fibroblasts have been shown to have impaired autophagy. Multi-system effects may be due to disrupted autophagy function, which plays a crucial role in cell homeostasis through the recycling/ degredation of protein products/organelles and the role of autophagy pathways in immune system defense. Additionally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by knock out *EPG5* (-/-) mice (PMID: 23674064). *EPG5* knockout mice recapitulated the phenotypes of pathologic corpus callosum changes and myopathy, including an increase in centrally located nuclei. However, knock out *EPG5* mice grew to be sexually active adults and failed to recapitulate phenotypes such as facial dysmorphia, hypopigmentation, immunodeficiency phenotypes cataracts, and cardiac changes. Finally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by knock out *EPG5* zebrafish (PMID: 30806141). *EPG5*  (-/-) zebrafish displayed phenotypes such as cardiomyopathy, growth impairment, and perhaps most notably, defective autophagy pathway and features of myopathy. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
