The aim of this study was to further define the spectrum of TARDBP mutations in a large cohort of 666 Italian ALS patients (125 familial and 541 sporadic cases). The entire coding region was sequenced in 281 patients, while in the remaining 385 cases only exon 6 was sequenced. In 18 patients, of which six are familial, we identified 12 different heterozygous missense mutations (nine novel) all locating to exon 6, which were absent in 771 matched controls. The c.1144G>A (p.A382T) variation was observed in seven patients, thus representing the most frequent TARDBP mutation in ALS. Analysis of microsatellites surrounding the TARDBP gene indicated that p.A382T was inherited from a common ancestor in 5 of the 7 patients. Altogether, the frequency of TARDBP gene mutations appears to be particularly high in Italian ALS patients compared to individuals of mainly Northern European origin (2.7% vs. 1%). Western blot analysis of lymphocyte extracts from two patients carrying the p.A382T and p.S393L TARDBP mutations showed the presence of lower molecular weight TDP-43 bands, which were more abundant than observed in healthy controls and patients negative for TARDBP mutations. In conclusion, this report contributes to the demonstration of the causative role of the TARDBP gene in ALS pathogenesis and indicates that mutations may affect the stability of the protein even in nonneuronal tissues.","dc:creator":"Corrado L","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"High frequency of TARDBP gene mutations in Italian patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19224587","rdfs:label":"CB138"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Default score for SOP v8 = 0.1. \nAdditional evidence reported in same publication (PMID: 19224587) to support pathogenicity of TARDBP G335D mutant (however no modulation of score as all are in silico/prediction analyses): \n1.

The first pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 (TARDBP) were recently reported in familial and sporadic ALS patients, supporting a direct role for TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. In this study, we report the identification and functional analyses of two novel and one known mutation in TARDBP that we identified as a result of extensive mutation analyses in a cohort of 296 patients with variable neurodegenerative diseases associated with TDP-43 histopathology. Three different heterozygous missense mutations in exon 6 of TARDBP (p.M337V, p.N345K, and p.I383V) were identified in the analysis of 92 familial ALS patients (3.3%), while no mutations were detected in 24 patients with sporadic ALS or 180 patients with other TDP-43-positive neurodegenerative diseases. The presence of p.M337V, p.N345K, and p.I383V was excluded in 825 controls and 652 additional sporadic ALS patients. All three mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues in the C-terminal part of TDP-43 known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Biochemical analysis of TDP-43 in ALS patient cell lines revealed a substantial increase in caspase cleaved fragments, including the approximately 25 kDa fragment, compared to control cell lines. Our findings support TARDBP mutations as a cause of ALS. Based on the specific C-terminal location of the mutations and the accumulation of a smaller C-terminal fragment, we speculate that TARDBP mutations may cause a toxic gain of function through novel protein interactions or intracellular accumulation of TDP-43 fragments leading to apoptosis.","dc:creator":"Rutherford NJ","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Novel mutations in TARDBP (TDP-43) in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18802454","rdfs:label":"ND08308"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Default score for SOP v8 = 0.1. \nAdditional evidence reported in same publication (PMID:18802454) to support pathogenicity of TARDBP N345K mutant (however modulation of score only for functional studies, no modulation of score for in silico/prediction analyses and patient cell work):\n1.

Mutation analysis of TARDBP, the gene encoding TDP-43, was performed in cohorts of classic and FAV ALS patients. An analysis of mutation effects was performed in patient fibroblasts. Results showed that a novel heterozygous in-frame insertion/deletion (indel), c.1158_1159delAT; c.1158_1159insCACCAACC, was identified in a highly conserved region encoding the glycine-rich area of TDP-43 in a patient with FAV.

Under induced stress, indel-mutant fibroblasts showed a loss of normal nuclear TDP-43 immunoreactivity and formation of cytoplasmic inclusions of TDP-43, consistent with features seen in affected neurons. In conclusion, TARDBP missense mutations have previously been reported in classic ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

We screened 1220 probands with an ALS phenotype, referred originally for SOD1 molecular genetic analysis. 1128 SOD1-negative probands were screened for ANG, and 277 and 223 SOD1- and ANG-negative samples were screened for TARDBP and FUS, respectively.

ANG screening identified three mutations, including two novel mutations, and TARDBP screening identified two previously reported TARDBP mutations. We also identified four mutations in FUS, including the reported FUS in-frame deletion, c.430_447del, p.Gly144_Tyr149del, in a patient with inclusion body myositis, and two known FUS missense mutations. From this study, we estimate frequencies for SOD1, ANG, TARDBP and FUS mutations, in this United States cohort, to be 7.5%, 0.71%, 0.72% and 1.9%, respectively. In conclusion, we identify novel variants in SOD1, ANG, TARDBP and FUS, and expand the FUS-associated clinicopathologic phenotype.","dc:creator":"Brown JA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"SOD1, ANG, TARDBP and FUS mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a United States clinical testing lab experience."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22292843","rdfs:label":"Brown 2012 ALS case 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Default score for SOP v8 = 0.1. \nRecurrent variant, originally reported in PMID: 18372902."},{"id":"cggv:270a6c51-250a-4ddb-a17f-32a80874e2de_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a0313f3-d3d0-4340-8937-4ed0c5ae5352","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":61,"detectionMethod":"Mutational screening of the exon 4 and exon 6 of the gene TRADBP.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007078","obo:HP_0003445","obo:HP_0002878","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0007354","obo:HP_0002380","obo:HP_0003202"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Mutations in SOD1, ANG and VAPB were excluded.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:270a6c51-250a-4ddb-a17f-32a80874e2de_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c9f28744-f1e9-4124-94da-f93794d274bf"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20959352"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20959352","rdfs:label":"ALS1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Default score for SOP v8 = 0.1. \nRecurrent variant, originally reported in PMID: 19236453."},{"id":"cggv:4e9c6ea9-1cc5-4463-9fd8-2d674ff35e33_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a10e399-83be-4154-bdd8-f6f2da5623db","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":57,"detectionMethod":"The coding region of all five coding exons of TARDBP (accession number NM_007375) was sequenced in each patient plus at least 50bp into introns before and after each exon.

However, the role of cytoplasmic TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative TDP-43 proteinopathies remains unclear, due in part to a lack of valid mouse models. We therefore generated new mice with doxycycline (Dox)-suppressible expression of human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) harboring a defective nuclear localization signal (∆NLS) under the control of the neurofilament heavy chain promoter. Expression of hTDP-43∆NLS in these 'regulatable NLS' (rNLS) mice resulted in the accumulation of insoluble, phosphorylated cytoplasmic TDP-43 in brain and spinal cord, loss of endogenous nuclear mouse TDP-43 (mTDP-43), brain atrophy, muscle denervation, dramatic motor neuron loss, and progressive motor impairments leading to death. Notably, suppression of hTDP-43∆NLS expression by return of Dox to rNLS mice after disease onset caused a dramatic decrease in phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology, an increase in nuclear mTDP-43 to control levels, and the prevention of further motor neuron loss. rNLS mice back on Dox also showed a significant increase in muscle innervation, a rescue of motor impairments, and a dramatic extension of lifespan. Thus, the rNLS mice are new TDP-43 mouse models that delineate the timeline of pathology development, muscle denervation and neuron loss in ALS/FTLD-TDP.

Following the discovery of the TDP-43 protein as the principle component of ALS hallmark ubiquitinated protein inclusions within affected motor neurons (Neumann M, et al, 2006, PMID:17023659 and Arai T, et al 2006, PMID: 17084815), the authors investigated the TARDBP gene endoding this TDP-43 protein as a candidate gene in a cohort of index cases with familial ALS. Screening of TRADBP in this cohort identified missense mutation in a Caucasian family segregating with disease in a total of five affected family members across two generations. Genome-wide SNP-based linkage analysis including a total of 23 family members  identified linkage to 1p36 with a parametric multipoint LOD score of 2.04. Fine mapping confirmed linkage with a maximal two-point LOD score of 2.73 at D1S450 and a highly significant multipoint lod score of 2.93. Extended cohort screening further identified a further two TARDBP missense mutations, each identified in a single sporadic ALS case.\nALS is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons in the brain and lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord, resulting in fatal paralysis. TARDBP encodes the TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and while the exact function of thise RNA/DNA protein is unknown, it is known to play roles in transcriptional repression and alternative splicing (PMID: 11470789). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. More than 60 mutations in TARDBP have been implicated in ALS, including single point mutations and small insertion/deletions, with the majority of these mutations falling in the final exon 6 of this gene (reviewed in PMID: 30837838, literature search in PMID: 32409511). A number of TDP-43 related phenotypes are reported among ALS patients, including its aggregation into protein inclusions, depletion in the nucleus and mislocalisation to the cytoplasm and sequestration into stress granules (reviewed in PMID: 30837838). Experimentally, this disease-gene relationship is also supported by a number of animal models that recapitulate various ALS related phenotypes. More genetic and experimental evidence is available in the literature, however the maximum score of 18pts has been reached. In summary TARDBP is definitively associated with autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 10. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nAs per SOPv8 a maximum 12 points scored for \"Proband with other variant type with some evidence of gene impact\" are considered applicable to the overall genetic evidence total, therefore from the 13.2 points collated, 12 points will be applied in this category, raising the genetic evidence total from 8.5pt to maximum 12pt and the total points increase from 14.5pt to 18pt.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bf8bf781-25c9-4f16-b8cc-b0533390e4e2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
