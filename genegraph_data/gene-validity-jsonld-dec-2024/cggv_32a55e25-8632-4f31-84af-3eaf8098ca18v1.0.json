Inherited deficiency of PCC due to mutations in either the PCCA or the PCCB gene results in propionic acidemia (PA), a clinically heterogeneous disorder with a severe, often lethal, neonatal form, and a mild, later onset form. To characterize PCCA gene mutations responsible for PCC deficiency, we analyzed RT-PCR products obtained from cultured fibroblasts from Spanish PCC-alpha deficient patients. In three patients, smaller than normal PCR products were observed, and sequence analysis revealed the deletion of a 54-bp exon in the cDNA. Sequencing of genomic DNA from these three patients led to the identification of three novel mutations in the PCCA gene, two short deletions and one small insertion, adjacent to short direct repeats, and all of them affecting the consensus splice sites of the skipped exon. These mutations, 1771IVS-2del9, 1824IVS+3del4, and 1824IVS+3insCT, are the cause of the aberrant splicing of the PCCA pre-mRNA and result in an in-frame deletion of 54 nucleotides in the cDNA, probably leading to an unstable protein structure which is responsible for the lack of activity leading to PCC deficiency in these patients.","dc:creator":"Richard E","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Three novel splice mutations in the PCCA gene causing identical exon skipping in propionic acidemia patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9385377","rdfs:label":"MSO"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for an intronic deletion, beginning at +3 in intron 21.

It is well established that PCC is a 750 kDa heterododecamer composed of 6 alpha subunit (encoded by PCCA) and 6 beta subunits (encoded by PCCB) (for review, see Wongkittichote et al. 2017; PMID 29033250). In this study, the crystal structure of a bacterial PCC holoenzyme and  cryo-electron microscopy of human PCC revealed that the alpha subunits are arranged as monomers in the holoenzyme, decorating a central beta-6 hexamer.

Deficiencies in PCC activity in humans are linked to the disease propionic acidaemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that can be fatal in infants. The holoenzyme of PCC is an alpha(6)beta(6) dodecamer, with a molecular mass of 750 kDa. The alpha-subunit contains the biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains, whereas the beta-subunit supplies the carboxyltransferase (CT) activity. Here we report the crystal structure at 3.2-A resolution of a bacterial PCC alpha(6)beta(6) holoenzyme as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction at 15-A resolution demonstrating a similar structure for human PCC. The structure defines the overall architecture of PCC and reveals unexpectedly that the alpha-subunits are arranged as monomers in the holoenzyme, decorating a central beta(6) hexamer. A hitherto unrecognized domain in the alpha-subunit, formed by residues between the BC and BCCP domains, is crucial for interactions with the beta-subunit. We have named it the BT domain. The structure reveals for the first time the relative positions of the BC and CT active sites in the holoenzyme. They are separated by approximately 55 A, indicating that the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis. The BCCP domain is located in the active site of the beta-subunit in the current structure, providing insight for its involvement in the CT reaction. The structural information establishes a molecular basis for understanding the large collection of disease-causing mutations in PCC and is relevant for the holoenzymes of other biotin-dependent carboxylases, including 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) and eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).","dc:creator":"Huang CS","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Crystal structure of the alpha(6)beta(6) holoenzyme of propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase."},"rdfs:label":"Crystal structure of PCC"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"It is well-established that PCCA and PCCB encode subunits of propionyl CoA carboxylase (PCC).

Each mutant strain incorporated negligible amounts of radioactivity compared to control strains.

Seven mutant strains were fused in all pairwise combinations and examined for increased 14C-propionate incorporation in heterokaryons. Two main complementation groups were revealed. One group was composed of three mutants. The other was a complex group composed of four mutants in which intragroup complementation was demonstrated. Two mutants showing excellent complementation by radioautography were examined for complementation by the direct assay of PCC ACTIVITY. The enzyme activity of virus-treated preparations with 23% multinucleate cells was 183 U (pmol/min/mg protein) compared to 16 U for the untreated mixture (normal range 450-850 u).

An AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) vector was engineered to express the human PCCA cDNA and delivered to newborn mice via an intrahepatic injection. Greater than 64% of the Pcca(-/-) mice were rescued after AAV8-mediated gene transfer and survived until day of life 16 or beyond. Western analysis of liver extracts showed that PCC was completely absent from Pcca(-/-) mice but was restored to greater than wild-type levels after AAV gene therapy. The treated Pcca(-/-) mice also exhibited markedly reduced plasma levels of 2-methylcitrate compared with the untreated Pcca(-/-) mice, which indicates significant PCC enzymatic activity was provided by gene transfer. At the time of this report, the oldest treated Pcca(-/-) mice are over 6 months of age. In summary, AAV gene delivery of PCCA effectively rescues Pcca(-/-) mice from neonatal lethality and substantially ameliorates metabolic markers of the disease.

PCCA encodes the alpha subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). PCC is composed of 6 alpha-subunit and 6 beta-subunits. The beta subunit is encoded by PCCB. PCC, a mitochondrial biotin-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA, which is produced by the catabolism of cholesterol, valine, odd chain fatty acids, methionine, isoleucine and threonine, to methylmalonyl-CoA. Variants in PCCA were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1996 (Campeau et al, Am J Hum Genet 59 (suppl 59): A1448; Richard et al, 1997, PMID 9385377). At least 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 4 publications (Richard et al, 1997, PMID 9385377; Yang et al, 2004, PMID 15059621; Vatanavicharn et al, 2014, PMID 24464666; Gupta et al, 2016, PMID 27227689). Many more patients have been reported in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of PCCA as a subunit of PCC (see Wongkittichote et al, 2017, PMID 29033250 for review), the finding that variants in the gene encoding the beta subunit of PCC (PCCB) cause propionic acidemia, genetic complementation studies (Gravel et al, 1997, PMID 195466), a null mouse model which recapitulates the biochemical features of propionic acidemia, and rescue of the phenotype in the null mouse model by a Pcca transgene (Miyazaki et al, 2001; PMID 11461925) and  AAV8 Pcca gene transfer (Chandler et al, 2011; PMID 20950151). In summary, PCCA is definitively associated with propionic acidemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:32a55e25-8632-4f31-84af-3eaf8098ca18"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
