We describe two probands: one with a de novo frameshift (NM_002140.3: c.953+1dup), and the other with a de novo splice donor site variant (NM_002140.3: c.257G>A). Both probands have intellectual disability, a shared unique craniofacial phenotype, and connective tissue and skeletal abnormalities. The identification of this syndrome was made possible by a new online tool, GeneMatcher, which facilitates connections between clinicians and researchers based on shared interest in candidate genes. This report demonstrates that new Web-based approaches can be effective in helping investigators solve exome sequencing projects, and also highlights the newer paradigm of \"reverse phenotyping,\" where characterization of syndromic features follows the identification of genetic variants.","dc:creator":"Au PY","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"GeneMatcher aids in the identification of a new malformation syndrome with intellectual disability, unique facial dysmorphisms, and skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities caused by de novo variants in HNRNPK."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1adc74c-9bbc-48fc-bbbf-1159c0944108_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1adc74c-9bbc-48fc-bbbf-1159c0944108_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e6ae236-33f4-4140-9afc-85a456b605c5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:895cead3-6d83-42f5-8600-cc2903d1bb06","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"As the phenotype involves skeletal abnormalities, including craniosynostosis, this may be relevant.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26638989","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Osteoclast differentiation is a complex and finely regulated physiological process that involves a variety of signaling pathways and factors. Recent studies suggested that the Ser9 phosphorylation of Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is required for the osteoclast differentiation. However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. We have previously identified the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) as a putative GSK3β interactor. In the present study, we demonstrate that, during the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, the PI3K/Akt-mediated Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β provokes the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNPK in an ERK-dependent manner, enhancing the cytoplasmic co-localization and interaction of GSK3β and hnRNPK. We show that hnRNPK is essential for the osteoclast differentiation, and is involved in several reported functions of GSK3β, including the activation of NF-κB, the expression of NFATc1, and the acetylation of tubulin, all known to be critical for osteoclast differentiation and functions. We find that hnRNPK is localized in the actin belt, and is important for the mature osteoclast formation. Taken together, we demonstrate here the critical role of hnRNPK in osteoclast differentiation, and depict a model in which the cytoplasmic hnRNPK interacts with GSK3β and regulates its function.","dc:creator":"Fan X","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Cytoplasmic hnRNPK interacts with GSK3β and is essential for the osteoclast differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Fan 2015 Function 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f1adc74c-9bbc-48fc-bbbf-1159c0944108_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6781,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":12.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b7ee4cbb-3011-4d6a-b8c5-97d4a2b028c4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018681","gene":"hgnc:5044","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.5","dc:description":"*HNRNPK* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder-craniofacial dysmorphism-cardiac defect-hip dysplasia syndrome (Au-Kline syndrome) in 2015 (Au et al., PMID: 26173930). Au-Kline syndrome (AKS) is caused by de novo variants in *HNRNPK*, leading to variable dysmorphic features, cardiac malformations, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Multiple patients diagnosed with AKS were initially diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome. Ten variants (all *de novo* loss of function caused by missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice variants) that have been reported in 10 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 26173930, 26954065, 28374925, 28771707, 29904177) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of *HNRNPK* in osteoclast differentiation as the phenotype involves skeletal abnormalities, including craniosynostosis (PMID: 26638989). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *HNRNPK* and autosomal dominant Au-Kline syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the General Gene Curation Expert Panel GCEP in 2016. It was reevaluated by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 20, 2021. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of new literature (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f1adc74c-9bbc-48fc-bbbf-1159c0944108"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
