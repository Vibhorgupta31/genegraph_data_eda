The mouse cripto gene is expressed at low level in specific organs of the adult animal such as spleen, heart, lung and brain. In situ hybridization analysis during murine embryogenesis (day 6.2 to day 10.5) reveals a very restricted expression pattern. cripto transcripts are first detected in a few epiblastic cells at day 6.5. During gastrulation, the transcripts are expressed in the forming mesoderm and later during development cripto gene expression is restricted to the truncus arteriosus of the developing heart. This expression pattern suggests a role for cripto gene in the determination of the epiblastic cells that subsequently give rise to the mesoderm.","dc:creator":"Dono R","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"The murine cripto gene: expression during mesoderm induction and early heart morphogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Expression evidence, mouse embryos "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:88e70c46-b6ff-4a94-9d21-b6746d96453f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:35ffefab-7f6a-4fc3-ad23-78d53a2c3534","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"NKX2-5 performs direct transcriptional activation of TDGF1.

Patients with CHD that survive the neonatal period often progress to develop advanced heart failure requiring specialized treatment including cardiac transplantation. A full understanding of the transcriptional networks that direct cardiac progenitors during heart development will enhance our understanding of both normal cardiac function and pathological states. These findings will also have important applications for emerging therapies and the treatment of congenital heart disease. Furthermore, a number of shared transcriptional pathways or networks have been proposed to regulate the development and regeneration of tissues such as the heart. We have utilized transgenic technology to isolate and characterize cardiac progenitor cells from the developing mouse heart and have begun to define specific transcriptional networks of cardiovascular development.

However, only 2 (missense, large deletion) were scored as the other variants were too frequent in population databases. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence, interaction evidence; PMIDs: 7916676, 24069547). In a luciferase assay, the gene interacted with NKX2-5, which has been classified as definitive for congenital, conduction, and myopathic heart disease. Analysis in mouse embryos showed early expression of* CRIPTO* in the truncus arteriosus. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on 6/10/2024 (SOP Version 10).\nPlease note that the score for genetic evidence should be 0.6, as there was a large deletion scored at 0.5 that the Gene Curation Interface would not allow me to enter.
