The clinical features of TAP deficiency include a chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract and/or granulomatous skin lesions. In this report, we describe two adult siblings with an HLA class I deficiency. One individual had only spontaneously-healing skin granulomatous lesions, while the second did not display any of the symptoms associated with HLA class I deficiency and could be considered to be healthy. We show that the patients display a homozygous TAP2 mutation which blocks the maturation of HLA class I molecules. Cell surface expression of these molecules is strongly reduced, but three times higher than on cells from other previously described TAP-deficient individuals. This higher expression results, at least in part, from the presence of HLA-B7 molecules which are probably empty of peptide. The numbers of CD8+ alphabeta T cells are almost normal in these patients. The anti-EBV T-cell response of one patient is mediated by HLA-B7 restricted CD8+ alphabeta T lymphocytes recognizing the BMRF1 nuclear EBV antigen, demonstrating that CD8+ alphabeta T cells can participate in anti-viral responses. This study shows that TAP deficiency can remain totally asymptomatic for several decades, and suggests that in some cases, TAP-independent immune responses provide efficient protection from most of the common intracellular pathogens.","dc:creator":"de la Salle H","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Asymptomatic deficiency in the peptide transporter associated to antigen processing (TAP)."}},"rdfs:label":"de la Salle 2002 Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:d60cd381-95ec-48dd-9858-87275dcc18dd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d60cd381-95ec-48dd-9858-87275dcc18dd_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d60cd381-95ec-48dd-9858-87275dcc18dd_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"c.1636-1G>A is a rare variant absent in gnomAD and is expected to result in NMD."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"c.1636-1G>A is a rare variant absent in gnomAD and is expected to result in NMD.

This condition is characterized by chronic bacterial infections and/or cutaneous granulomatous lesions. Bacterial infections may impact the upper and lower respiratory tract, causing sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, and bronchiectasis. Some individuals are asymptomatic. (PMID: 12067308, 36227411) The immunophenotype of TAP2-related MHC class I deficiency has been reported as normal total CD8+ T cell counts but decreased naïve CD8+ T cell counts and increased alpha-beta T cells. (PMID: 36227411) Heterozygous carriers are apparently unaffected. (PMID: 10560675, 12067308, 36227411) Six variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) that have been reported in six probands in six publications (PMIDs: 7517574, 10560675, 12067308, 23662797, 20083708, 36227411) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by protein interaction, functional alteration in patient cells, a rescue study, and mouse models. (PMIDs: 9651323, 10560675, 19721454, 27861817, 7517574) The TAP complex is made up of TAP1 and TAP2. (PMID: 9651323) We have previously established TAP1 as definitively associated with MHC class I deficiency. TAP2 deficient patient cells have deficient MHC class I surface expression (PMID: 7517574), and expression of wild-type TAP2 in patient cells restores that expression (PMID: 10560675) Animal models also recapitulate the phenotype seen in humans with absent MHC class I expression. (PMID: 19721454, 27861817)\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TAP2 and autosomal recessive MHC class I deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date October 19, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d34f7639-eb52-4a29-90e0-27dbdaeec334"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
