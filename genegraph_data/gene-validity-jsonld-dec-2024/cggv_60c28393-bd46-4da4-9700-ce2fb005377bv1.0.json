A questionable association between HYKK and hydroxylysinuria is listed in the International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (Ferreira et al, 2021, PMID: 33340416). Four probands with intellectual disability and hydroxylysinuria and/or hydroxylysinemia have been reported (Benson et al, 1969, PMID: 5765982; Parker et al, 1970, PMID: 4192000; Hoefnagel and Pomeroy, 1970, PMID: 4194840; Goodman et al, 1972, PMID: 5048993). While a deficiency of AGPHD1 has been hypothesized (Goodman et al, 1972, PMID: 5048993), to our knowledge, this has not been substantiated by experimental evidence. No reports describing individuals with pathogenic variants in HYKK and hydroxylysinuria and/or hydroxylysinemia were identified. However, individuals with biallelic variants in the gene that encode the next enzyme in the pathway, AGXT2L2, which breaks down phosphohydroxylysine have been reported (Veiga-da-Cunha et al, 2013, PMID: 23242558).\nSupport for a potential gene-disease relationship between HYKK and hydroxylysinuria or hydrixylysinemia comes from the biochemical function of AGPHD1 which, as mentioned, catalyzes the GTP-dependent phosphorylation of 5-hydroxy-L-lysine (Veiga-da-Cunha et al, 2012, PMID: 22241472).  In summary, at the current time, there is insufficient genetic evidence to support a gene-disease relationship between HYKK and hydroxylysinuria or hydrixylysinemia. A classification of No Known Disease Relationship was approved by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on July 14, 2023 (SOP v9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:60c28393-bd46-4da4-9700-ce2fb005377b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
