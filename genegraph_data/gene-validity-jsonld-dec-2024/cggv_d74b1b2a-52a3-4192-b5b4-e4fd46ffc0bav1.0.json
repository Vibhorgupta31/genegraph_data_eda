In HEK-293 cells, the transport of the mutant D293N mouse CTSD to the lysosome was delayed and associated with a low secretion rate compared with wild-type CTSD.

Consequently, CTSD deficiency leads to a strong impairment of the lysosomal-autophagy machinery. In mice and humans CTSD dysfunction underlies the congenital variant (CLN10) of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). NCLs are distinct lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) sharing various hallmarks, namely accumulation of protein aggregates and ceroid lipofuscin leading to neurodegeneration and blindness. The most established and clinically approved approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) aiming to replace the defective hydrolase with an exogenously applied recombinant protein. Here we reveal that recombinant human pro-CTSD produced in a mammalian expression system can be efficiently taken up by a variety of cell models, is correctly targeted to lysosomes and processed to the active mature form of the protease. In proof-of-principle experiments we provide evidence that recombinant human CTSD (rhCTSD) can improve the biochemical phenotype of CTSD-deficient hippocampal slice cultures in vitro and retinal cells in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dosing of rhCTSD in the murine CLN10 model leads to a correction of lysosomal hypertrophy, storage accumulation and impaired autophagic flux in the viscera and central nervous system (CNS). We establish that direct delivery of the recombinant protease to the CNS is required for improvement of neuropathology and lifespan extension. Together these data support the continuation of the pre-clinical studies for the application of rhCTSD in the treatment of NCL.Abbreviations: AIF1/IBA1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; BBB: blood brain barrier; CNS: central nervous system; CTSB: cathepsin B; CTSD: cathepsin D; CTSL: cathepsin L; ERT: enzyme replacement therapy; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; INL: inner nuclear layer; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LRP1: low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; LSD: lysosomal storage disorder; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; M6P: mannose 6-phosphate; mCTSD: mature CTSD; NCL: neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; ONL: outer nuclear layer; PB: phosphate buffer; proCTSD: pro-cathepsin D; LRPAP1: low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1; rhCTSD: human recombinant CTSD; SAPC: saposin C; SAPD: saposin D; ATP5G1: ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit C1 (subunit 9); SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TPP1: tripeptidyl peptidase I.","dc:creator":"Marques ARA","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant pro-CTSD (cathepsin D) corrects defective proteolysis and autophagy in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue in Null Mouse using Recombinant Human CTSD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:93407fc7-cc9c-430e-b9d2-3f47b2274bc3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:afb6e12a-38f8-470b-8105-f19e0804c4be","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"CD -/- studied.

By electron microscopy, autophagosome/autolysosome-like bodies containing part of the cytoplasm, granular osmiophilic deposits, and fingerprint profiles were demonstrated in the neuronal perikarya of CD-/- mouse brains after P20. Autophagosomes and granular osmiophilic deposits were detected in neurons at P0 but were few in number, whereas they increased in the neuronal perikarya within days after birth. Some large-sized neurons having autophagosome/autolysosome-like bodies in the perikarya appeared in the CNS tissues, especially in the thalamic region and the cerebral cortex, at P17. These lysosomal bodies occupied the perikarya of almost all neurons in CD-/- mouse brains obtained from P23 until the terminal stage. Because these neurons exhibited autofluorescence, it was considered that ceroid lipofuscin may accumulate in lysosomal structures of CD-/- neurons. Subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase was found to accumulate in the lysosomes of neurons, although the activity of tripeptidyl peptidase-I significantly increased in the brain. Moreover, neurons near the terminal stage were often shrunken and possessed irregular nuclei through which small dense chromatin masses were scattered.

Electron microscopy revealed that the inclusions had coarsely granular matrices surrounding well-delineated spherical structures and that the inclusions near the retinal outer limiting membranes were within photoreceptor cells, mostly cones. Affected American Bulldogs were homozygous for the A allele of a G to A transition in the cathepsin D gene (CTSD), which predicts the conversion of methionine-199 to an isoleucine.

Transmission analysis in a 99 dog pedigree of American Bulldogs indicated a probability of less than 10(-7) that alleles from any mutation unlinked to CTSD would be concordant with the pedigree and phenotypes of the dogs.

Four main clinical subtypes have been described based on the age at presentation: infantile, late infantile, juvenile and adult types. In addition, rare congenital cases of NCL have been reported in the literature. Previously, a homozygous mutation in the cathepsin D gene has been shown to cause congenital NCL in a patient of Pakistani origin. We report a case of a 39-week estimated gestational age female infant with severe microcephaly and hypertonia, whereas MRI showed generalized hypoplasia of the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. The infant died on day two after birth. Postmortem examination revealed a small, firm brain with extensive neuronal loss and gliosis. Remaining neurons, astrocytes and macrophages contained PAS-positive storage material with granular ultrastructure and immunoreactivity against sphingolipid activator protein D. A diagnosis of congenital NCL was rendered with a novel mutation, c.299C > T (p.Ser100Phe) in exon 3 of the cathepsin D gene. In the patient fibroblasts, cathepsin D activity was marginal, but the protein appeared stable and normally processed. This was confirmed in overexpression studies. Importantly, by identification of the mutation in the family, we were able to confirm the first prenatal diagnosis excluding cathepsin D deficiency in the younger sibling of the patient.","dc:creator":"Fritchie K","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Novel mutation and the first prenatal screening of cathepsin D deficiency (CLN10)."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18762956","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:9ec4e77c-1875-451c-8e68-7e5b13112b12_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:249d86b4-8708-4233-9c3e-528983de9fd8","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"microcephaly, intractable neonatal seizures, spasticity and apnea","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:9ec4e77c-1875-451c-8e68-7e5b13112b12_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f0044c29-057d-4334-bb64-52a930b32955","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001909.5(CTSD):c.764dup (p.Tyr255Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA258043"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16670177","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a devastating inherited neurodegenerative disorder of unknown metabolic basis. Eight patients with this rare disorder, all with similar clinical and neuropathological findings, have been reported, and here we describe two further patients. Previously, we showed that a mutation in the cathepsin D gene causes congenital NCL in sheep. On the basis of the neuropathological and ultrastructural similarities between the sheep and patients affected with congenital NCL, we screened the cathepsin D gene for mutations in a patient of Pakistani origin. We identified a nucleotide duplication, c.764dupA, in the cathepsin D gene in homozygous form in the patient, and in heterozygous form in his father. This duplication is likely to be disease-causing, as it creates a premature stop codon, predicting a truncation of the protein. When transiently expressed in cell cultures, the mutant protein was enzymatically inactive, but stable. In paraffin-embedded brain tissue samples of two affected siblings of the Pakistani patient, cathepsin D was absent, suggesting rapid degradation of the c.764dupA mutant cathepsin D at mRNA or protein level in vivo. Further, we were able to confirm lack of cathepsin D in the brain tissue of yet another, unrelated, patient of English origin with congenital NCL. On the basis of the present data, and the nearly identical clinical and/or pathological phenotype of the other reported cases of congenital NCL, it is reasonable to suggest that cathepsin D deficiency caused by mutations in the corresponding gene may underlie all cases of congenital NCL. The present observations also suggest that cathepsin D deficiency should be considered as a possible diagnosis in microcephalic neonates, who present with seizures at or before birth.","dc:creator":"Siintola E","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Cathepsin D deficiency underlies congenital human neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16670177","rdfs:label":"Patient 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:3b8e5875-4cab-44af-8bb9-aec998aeefd0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a56ba525-e682-4f97-861b-2b496be21c82","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3b8e5875-4cab-44af-8bb9-aec998aeefd0_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:d624a931-8e06-4e63-bbe0-5dc5206b89c5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001909.5(CTSD):c.268dup (p.Gln90fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5814243"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26059544","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) is characterized by a combination of retinopathy, dementia, and epilepsy.

Biallelic pathogenic variants in CTSD are causative of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, type 10 (NCL10).  NCL10 is characterized by acquired microcephaly, developmental regression, seizures, ataxia, cardiomyopathy and retinitis pigmentosa.  Onset of symptoms can range from the prenatal period to the second decade and affected individuals demonstrate cerebral and cerebellar atrophy on MRI, significantly reduced cathepsin D enzyme activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts and the characteristic autofluorescent storage bodies in a variety of cell types.  The disease mechanism is loss of function and CTSD mutations result in a significantly reduced cathepsin D, a lysosomal aspartyl proteinase essential to neuronal cell homeostasis. Over 10 different disease-causing mutations reported in families in the literature, the majority of which are homozygous variants identified in consanguineous families.  The mutation spectrum includes nonsense, frameshift, and missense variants (Doccini et al, PMID 27072142;  Steinfeld et al, PMID 16685649;  Thottath et al, PMID 31086824;  Hersheson et al, PMID 25298308;  Fokstuen et al, PMID 27353043;  Varvagiannis et al, PMID 29284168;  Meyer et al, PMID 26059544;  Komlosi et al, PMID 29373990;  Sintola et al, PMID 16670177;  Seidahmed et al, PMID 23101555;  Alazami et al, PMID 25558065; Shaheen et al, PMID 30214071;  Fritchie et al, PMID 18762956;  Santorelli et al, PMID 23374165).  Missense variant point assignment was upgraded due to functional data and/or the presence of the variant in individuals with proven reduced cathepsin D enzyme activity.  Additionally, a number of reported families demonstrate complete co-segregation in affected and unaffected individuals.  Supporting experimental evidence includes functional alteration in non-patient cells (Paranen et al, PMID 12350228),  expression (Reid et al, 3543065),  non-human model organism (Tyynela et al, 10856224 ;  Koike et al, 10995834 ; Awano et al, 16386934), and rescue in non-human model organism (Marques et al, 31282275).   A genetic evidence score of 12 and experimental evidence score of 5 results in a total score of 17.  Evidence supporting an association between CTSD and NCL has been replicated over time; therefore, the gene-disease validity has been classified as DEFINITIVE.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d74b1b2a-52a3-4192-b5b4-e4fd46ffc0ba"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
