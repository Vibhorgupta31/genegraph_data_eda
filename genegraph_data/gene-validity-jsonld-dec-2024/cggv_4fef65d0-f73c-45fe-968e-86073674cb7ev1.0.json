Between 30% and 70% of syndromic craniosynostoses are caused by mutations in hotspots in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes or in the TWIST1 gene with the difference in detection rates likely to be related to different study populations within craniofacial centers. Here we present results from molecular testing of an Australia and New Zealand cohort of 630 individuals with a diagnosis of craniosynostosis. Data were obtained by Sanger sequencing of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 hotspot exons and the TWIST1 gene, as well as copy number detection of TWIST1. Of the 630 probands, there were 231 who had one of 80 distinct mutations (36%). Among the 80 mutations, 17 novel sequence variants were detected in three of the four genes screened. In addition to the proband cohort there were 96 individuals who underwent predictive or prenatal testing as part of family studies. Dysmorphic features consistent with the known FGFR1-3/TWIST1-associated syndromes were predictive for mutation detection. We also show a statistically significant association between splice site mutations in FGFR2 and a clinical diagnosis of Pfeiffer syndrome, more severe clinical phenotypes associated with FGFR2 exon 10 versus exon 8 mutations, and more frequent surgical procedures in the presence of a pathogenic mutation. Targeting gene hot spot areas for mutation analysis is a useful strategy to maximize the success of molecular diagnosis for individuals with craniosynostosis.","dc:creator":"Roscioli T","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Genotype and clinical care correlations in craniosynostosis: findings from a cohort of 630 Australian and New Zealand patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24127277","rdfs:label":"Roscioli FGFR1-PS Individual 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"No patient specific phenotypes, no functional or radiographic evidence of variant impact."},{"id":"cggv:d90d47ed-6723-4521-9138-2ba52fda047d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9dba3461-37db-4aa1-8cf6-c5fb797896b0","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"SSCP/linkage analysis of initial family 13 to identify variant locus, with PCR to identify variant in affected/unaffected individuals of other families.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:d90d47ed-6723-4521-9138-2ba52fda047d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:608a8b26-aab2-4b87-bbba-1b0f94a34369"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7874169"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7874169","rdfs:label":"Muenke Family 15 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Confidence in pathogenicity of variant and clinical diagnosis of patient used to upgrade case.

The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene. A specific, rare mutation p.Pro252Arg, located between the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain of FGFR1, is associated with mild clinical signs. We report on a three-generation family with five members having a heterozygous FGFR1 p.Pro252Arg mutation. Phenotypic features within the family showed high variability from the apparently normal skull and limbs to the characteristic brachycephaly and digital anomalies. The typical features of Pfeiffer syndrome appeared only in the third generation allowing us to unveil the syndrome in several further family members in two previous generations.

Here, we characterize the effects of proline-->arginine mutations in FGFR1c and FGFR3c on ligand binding using surface plasmon resonance and X-ray crystallography. Both Pro252Arg FGFR1c and Pro250Arg FGFR3c exhibit an enhancement in ligand binding in comparison to their respective wild-type receptors. Interestingly, binding of both mutant receptors to FGF9 was notably enhanced and implicates FGF9 as a potential pathophysiological ligand for mutant FGFRs in mediating craniosynostosis. The crystal structure, of Pro252Arg FGFR1c in complex with FGF2, demonstrates that the enhanced ligand binding is due to an additional set of receptor-ligand hydrogen bonds, similar to those gain-of-function interactions that occur in the Apert syndrome Pro253Arg FGFR2c-FGF2 crystal structure. However, unlike the Apert syndrome Pro253Arg FGFR2c mutant, neither the Pfeiffer syndrome Pro250Arg FGFR1c mutant nor the Muenke syndrome Pro250Arg FGFR3c mutant bound appreciably to FGF7 or FGF10. This observation provides a potential explanation for why the limb phenotypes, observed in type I Pfeiffer and Muenke syndromes, are less severe than the limb abnormalities observed in Apert syndrome. Hence, although analogous proline-->arginine mutations in FGFR1-3 act through a common structural mechanism to result in gain-of-function, differences in the primary sequence among FGFRs result in varying effects on ligand binding specificity.","dc:creator":"Ibrahimi OA","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Proline to arginine mutations in FGF receptors 1 and 3 result in Pfeiffer and Muenke craniosynostosis syndromes through enhancement of FGF binding affinity."},"rdfs:label":"Ibrahimi FGF binding study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4fef65d0-f73c-45fe-968e-86073674cb7e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d129047-922f-4ad5-84ef-38fa9542fa61","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc47be3f-7883-4abf-917f-d6ca3cf99c87","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Detailed analysis of facial bones in mutant mice recapitulating midface hypoplasia in human patients.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21538817","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Apert and Pfeiffer syndromes are hereditary forms of craniosynostosis characterized by midfacial hypoplasia and malformations of the limbs and skull.

Analysis of the posterior and anterior frontal, sagittal and coronal sutures of early post-natal mutant mice revealed premature fusion. The sutures of mutant mice had accelerated osteoblast proliferation and increased expression of genes related to osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that bone formation at the sutures is locally increased in Pfeiffer syndrome. Of note, dramatically increased expression of core-binding transcription factor alpha subunit type 1 (Cbfa1) accompanied premature fusion, suggesting that Cbfa1 may be a downstream target of Fgf/Fgfr1 signals. This was confirmed in vitro, where we demonstrate that transfection with wild-type or mutant Fgfr1 induces Cbfa1 expression. The induced expression was also observed using Fgf ligands (Fgf2 and Fgf8).

One missense variant in FGFR1 is associated with PS1, and has been reported in at least 16 probands from 8 publications (PMIDs: 10861678, 14564217, 7874169, 16957473, 25251565, 24127277, 23348274, 24776567).
