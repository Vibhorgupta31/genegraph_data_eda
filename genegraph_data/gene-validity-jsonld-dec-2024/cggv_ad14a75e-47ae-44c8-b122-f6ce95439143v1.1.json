Here, we report on mutations in two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that are associated with ID in two unrelated Iranian families. In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.514G>A, p.Asp172Asn) in the cytoplasmic seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS) gene. The mutation affects the enzymatic core domain of the protein and impairs its enzymatic activity, probably leading to reduced cytoplasmic tRNASer concentrations. The mutant protein was predicted to be unstable, which could be substantiated by investigating ectopic mutant SARS in transfected HEK293T cells. In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p.Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T>G, p.Trp13Gly). The latter affects the mitochondrial localization signal of WARS2, causing protein mislocalization. Including AIMP1, which we have recently implicated in the etiology of ID, three genes with a role in tRNA-aminoacylation are now associated with this condition. We therefore suggest that the functional integrity of tRNAs in general is an important factor in the development and maintenance of human cognitive functions.","dc:creator":"Musante L","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations of the aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases SARS and WARS2 are implicated in the etiology of autosomal recessive intellectual disability."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad14a75e-47ae-44c8-b122-f6ce95439143_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:ad14a75e-47ae-44c8-b122-f6ce95439143_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad14a75e-47ae-44c8-b122-f6ce95439143_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ad14a75e-47ae-44c8-b122-f6ce95439143_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.2},{"id":"cggv:ee4284c4-e39b-458d-8828-8e9f77b82a0c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee4284c4-e39b-458d-8828-8e9f77b82a0c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:78e1db52-ff56-4a43-b429-1b578c69ffae","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006513.4(SARS1):c.638G>T (p.Arg213Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341506120"}},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:94e35a83-b397-41c1-ad13-ddbe345a0de0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:78e1db52-ff56-4a43-b429-1b578c69ffae"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34570399","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are ubiquitously expressed enzymes responsible for ligating amino acids to their cognate tRNA molecules through an aminoacylation reaction.

ARSs have been implicated in autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive human disorders. Autosomal dominant variants in tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (WARS1) are known to cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, but a recessively inherited phenotype is yet to be clearly defined. Seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 (SARS1) has rarely been implicated in an autosomal recessive developmental disorder. Here, we report five individuals with biallelic missense variants in WARS1 or SARS1, who presented with an overlapping phenotype of microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and brain anomalies. Structural mapping showed that the SARS1 variant is located directly within the enzyme's active site, most likely diminishing activity, while the WARS1 variant is located in the N-terminal domain. We further characterize the identified WARS1 variant by showing that it negatively impacts protein abundance and is unable to rescue the phenotype of a CRISPR/Cas9 wars1 knockout zebrafish model. In summary, we describe two overlapping autosomal recessive syndromes caused by variants in WARS1 and SARS1, present functional insights into the pathogenesis of the WARS1-related syndrome and define an emerging disease spectrum: ARS-related developmental disorders with or without microcephaly.","dc:creator":"Bögershausen N","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"WARS1 and SARS1: Two tRNA synthetases implicated in autosomal recessive microcephaly."}},{"id":"cggv:506ba113-35b4-4f5c-a11e-c4dde6e58514_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4001a5d6-0b02-4d46-951b-38ce74b62684"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35790048"}],"rdfs:label":"individual 5"},{"id":"cggv:48cf7ad7-8f64-4e8b-8482-168ef17f43d0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48cf7ad7-8f64-4e8b-8482-168ef17f43d0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:506ba113-35b4-4f5c-a11e-c4dde6e58514","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:506ba113-35b4-4f5c-a11e-c4dde6e58514_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9c078c0c-a94a-463c-a513-fe210d16820e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c078c0c-a94a-463c-a513-fe210d16820e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:96cf673b-190b-4764-aefa-ae9f7f20e06a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006513.4(SARS1):c.1196C>T (p.Thr399Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/2506443"}},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:5ebbefd3-a603-483a-83a6-28f7eeb9b782_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:96cf673b-190b-4764-aefa-ae9f7f20e06a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36004946","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, ataxia, and seizures (NEDMAS) syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by moderate intellectual disability (ID), thin body habitus, microcephaly, seizures, ataxia, muscle weakness, and speech impairment.
