DNA sequencing was complemented with custom array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. aCGH identified deletions/duplications in 4 different FA genes. RNA-seq analysis revealed lack of allele specific expression associated with a deletion and splicing defects caused by missense, synonymous, and deep-in-intron variants. The combination of TruSeq-targeted capture, aCGH, and RNA-seq enabled us to identify the complementation group and biallelic germline mutations in all 27 families: FANCA (7), FANCB (3), FANCC (3), FANCD1 (1), FANCD2 (3), FANCF (2), FANCG (2), FANCI (1), FANCJ (2), and FANCL (3).

NGS offers the potential for gene discovery in patients who do not have mutations in currently known genes. This report shows how WES was used in the diagnosis of six paediatric haematology cases. In four cases (Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, congenital neutropenia (n = 2), and Fanconi anaemia), the diagnosis was suspected based on classical phenotype, and NGS confirmed those suspicions. Mutations in RPS19, ELANE and FANCD2 were found. The final two cases (MYH9 associated macrothrombocytopenia associated with multiple congenital anomalies; atypical juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia associated with a KRAS mutation) highlight the utility of NGS where the diagnosis is less certain, or where there is an unusual phenotype.

We have identified the zebrafish homolog of human FANCD2, which encodes a nuclear effector protein that is monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage, targeting it to nuclear foci where it preserves chromosomal integrity. Fancd2-deficient zebrafish embryos develop defects similar to those found in children with FA, including shortened body length, microcephaly, and microophthalmia, which are due to extensive cellular apoptosis. Developmental defects and increased apoptosis in Fancd2-deficient zebrafish were corrected by injection of human FANCD2 or zebrafish bcl2 mRNA, or by knockdown of p53, indicating that in the absence of Fancd2, developing tissues spontaneously undergo p53-dependent apoptosis. Thus, Fancd2 is essential during embryogenesis to prevent inappropriate apoptosis in neural cells and other tissues undergoing high levels of proliferative expansion, implicating this mechanism in the congenital abnormalities observed in human infants with FA.","dc:creator":"Liu TX","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Knockdown of zebrafish Fancd2 causes developmental abnormalities via p53-dependent apoptosis."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f771c397-66a9-4532-8a0b-d5df90c60f62","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:229046b7-02a7-4f09-bed3-103bf168a72b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Biochemical and morphological phenotypes are similar to observed in human FA patients due to biallelic FANCD2 mutations.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12893777","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA damage, bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer. To further investigate the in vivo function of the FA pathway, mice with a targeted deletion in the distally acting FA gene Fancd2 were created. Similar to human FA patients and other FA mouse models, Fancd2 mutant mice exhibited cellular sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-links and germ cell loss. In addition, chromosome mispairing was seen in male meiosis. However, Fancd2 mutant mice also displayed phenotypes not observed in other mice with disruptions of proximal FA genes. These include microphthalmia, perinatal lethality, and epithelial cancers, similar to mice with Brca2/Fancd1 hypomorphic mutations. These additional phenotypes were not caused by defects in the ATM-mediated S-phase checkpoint, which was intact in primary Fancd2 mutant fibroblasts. The phenotypic overlap between Fancd2-null and Brca2/Fancd1 hypomorphic mice is consistent with a common function for both proteins in the same pathway, regulating genomic stability.","dc:creator":"Houghtaling S","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Epithelial cancer in Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (Fancd2) knockout mice."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse KO"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"As demonstrated in humans, residual mRNA was also detected from mutant alleles."},{"id":"cggv:a634cdf5-d95c-4b38-85b4-7893973574af","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e08fc042-79a6-4620-ace1-6344c3243e70","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The observed biochemical and morphological phenotypes are also reported in humans.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14667412","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2949,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0fef8377-bc87-4eb3-826a-038f1520bdf2","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009214","gene":"hgnc:3585","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"FANCD2 is one of the more than twenty Fanconi anemia (FA) or FA-like genes known to cause autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane, and cancer predisposition. Biallelic predicted and/or proven loss-of-function variants in FANCD2 were first identified in Fanconi anemia patients in 2001 (PMID: 11239453). Since then, more than 20 variants in FANCD2 have been reported in individuals with FA complementation group D2 (PMIDs: 17436244, 25703294, 23613520). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) for the variant type has been reached. Although most of the reported variants have a predicted and/or proven loss-of-function effect, the presence of residual FANCD2 protein has been documented in the individuals and cell models, regardless of the ‘reverse mosaicism’ phenomenon where hematopoietic cells may regain the wild-type allele via mechanisms such as reversing the mutation or recombination with gene conversion. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by functional studies  demonstrating the protein-protein interactions with other FA genes, functional alteration in the patient fibroblast cells carrying biallelic FANCD2 variants, and rescue of the function in the patient cell culture models (PMID: 11239454). Animal studies demonstrated the recapitulation of the biochemical and morphological phenotypes reported in humans (PMIDs: 12893777, 14667412). In summary, FANCD2 is definitively associated with FA complementation group D2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5f0c260f-52d2-4225-9044-608f066ccfb2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
