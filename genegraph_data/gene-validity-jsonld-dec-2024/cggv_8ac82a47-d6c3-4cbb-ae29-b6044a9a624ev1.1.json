These 18 probands were identified using exome sequencing as part of a large cohort (n = 2572) from the National Biological Sample and Data Repository for PAH. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression evidence (PMID: 23715323). GTEx analysis revealed normal expression in human lung and liver tissue, which is consistent with the PAH phenotype. \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship netween *GGCX* and autosomal dominant PAH is moderate.
