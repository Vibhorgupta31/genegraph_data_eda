The disease comprises pure and complex forms that clinically include slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity resulting from degeneration of the corticospinal tract. At least 48 loci accounting for these diseases have been mapped to date, and mutations have been identified in 22 genes, most of which play a role in intracellular trafficking. Here, we identified mutations in two functionally related genes (DDHD1 and CYP2U1) in individuals with autosomal-recessive forms of HSP by using either the classical positional cloning or a combination of whole-genome linkage mapping and next-generation sequencing. Interestingly, three subjects with CYP2U1 mutations presented with a thin corpus callosum, white-matter abnormalities, and/or calcification of the basal ganglia. These genes code for two enzymes involved in fatty-acid metabolism, and we have demonstrated in human cells that the HSP pathophysiology includes alteration of mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics with increased oxidative stress. Our combined results focus attention on lipid metabolism as a critical HSP pathway with a deleterious impact on mitochondrial bioenergetic function.","dc:creator":"Tesson C","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Alteration of fatty-acid-metabolizing enzymes affects mitochondrial form and function in hereditary spastic paraplegia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e2d550d2-5653-45dc-a8a3-2dccf4bb49f6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e6042eb-3c10-40ff-8b2e-64769f9bddc1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e6042eb-3c10-40ff-8b2e-64769f9bddc1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:86269fa9-3639-4ede-8618-36d5a2c7ea66","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_183075.3(CYP2U1):c.947A>T (p.Asp316Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130341"}},"detectionMethod":"A genome scan with 6,090 SNP markers (LINKAGE_V panel, Illumina) covering all chromosomes was performed.

We compared spectroscopic, enzymatic, and structural (from a 3D model) characteristics of the over expressed wild-type or mutated CYP2U1 in HEK293T cells. Our findings demonstrated that most of the tested missense variants in CYP2U1 were functionally inactive because of a loss of proper heme binding or destabilization of the protein structure. We also showed that functional data do not necessarily correlate with in silico predictions of variants pathogenicity, using different bioinformatic phenotype prediction tools.

Among them, HSP with thin corpus callosum and intellectual disability is a frequent subtype, often inherited as a recessive trait (ARHSP-TCC). Within this heterogeneous subgroup, SPG11 and SPG15 represent the most frequent subtypes. We analyzed the mutation frequency of three genes associated with early-onset forms of ARHSP with and without TCC, CYP2U1/SPG56, DDHD2/SPG54 and GBA2/SPG46, in a large population of selected complicated HSP patients by using a combined approach of traditional-based and amplicon-based high-throughput pooled-sequencing. Three families with mutations were identified, one for each of the genes analyzed. Novel homozygous mutations were identified in CYP2U1 (c.1A>C/p.Met1?) and in GBA2 (c.2048G>C/p.Gly683Arg), while the homozygous mutation found in DDHD2 (c.1978G>C/p.Asp660His) had been previously reported in a compound heterozygous state. The phenotypes associated with the CYP2U1 and DDHD2 mutations overlap the SPG56 and the SPG54 subtypes, respectively, with few differences. By contrast, the GBA2 mutated patients show phenotypes combining typical features of both the SPG46 subtype and the recessive ataxia form, with marked intrafamilial variability thereby expanding the spectrum of clinical entities associated with GBA2 mutations. Overall, each of three genes analyzed shows a low mutation frequency in a general population of complicated HSP (<1 % for either CYP2U1 or DDHD2 and approximately 2 % for GBA2). These findings underline once again the genetic heterogeneity of ARHSP-TCC and the clinical overlap between complicated HSP and the recessive ataxia syndromes.

HSP (also referred to as familial spastic paraparesis), refers to a group of inherited disorders that are characterised by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. Symptoms typically progress slowly and can sometimes present as a static clinical course. Age of onset is variable. HSP can co-occur with other conditions, including epilepsy, cognitive deficits, peripheral neuropathy, impaired vision, and deafness.\n\nTwenty-four variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in 25 probands in 15 publications. We have included 9 probands and 12 variants in this curation (PMIDs: 23176821, 26914923, 24337409, 290354544, 28725025). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) had been reached (additional PMIDs include: 27679996, 26936192, 27292318, 28120039, 31281085, 31359954, 32006740, 32036589, 34316314, 33107650). Putative loss of function variants account for nearly 50% of observed variants (11/24), but missense variants have also been reported. Functional evidence including protein expression and enzymatic activity studies have been carried out for nine of the 24 variants, supporting the assumption that these variants act through a loss of protein/enzymatic activity.\n\nOf note, vision impairment or other eye phenotypes were also observed in 11 of the 24 probands/families. A case study in 2021 (El Matri et al., PMID: 34828401) reported on an individual (aged 12) with p.Arg390* variant in CYP2U1, who presented with macular telangiectasia in the absence of an HSP phenotype. The GCEP did not include this proband in the curation; however, would like to point out that other individuals with the same variant (p.Arg390*) all presented with eye phenotypes and adult-onset HSP phenotypes. This may explain the absence of the phenotype in the individual reported by El Mitri (2021). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is modestly supported by a CYP2U1 knockout murine model (PMID: 34546337). However, this knockout model does not recapitulate a locomotor phenotype, only a progressive short term memory loss (Y-maze) and photoreceptor cone degeneration (macular degeneration). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between CYP2UI and  autosomal recessive HSP. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 6, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n.\n\nThis gene has repeatedly been reported in people with autosomal recessive HSP, with the same recurrent phenotypes. As of this curation, 25 probands in 15 publications.
