The VHL gene was recently isolated by positional cloning. The cDNA encodes 852 nucleotides in 3 exons. The VHL gene is unrelated to any known gene families. We identified germline mutations in 85/114 (75%) of VHL families. Clinical heterogeneity is a well-known feature of VHL. VHL families were classified into 2 types based on the presence or absence of pheochromocytoma. The types of mutations responsible for VHL without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1) differed from those responsible for VHL with pheochromocytoma (VHL type 2). Fifty-six % of the mutations responsible for VHL type 1 were microdeletions/insertions, nonsense mutations, or deletions; 96% of the mutations responsible for VHL type 2 were missense mutations. Specific mutations in codon 238 accounted for 43% of the mutations responsible for VHL type 2. The mutations identified in these families will be useful in presymptomatic diagnosis. The identification of mutations associated with phenotypes contributes to the understanding of fundamental genetic mechanisms of VHL disease.","dc:creator":"Chen F","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Germline mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene: correlations with phenotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7728151","rdfs:label":"2338"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:deb34fbe-d2b9-492a-9c41-58a53db42b41_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca521a1b-5f99-48dd-a56d-97a1f127fe87","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"A combination of SSCP and DNA sequencing were used to identify the VHL mutation.

Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a ferroprotein oxygen sensor. Here we demonstrate a critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene product pVHL in HIF-1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF alpha-subunits are constitutively stabilized and HIF-1 is activated. Re-expression of pVHL restored oxygen-dependent instability. pVHL and HIF alpha-subunits co-immunoprecipitate, and pVHL is present in the hypoxic HIF-1 DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous ions, HIF-1 is dissociated from pVHL. These findings indicate that the interaction between HIF-1 and pVHL is iron dependent, and that it is necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF alpha-subunits.

The molecular basis for a large number of tumor-derived mutations can be attributed to alterations that directly compromise the ability of pVHL to assemble the E3 or to contact the substrate. Here we describe a new mechanism of oncogenic inactivation by VHL missense mutations that lie in the L1 and L7 linker regions distal to the HIF-alpha-binding pocket. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the tumorigenic L1 loop mutation of Ser(65) to Leu, deficient in promoting the degradation of HIF-alpha, disrupts the coordination of internal motions of the pVHL.HIF-1alpha complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to S65L, five other tumor-derived VHL mutations located within the L1 loop are each defective in mediating proteolysis of HIF-2alpha. Moreover, dynamic organization of pVHL.HIF-1alpha recognition is focally centered on Gln(145) within the L7 loop, and its tumorigenic mutant Q145H abolishes almost all of the correlated dynamic motions. Intriguingly, Q145H, whereas defective in targeting cellular HIF-alpha for degradation, had an attenuated hydroxylation dependence in binding to HIF-1alpha in vitro.

Although the present curation does not distinguish between VHL Type 1 and Type 2, generally, truncating and grossly damaging missense are associated with VHL Type 1 while less damaging missense are associated with VHL Type 2. The present curation does not include Chuvash Polycythemia or associated variants. Other databases describing germline VHL variants include: Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (https://civicdb.org), VHLdb (http://vhldb.bio.unipd.it/home), and large compendiums of genetic variants (PMID: 20151405). There is extensive genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship including both case-level and familial data. The VHL gene is a tumor-suppressor with a wide variety of cellular functions (PMID: 25533676), most notably in regulation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor A (HIFa) through binding to hydroxylated HIFa, which induces subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (PMID: 25533676). To bind hydroxylated HIFa, VHL is assembled into a complex with CUL2, RBX1 and Elongin B and C (VCB complex). The molecular mechanism of VHL dysfunction in von Hippel Lindau disease involves mutations which result in absent or reduced assembly of the VCB complex, or absent/reduced binding of the VCB complex (VHL) to HIFa. This gene-disease relationship is supported experimentally by expression studies, biochemical function, functional alterations and animal models. In summary, VHL is definitively associated with the autosomal autosomal dominant von Hippel Lindau syndrome. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:30c04ced-b74d-465a-8d7d-eb822109b7f1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
