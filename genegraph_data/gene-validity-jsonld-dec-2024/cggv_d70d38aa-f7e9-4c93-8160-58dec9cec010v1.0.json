The disorder has been reported in goat, cattle and man. The human disorder is rare and only 20 cases in 16 families have been reported. We have sequenced the exons and exon-intron borders in a European patient with infantile onset of beta-mannosidosis. The patient was compound heterozygous for a silent mutation (c.375A>G) in exon 3 causing alternative splicing, and a missense mutation (c.1513T>C, p.Ser505Pro) in exon 12. The alternative splicing event deleted four nucleotides from the transcript and was predicted to result in premature termination of translation. In order to evaluate the consequence of the missense mutation, we inserted the human beta-mannosidase gene into an expression vector, performed site-directed mutagenesis and expressed the normal and mutant enzyme in COS-7 cells. We also included the previously reported beta-mannosidosis-associated missense mutations c.544C>T (p.Arg182Trp) and c.1175G>A (p.Gly392Glu), which were found in patients presenting a milder phenotype. Cells transfected with the wild-type construct showed a 33-fold increase in beta-mannosidase activity compared to mock-transfected cells, whereas cells transfected with the mutant constructs showed no detectable increase in activity. We propose that the milder phenotype described in some beta-mannosidosis patients with missense mutations in the MANBA gene is not due to residual beta-mannosidase activity, but rather caused by epigenetic and/or environmental factors.","dc:creator":"Riise Stensland HMF","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Identification of two novel beta-mannosidosis-associated sequence variants: biochemical analysis of beta-mannosidase (MANBA) missense mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:8c8d7c8d-830c-4966-835a-d6b6e16d4fc8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:99816b81-5e37-4cd3-91f0-a1896c7cb131"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18565776"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 Riise"},{"id":"cggv:8c8d7c8d-830c-4966-835a-d6b6e16d4fc8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c8d7c8d-830c-4966-835a-d6b6e16d4fc8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8c8d7c8d-830c-4966-835a-d6b6e16d4fc8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"COS-7 cells transfected with the c.1513T>C (p.Ser505Pro) showed no detectable change in beta-mannosidase activity (vs the 33-fold increase seen in cells transfected with wild-type MANBA)"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:66f6082f-5851-4f81-9b5f-21aa9c5ed69e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66f6082f-5851-4f81-9b5f-21aa9c5ed69e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:66f6082f-5851-4f81-9b5f-21aa9c5ed69e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"silent variant shown via cDNA analysis to lead to alternative splicing of exon 3 and a 4-nucleotide deletion, c.375_378delATAT (p.Tyr126AlafsX11), predicted to result in frameshift and NMD"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1e929117-490f-43b4-8791-10ac5c4ce236_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1e929117-490f-43b4-8791-10ac5c4ce236","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:c594c056-e784-439b-8b7e-630982a57e25","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005908.4(MANBA):c.563_572dup (p.Asp191_Trp192insTer)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1677"}},{"id":"cggv:77eabb0f-3813-4503-8d3b-619d6ebecf6b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005908.4(MANBA):c.1705-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1678"}}],"detectionMethod":"PCR and Sanger sequencing of MANBA gene","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b98fd6ce-1fb2-49a7-94b5-91cd68c2ad09_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:77eabb0f-3813-4503-8d3b-619d6ebecf6b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16401745","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"beta-Mannosidosis is a rare inborn error of metabolism with various phenotypes, including mental retardation, behavioral problems, hearing loss, and recurrent airway infections in childhood.

The clinical manifestations of this disease in reported human cases are very heterogeneous ranging from relatively mild to moderately severe. This is in contrast with the severe prenatal onset seen in ruminant beta-mannosidosis. In humans, mental retardation, hearing loss, frequent infections, and behavioral problems are relatively common. Dysmorphology and skeletal involvement such as those seen in ruminants are unusual. The purpose of this study is to determine the range of clinical expression in human beta-mannosidosis resulting from null mutations. We determined that the beta-mannosidase gene consists of 17 exons. Intron-based PCR primers were designed and used to amplify each of the exons in genomic DNA isolated from patient fibroblasts. We identified two patients with null mutations. Results of the analysis showed that one patient was heterozygous for nonsense mutations G334T (E83X) in exon 2 and C1363T (Q426X) in exon 10, resulting in truncation of the deduced peptide sequence from 879 to 82 and 425 amino acids, respectively. The second patient was homozygous for a deletion mutation in exon 11 (1541delAT). This deletion causes a reading frame shift and 26 out of frame amino acids before a stop codon occurs in exon 12, resulting in truncation of the deduced peptide sequence from 879 to 510 amino acids. Because disease presentation in these patients with null mutations is very variable, ranging from mild to severe, we conclude that beta-mannosidosis in humans may indeed be milder than typical of other lysosomal storage disorders.","dc:creator":"Bedilu R","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Variable clinical presentation of lysosomal beta-mannosidosis in patients with null mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:db2ad738-495c-4dd7-b058-4fc6287e9430_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a219e329-d51b-4763-a2dd-5a602e64a852"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468273"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 Bedilu"},{"id":"cggv:db2ad738-495c-4dd7-b058-4fc6287e9430","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db2ad738-495c-4dd7-b058-4fc6287e9430_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:e157075c-b0d4-4bce-8074-1ece4683c284","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e157075c-b0d4-4bce-8074-1ece4683c284_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:dec1496a-fed0-478b-bf02-119697c00792_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dec1496a-fed0-478b-bf02-119697c00792","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:4f1e8caf-fa61-4a4b-a214-6e2e6d93e622","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005908.4(MANBA):c.960+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1676"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR and Sanger sequencing of MANBA gene","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:8ea82a22-fda4-4175-ad25-7d18a044a495_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4f1e8caf-fa61-4a4b-a214-6e2e6d93e622"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12890191","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"There are seven well-known lysosomal storage diseases that produce angiokeratoma corporis diffusum clinically. beta-Mannosidosis (MANB1; OMIM248510), first reported in humans in 1986, is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme beta-mannosidase.

In addition, the phenotypic manifestation among the reported cases of human beta-mannosidosis is variable, even among members of the same family. To understand the molecular basis of the human disease and the mechanisms for such clinical variability, we sequenced the entire coding region of the human beta-mannosidase gene using a combination of cDNA library screening, RT-PCR and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The composite cDNA is 3293 nt, consisting of an 87 nt 5'-untranslated region, 2640 nt coding region and 566 nt 3'-untranslated region. The gene was localized to human chromosome 4q22-25. Analysis of a multiple tissue northern blot demonstrated a single 3.7 kb transcript. Mutation analysis of a Czech gypsy family with two siblings differently affected with beta-mannosidosis demonstrated a homozygous A-->G transition 2 bp upstream of a splice acceptor site.

The composite cDNA codes for an 879-amino-acid peptide that has four potential N-glycosylation sites. Comparison of the caprine and bovine cDNAs reveals that 96.3% of the nucleotides and 95.2% of the deduced amino acids are identical. A single-base deletion at position 1398 of the coding sequence was identified in the cDNA isolated from a goat affected with beta-mannosidosis. This deletion results in a shift in the reading frame and a premature termination of translation, yielding a deduced peptide of 481 amino acids. An assay, developed to determine the presence or absence of this mutation, confirmed that animals affected with beta-mannosidosis were homozygous for the mutation and that obligate carriers in a caprine beta-mannosidosis colony were heterozygous. This assay accurately distinguished between mutation carrier and noncarrier goats and was used for prenatal diagnosis using DNA collected from fetal fluids. The assay also confirmed chimerism in a goat with an atypically mild beta-mannosidosis phenotype.

MANBA encodes beta-mannosidase, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of N-linked oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins via catalyzing the cleavage of the beta-mannoside linkage of Man-(β 1→4)GlcNAc (PMID: 9384606). Among patients with beta-mannosidosis (MANSB), beta-mannosidase deficiency results in the characteristic disease manifestation of accumulation of undegraded Man-(β 1→4)GlcNAc in multiple tissues (PMID: 2317928, PMID: 3128685). \n\nThe disease mechanism of MANSB is loss of function. MANSB was first reported in 1986 by Wenger (PMID: 2945113) and Cooper (PMID: 3762648) and the first report of biallelic variants in MANBA among MANSB patients in 1998 by Alkhayat (PMID: 9384606). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between ABHD5 and CDS. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 9384606, PMID: 16401745, PMID: 12468273, PMID: 18565776, PMID: 12890191, PMID: 17420068, PMID: 16904924). In total, twelve variants from eight probands in seven publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between MANBA and MANSB includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (beta-mannosidase) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with MANSB (PMID: 9384606, PMID: 2317928, PMID: 3128685); the biochemical and clinical features of MANBA knockout animal models (PMID: 8921369); and rescue of beta-mannosidase enzyme function via allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in a patient with MANSB (PMID: 31115173). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, MANBA is definitively associated with MANSB. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on August 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d70d38aa-f7e9-4c93-8160-58dec9cec010"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
