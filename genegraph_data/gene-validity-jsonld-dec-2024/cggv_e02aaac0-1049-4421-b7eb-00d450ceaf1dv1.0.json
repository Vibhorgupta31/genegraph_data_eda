Diagnostic hallmark of HIDS is a constitutively elevated level of serum immunoglobulin D (IgD), although patients have been reported with normal IgD levels. To determine the underlying defect in HIDS, we analysed urine of several patients and discovered increased concentrations of mevalonic acid during severe episodes of fever, but not between crises. Subsequent analysis of cells from four unrelated HIDS patients revealed reduced activities of mevalonate kinase (MK; encoded by the gene MVK), a key enzyme of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Sequence analysis of MVK cDNA from the patients identified three different mutations, one of which was common to all patients. Expression of the mutant cDNAs in Escherichia coli showed that all three mutations affect the activity of the encoded proteins. Moreover, immunoblot analysis demonstrated a deficiency of MK protein in patient fibroblasts, indicating a protein-destabilizing effect of the mutations.","dc:creator":"Houten SM","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutations in MVK, encoding mevalonate kinase, cause hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e02aaac0-1049-4421-b7eb-00d450ceaf1d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e02aaac0-1049-4421-b7eb-00d450ceaf1d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1f8c2be-e18f-42f8-b10c-6a9f91eb8058","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fd420cd3-8ec3-4676-a583-f2e86c357bda","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"MK deficiency is consistently reported in HIDS and is believed to result in increased inflammatory process.

We recently demonstrated that mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene (MVK) are associated with HIDS. Direct DNA sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of MVK in 25 unrelated patients with HIDS. Mutations were detected in the coding region of the gene including 11 missense mutations, one deletion, the absence of expression of one allele, as well as three novel polymorphisms. Seven of these mutations are novel. The large majority of the patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations. Of these, V377I (G-->A) is the most common mutation occurring in 20 unrelated patients and was found to be associated with I268T in six patients. Mutations were associated with a decrease of mevalonate kinase (MK) (ATP:mevalonate 5-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.I.36) enzymatic activity but not as profound as in mevalonic aciduria, a syndrome also caused by a deficient activity of MK. In HIDS the mutations are located all along the protein which is different from mevalonic aciduria where MK mutations are mainly clustered to a same region of the protein. On the basis of this study, we propose that the diagnostic screen of MVK in HIDS should be first directed on V377I and I268T mutations. Three patients are also described to illustrate the genotypic and phenotypic overlap with mevalonic aciduria.","dc:creator":"Cuisset L","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Molecular analysis of MVK mutations and enzymatic activity in hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"MK enzyme analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:e02aaac0-1049-4421-b7eb-00d450ceaf1d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7acf5ad4-1934-4b47-bbc7-51f01379828b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b08156c3-8afe-464b-9334-7e976f1acadb","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Enzyme measurements in E. coli lysates showed that both H20P and I268T mutations have an effect on the activity of their respective MK proteins.

In 1999 MVK variants were also implicated in a milder recessive condition, called Hyper-IgD Syndrome with periodic fever (HIDS) (Houten et al 1999). Collectively these conditions are known as Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) and are characterized by episodes of recurrent fever lasting 3-6 days, which begin early in childhood. In addition to fevers, symptoms can include abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, serositis, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions/rash, aphthous ulcers, arthralgia/arthritis. In more severe forms of MA there may also be growth delay, congenital anomalies (cataracts, shortened limbs and dysmorphic features), failure to thrive and neurological symptoms (PMID:27142780)\nIn both conditions there is decreased MVK enzyme activity which leads to the accumulation of mevalonic acid, defective prenylation, and ultimately constitutive activation of the pyrin inflammasome. This activation leads to excess production of IL-1 causing many of the inflammatory features of the disease. It is hypothesized that excess MA accumulation may lead to the ocular and neurologic symptoms which are seen in both forms of the disease, but more commonly in the more severe form of mevalonate aciduria (PMID:35685471). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism as both lead to varying levels of mevalonate kinase deficiency, and both follow the same inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entities, Hyper-IgD Syndrome (OMIM:260920) and Mevalonic Aciduria (OMIM:610377). The split curation for Porokeratosis, which is also caused by variants in MVK, but which is inherited in an autosomal dominant mechanism with localized post-zygotic mutation will be curated separately. 179 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants have been reported in the Infevers database to date (https://infevers.umai-montpellier.fr/web/) and 132 have been reported in ClinVar. 19 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs:  PMID:1036926 and PMID:11371670) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. \nThe gene disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. Several studies have shown decreased MVK activity in patient cells (PMIDs: 10369261, 11313769) and an upregulation of IL-1β and other cytokines (PMID:12384940, PMID:25173351). Mouse models with heterozygous MVK deletions (MVK +/-) have also shown decreased mevalonate kinase activity, immune dysfunction, and similar clinical features to individuals with HIDS included hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal thermoregulation and general malaise (PMID:18008182)\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between MVK autosomal recessive Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Autoinflammatory GCEP on the meeting date 05/15/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e02aaac0-1049-4421-b7eb-00d450ceaf1d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
