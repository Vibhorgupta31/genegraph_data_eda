We report on a patient with a de novo del(2)(q36.2q36.3) interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 2 diagnosed by classical banding. The phenotype comprised facial dysmorphism, enlarged kidneys with multiple renal cysts, abnormal minora labia, asymmetric lower limbs with dysplastic patella, and severe mental retardation. By physical mapping, using array-comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) confirmed by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH), the breakpoints of the deletion were mapped and the size of the deletions was measured: 5.61+/-0.19Mb. A skin biopsy was analysed using electronic microscopy showing an alteration of the structure and organisation of the dermal and peri-neuronal basement membrane. The relation between the phenotype and the deletion of both COL4A4 and COL4A3 genes, located in 2q36.3 loci, as well as the disruption of TRIP12 were discussed.","dc:creator":"Doco-Fenzy M","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Deletion 2q36.2q36.3 with multiple renal cysts and severe mental retardation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:011b99b3-0d17-4615-800e-36f4bacd8117_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:011b99b3-0d17-4615-800e-36f4bacd8117_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6149,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0cad63e5-99f0-486a-8713-aa155f5501eb","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100038","gene":"hgnc:12306","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"*TRIP12* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2008 (Doco-Fenzy et al., PMID: 18822396). Individuals with variants in this gene have been reported to have delayed psychomotor development with delayed walking, mildly impaired intellectual development, learning difficulties, autistic features, or behavioral abnormalities. Most had fluent speech, although several patients had delayed speech. Additional features included hypotonia (4 patients), seizures (3 patients), and strabismus (2 patients). Given the spectrum of neurodevelopmental features observed, this gene was curated for the disease entity \"complex neurodevelopmental disorder\". \n\nTwenty-seven variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletions, etc.) have been reported in 25 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 25418537, 27848077, 18822396, 27479843, 28251352, 32424948) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The presumed mechanism of pathogenicity based on published evidence is loss of function.\n\nIn summary, *TRIP12* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Expert Panel on April 5th, 2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:011b99b3-0d17-4615-800e-36f4bacd8117"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
