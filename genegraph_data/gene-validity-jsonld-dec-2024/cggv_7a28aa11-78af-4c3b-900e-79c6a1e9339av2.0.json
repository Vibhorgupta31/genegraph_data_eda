The disease results from deficiency in hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT). We have previously described one deletion and six different point mutations in four RHS patients. We have now analyzed the TAT genes in a further seven unrelated RHS families from Italy, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We have established PCR conditions for the amplification of all twelve TAT exons and have screened the products for mutations by direct sequence analysis or by first performing single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We have thus identified the presumably pathological mutations in eight RHS alleles, including two nonsense mutations (R57X, E411X) and four amino acid substitutions (R119W, L201R, R433Q, R433W). Only the R57X mutation, which was found in one Scottish and two Italian families, has been previously reported in another Italian family. Haplotype analysis indicates that this mutation, which involves a CpG dinucleotide hot spot, has a common origin in the three Italian families but arose independently in the Scottish family. Two polymorphisms have also been detected, viz., a protein polymorphism, P15S, and a silent substitution S103S (TCG-->TCA). Expression of R433Q and R433W demonstrate reduced activity of the mutant proteins. In all, twelve different TAT gene mutations have now been identified in tyrosinemia type II.","dc:creator":"Hühn R","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Novel and recurrent tyrosine aminotransferase gene mutations in tyrosinemia type II."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9544843","rdfs:label":"Patient MV"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The homozygous (due to consanguinity) missense variant, Arg119Trp, occurs at a highly conserved residue implicating an important structural or functional role.

Parents may therefore seek prenatal diagnosis, but this is not possible by biochemical assays as tyrosine does not accumulate in amniotic fluid and TAT is not expressed in chorionic villi or amniocytes. Molecular analysis is therefore the only possible approach for prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection. To this end, we sought TAT gene mutations in 9 tyrosinaemia II patients from three consanguineous Palestinian kindreds. In two kindreds (7 patients), the only potential abnormality identified after sequencing all 12 exons and exon-intron boundaries was homozygosity for a silent, single-nucleotide transversion c.1224G > T (p.T408T) at the last base of exon 11. This was predicted to disrupt the 5' donor splice site of exon 11 and result in missplicing. However, as TAT is expressed exclusively in liver, patient mRNA could not be obtained for splicing analysis. A minigene approach was therefore used to assess the effect of c.1224G > T on exon 11 splicing. Transfection experiments with wild-type and c.1224G > T mutant minigene constructs demonstrated that c.1224G > T results in complete exon 11 skipping, illustrating the utility of this approach for confirming a putative splicing defect when cDNA is unavailable. Homozygosity for a c.1249C > T (R417X) exon 12 nonsense mutation (previously reported in a French patient) was identified in both patients from the third kindred, enabling successful prenatal diagnosis of an unaffected fetus using chorionic villous tissue.","dc:creator":"Maydan G","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"TAT gene mutation analysis in three Palestinian kindreds with oculocutaneous tyrosinaemia type II; characterization of a silent exonic transversion that causes complete missplicing by exon 11 skipping."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16917729","rdfs:label":"Patient B1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous variant appears to be synonymous, Thr408,  but in fact disrupts splicing, causing the skipping of exon 11 as shown in a minigene assay."},{"id":"cggv:6710c275-c8e8-49f7-86ee-0d29afbbe192_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f24db95-5f63-4007-a483-3401b482e820","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":28,"detectionMethod":"Blood samples were collected from the whole family and DNA was extracted.

A low‐protein diet and the use of a special formula that is free of phenylalanine and tyrosine are effective in lowering the plasma level of tyrosine, allowing resolution of both eye and skin symptoms within days to several weeks.

At least 22 unique variants (including many missense/nonsense, as well as frameshift and large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 9544843, 16917729, 1357662, 16318910, 27832414, 18945316). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members.\nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence: 0.5 points\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of TAT, the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxylphenylpyruvate. Hypertyrosinemia occurs due to lack of TAT enzymatic activity.\n\nIn summary, TAT is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Tyrosinemia Type II. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7a28aa11-78af-4c3b-900e-79c6a1e9339a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
