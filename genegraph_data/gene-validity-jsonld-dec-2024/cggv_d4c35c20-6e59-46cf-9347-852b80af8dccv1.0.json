Most patients have heterozygous mutations in SCN1A, encoding voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.1 alpha subunits. Sodium channels are modulated by beta1 subunits, encoded by SCN1B, a gene also linked to epilepsy. Here we report the first patient with Dravet syndrome associated with a recessive mutation in SCN1B (p.R125C). Biochemical characterization of p.R125C in a heterologous system demonstrated little to no cell surface expression despite normal total cellular expression. This occurred regardless of coexpression of Na(v)1.1 alpha subunits. Because the patient was homozygous for the mutation, these data suggest a functional SCN1B null phenotype. To understand the consequences of the lack of beta1 cell surface expression in vivo, hippocampal slice recordings were performed in Scn1b(-/-) versus Scn1b(+/+) mice. Scn1b(-/-) CA3 neurons fired evoked action potentials with a significantly higher peak voltage and significantly greater amplitude compared with wild type. However, in contrast to the Scn1a(+/-) model of Dravet syndrome, we found no measurable differences in sodium current density in acutely dissociated CA3 hippocampal neurons. Whereas Scn1b(-/-) mice seize spontaneously, the seizure susceptibility of Scn1b(+/-) mice was similar to wild type, suggesting that, like the parents of this patient, one functional SCN1B allele is sufficient for normal control of electrical excitability. We conclude that SCN1B p.R125C is an autosomal recessive cause of Dravet syndrome through functional gene inactivation.","dc:creator":"Patino GA","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"A functional null mutation of SCN1B in a patient with Dravet syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"19710327_Proband"},{"id":"cggv:b8144d72-20b5-428b-887e-a589468f1b6e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b8144d72-20b5-428b-887e-a589468f1b6e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b8144d72-20b5-428b-887e-a589468f1b6e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"p.Arg125Cys showed reduced cell surface expression compared to WT in HEK293 cells, and it had a LoF effect on current modulation in 1610 cells."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a34ecaf5-0273-456d-b024-d41c62f10399_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a34ecaf5-0273-456d-b024-d41c62f10399","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:fea52a41-572e-4eb5-a99f-3a9b6457c3f0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001037.5(SCN1B):c.178C>T (p.Arg60Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA405328288"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0007281"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:dd47564c-9cff-4512-b630-a7ee287201eb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fea52a41-572e-4eb5-a99f-3a9b6457c3f0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33901312"},"rdfs:label":"33901312_FamilyD_Proband_IV-3"},{"id":"cggv:dd47564c-9cff-4512-b630-a7ee287201eb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd47564c-9cff-4512-b630-a7ee287201eb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:dd47564c-9cff-4512-b630-a7ee287201eb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"p.Arg60Cys showes abnormal gating of human NaV channels compared to WT when expressed in Xenopus Oocytes"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:73c3d5c1-6949-4a2a-9556-000356c67176_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73c3d5c1-6949-4a2a-9556-000356c67176","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:8d72a86d-8225-4afb-951e-6a2c48c47fa6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001037.5(SCN1B):c.449-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/694617"}},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a90b2bbf-f981-4d92-910e-115fd8668cbd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8d72a86d-8225-4afb-951e-6a2c48c47fa6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28218389","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dominant SCN1B mutations are known to cause several epilepsy syndromes in humans.

expression and participate in cell adhesive interactions in vitro. beta1-/- mice appear ataxic and display spontaneous generalized seizures. In the optic nerve, the fastest components of the compound action potential are slowed and the number of mature nodes of Ranvier is reduced, but Na(v)1.6, contactin, caspr 1, and K(v)1 channels are all localized normally at nodes. At the ultrastructural level, the paranodal septate-like junctions immediately adjacent to the node are missing in a subset of axons, suggesting that beta1 may participate in axo-glial communication at the periphery of the nodal gap. Sodium currents in dissociated hippocampal neurons are normal, but Na(v)1.1 expression is reduced and Na(v)1.3 expression is increased in a subset of pyramidal neurons in the CA2/CA3 region, suggesting a basis for the epileptic phenotype. Our results show that beta1 subunits play important roles in the regulation of sodium channel density and localization, are involved in axo-glial communication at nodes of Ranvier, and are required for normal action potential conduction and control of excitability in vivo.","dc:creator":"Chen C","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mice lacking sodium channel beta1 subunits display defects in neuronal excitability, sodium channel expression, and nodal architecture."},"rdfs:label":"β1(-/-) mice have seizures"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3861,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:feea2e06-7297-4bc7-988c-98d0230a31a3","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100062","gene":"hgnc:10586","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"SCN1B was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy in 2009 (Patino, et al., PMID: 19710327). At least 8 variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 19710327, 23148524, 28218389, 31709768, 33901312). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function (PMID: 19710327, 28218389). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures plus and autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation or Brugada syndrome. These have been assessed separately. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, SCN1B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Working Group on 1/4/22 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d4c35c20-6e59-46cf-9347-852b80af8dcc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
