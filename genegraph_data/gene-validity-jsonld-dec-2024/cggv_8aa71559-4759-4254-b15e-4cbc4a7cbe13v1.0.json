We previously described abnormalities in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic pathway as a cause of ASD. Here, we show that the solute carrier transporter 7a5 (SLC7A5), a large neutral amino acid transporter localized at the blood brain barrier (BBB), has an essential role in maintaining normal levels of brain BCAAs. In mice, deletion of Slc7a5 from the endothelial cells of the BBB leads to atypical brain amino acid profile, abnormal mRNA translation, and severe neurological abnormalities. Furthermore, we identified several patients with autistic traits and motor delay carrying deleterious homozygous mutations in the SLC7A5 gene. Finally, we demonstrate that BCAA intracerebroventricular administration ameliorates abnormal behaviors in adult mutant mice. Our data elucidate a neurological syndrome defined by SLC7A5 mutations and support an essential role for the BCAA in human brain function.","dc:creator":"TÄƒrlungeanu DC","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Impaired Amino Acid Transport at the Blood Brain Barrier Is a Cause of Autism Spectrum Disorder."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8aa71559-4759-4254-b15e-4cbc4a7cbe13_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8aa71559-4759-4254-b15e-4cbc4a7cbe13_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:7358671b-2b0b-4434-95ec-5b09eb67f4e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7358671b-2b0b-4434-95ec-5b09eb67f4e2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:110400a4-db9f-4b6c-88cb-7f6908cd9f73","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003486.7(SLC7A5):c.1124C>T (p.Pro375Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8222777"}},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ed670779-08a5-4d88-abf0-db0aed6ed7c7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:110400a4-db9f-4b6c-88cb-7f6908cd9f73"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912058"},"rdfs:label":"Tarlungeanu-Individual-1465-3"},{"id":"cggv:ed670779-08a5-4d88-abf0-db0aed6ed7c7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed670779-08a5-4d88-abf0-db0aed6ed7c7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:cf5d33fc-d13e-45f1-9c6c-8a8e93e03cc4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf5d33fc-d13e-45f1-9c6c-8a8e93e03cc4","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:110400a4-db9f-4b6c-88cb-7f6908cd9f73"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Microarry-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization was carried out, providing inconspicuous results for both sibling patients","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:adfa14bc-bc92-46e7-b10c-cc6529bae119_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:110400a4-db9f-4b6c-88cb-7f6908cd9f73"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36996814","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes, but what are the consequences of perturbing this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons affects the postnatal metabolic state, leading to a shift in lipid metabolism. Additionally, it causes stage- and cell-type-specific alterations in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Knaus LS","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival."}},"rdfs:label":"Knaus-Individual-130-1"},{"id":"cggv:adfa14bc-bc92-46e7-b10c-cc6529bae119","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:adfa14bc-bc92-46e7-b10c-cc6529bae119_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8aa71559-4759-4254-b15e-4cbc4a7cbe13_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.7},{"id":"cggv:5b7117a8-13c6-464d-a746-8efc830121dd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b7117a8-13c6-464d-a746-8efc830121dd","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ada5eac5-3c72-4bbd-82c2-c881b40fd574","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003486.7(SLC7A5):c.737C>T (p.Ala246Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA397042114"}},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9a7f3f94-ffc1-4231-9e1b-0327eb7a81f6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ada5eac5-3c72-4bbd-82c2-c881b40fd574"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912058"},"rdfs:label":"Tarlungeanu-Individual-1426-5"},{"id":"cggv:9a7f3f94-ffc1-4231-9e1b-0327eb7a81f6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a7f3f94-ffc1-4231-9e1b-0327eb7a81f6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9a7f3f94-ffc1-4231-9e1b-0327eb7a81f6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"To validate functional impact, performed transport assays that showed the mutant A246V was virtually inactive.
