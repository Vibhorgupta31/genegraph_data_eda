The study shows a functional interaction between CYP1B1 and myocilin where 17β estradiol acts as a mediator. 17β estradiol can induce MYOC expression through the putative estrogen responsive elements (EREs) located in its promoter and CYP1B1 manipulates MYOC expression by metabolizing 17β estradiol to 4-hydroxy estradiol, thus preventing it from binding to MYOC promoter. Hence any mutation in CYP1B1 that reduces its 17β estradiol metabolizing activity might lead to MYOC upregulation, which in turn might play a role in glaucoma pathogenesis.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23028769","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"CYP1B1 has been implicated in primary congenital glaucoma with autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Mutations in CYP1B1 have also been reported in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) cases and suggested to act as a modifier of the disease along with Myocilin (MYOC). Earlier reports suggest that over-expression of myocilin leads to POAG pathogenesis. Taken together, we propose a functional interaction between CYP1B1 and myocilin where 17β estradiol acts as a mediator. Therefore, we hypothesize that 17β estradiol can induce MYOC expression through the putative estrogen responsive elements (EREs) located in its promoter and CYP1B1 could manipulate MYOC expression by metabolizing 17β estradiol to 4-hydroxy estradiol, thus preventing it from binding to MYOC promoter. Hence any mutation in CYP1B1 that reduces its 17β estradiol metabolizing activity might lead to MYOC upregulation, which in turn might play a role in glaucoma pathogenesis. It was observed that 17β estradiol is present in Human Trabecular Meshwork cells (HTM) and Retinal Pigment Epithelial cells (RPE) by immunoflouresence and ELISA. Also, the expression of enzymes related to estrogen biosynthesis pathway was observed in both cell lines by RT-PCR. Subsequent evaluation of the EREs in the MYOC promoter by luciferase assay, with dose and time dependent treatment of 17β estradiol, showed that the EREs are indeed active. This observation was further validated by direct binding of estrogen receptors (ER) on EREs in MYOC promoter and subsequent upregulation in MYOC level in HTM cells on 17β estradiol treatment. Interestingly, CYP1B1 mutants with less than 10% enzymatic activity were found to increase the level of endogenous myocilin in HTM cells. Thus the experimental observations are consistent with our proposed hypothesis that mutant CYP1B1, lacking the 17β estradiol metabolizing activity, can cause MYOC upregulation, which might have a potential implication in glaucoma pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Mookherjee S","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Molecular basis for involvement of CYP1B1 in MYOC upregulation and its potential implication in glaucoma pathogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Involvement of CYP1B1 in MYOC upregulation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:107502fc-115b-4ee0-ba83-7081a17d1ebc_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8786e5aa-f0ee-458f-b8f4-2eb521dc97e0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6983a3ed-cc8a-4df6-83da-2f51509d50ae","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Eight of the variants analysed have been retrieved previously from patients with Primary Congenital Glaucoma (PMID:23218183 ).

PCG pathogenicity in patients is associated with the presence of *CYP1B1* variants in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state. The clinical features of the disease include increased intraocular pressure, increased corneal diameter, enlarged globe, Haab striae (breaks in Descemet’s membrane), corneal edema, and optic nerve head cupping. Although most *CYP1B1* variants are associated with PCG, variants have been also described causing other disease phenotypes including aniridia (PMID:23767995; PMID:24001018), anterior segment dysgenesis 6 (ASGD6, OMIM #617315), Peter’s anomaly (PA, OMIM #617315), and primary open angle glaucoma with adult or juvenile onset (POAG, JOAG; OMIM# 231300; PMID: 24099281; PMID: 19643970). It is important to note, however, that the same variants can be associated with different disease phenotypes (PMID: 17914928), and that diverse disease phenotypes can occur among members of the same family (PMID: 26164761) or within the same individual (PMID: 20827438). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, these findings as well as the similarities in inheritance pattern were found to point to a single disease spectrum rather than multiple distinct disease entities. For the purposes of this curation, this lumped disease entity has been referred to as CYP1B1-related glaucoma with or without anterior segment dysgenesis.\n\nMore than 82 variants have been described in the literature (PMID: 17914928). Ten disease-causing variants were scored as part of this curation, which have been recurrently identified in multiple probands having different phenotypes (e.g. ASD6, PCG, PA, POAG) and have been shown *in vivo* to impair the proper functioning of the protein. Pathogenicity of the variants follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in probands. The mechanism of pathogenicity includes missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants that disrupt or abolish protein function by reducing enzymatic activity (e.g p.Glu387Lys), decreasing protein stability (e.g. p.Pro437Leu), or triggering truncation of the protein product (e.g p.Ala179fs). The variants are observed at a low frequency that is consistent with the disease penetrance.\n\nExperimental evidence indicates that *CYP1B1* encodes a protein that is a member of the P450 family of enzymes which are involved in the metabolism of steroids, fatty acids, and retinoids. *CYP1B1* is highly expressed in the iris and ciliary body of the human eye. CYP1B1 is hypothesized to participate in the metabolism of a substrate that is important for the normal development and functioning of the anterior segment of the eye, which is further supported by evidence showing a higher expression of this gene in fetal than in adult eyes. Functional, functional alteration and animal models indicate that variants in *CYP1B1* interfere with the normal metabolism of other proteins known to be involved in pathogenesis (e.g. upregulation of MYOC, PMID: 23028769), result in disruption of microfibril fibers in the extracellular matrix in glaucoma patients compared to controls, or alter CYP1B1 expression in cultured cells resulting in lower protein activity and instability. Mice deficient in *Cyp1b1* expression show abnormalities during development of the ocular tissue (e.g. increased collagen loss resulting in severe atrophy of the trabecular meshwork in mice, PMID 24879660).\n\nIn summary, *CYP1B1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive CYP1B1-related glaucoma with or without anterior segment dysgenesis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 19th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:107502fc-115b-4ee0-ba83-7081a17d1ebc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
