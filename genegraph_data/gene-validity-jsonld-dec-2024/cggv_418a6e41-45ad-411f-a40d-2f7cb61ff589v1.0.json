Through exome sequencing we identified compound heterozygous mutations in WDR19 in a Norwegian family with Sensenbrenner syndrome. In a Dutch family with the clinically overlapping Jeune syndrome, a homozygous missense mutation in the same gene was found. Both families displayed a nephronophthisis-like nephropathy. Independently, we also identified compound heterozygous WDR19 mutations by exome sequencing in a Moroccan family with isolated nephronophthisis. WDR19 encodes IFT144, a member of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex A that drives retrograde ciliary transport. We show that IFT144 is absent from the cilia of fibroblasts from one of the Sensenbrenner patients and that ciliary abundance and morphology is perturbed, demonstrating the ciliary pathogenesis. Our results suggest that isolated nephronophthisis, Jeune, and Sensenbrenner syndromes are clinically overlapping disorders that can result from a similar molecular cause.","dc:creator":"Bredrup C","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Ciliopathies with skeletal anomalies and renal insufficiency due to mutations in the IFT-A gene WDR19."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:418a6e41-45ad-411f-a40d-2f7cb61ff589_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:418a6e41-45ad-411f-a40d-2f7cb61ff589_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:81064bb4-fd12-42cc-9081-51c10bb6cc33_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81064bb4-fd12-42cc-9081-51c10bb6cc33","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:0ec27da8-572c-478e-a916-696944dfa999","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025132.4(WDR19):c.3307C>T (p.Arg1103Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342746"}},{"id":"cggv:2231afba-e04a-453b-8ce9-20d45282d748","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025132.4(WDR19):c.2129T>C (p.Leu710Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA199262"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Sensenbrenner syndrome.

Our purpose was to identify the causal gene, describe the phenotype and delineate the mutation spectrum in a consanguineous Quebec arRP family. We performed Arrayed Primer Extension (APEX) technology to exclude ∼500 arRP mutations in ∼20 genes. Homozygosity mapping [single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping] identified 10 novel significant homozygous regions. We performed next generation sequencing and whole exome capture. Sanger sequencing provided cosegregation. We screened another 150 retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and 200 patients with Senior-Løken Syndrome (SLS). We identified a novel missense mutation in WDR19, c.2129T>C which lead to a p.Leu710Ser. We found the same mutation in a second Quebec arRP family. Interestingly, two of seven affected members of the original family developed 'sub-clinical' renal cysts. We hypothesized that more severe WDR19 mutations may lead to severe ciliopathies and found seven WDR19 mutations in five SLS families. We identified a new gene for both arRP and SLS. WDR19 is a ciliary protein associated with the intraflagellar transport machinery. We are currently investigating the full extent of the mutation spectrum. Our findings are crucial in expanding the understanding of childhood blindness and identifying new genes.

More than 13 genes are implicated in its pathogenesis to date, accounting for only 40 % of all cases. High-throughput mutation screenings of large patient cohorts represent a powerful tool for diagnostics and identification of novel NPHP genes. We here performed a new high-throughput mutation analysis method to study 13 established NPHP genes (NPHP1-NPHP13) in a worldwide cohort of 1,056 patients diagnosed with NPHP-RC. We first applied multiplexed PCR-based amplification using Fluidigm Access-Array™ technology followed by barcoding and next-generation resequencing on an Illumina platform. As a result, we established the molecular diagnosis in 127/1,056 independent individuals (12.0 %) and identified a single heterozygous truncating mutation in an additional 31 individuals (2.9 %). Altogether, we detected 159 different mutations in 11 out of 13 different NPHP genes, 99 of which were novel. Phenotypically most remarkable were two patients with truncating mutations in INVS/NPHP2 who did not present as infants and did not exhibit extrarenal manifestations. In addition, we present the first case of Caroli disease due to mutations in WDR19/NPHP13 and the second case ever with a recessive mutation in GLIS2/NPHP7. This study represents the most comprehensive mutation analysis in NPHP-RC patients, identifying the largest number of novel mutations in a single study worldwide.

Ciliary protein trafficking is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. Mutations in genes encoding the IFT-A subunits (IFT43, IFT121/WDR35, IFT122, IFT139/TTC21B, IFT140 and IFT144/WDR19) often result in skeletal ciliopathies, including cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED). We here characterized the molecular and cellular defects of CED caused by compound heterozygous mutations in IFT144 [the missense variant IFT144(L710S) and the nonsense variant IFT144(R1103*)]. These two variants were distinct with regard to their interactions with other IFT-A subunits and with the IFT-B complex. When exogenously expressed in IFT144-knockout (KO) cells, IFT144(L710S) as well as IFT144(WT) rescued both moderately compromised ciliogenesis and the abnormal localization of ciliary proteins. As the homozygous IFT144(L710S) mutation was found to cause autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, IFT144(L710S) is likely to be hypomorphic at the cellular level. In striking contrast, the exogenous expression of IFT144(R1103*) in IFT144-KO cells exacerbated the ciliogenesis defects. The expression of IFT144(R1103*) together with IFT144(WT) restored the abnormal phenotypes of IFT144-KO cells. However, the coexpression of IFT144(R1103*) with the hypomorphic IFT144(L710S) variant in IFT144-KO cells, which mimics the genotype of compound heterozygous CED patients, resulted in severe ciliogenesis defects. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that compound heterozygous mutations in IFT144 cause severe ciliary defects via a complicated mechanism, where one allele can cause severe ciliary defects when combined with a hypomorphic allele.","dc:creator":"Ishida Y","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Molecular basis of ciliary defects caused by compound heterozygous IFT144/WDR19 mutations found in cranioectodermal dysplasia."},"rdfs:label":"Ishida_FunctionalAlteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:418a6e41-45ad-411f-a40d-2f7cb61ff589_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:abc6de20-8ac5-4dc8-9bd4-137c9ebb25a0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8dc20007-7e2d-47ff-8c43-2dbc44fafc2e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Phenotypes replicate skeletal and craniofacial anomalies seen in human skeletal ciliopathies ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22228095","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in components of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery required for assembly and function of the primary cilium cause a subset of human ciliopathies characterized primarily by skeletal dysplasia. Recently, mutations in the IFT-A gene IFT144 have been described in patients with Sensenbrenner and Jeune syndromes, which are associated with short ribs and limbs, polydactyly and craniofacial defects. Here, we describe an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-derived mouse mutant with a hypomorphic missense mutation in the Ift144 gene. The mutant twinkle-toes (Ift144(twt)) phenocopies a number of the skeletal and craniofacial anomalies seen in patients with human skeletal ciliopathies. Like other IFT-A mouse mutants, Ift144 mutant embryos display a generalized ligand-independent expansion of hedgehog (Hh) signalling, in spite of defective ciliogenesis and an attenuation of the ability of mutant cells to respond to upstream stimulation of the pathway. This enhanced Hh signalling is consistent with cleft palate and polydactyly phenotypes in the Ift144(twt) mutant, although extensive rib branching, fusion and truncation phenotypes correlate with defects in early somite patterning and may reflect contributions from multiple signalling pathways. Analysis of embryos harbouring a second allele of Ift144 which represents a functional null, revealed a dose-dependent effect on limb outgrowth consistent with the short-limb phenotypes characteristic of these ciliopathies. This allelic series of mouse mutants provides a unique opportunity to uncover the underlying mechanistic basis of this intriguing subset of ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Ashe A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in mouse Ift144 model the craniofacial, limb and rib defects in skeletal ciliopathies."},"rdfs:label":"Ashe_MouseModel"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5053,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:68b8b04b-f952-4423-805c-0ff2fe28ff2d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005308","gene":"hgnc:18340","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*WDR19* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ciliopathies in 2011 (Bedrup et al., PMID: 22019272). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. *WDR19* has been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: Cranioectodermal dysplasia 4 (OMIM:614378), Nephronophthisis 13 (OMIM:614377), Senior-Loken syndrome 8 (OMIM:616307), and Short-rib thoracic dysplasia 5 with or without polydactyly (OMIM:614376). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and the phenotypic variability was representative of a syndromic spectrum of ciliopathy disorders caused by *WDR19*. Therefore, the above disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, ciliopathy (MONDO:0005308). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22019272, 23683095, 23559409, 25726036) and are included in this curation. Additionally, variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, functional alteration studies, and animal models. (PMIDs: 33517396, 22228095, 25726036, 22019273). Expression studies demonstrated a reduction in ciliated cells, a lack of WDR19 in cilia, and diffuse cytoplasmic staining in cells from affected patients. Exogenous expression of *WDR19* variants in *WDR19*-knockout cells did not rescue ciliogenesis defects. Finally, ENU-derived mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation (p.Leu750Pro) in *Wdr19* replicate skeletal and craniofacial anomalies seen in human skeletal ciliopathies. In summary, *WDR19* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 5/25/22 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:418a6e41-45ad-411f-a40d-2f7cb61ff589"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
