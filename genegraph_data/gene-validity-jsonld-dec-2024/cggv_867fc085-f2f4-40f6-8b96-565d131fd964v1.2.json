The proposed disease mechanism is loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Three variants (all missense) have been reported in two probands in two publications (PMIDs: 25331638, 31656313) for a genetic evidence score of 1.75 points. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members (PMID: 31656313). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and an expression study (PMIDs: 25331638, 31656313) detailing expression of TMEM132E in the mouse cochlea, phenocopied ARNHL in Zebrafish, and wild type rescue of the phenotype seen in Zebrafish whereas the variant seen in the proband (PMID: 25331638) did not. This resulted in an experimental evidence score of 3.5 points. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/21/2017 (SOP Version 5).
