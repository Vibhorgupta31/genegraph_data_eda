In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an autophagosome is formed in the cytosol. The outer membrane of the autophagosome is fused with the vacuole, releasing the inner membrane structure, an autophagic body, into the vacuole. The autophagic body is subsequently degraded by vacuolar hydrolases. Taking advantage of yeast genetics, apg (autophagy-defective) mutants were isolated that are defective in terms of formation of autophagic bodies under nutrient starvation conditions. One of the APG gene products, Apg12p, is covalently attached to Apg5p via the C-terminal Gly of Apg12p as in the case of ubiquitylation, and this conjugation is essential for autophagy. Apg7p is a novel E1 enzyme essential for the Apg12p-conjugation system. In mammalian cells, the human Apg12p homolog (hApg12p) also conjugates with the human Apg5p homolog. In this study, the unique characteristics of hApg7p are shown. A two-hybrid experiment indicated that hApg12p interacts with hApg7p. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Cys(572) of hApg7p is an authentic active site cysteine residue essential for the formation of the hApg7p.hApg12p intermediate. Overexpression of hApg7p enhances the formation of the hApg5p.hApg12p conjugate, indicating that hApg7p is an E1-like enzyme essential for the hApg12p conjugation system. Cross-linking experiments and glycerol-gradient centrifugation analysis showed that the mammalian Apg7p homolog forms a homodimer as in yeast Apg7p. Each of three human Apg8p counterparts, i.e. the Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa, GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, coimmunoprecipitates with hApg7p and conjugates with mutant hApg7p(C572S) to form a stable intermediate via an ester bond. These results indicate that hApg7p is an authentic protein-activating enzyme for hApg12p and the three Apg8p homologs.","dc:creator":"Tanida I","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"The human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Apg7p is a Protein-activating enzyme for multiple substrates including human Apg12p, GATE-16, GABARAP, and MAP-LC3."},"rdfs:label":"ATG7 encodes autophagy-like 7 protein"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Per ClinGen LD GCEP guidelines, gene products that have a well-established function in a metabolic pathway are scored 2 points"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:bfee65a8-cbc9-4f1a-a4f7-5973ecff593d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:832277ff-82ed-433c-8867-2a02bbaddbfb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b94e9e64-e8ec-469c-bfca-2fb505ce6171","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"in SCAR31 patient fibroblasts (deficient for ATG7), transfection of wild-type ATG7 (via insertion of a pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid encoding wild-type ATG7) restored autophagic activity, as measured via LC3 lipidation ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34161705","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Autophagy is the major intracellular degradation route in mammalian cells.

In addition to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, emerging evidence points to the importance of autophagy--the bulk protein degradation pathway involved in starvation-induced and constitutive protein turnover--in the protein quality-control process. However, little is known about the precise roles of autophagy in neurons. Here we report that loss of Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), a gene essential for autophagy, leads to neurodegeneration. We found that mice lacking Atg7 specifically in the central nervous system showed behavioural defects, including abnormal limb-clasping reflexes and a reduction in coordinated movement, and died within 28 weeks of birth. Atg7 deficiency caused massive neuronal loss in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Notably, polyubiquitinated proteins accumulated in autophagy-deficient neurons as inclusion bodies, which increased in size and number with ageing. There was, however, no obvious alteration in proteasome function. Our results indicate that autophagy is essential for the survival of neural cells, and that impairment of autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders involving

relationship between the ATG7 gene and spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive 31 (SCAR31), was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 18, 2022. ATG7 encodes autophagy-related 7 protein, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 involved in cellular autophagy (i.e., cellular degradation and recycling of organelles and proteins) via binding ATG12 (ubiquitin-like molecule) to form a complex that mediates membrane fusion in autophagy (PMID: 11096062). ATG7 is deficient among patients with SCAR31, as reflected by severely diminished levels of ATG7 protein (measured via immunoblot analysis) in muscle cells and fibroblasts among patients with SCAR31 (PMID: 34161705), and SCAR31 patients show impaired autophagy, as reflected by accumulation of the autophagic substrate p62 and reduced autophagic flux (as reflected by reduced levels of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II) in patient fibroblasts (PMID: 34161705). \n\nThe disease mechanism of SCAR31 is loss of function. SCAR31 was first reported in 2021 (PMID: 34161705) and this was also the first report of biallelic variants in ATG7 among patients with SCAR31 (PMID: 34161705). In this report, a total of nine different ATG7 variants were noted among 12 individuals from five families and the variants segregated with disease in all families. The variants reported included nonsense, splice-site, and missense variants, and for eight of the nine variants, direct functional assessments demonstrated that they impaired wild-type protein function. To date, this first report (PMID: 34161705) appears to be the only report of biallelic ATG7 variants among patients with SCAR31. \n\nIn addition to the case-level (genetic) evidence (6.1 points total), there is also experimental evidence supporting the relationship between SCAR31 and ATG7 (6 points total). Experimental evidence for the relationship between ATG5 and SCAR31 includes the biochemical function of the gene product (autophagy-related 7 protein) being consistent with the impaired autophagy found in individuals with SCAR31 (PMID: 34161705), the biochemical and clinical features of a ATG7 knockout mouse model (PMID:16625205), and rescue autophagic activity in (ATG7-deficient) patient fibroblasts via reintroduction of wild-type ATG7 (PMID: 34161705). \n\nIn sum, based on the strength of the evidence from the published report to date, the association between ATG7 and SCAR31 reaches the score range for Definitive. However, to our knowledge, only a single report of human cases exists (PMID: 34161705); thus, per the ClinGen Gene Curation, the ATG7-SCAR31 association can currently be classified as Strong, and can be classified as Definitive once there are additional follow-up publications to demonstrate that the association has been replicated over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on September 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bfee65a8-cbc9-4f1a-a4f7-5973ecff593d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
