The phenotype varies from ear pits to profound hearing loss, branchial fistulae, and kidney agenesis. The most common gene mutated in BOR families is EYA1, a transcriptional activator. Over 80 different disease-causing mutations have been published (www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/labs/pendredandbor/, last accessed 20 November 2007). We analyzed the EYA1 coding region (16 exons) from 435 families (345 at the University of Iowa [UI] and 95 at Boys Town National Research Hospital [BTNRH], including five at both) and found 70 different EYA1 mutations in 89 families. Most of the mutations (56/70) were private. EYA1 mutations were found in 31% of families (76/248) fitting established clinical criteria for BOR and 7% of families with questionable BOR phenotype (13/187). Severity of the phenotype did not correlate with type of mutation nor with the domain involved. These results add considerably to the spectrum of EYA1 mutations associated with BOR and indicate that the BOR phenotype is an indication for molecular studies to diagnose EYA1-associated

The aberrant transcript was present at approximately 50% level of wild-type EYA1 mRNA in fibroblasts, and is predicted to encode an EYA1 protein retaining the amino terminal transcriptional coactivator region but lacking the conserved carboxy terminal Eya phosphatase domain. Patients with the c.867 + 5G > A mutation were found to have more severe renal abnormalities than probands with other mutations in this cohort.

Eya1 and other Eya gene products share a highly conserved 271 amino acid Eya domain that is required for protein-protein interaction. Recently, several point mutations that result in single amino acid substitutions in the conserved Eya domain region of EYA1 have been identified in BOR patients; however, the molecular and developmental basis of organ defects that occurred in BOR syndrome is unclear. To understand how these point mutations cause disease, we have analyzed the functional importance of these Eya domain missense mutations with respect to protein complex formation and cellular localization. We have demonstrated that these point mutations do not alter protein localization. However, four mutations are crucial for protein-protein interactions in both yeast and mammalian cells.

The deafness and abnormal behavior were shown to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and mapped to mouse chromosome 1 near the position of the Eya1 gene. The human homolog of this gene, EYA1, has been shown to underly branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hearing loss with associated branchial and renal anomalies. Molecular analysis of the Eya1 gene in mutant mice revealed the insertion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) element in intron 7. The presence of the IAP insertion was associated with reduced expression of the normal Eya1 message and formation of additional aberrant transcripts. The hypomorphic nature of the mutation may explain its recessive inheritance, if protein levels in homozygotes, but not heterozygotes, are below a critical threshold needed for normal developmental function. The new mouse mutation is designated Eya1(bor) to denote its similarity to human BOR syndrome, and will provide a valuable model for studying mutant gene expression and etiology.","dc:creator":"Johnson KR","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Inner ear and kidney anomalies caused by IAP insertion in an intron of the Eya1 gene in a mouse model of BOR syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Johnson Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":256,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:df20fd40-e4a9-416e-9787-297062e12ee9","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007029","gene":"hgnc:3519","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The EYA1 gene has been associated with autosomal dominant Branchio-oto-renal syndrome using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 10/17/17. This association was made using case-level data. Multiple missense, nonsense, frameshift and splice-site variants have been reported in humans. EYA1 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1997 (Abdelhak et al.​). Nine probands, familial and de novo, were scored for this curation (9020840, 18220287, 19206155). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by a spontaneous mouse model, a Xenopus model and a rescue in Xenopus oocytes (10072433, 19951260). In summary, EYA1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Branchio-oto-renal syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 11/21/17.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dca41ef6-ee63-4b1f-93d3-8b114dafcc58"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
