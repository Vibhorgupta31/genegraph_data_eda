Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"ICIMD Review"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes within a shared pathway"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7975,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:65becc27-1ef9-48d0-a252-f81a5b12da7a","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:7427","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-CYB* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 4, 2024. The *MT-CYB* gene encodes cytochrome b, the core catalytic subunit of respiratory chain complex III (ubiquinone: cytochrome c oxidoreductase). Defects in this gene lead to isolated complex III deficiency.  \n\nThe *MT-CYB* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 1996 (PMID: 8910895), in an adult male with a childhood onset of progressive exercise intolerance. Subsequent publications reported additional individuals with a progressive exercise as well as progressive multisystem disease manifestations (encephalopathy, headaches, ataxia, hearing loss, cataracts, retinal dystrophy, ophthalmoplegia, epilepsy, nausea, vomiting, Wolff-Parkinson-White arrhythmia). In most cases, affected individuals had elevated lactate levels with muscle biopsies revealing an isolated complex III deficiency and ragged red fibers. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-CYB*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-CYB* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 12 unique variants reported in 12 cases from eight publications (PMIDs: 8910895, 11047755, 12686403, 11464242, 10502593, 9894887, 11601507, 9894888). Variants included six nonsense (m.15059G>A, m.15150G>A, m.15168G>A, m.15242G>A, m.15761G>A, m.15084G>A), one frameshift (m.14787_14790delTTAA), one in-frame deletion (m.15498-15521del24), and four missense variants (m.14846G>A, m.15197T>C , m.15579A>G, m.15615G>A). Cybrids studies (PMIDs: 24863938, 11601507) and single fiber testing (PMIDs: 9894887, 10502593, 11047755) further supported the pathogenicity of several of these variants.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease (PMID: 33340416).   \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MT-CYB* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 4, 2024, (SOP Version 10).
