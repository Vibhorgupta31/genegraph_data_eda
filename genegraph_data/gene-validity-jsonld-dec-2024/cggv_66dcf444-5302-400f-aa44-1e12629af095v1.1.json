We identified three unrelated individuals with a rare recessively inherited form of EDS (characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and cardiac valvular defects); in two of them, COL1A2 messenger RNA (mRNA) instability results from compound heterozygosity for splice site mutations in the COL1A2 gene, and, in the third, it results from homozygosity for a nonsense codon. The splice site mutations led to use of cryptic splice donor sites, creation of a downstream premature termination codon, and extremely unstable mRNA. In the wild-type allele, the two introns (IVS11 and IVS24) in which these mutations occurred were usually spliced slowly in relation to their respective immediate upstream introns. In the mutant alleles, the upstream intron was removed, so that exon skipping could not occur. In the context of the mutation in IVS24, computer-generated folding of a short stretch of mRNA surrounding the mutation site demonstrated realignment of the relationships between the donor and acceptor sites that could facilitate use of a cryptic donor site. These findings suggest that the order of intron removal is an important variable in prediction of mutation outcome at splice sites and that folding of the nascent mRNA could be one element that contributes to determination of order of splicing. The complete absence of pro alpha 2(I) chains has the surprising effect of producing cardiac valvular disease without bone involvement.","dc:creator":"Schwarze U","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Rare autosomal recessive cardiac valvular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome results from mutations in the COL1A2 gene that activate the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway."}},{"id":"cggv:2b6da783-35ef-47ec-99aa-484fd1cfa0e2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6aebd71b-0410-4c7c-bfc1-99cf858b6886"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15077201"}],"rdfs:label":"Schwarze_Proband_1"},{"id":"cggv:2b6da783-35ef-47ec-99aa-484fd1cfa0e2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b6da783-35ef-47ec-99aa-484fd1cfa0e2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:2bf21947-2b9b-401a-9619-9dc87b744eab","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2bf21947-2b9b-401a-9619-9dc87b744eab_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:76e92a95-192b-431d-afe0-a1ed1af8203f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76e92a95-192b-431d-afe0-a1ed1af8203f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":30,"allele":{"id":"cggv:414fb32f-c408-4973-b8d2-775c1516937a"},"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001634","obo:HP_0002816","obo:HP_0001631","obo:HP_0000978","obo:HP_0001653","obo:HP_0001058","obo:HP_0000977","obo:HP_0000592","obo:HP_0001382"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:d92c4f85-2651-4998-a952-75808768445e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:414fb32f-c408-4973-b8d2-775c1516937a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15077201"},"rdfs:label":"Schwarze_Proband_3"},{"id":"cggv:d92c4f85-2651-4998-a952-75808768445e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d92c4f85-2651-4998-a952-75808768445e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinuity.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cardiac valvular type is a connective tissue disorder primarily affecting the skin, joints, and blood vessel walls. This syndrome is typically characterized by the presence of joint hypermobility, soft hyperextensibility, easy bruisability, and atrophic scar formation with the presence of cardiac valvular defects comprising mitral and/or aortic valve insufficiency. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities,  osteogenesis imperfecta type II (OMIM:166210), osteogenesis imperfecta type III (OMIM:259420), osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV (OMIM:166220), Combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 2\t(OMIM:619120), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 2 (OMIM:617821), and Osteoporosis, postmenopausal (OMIM:166710). The split curations have been curated separately. Five variants (nonsense and splice site) that have been reported in 5 probands in three publications (PMIDs: 30821104, 16816023, 15077201) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, *COL1A2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cardiac valvular type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 12/5/22 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:66dcf444-5302-400f-aa44-1e12629af095"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
