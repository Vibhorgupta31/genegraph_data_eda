This has been well-documented in the literature, and is shown here in a representative piece of evidence from an X-ray crystal structure of the hemoglobin complex in the oxygen-bound state.

Data were collected on an Arndt-Wonacott camera at -2 degrees C. The structure was refined to an R factor of 0.223 by the Jack-Levitt method, starting from Baldwin's model of human carbon monoxide haemoglobin. The active sites in the alpha and beta subunit are distinct. The iron atoms are 0.16(8) A and 0.00(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin carbons and nitrogens (0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin nitrogens) in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively, in correlation with the orientation of HisF8 relative to the porphyrin nitrogens. The haem group appears to be nearly planar in the alpha subunit but ruffled in the beta subunit. The Fe-O(1)-O(2) angles are 153(7) degrees and 159(12) degrees in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively. The oxygen molecule forms a hydrogen bond to N epsilon of HisE7 in the alpha, but either none or a weak one in the beta subunit. The following bond lengths were found: Fe-N epsilon (HisF8) = 1.94(9) A (alpha) and 2.07(9) A (beta); Fe-O(1) = 1.66(8) A (alpha) and 1.87(13) A (beta); Fe-Nporph (mean = 1.99(5) A (alpha) and 1.96(6) A (beta). These dimensions agree with the values obtained in oxymyoglobin and model compounds. The C-terminal residues, ArgHC3(141 alpha) and HisHC3(146 beta), are relatively delocalized, and their positions do not enable them to form the intersubunit salt bridges in which they are involved in deoxyhaemoglobin. The penultimate tyrosine residues, TyrHC2 140 alpha and 145 beta, are relatively localized and maintain the hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of ValFG5 (93 alpha and 98 beta), with only minor variations compared to their geometry in deoxyhaemoglobin. TyrHC2(145 beta), however, alternates between a major and a minor site, in conjunction with CysF9(93 beta), both sharing the internal pocket between the F and H helices while in the major conformation. This suggests that the role of the penultimate tyrosines in the allosteric mechanism may differ from that previously proposed by Perutz. The overall quaternary structure of oxyhaemoglobin is identical, within experimental error, to that of carbon monoxide haemoglobin, and thus confirms the applicability of the allosteric mechanisms proposed by Perutz and Baldwin & Chothia to the process of oxygen binding.","dc:creator":"Shaanan B","dc:date":"1983","dc:title":"Structure of human oxyhaemoglobin at 2.1 A resolution."},"rdfs:label":"Shaanan Protein-Protein"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The GCEP decided to upgrade this evidence in previous curations on the globin genes."},{"id":"cggv:a53a3211-6c9b-4ba1-95ca-5595decbc29d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1dc3e621-6ccb-40d6-bf64-6c303717fbd5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The ability to bind and release oxygen is relevant to erythrocytosis, a disease characterized by an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11747442","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"By using transgenic methodologies, we have produced a number of mouse/human chimeric hemoglobins containing adult mouse and human embryonic globin chains.

Further analysis traces the origins of these effects to alterations in the properties of the T states of these proteins.

Erythrocytosis 7 is a disorder of the blood characterized by a high concentration of erythrocytes in the blood and an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability in erythrocytosis 7 relative to other disease entities associated with *HBA1*. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into curations; AD erythrocytosis, AD and AR alpha-thalassemia, unstable hemoglobin disease, and methemoglobinemia. This curation addresses only AD erythrocytosis. This curation includes at least 8 missense and 1 indel variants reported in 9 probands with AD erythrocytosis in 9 publications (PMIDs: 5913291, 11123, 701083, 3973024, 3667323, 3142772, 14649314, 24200101, 28532286). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 15 additional family members (PMID: 5913291). This gene disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including expression, biochemical function, and protein-protein interactions (PMIDs: 11747442, 6644819).  In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on 10/25/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:df23db1a-3b2f-497f-87c4-556c51e7bdd6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
