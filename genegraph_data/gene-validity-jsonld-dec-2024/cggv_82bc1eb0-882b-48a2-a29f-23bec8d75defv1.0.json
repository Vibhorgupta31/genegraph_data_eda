By multi-gene panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) in patients with Joubert syndrome, we identified two more patients and summarize what is currently known about the phenotypes associated with sequence variants in these genes. In a boy aged 12 years with intellectual disability and the classical molar tooth sign on MRI, a homozygous splice-site sequence variant in TCTN3 leading to in-frame skipping of exon 7 was detected. A previously described non-truncating sequence variant in TCTN3 was also associated with Joubert syndrome, whereas four truncating sequence variants were detected in patients with Meckel-Gruber or Mohr-Majewski syndrome. The second patient, a boy aged 7 years with severe psychomotor retardation, was found to carry a homozygous canonic splice-site sequence variant in TCTN2. So far, only three sequence variants associated with Joubert syndrome and two with Meckel-Gruber syndrome have been described in this gene. Reviewing the clinical data on patients with sequence variants in the tectonic genes TCTN1-3 reveals that all of them have a neurological phenotype with vermis hypoplasia or occipital encephalocele associated with severe intellectual disability in the surviving patients. In contrast, other features frequently seen in patients with ciliopathies such as nephronophthisis, liver fibrosis, retinal dystrophy or coloboma have not been reported. Our patients emphasize the usefulness and efficacy of a comprehensive NGS panel approach. A concise genetic diagnosis may help to prevent unnecessary investigations and improve the clinical management of these patients.","dc:creator":"Huppke P","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Tectonic gene mutations in patients with Joubert syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Huppke_Proband"},{"id":"cggv:ae0c2c87-9aa9-42ab-824a-56e9e4c75602","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae0c2c87-9aa9-42ab-824a-56e9e4c75602_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"-0.25 Homozygous\n-0.25 Consanguinity  "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:49f9242b-520f-4448-8bfd-4d47d75608e8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:49f9242b-520f-4448-8bfd-4d47d75608e8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2926fe66-e9e7-4d9b-a19d-6a6153401754"},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide homozygosity mapping ","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001320","obo:HP_0001252"],"secondTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:e244e847-1622-4a77-9da8-bd0dd851bdc6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2926fe66-e9e7-4d9b-a19d-6a6153401754"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21565611","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Nephronophthisis (NPHP), Joubert (JBTS), and Meckel-Gruber (MKS) syndromes are autosomal-recessive ciliopathies presenting with cystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and cerebellar/neural tube malformation.

Using high-confidence proteomics, we identified 850 interactors copurifying with nine NPHP/JBTS/MKS proteins and discovered three connected modules: \"NPHP1-4-8\" functioning at the apical surface, \"NPHP5-6\" at centrosomes, and \"MKS\" linked to Hedgehog signaling. Assays for ciliogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis in 3D renal cultures link renal cystic disease to apical organization defects, whereas ciliary and Hedgehog pathway defects lead to retinal or neural deficits. Using 38 interactors as candidates, linkage and sequencing analysis of 250 patients identified ATXN10 and TCTN2 as new NPHP-JBTS genes, and our Tctn2 mouse knockout shows neural tube and Hedgehog signaling defects.

As described here, we investigated Tectonic1 (Tctn1), a regulator of mouse Hedgehog signaling, and found that it is essential for ciliogenesis in some, but not all, tissues. Cell types that do not require Tctn1 for ciliogenesis require it to localize select membrane-associated proteins to the cilium, including Arl13b, AC3, Smoothened and Pkd2. Tctn1 forms a complex with multiple ciliopathy proteins associated with Meckel and Joubert syndromes, including Mks1, Tmem216, Tmem67, Cep290, B9d1, Tctn2 and Cc2d2a. Components of this complex co-localize at the transition zone, a region between the basal body and ciliary axoneme. Like Tctn1, loss of Tctn2, Tmem67 or Cc2d2a causes tissue-specific defects in ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition. Consistent with a shared function for complex components, we identified a mutation in TCTN1 that causes Joubert syndrome. Thus, a transition zone complex of Meckel and Joubert syndrome proteins regulates ciliary assembly and trafficking, suggesting that transition zone dysfunction is the cause of these ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Garcia-Gonzalo FR","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A transition zone complex regulates mammalian ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition."},"rdfs:label":"Garcia-Gonzalo_Protein Interaction "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:82bc1eb0-882b-48a2-a29f-23bec8d75def_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9abbfb69-7a4e-466b-beb1-6727ea4eddbf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81e37584-cccd-4b8e-8479-0c12cd6d93df","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Demonstrated that TCTN2 was required for Ciliogenesis in isolated cells (MEFs) and in vivo, consistent with TCTN2 being a ciliopathy gene in mice \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21565611","rdfs:label":"Sang_Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:8fb0dd23-dd6b-462c-b8cf-b08000d6bd35","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eafd511c-cb43-401a-83b6-c6e1bfd16c8d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"showed that Tctn2 affects Ciliogenesis in a tissue-specific manner. \n\n\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21725307","rdfs:label":"Garcia-Gonzalo_Mouse "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6651,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8796facd-1c67-4592-8252-4d786a7b85ce","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014724","gene":"hgnc:25774","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"TCTN2 is located on chromosome 12 at 12q24.31 and encodes the Tectonic family member 2\ntype I membrane protein. The TCTN2 protein is a component of the tectonic-like complex which is localized at the transition zone of primary cilia and acts as a barrier that prevents diffusion of transmembrane proteins between the cilia and plasma membranes. TCTN2 was first reported in relation to Joubert Syndrome 24 in 2011 (Sang et al., PMID: 21565611). Joubert Syndrome is an autosomal recessive ciliopathy characterized by delays in psychomotor development in addition to congenital malformations of the brainstem appearing as agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis on brain imaging. TCTN2 has been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: Joubert Syndrome and Meckel Syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. We additionally found that observed phenotypic variability was representative of Meckel syndrome presenting as a severe manifestation on the phenotypic spectrum of Joubert Syndrome. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Joubert Syndrome 24 (OMIM:616654). A total of 6 variants (splice site, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in 6 probands in 4 publications (PMID: Shaheen et al., 2011, PMID: 21462283; PMID: 21565611; Huppke et al., 2015, PMID: 25118024; Zhang et al., 2020, PMID: 32655147) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, protein interaction studies and mouse models (Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011, PMID: 21725307; PMID: 21462283; PMID: 21565611). TCTN2 was shown to have significant levels of expression in mice in tissues commonly affected in Meckel Syndrome. Additionally, TCTN2 was shown to interact with another component of the tectonic-like complex and also implicated in Joubert Syndrome, TCTN1.  The gene-disease relationship is supported by two mouse models, with a ciliopathy phenotype shown in one TCTN2 null mouse and further recapitulation of the human phenotype in another. In summary, TCTN2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Joubert Syndrome 24. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 02.01.2023 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:82bc1eb0-882b-48a2-a29f-23bec8d75def"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
