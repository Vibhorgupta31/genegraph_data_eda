In 93 patients, a type V collagen defect was found, of which 73 were COL5A1 mutations, 13 were COL5A2 mutations and seven were COL5A1 null-alleles with mutation unknown. The majority of the 73 COL5A1 mutations generated a COL5A1 null-allele, whereas one-third were structural mutations, scattered throughout COL5A1. All COL5A2 mutations were structural mutations. Reduced availability of type V collagen appeared to be the major disease-causing mechanism, besides other intra- and extracellular contributing factors. All type V collagen defects were identified within a group of 102 patients fulfilling all major clinical Villefranche criteria, that is, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. No COL5A1/COL5A2 mutation was detected in 24 patients who displayed skin and joint hyperextensibility but lacked dystrophic scarring.

Mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene encoding the alpha1(V) and the alpha2(V) chains, respectively, of type V collagen have been shown to cause the disorder, but it is unknown what proportion of classic EDS patients carries a mutation in these genes. We studied fibroblast cultures from 48 patients with classic EDS by SDS-PAGE for the presence of type V collagen defects. An abnormal collagen pattern was detected in only 2 out of 48 cell lines, making this a poor method for routine diagnostic evaluation. A total of 42 out of 48 (88%) patients were heterozygous for an expressed polymorphic variant in COL5A1. cDNA from 18 (43%) of them expressed only one COL5A1 allele. In 37 patients, the COL5A1/A2 genes were then analyzed by SSCP and conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE). A total of 26 patients that were mutation-negative after SSCP/CSGE screening were reanalyzed by dHPLC. In addition, 11 other patients were analyzed by dHPLC only. In total, 17 mutations leading to a premature stop codon and five structural mutations were identified in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 genes. In three patients with a positive COL5A1 null-allele test, no causal mutation was found. Overall, in 25 out of 48 patients (52%) with classic EDS, an abnormality in type V collagen was confirmed. Variability in severity of the phenotype was observed, but no significant genotype-phenotype correlations emerged. The relatively low mutation detection rate suggests that other genes are involved in classic EDS.

The first proband was heterozygous for a 7 bp deletion that resulted in skipping of exon 27 while the second proband was heterozygous for a single nucleotide substitution that resulted in skipping of exon 28. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from both probands produced about equal amounts of the normal and mutant alpha2(V) mRNAs and protein chains. The dermis from the first proband contained a sparse collagen fibrillar network with great variability in collagen fibril sizes and shapes. The dermal collagens were also abnormally soluble. Bone cells from the first proband also produced about equal amounts of the normal and mutant alpha2(V) mRNAs. However, the collagen fibrillar architecture and collagen solubility of the bone matrix were normal.

First described by Beighton in 1968, classic EDS (formerly known as EDS type I or “gravis” and type II or “mitis”) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibilty, and skin fragility leading to atrophic scarring (reviewed in Bowen et al, 2017, PMID: 28192633; Malfait et al, 2018, PMID 20301422). This curation includes nineteen unique variants (splicing variants causing in frame deletions, missense variants, one in frame deletion/insertion, and a 3’ terminal frameshift not expected to undergo nonsense-mediated decay) that have been reported in nineteen probands meeting clinical criteria for classic EDS in six publications (Michalickova et al, 1998, PMID: 9425231; Richards et al, 1998, PMID: 9783710; Malfait et al, 2005, PMID: 15580559; Symoens et al, 2012, PMID: 22696272; Ritelli et al, 2013, PMID: 23587214, Watanabe et al, 2016, PMID: 27656288). Of note, none of these variants is predicted to result in lack of protein. Like the other fibrillar collagens, alpha2(V) has a long uninterrupted triple helix of Gly-X-Y repeats. The glycine residues have been shown to be important to the triple helix structure (Long et al, 1993, PMID 8218237; Bella et al, 1994, PMID 7695699; Shoulders and Raines, 2009, PMID 19344236). Ten of the variants curated here cause in frame deletion of 18-36 amino acids in the helical domain, and one is an in frame insertion/deletion. With the exception of one frameshift in the 3’ end of the gene, all of the other variants curated involved missense substitutions of a glycine residue in the helical domain. Alteration or loss of the Gly-X-Y repeats in the helical region is expected to result in a dominant-negative mechanism of disease, with up to 50% of Collagen V chains incorporating an altered alpha2(V) chain. The relationship between COL5A2 and classic EDS is also supported by experimental evidence. This includes the biochemical function of COL5A2 in regulating collagen fiber size in the extra-cellular matrix, which is consistent with the clinical features of the condition (Andrikopoulos et al., 1995, PMID: 7704020; Fichard et al, 1995, PMID: 8535602; the interaction of the gene product of COL5A2 (alpha2(V)) in a triple helical structure with the gene product of COL5A1 (alpha1(V), another gene with a definitive relationship with classic EDS (Bentz H, et al., 1978, PMID: 738278); functional alteration evidence in which fibroblasts and dermis samples from a patient with classic EDS and a COL5A2 variant show abnormalities in collagen solubility and collagen fibril size (Michalickova et al, 1998, PMID: 9425231); the clinical features of animal models including a cow model with skin abnormalities and a COL5A2 variant (Jacinto et al, 2020, PMID: 33143196), a conditional mouse knockout with fragile skin and poor wound-healing (Park et al, 2017, PMID: 28734943), and mouse model with an in frame deletion of the N-telopeptide domain in which homozygotes have fragile, hyperextensible skin (Andrikopoulos et al, 1995, PMID: 7704020). In summary, COL5A2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant classic EDS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease classification was approved by the General Gene Curation Expert panel on March 24th, 2021.\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1901d495-d33f-4741-88fd-4b66ac43bbad"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
