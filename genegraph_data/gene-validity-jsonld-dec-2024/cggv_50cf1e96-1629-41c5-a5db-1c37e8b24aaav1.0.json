Although survival to adulthood has been reported, most patients die within the first six months of life. Recently, we found mutations of ENPP1 coding for ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 to be associated with GACI in 8 of 11 families. In this study, we analyzed ENPP1 in affected individuals of another 12 unrelated families. We identified 11 novel homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in 10 of the 12 new families. The mutations (1 nonsense, 7 missense, 1 single amino acid deletion, and 2 frame shift mutations) were scattered over the whole coding region with a slightly more condensed distribution within the catalytic and nuclease-like domain as compared to the first survey. In this study, three mutations were found repeatedly in apparently unrelated patients, 7 x c.913C>A (p.Pro305Thr) and c.2662C [corrected]>T (p.Arg888Trp) as well as c.2320C>T (p.Arg774Cys) each twice. However, haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect of British extraction for mutation c.913C>A (p.Pro305Thr). The fact that the two other mutations c.2662C [corrected]>T (p.Arg888Trp) and c.2320C>T (p.Arg774Cys) occurred twice within a single allele also suggests a single founder. This study confirms the role of ENPP1 mutations as the main cause of GACI and adds considerably to the mutational spectrum of ENPP1.","dc:creator":"Ruf N","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"The mutational

the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL) is a common form of human myelopathy caused by a compression of the spinal cord by ectopic ossification of spinal ligaments. To elucidate the genetic basis for OPLL, we have been studying the ttw (tiptoe walking; previously designated twy) mouse, a naturally occurring mutant which exhibits ossification of the spinal ligaments very similar to human OPLL (refs 3,4). Using a positional candidate-gene approach, we determined the ttw phenotype is caused by a nonsense mutation (glycine 568 to stop) in the Npps gene which encodes nucleotide pyrophosphatase. This enzyme regulates soft-tissue calcification and bone mineralization by producing inorganic pyrophosphate, a major inhibitor of calcification. The accelerated bone formation characteristic of ttw mice is likely to result from dysfunction of NPPS caused by predicted truncation of the gene product, resulting in the loss of more than one-third of the native protein. Our results may lead to novel insights into the mechanism of ectopic ossification and the aetiology of human OPLL.","dc:creator":"Okawa A","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutation in Npps in a mouse model of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine."},"rdfs:label":"Okawa_Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Mouse model downgraded because it doesn't recapitulate the human phenotype exactly"},{"id":"cggv:d8f89c98-fec2-4d6f-9ab3-b4f6bac26127","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dcf418d2-8b15-4c4c-890a-7627569dc6e0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Like the human phenotype, the mice showed periarticular calcification","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24770645","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We recently have reported on a novel ankylosis gene that is closely linked to the Enpp1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1) gene on chromosome 10. Here, we have discovered novel mutant mice in a Jcl:ICR closed colony with ankylosis in the toes of the forelimbs at about 3 weeks of age. The mutant mice exhibited rigidity in almost all joints, including the vertebral column, which increased with age. These mice also showed hypogrowth with age after 16 weeks due to a loss of visceral fat, which may have been caused by poor nutrition. Histological examination and soft X-ray imaging demonstrated the ectopic ossification of various joints in the mutant mice. In particular, increased calcium deposits were observed in the joints of the toes, the carpal bones and the vertebral column. We sequenced all exons and exon/intron boundaries of Enpp1 in the normal and mutant mice, and identified a G-to-T substitution (c.259+1G>T) in the 5' splice donor site of intron 2 in the Enpp1 gene of the mutant mice. This substitution led to the skipping of exon 2 (73 bp), which generated a stop codon at position 354 bp (amino acid 62) of the cDNA (p.V63Xfs). Nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase (NPPH) activity of ENPP1 in the mutant mice was also decreased, suggesting that Enpp1 gene function is disrupted in this novel mutant.

The affected individuals in most cases die within the first year of life, and there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder. In this study, we characterized a spontaneous mutant mouse, asj-2J, as a model for GACI. These mice were identified as part of a phenotypic deviant search in a large-scale production colony of BALB/cJ mice at The Jackson Laboratory. They demonstrated a characteristic gait due to stiffening of the joints, with phenotypic similarity to a previously characterized asj (\"ages with stiffened joints\") mouse, caused by a missense mutation in the Enpp1 gene. Complementation testing indicated that asj-2J and asj were allelic. PCR-based mutation detection strategy revealed in asj-2J mice a large, 40,035 bp, deletion spanning from intron 1 to the 3'-untranslated region of the Enpp1 gene, coupled with a 74 bp insertion. This was accompanied with a significant reduction in the plasma PPi concentration and reduced PPi/Pi ratio. As a consequence, extensive aberrant mineralization affecting the arterial vasculature, a number of internal organs, and the dermal sheath of vibrissae, a progressive biomarker of the ectopic mineralization process, was demonstrated by a combination of micro computed tomography, histopathology with calcium-specific stains, and direct chemical assay of calcium. Comparison of the asj and asj-2J mice demonstrated that the latter ones, particularly when placed on an acceleration diet high in phosphate and low in magnesium, had more extensive mineralization. Thus, the asj-2J mouse serves as a novel model for GACI, a currently intractable disorder.","dc:creator":"Li Q","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Spontaneous asj-2J mutant mouse as a model for generalized arterial calcification of infancy: a large deletion/insertion mutation in the Enpp1 gene."},"rdfs:label":"Li_mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Model was downgraded because it did not fully recapitulate the human phenotype"},{"id":"cggv:2cb46ed9-5bd1-48d4-9fba-2f19ee0e6e80","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dca94193-3f8b-4473-b4fb-9b7573e72e4f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Human phenotype includes ectopic mineralization, early onset perichondrial ossification with calcification in the inter-cranial space, myocardium, and in the skin, and ectopic calcifications in the eye and craniofacial bones","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24906371","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In recent years it has become clear that, mechanistically, biomineralization is a process that has to be actively inhibited as a default state. This inhibition must be released in a rigidly controlled manner in order for mineralization to occur in skeletal elements and teeth. A central aspect of this concept is the tightly controlled balance between phosphate, a constituent of the biomineral hydroxyapatite, and pyrophosphate, a physiochemical inhibitor of mineralization. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of a zebrafish mutant, dragonfish (dgf), which is mutant for ectonucleoside pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1), a protein that is crucial for supplying extracellular pyrophosphate. Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a fatal human disease, and the majority of cases are thought to be caused by mutations in ENPP1. Furthermore, some cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) have recently been linked to ENPP1. Similar to humans, we show here that zebrafish enpp1 mutants can develop ectopic calcifications in a variety of soft tissues - most notably in the skin, cartilage elements, the heart, intracranial space and the notochord sheet. Using transgenic reporter lines, we demonstrate that ectopic mineralizations in these tissues occur independently of the expression of typical osteoblast or cartilage markers. Intriguingly, we detect cells expressing the osteoclast markers Trap and CathepsinK at sites of ectopic calcification at time points when osteoclasts are not yet present in wild-type siblings. Treatment with the bisphosphonate etidronate rescues aspects of the dgf phenotype, and we detected deregulated expression of genes that are involved in phosphate homeostasis and mineralization, such as fgf23, npt2a, entpd5 and spp1 (also known as osteopontin). Employing a UAS-GalFF approach, we show that forced expression of enpp1 in blood vessels or the floorplate of mutant embryos is sufficient to rescue the notochord mineralization phenotype. This indicates that enpp1 can exert its function in tissues that are remote from its site of expression.","dc:creator":"Apschner A","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Zebrafish enpp1 mutants exhibit pathological mineralization, mimicking features of generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) and pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)."},"rdfs:label":"Apschner_zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Syndromic disorders GCEP downgrades zebrafish model to 1 point because of potential off-target effects of morpholinos"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9203,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0ea9726e-acef-4a04-9024-fc10d8796195","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008817","gene":"hgnc:3356","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The ENPP1 gene is located on chromosome 6 at 6q23.2 and encodes the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 protein, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP to produce extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which inhibits bone mineralization and soft tissue calcification. ENPP1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive generalized arterial calcification of infancy, hypophosphatemic rickets, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum in 2003 (Rutsch et al., PMID: 12881724). The disorder is characterized by infantile onset of arterial calcification and/or narrowing of medium- and large-sized vessels that cause cardiovascular findings. Additional features can include pseudoxanthoma elasticum, periarticular calcifications, rickets, cervical spine fusion, and hearing loss.\nENPP1 has also been associated with autosomal dominant hypopigmentation-punctate palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome, or Cole disease, by Eytan et al. in 2013 (PMID: 24075184). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we identified differences in inheritance pattern and in clinical phenotype between hypopigmentation-punctate palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome and the remaining disorders, where we found no clear difference in the phenotypic variability or molecular mechanism(s) underlying the disease entities. Therefore, the diseases were split into generalized arterial calcification of infancy 1 (OMIM: 208000), which includes autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and hypopigmentation-punctate palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome (OMIM: 615522). The split curation for autosomal dominant hypopigmentation-punctate palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome has been curated separately. \nEvidence supporting the relationship between ENPP1 and generalized arterial calcification of infancy 1 includes case-level data. Thirteen variants (including 4 nonsense, 3 frameshift, and 6 missense variants in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state) that have been reported in 7 probands from 3 publications (Rutsch et al. 2003, PMID: 12881724; Ruf et al. 2005, Mehta et al. 2012, PMID: 22539483) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be biallelic loss of function (Ralph et al. 2022, PMID: 35475527). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by several animal models, including zebrafish and mice, that recapitulate many features of the human disease phenotype (Okawa et al. 1998, PMID: 9662402; Takabayashi et al. 2014, PMID: 24770645; Apschner et al. 2014, PMID: 24906371; Li et al. 2014, PMID: 25479107). \nIn summary, ENPP1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive generalized arterial calcification of infancy 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 06.17.2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:50cf1e96-1629-41c5-a5db-1c37e8b24aaa"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
