The most significant clinical findings were tubulopathy (hyperuricemia, metabolic alkalosis), pulmonary hypertension, and progressive renal failure in infancy (HUPRA syndrome). Analysis of the consanguineous pedigree suggested that the causative mutation is in the nuclear DNA. By using genome-wide SNP homozygosity analysis, we identified a homozygous identity-by-descent region on chromosome 19 and detected the pathogenic mutation c.1169A>G (p.Asp390Gly) in SARS2, encoding the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase. The same homozygous mutation was later identified in a third infant with HUPRA syndrome. The carrier rate of this mutation among inhabitants of this Palestinian isolate was found to be 1:15. The mature enzyme catalyzes the ligation of serine to two mitochondrial tRNA isoacceptors: tRNA(Ser)(AGY) and tRNA(Ser)(UCN). Analysis of amino acylation of the two target tRNAs, extracted from immortalized peripheral lymphocytes derived from two patients, revealed that the p.Asp390Gly mutation significantly impacts on the acylation of tRNA(Ser)(AGY) but probably not that of tRNA(Ser)(UCN). Marked decrease in the expression of the nonacylated transcript and the complete absence of the acylated tRNA(Ser)(AGY) suggest that this mutation leads to significant loss of function and that the uncharged transcripts undergo degradation.","dc:creator":"Belostotsky R","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations in the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase cause hyperuricemia, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure in infancy and alkalosis, HUPRA syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient F2:II-2"},{"id":"cggv:5241e035-2b2b-4bb4-9d19-5abf25ea82f5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5241e035-2b2b-4bb4-9d19-5abf25ea82f5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5241e035-2b2b-4bb4-9d19-5abf25ea82f5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"see Belostotsky et al. 2011, Case F1:III-1"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"In GCEP review there was debate as to whether this variant should be considered as a founder given the 1/15 carrier frequency (7/103 samples) in the village that Family 1 and Family 2 originate from.

We report here a homozygous splicing mutation in SARS2 in a patient with progressive spastic paresis. We show that the mutation leads to diminished levels of the synthetase in patient's fibroblasts. This has a destabilizing effect on the tRNASer(AGY) isoacceptor, but to a lesser degree than in HUPRA syndrome patients. tRNASer(UCN) is largely unaffected in both phenotypes. In conclusion, the level of tRNASer(AGY) instability may be a factor in determining tissue manifestation in patients with SARS2 mutations.

Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.","dc:creator":"Boczonadi V","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial DNA transcription and translation: clinical syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Boczonadi review"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10+ genes with a function in mitochondrial translation associated with PMD "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d49e2a27-bd5f-4bc5-8d41-e3f0b4b043ad_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56c35c7d-3157-4967-bb76-4abe97fc4ce1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a84853cf-0d98-47bc-ac5e-b8a133880b9a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"SARS2 depletion in early erythroblasts results in decreased proliferation rate and differentiation arrest due to increased apoptosis.

The *SARS2* gene encodes mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe *SARS2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2011 (PMID: 21255763).  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SARS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine unique variants, including eight missense variants and one splice-site variant. Nine probands were reported in nine publications between 2011-2022 (PMIDs: 21255763, 24034276, 33751860, 34407605, 35445976, 33972171, 27279129, 28716262, 31607746). The condition was first described in a consanguineous family from Palestine in a male proband and a similarly affected female cousin with early onset severe hyperuricemia, pulmonary hypertension, progressive renal failure, alkalosis, anemia, and elevated blood lactate levels (referred to by the acronym HUPRA syndrome for **h**yper**u**ricemia, **p**ulmonary hypertension, **r**enal failure, and **a**lkalosis). Subsequent publications have reported five additional cases with a consistently severe phenotype characterized by progressive kidney failure and pulmonary hypertension. In addition, there have been three reports of individuals with a predominant spastic paresis phenotype with infantile or childhood onset associated with a variable developmental delay and/or intellectual disability. No segregation data were available. Loss or altered function is proposed as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by its known biochemical function that is shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 6, 2022 (SOP Version 8).
