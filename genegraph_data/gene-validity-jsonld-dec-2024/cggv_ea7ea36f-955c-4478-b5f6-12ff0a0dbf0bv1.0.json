Mutations in genes that encode proteins of the FA pathway fail to orchestrate the repair of DNA damage caused by DNA interstrand crosslinks. Zebrafish harbor homologs for nearly all known FA genes. We used multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to generate loss-of-function mutants for 17 FA genes: fanca, fancb, fancc, fancd1/brca2, fancd2, fance, fancf, fancg, fanci, fancj/brip1, fancl, fancm, fancn/palb2, fanco/rad51c, fancp/slx4, fancq/ercc4, fanct/ube2t, and two genes encoding FA-associated proteins: faap100 and faap24. We selected two indel mutations predicted to cause premature truncations for all but two of the genes, and a total of 36 mutant lines were generated for 19 genes. Generating two independent mutant lines for each gene was important to validate their phenotypic consequences. RT-PCR from homozygous mutant fish confirmed the presence of transcripts with indels in all genes. Interestingly, 4 of the indel mutations led to aberrant splicing, which may produce a different protein than predicted from the genomic sequence. Analysis of RNA is thus critical in proper evaluation of the consequences of the mutations introduced in zebrafish genome. We used fluorescent reporter assay, and western blots to confirm loss-of-function for several mutants. Additionally, we developed a DEB treatment assay by evaluating morphological changes in embryos and confirmed that homozygous mutants from all the FA genes that could be tested (11/17), displayed hypersensitivity and thus were indeed null alleles. Our multiplexing strategy helped us to evaluate 11 multiple gene knockout combinations without additional breeding. Homozygous zebrafish for all 19 single and 11 multi-gene knockouts were adult viable, indicating FA genes in zebrafish are generally not essential for early development. None of the mutant fish displayed gross developmental abnormalities except for fancp-/- fish, which were significantly smaller in length than their wildtype clutch mates. Complete female-to-male sex reversal was observed in knockouts for 12/17 FA genes, while partial sex reversal was seen for the other five gene knockouts. All adult females were fertile, and among the adult males, all were fertile except for the fancd1 mutants and one of the fancj mutants.

Biallelic variant in *RAD51C* was first identified in a patient with Fanconi anemia complementation group O (FANCO) in 2010 by Vaz et al. (PMID: 20400963). *RAD51C* is a member of the RAD51 gene family. The protein of RAD51 family members are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. RAD51C protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important for Holliday junction resolution. Monoallelic *RAD51C* variants were also linked to autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split autosomal dominant triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer into separate curations due to phenotypic variability and different inheritance patterns. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal recessive FANCO. Three variants (1 intronic variant predicted to result in splice effect and 2 missense variants) identified in 2 families are included in this curation (2.6 points; PMIDs: 20400963, 29278735). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function (LOF). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including animal models and biomedical function studies (2.5 points; PMIDs: 22167183, 30540754, 36906610). The cells with loss of *RAD51C* or expressing *RAD51C* variants  exhibited a marked increase in the frequency of interstrand cross-links and double strand breaks. Knockout zebrafish model exhibited a partial female sex reversal. This reversal may illustrate that the *RAD51C* gene is important for gonadogenesis and may reflect the commonly observed hypogonadism in FA probands. Mice with double knockout of Rad51c and Brca2 demonstrates phenotypes seen in FA patients including DNA replication instability, higher spontaneous chromosomal aberrations, bone marrow failure, leukemia, reduced survivability. Combination of genetic and experimental evidence has not demonstrated convincing definitive validity of *RAD51C* gene in inherited FANCO. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
