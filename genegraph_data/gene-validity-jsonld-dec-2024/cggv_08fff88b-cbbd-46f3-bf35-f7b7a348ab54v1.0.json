By direct sequencing of the candidate gene MTO1, encoding the mitochondrial-tRNA modifier 1, or whole exome sequencing analysis, we identified novel missense mutations. All MTO1 mutations were predicted to be deleterious on MTO1 function. Their pathogenic role was experimentally validated in a recombinant yeast model, by assessing oxidative growth, respiratory activity, mitochondrial protein synthesis, and complex IV activity. In one case, we also demonstrated that expression of wt MTO1 could rescue the respiratory defect in mutant fibroblasts. The severity of the yeast respiratory phenotypes partly correlated with the different clinical presentations observed in MTO1 mutant patients, although the clinical outcome was highly variable in patients with the same mutation and seemed also to depend on timely start of pharmacological treatment, centered on the control of lactic acidosis by dichloroacetate. Our results indicate that MTO1 mutations are commonly associated with a presentation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and MRC deficiency, and that ad hoc recombinant yeast models represent a useful system to test the pathogenic potential of uncommon variants, and provide insight into their effects on the expression of a biochemical phenotype.

To gain insight into the genetic origin of this condition, we used next-generation exome sequencing to identify mutations in MTO1, which encodes mitochondrial translation optimization 1. Two affected siblings carried a maternal c.1858dup (p.Arg620Lysfs(∗)8) frameshift and a paternal c.1282G>A (p.Ala428Thr) missense mutation. A third unrelated individual was homozygous for the latter change. In both humans and yeast, MTO1 increases the accuracy and efficiency of mtDNA translation by catalyzing the 5-carboxymethylaminomethylation of the wobble uridine base in three mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs). Accordingly, mutant muscle and fibroblasts showed variably combined reduction in mtDNA-dependent respiratory chain activities. Reduced respiration in mutant cells was corrected by expressing a wild-type MTO1 cDNA. Conversely, defective respiration of a yeast mto1Δ strain failed to be corrected by an Mto1(Pro622∗) variant, equivalent to human MTO1(Arg620Lysfs∗8), whereas incomplete correction was achieved by an Mto1(Ala431Thr) variant, corresponding to human MTO1(Ala428Thr). The respiratory yeast phenotype was dramatically worsened in stress conditions and in the presence of a paromomycin-resistant (P(R)) mitochondrial rRNA mutation.

Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"ICIMD review 2021"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes with a related function "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:08fff88b-cbbd-46f3-bf35-f7b7a348ab54_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:79f45ffc-f0ea-4232-adec-99007d4d9c59","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b044843a-8ffa-4baa-abb7-7009ab1ef7e0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Zebrafish Mto1 is 52.7% identical to human MTO1 aminoacid sequence\nUsing CRISPR/Cas9 technology an allele, mto1del7bp was generated by introducing a 7 bp deletion in the exon 3 of mto1. \nBoth mto1+/− and mto1−/− zebrafish were adult-viable\n-Deletion of mto1 resulted in defects in embryonic heart development, fig 1. \n-Histology 6 month fish: cardiomyocytes  mto1−/− zebrafish  showed hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and myocardial fiber disarray.

Previous investigations showed that pathogenic variants in MTO1 for the biosynthesis of τm5U of tRNAGlu, tRNAGln, tRNALys, tRNATrp and tRNALeu(UUR) were associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Using mto1 knock-out(KO) zebrafish generated by CRISPR/Cas9 system, we demonstrated the pleiotropic effects of Mto1 deficiency on mitochondrial RNA maturations. The perturbed structure and stability of tRNAs caused by mto1 deletion were evidenced by conformation changes and sensitivity to S1-mediated digestion of tRNAGln, tRNALys, tRNATrp and tRNALeu(UUR). Notably, mto1KO zebrafish exhibited the global decreases in the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs with the taurine modification. Strikingly, ablated mto1 mediated the expression of MTPAP and caused the altered polyadenylation of cox1, cox3, and nd1 mRNAs. Immunoprecipitation assay indicated the interaction of MTO1 with MTPAP related to mRNA polyadenylation. These alterations impaired mitochondrial translation and reduced activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes. These mitochondria dysfunctions caused heart development defects and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and myocardial fiber disarray in ventricles. These cardiac defects in the mto1KO zebrafish recapitulated the clinical phenotypes in HCM patients carrying the MTO1 mutation(s).

Here, we describe an MTO1-deficient mouse model generated by gene trap mutagenesis that mirrors the human phenotype remarkably well. As in patients, the most prominent signs and symptoms were cardiovascular and included bradycardia and cardiomyopathy. In addition, the mutant mice showed a marked worsening of arrhythmias during induction and reversal of anaesthesia. The detailed morphological and biochemical workup of murine hearts indicated that the myocardial damage was due to complex I deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, neurological examination was largely normal in Mto1-deficient mice. A translational consequence of this mouse model may be to caution against anaesthesia-related cardiac arrhythmias which may be fatal in patients.

The *MTO1* gene encodes mitochondrial tRNA translation optimization 1, which increases the accuracy and efficiency of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) translation by catalyzing the 5-carboxymethylaminomethylation of the wobble uridine base in three mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs: tRNA-Gln, tRNA-Glu, and tRNA-Lys).  \n\nThe *MTO1* gene was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2012 (Ghezzi et al. (2012) PMID: 22608499. The condition was first described in a family from northern Italy in two siblings with infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis.  Subsequent publications have reported a consistently early onset disease characterized by lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mild to severe global developmental delay. Phenotypic heterogeneity is observed with additional features such as feeding difficulties, optic atrophy, seizures and ataxia. Variability is reported in the severity of disease with many probands not surviving infancy while other affected individuals reached adolescence and early adulthood.  While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MTO1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MTO1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 10 unique variants reported in nine cases from five publications (PMIDs: 22608499, 23929671, 25058219, 29331171, 34547275). Variants included three frameshift, one nonsense, and six missense, one of which, c.1232C>T (p.Thr411Ile) is a proposed founder variant in the Pakistani population (PMID: 25058219). The maximum score for case-level data was reached in this curation; however we note that, in total, there appear to be at least 42 affected individuals reported in the medical literature.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease. Mouse and zebrafish models recapitulate aspects of the cardiovascular phenotype associated with disease, together with altered mitochondrial morphology and biochemistry (PMIDs: 33340416, 25506927, 33836087). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MTO1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 4, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
