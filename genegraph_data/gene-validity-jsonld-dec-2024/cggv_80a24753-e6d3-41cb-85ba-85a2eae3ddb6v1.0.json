ATS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A10, encoding the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10. Former studies implicated GLUT10 in the transport of dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of ascorbic acid (AA). Mouse models carrying homozygous Slc2a10 missense mutations did not recapitulate the human phenotype. Since mice, in contrast to humans, are able to intracellularly synthesize AA, we generated a novel ATS mouse model, deficient for Slc2a10 as well as Gulo, which encodes for L-gulonolactone oxidase, an enzyme catalyzing the final step in AA biosynthesis in mouse. Gulo;Slc2a10 double knock-out mice showed mild phenotypic anomalies, which were absent in single knock-out controls. While Gulo;Slc2a10 double knock-out mice did not fully phenocopy human ATS, histological and immunocytochemical analysis revealed compromised extracellular matrix formation. Transforming growth factor beta signaling remained unaltered, while mitochondrial function was compromised in smooth muscle cells derived from Gulo;Slc2a10 double knock-out mice. Altogether, our data add evidence that ATS is an ascorbate compartmentalization disorder, but additional factors underlying the observed phenotype in humans remain to be determined.","dc:creator":"Boel A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Slc2a10 knock-out mice deficient in ascorbic acid synthesis recapitulate aspects of arterial tortuosity syndrome and display mitochondrial respiration defects."},"rdfs:label":"Boel et al.

Recently, SLC2A10 mutations were identified in this condition. This gene encodes the glucose transporter GLUT10 and was previously suggested as a candidate gene for diabetes mellitus type 2. A total of 12 newly identified ATS families with 16 affected individuals were clinically and molecularly characterized. In addition, extensive cardiovascular imaging and glucose tolerance tests were performed in both patients and heterozygous carriers. All 16 patients harbor biallelic SLC2A10 mutations of which nine are novel (six missense, three truncating mutations, including a large deletion). Haplotype analysis suggests founder effects for all five recurrent mutations. Remarkably, patients were significantly older than those previously reported in the literature (P=0.04). Only one affected relative died, most likely of an unrelated cause. Although the natural history of ATS in this series was less severe than previously reported, it does indicate a risk for ischemic events. Two patients initially presented with stroke, respectively at age 8 months and 23 years. Tortuosity of the aorta or large arteries was invariably present. Two adult probands (aged 23 and 35 years) had aortic root dilation, seven patients had localized arterial stenoses, and five had long stenotic stretches of the aorta.

Four cases of ATS from two families are described, contributing to the clinical delineation of this condition. A patient with microcephaly and a complex uropathy and two cases with diaphragmatic hernia are noticed. Regarding the vascular involvement, a predominant supra-aortic involvement stands out and only 1 patient with significant arterial stenoses was described. All presented severe tortuosity of the intracranial arteries. To reduce hemodynamic stress on the arterial wall, beta-adrenergic blocking treatment was prescribed. A not previously described variant (NM_030777.4:c.899T>G (p.Leu300Trp)) was detected in a proband; it has an allegedly deleterious effect in compound heterozygous state with the pathogenic variant c.417T>A (p.Tyr139Ter).

Clinical phenotypes of ATS include aortic tortuosity, tortuosity of large and mid-sized arteries, pulmonary artery stenosis, joint hypermobility, ocular abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. Phenotype severity ranges from neonatal lethality to adults with isolated phenotypes. Aortic aneurysms varied from very slowly progressive to rapid dilation and dissection. 14 variants (missense, nonsense, deletion, and frameshift) reported in 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 17935213, 18818946, 37619836, 29323665) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including protein expression in the aorta (PMID:23715323) and a mouse model double knock out for both SLC2A10 and Gulo that recapitulated isolated phenotypes of ATS including decreases in diameter in the descending aorta and compromised extracellular matrix formation (PMID:32307537). Finally the curation is supported by the biochemical function of *SLC2A10*, which encodes GLUT10, a glucose transporting protein that transports dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). Phenotypes from variants in *SLC2A10* may be a result of impaired vitamin C cellular compartmentalization, increases in ROS/oxidative stress, and defective TGF-B signaling. In summary, *SLC2A10* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive arterial tortuosity syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The evidence summary was approved by the Heritable Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection subgroup of the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on 9/6/2024.
