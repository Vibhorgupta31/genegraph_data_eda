Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.","dc:creator":"Uhlén M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Proteomics.

The nucleotide variants segregated within the families, were absent in Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) databases and are predicted to be deleterious.

The TARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits. \n\nThe TARS2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (PMID: 24827421). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants in two cases in two publications (PMID: 24827421, 33153448). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and expression (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900).\n \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
