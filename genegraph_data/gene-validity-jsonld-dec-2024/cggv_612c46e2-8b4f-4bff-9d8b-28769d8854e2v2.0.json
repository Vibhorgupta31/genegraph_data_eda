A 423-fold enrichment over the specific content in the 100,000 X g sediment from platelet homogenates was obtained. The enzyme gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis corresponding to a monomeric molecular weight of 58,800. One heme per polypeptide chain was present, and by optical and EPR spectroscopy a close analogy to the group of cytochrome P-450 proteins was established. From its substrate prostaglandin H2, the stable end product thromboxane B2 is formed with a specific activity of 24.1 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1 which corresponds to a molecular activity of 1628 min-1. The enzyme formed 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid together with thromboxane B2 in a 1:1 ratio. Both products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. As reported previously for platelet microsomes (Ullrich, V., and Haurand, M. (1983) Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 11, 105-110), the pure hemoprotein spectrally interacts with pyridine- or imidazole-based inhibitors and for the potent inhibitor imidazo-(1,5-a)pyridine-5-hexanoic acid a stoichiometric binding to the heme was shown. Substrate analogs with a methylene group replacing the oxygen in either the 9- or 11-position caused difference spectra showing spectral shifts towards 387 and 407 nm, respectively. The identification of thromboxane synthase as a P-450 protein suggests that the heme-thiolate group of the enzyme is required to split and activate the endoperoxide bond of prostaglandin H2.","dc:creator":"Haurand M","dc:date":"1985","dc:title":"Isolation and characterization of thromboxane synthase from human platelets as a cytochrome P-450 enzyme."},"rdfs:label":"Isolation of thromboxane synthase from platelets"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This work reveled the presence of thromboxane synthase in platelets"},{"id":"cggv:5afa79ea-3c68-467f-a94a-1a6b7d18d73d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:830410e3-d57e-41d4-90f3-60a702ed64ec","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Patients withh GHDD show impaired aggregation in response to AA and reduced serum TXB2 levels","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2960694","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Thromboxane synthase inhibition can lead to two opposing effects: accumulation of proaggregatory cyclic endoperoxides and increased formation of antiaggregatory PGI2 and PGD2. The elimination of the effects of the cyclic endoperoxides by an endoperoxide-thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist should enhance the inhibition of hemostasis by thromboxane synthase blockers. We have carried out a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies in healthy volunteers to check if this hypothesis may be operative in vivo in man. In a first study, in 10 healthy male volunteers, the combined administration of the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13.177 and the thromboxane synthase inhibitor dazoxiben gave stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolonged the bleeding time more than either drug alone. In a second study, in 10 different healthy male volunteers, complete inhibition of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin reduced the prolongation of the bleeding time by the combination BM 13.177 plus dazoxiben. In a third study, in five volunteers, selective cumulative inhibition of platelet TXA2 synthesis by low-dose aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation and prolonged the bleeding time less than the combination BM 13.177 plus dazoxiben. In vitro, in human platelet-rich plasma stimulated with arachidonic acid, the combination of BM 13.177 and dazoxiben increased intraplatelet cAMP while the single drugs did not affect it. Our results indicate that prostaglandin endoperoxides can partly substitute for the activity of TXA2 in vivo in man and that an increased formation of endogenous antiaggregatory and vasodilatory prostaglandins, as obtained with selective thromboxane synthase inhibitors, may contribute to the impairment of hemostasis.","dc:creator":"Gresele P","dc:date":"1987","dc:title":"Role of proaggregatory and antiaggregatory prostaglandins in hemostasis.

To evaluate its various physiologic roles, we generated TXAS-deleted mice by gene targeting. TXAS(-/-) mice had normal bone marrow megakaryocytes, normal blood platelet counts, and normal CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts in thymus and spleen. Platelets from TXAS(-/-) mice failed to aggregate or generate thromboxane B(2) in response to arachidonic acid (AA) but produced increased prostaglandin-E(2) (PGE(2)), PGD(2), and PGF(2 alpha). AA infusion caused a progressive drop of mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac arrest, and death in wild-type (WT) mice but did not induce shock in TXAS(-/-) mice or in WT and TXAS(-/-) mice treated with antagonist to the thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptor. The TXAS(-/-) mice were able to maintain normal MAP upon AA insult when TP was present but were unable to do so when TP was blocked by an antagonist, suggesting a role of endoperoxide accumulation in influencing MAP. We conclude that TXAS is not essential for thrombopoiesis and lymphocyte differentiation. Its deficiency causes a mild hemostatic defect and protects mice against arachidonate-induced shock and death. The TXAS-deleted mice will be valuable for investigating the roles of arachidonate metabolic shunt in various pathophysiologic processes.","dc:creator":"Yu IS","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"TXAS-deleted mice exhibit normal thrombopoiesis, defective hemostasis, and resistance to arachidonate-induced death."},"rdfs:label":"TXAS-/- mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score was decreased because the TXAS-/- mouse model phenotype does not completely reflect the phenotype of patients with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:612c46e2-8b4f-4bff-9d8b-28769d8854e2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:613af944-da45-4651-bc8e-5dca400d08e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:613af944-da45-4651-bc8e-5dca400d08e2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:364c23ea-a6ec-4da5-bb14-bbd6f8cd5d21","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001061.7(TBXAS1):c.1441G>T (p.Gly481Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA121734"}},"detectionMethod":"a series of 17 intronic primers was designed to amplify the 4 noncoding and 13 coding exons of the TBXAS1 gene.

Here, we describe a novel targeted therapeutic approach for Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by severe normocytic anemia and bone abnormalities due to loss-of-function mutations in thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1). TBXAS1 metabolizes prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a cyclooxygenase (COX) product of arachidonic acid, into thromboxane A2. Loss-of-function mutations in TBXAS result in an increase in PGH2 availability for other PG synthases. The current treatment for Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia syndrome consists of corticosteroids. We hypothesize that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit COX-1 and COX-2, could ameliorate the effects of TBXAS1 loss and improve hematologic function by reducing prostaglandin formation. We treated 2 patients with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia syndrome, an adult and a child, with standard doses of NSAIDs (aspirin or ibuprofen). Both patients had rapid improvements concerning hematologic parameters and inflammatory markers without adverse events. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that urinary PG metabolites were increased along with proinflammatory lipoxygenase (LOX) products 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene E4. Our data show that NSAIDs at standard doses surprisingly reduced both COX and LOX products, leading to the resolution of cytopenia, and should be considered for first-line treatment for Ghosal

Platelet aggregation was studied in one member of one family and resulted impaired in response to arachidonic acid. None of the patients showed bleeding symptoms.\n\n10 unique variants have been reported in humans, 8 missense, 2 frameshift and 1 stop.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (functional evidence of protein expression, biochemical function, non-human model organisms).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 7.8 POINTS Variants in this gene have been reported in 12 GHDD probands in 7 publications (PMIDs 18264100, 27156553, 28868793, 33244729, 33595912, 35395429, 36574346\n) leading to a score of 7.8 for genetic evidence. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 3 POINTS This gene-disease association is supported by evidences of Biochemical Function (B): in human and horse platelet microsomes a molecule that converted prostaglandin endoperoxides into TXA2 was found. This molecule was ascertained to be thromboxane synthase (PMID 934294). Evidence of protein expression (A): Thromboxane synthase was purified from human platelets a close analogy to the group of cytochrome P-450 proteins was established. The purified enzyme catalyzed the formation of the stable end product thromboxane B2 from its substrate prostaglandin H2 (PMID: 2999104). A mouse model knockout for TBXAS1 showed similarities but also differences from GHDD patients: the mouse model showed a lack of platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid and a defect in TXA2 production, compatible with patients with GHDD. However, patients with GHDD do not have any bleeding problem while the TXAS-/- mouse show increased bleeding time, moreover the mouse model do not show increased bone density, myelophthisic anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (PMID: 15010374).\n\nIt is worth noting that a disease called “Thromboxane Synthase deficiency” (OMIM 614158) was described. Patients show bleeding, impaired aggregation in response to arachidonic acid but normal aggregation in response to the thromboxane analogue U46619, decreased serum TXB2, phenotypes compatible with a deficiency of Thromboxane Synthase (Weiss et al PMID 66560, Mestel et al PMID 6101498, Defreyn et al PMID 6268139). However, DNA analysis was not carried out in these patients and we can not establish an association with variants in TBXAS1.\n\nIn summary, we found  moderate association of TBXAS1 with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal syndrome.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the HT GCEP on 10/28/2020. As a result of the current reevaluation new genetic evidence was identified (PMIDs: 33244729, 33595912, 35395429, 36574346) but the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 9). This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on 06/07/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:612c46e2-8b4f-4bff-9d8b-28769d8854e2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
