In some genes, these mutations also influence RNA splicing and induce skipping of the exon that contains the nonsense codon. To begin to dissect how premature termination alters the metabolism of RNA from the COL1A1 gene, we studied nonsense and frameshift mutations distributed over exons 11-49 of the gene. These mutations were originally identified in 10 unrelated families with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type 1. We observed marked reduction in steady-state amounts of mRNA from the mutant allele in both total cellular and nuclear RNA extracts of cells from affected individuals, suggesting that nonsense-mediated decay of COL1A1 RNA is a nuclear phenomenon. Position of the mutation within the gene did not influence this observation. None of the mutations induced skipping of either the exon containing the mutation or, for the frameshifts, the downstream exons with the new termination sites.

Fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of structurally normal type I collagen as a result of decreased synthesis of one of its constituent chains, pro alpha 1(I), but the nature of the mutations which result in OI type I are unknown. We describe a three generation family with OI type I in which all affected members have one normal COL1A1 allele and another from which the intragenic Eco RI restriction site near the 3' end of the gene is missing. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction and sequence determination of the normal allele and of the mutant allele in the domain that normally contains the Eco RI site demonstrated a 5-bp deletion from the mutant allele. The deletion changes the translational reading-frame beginning at the Eco RI site and predicts the synthesis of a pro alpha 1(I) chain that extends 84 amino acids beyond the normal termination. Although the mutant pro alpha 1(I) chain is synthesized in an in vitro translation system, we are unable to detect its presence in intact cells, suggesting that it is unstable and rapidly destroyed in one of the cell's degradative pathways. Our analysis of individuals with OI type I from 20 families indicates that this is a unique mutation and suggests that the phenotype can result from multiple mechanisms that decrease the synthesis of normal type I procollagen molecules, including those that alter protein stability.","dc:creator":"Willing MC","dc:date":"1990","dc:title":"Frameshift mutation near the 3' end of the COL1A1 gene of type I collagen predicts an elongated Pro alpha 1(I) chain and results in osteogenesis imperfecta type I."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2295701","rdfs:label":"II-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Sanger sequencing of only COL1A1."},{"id":"cggv:20567e1c-444c-4a90-afd9-c5806b25c2fe_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e621fa3-b3b8-4dcb-88e7-595f1b273b41","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":37,"detectionMethod":"\"A Clinical Whole Exome Sequencing test was performed on blood of patient focusing on 3583 OMIM disease genes and Exome of 20,370 genes with target region capture followed by Next\nGeneration Sequencing (NGS).

bone fragility and low bone mass are common features of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which is associated with connective tissue. Its type is distinguished by clinical phenotypes and molecular genetics. Although fifteen types (I‑XV) of OI have been identified at present, the majority of patients are diagnosed as OI type I‑IV. Type I collagen is responsible for OI type I‑IV, consists of α1 (I) and α2 (I) chains and is encoded by COL1A1 and COL1A2. To identify the pathogenic gene of a large Chinese family with OI type I and explain genetic heterogeneity of the patients, next‑generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted in a female with OI type I and her affected niece and daughter to search for the mutation. Subsequently, it was confirmed in other family members by Sanger sequencing. Analysis of COL1A1 gene identified a splicing mutation (c.471+1G>A, also termed IVS5+1G>A) that converted the 5' end of intron 5 from GT to AT. The current study aimed to investigate why there are different phenotypes with the same mutation observed within the same OI pedigree, and the results suggested that there may be environmental factors involved. The present study provided genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for the family members, however additionally provided insight into the phenotype‑genotype association in OI.","dc:creator":"Ni M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Application of next‑generation sequencing for molecular diagnosis in a large family with osteogenesis imperfecta type I."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28901398","rdfs:label":"Ni Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:245be20f-65d7-43f2-8247-f1f74638b0aa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9751858-2dcc-4447-844e-ca2cf371827d","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Analyzed PCR amplified genomic DNA from affected and unaffected individuals for presence of mismatches by DGGE and/or SSCP.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in clinical phenotypic presentation and molecular mechanism between OI Types I-IV. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split: OI Type I (OMIM: 166200), OI Type II (OMIM: 166210), OI Type III (OMIM: 259420), and OI Type IV (OMIM: 166220). OI Type I is the mildest of Types I-IV and is characterized by “blue sclerae, normal stature, bone fragility without significant deformity and osteopenia” and fibroblasts of affected individuals \"produce about half the expected amount of structurally normal type I collagen,” indicating reduced protein as the mechanism of disease (Willing et al. 1990, PMID: 2295701). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. At least 21 unique null variants (nonsense, splice site, frameshift, and large deletions) have been identified in OI Type I patients in 8 publications (PMIDs: 2295701, 7942841, 8808594, 32165296, 28901398, 31653500, 26478226, 26634493). This gene-disease association is also supported by an animal model that recapitulates the disease’s phenotypes and mechanism (PMID: 31369917). In summary, COL1A1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type I. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) on 1/19/2021.
