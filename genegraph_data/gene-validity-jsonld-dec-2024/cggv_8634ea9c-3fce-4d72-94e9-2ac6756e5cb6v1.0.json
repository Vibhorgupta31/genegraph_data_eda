Although the genetic basis is partly understood, only a fraction of cases can receive a genetic diagnosis, and a global view of HSP is lacking. By using whole-exome sequencing in combination with network analysis, we identified 18 previously unknown putative HSP genes and validated nearly all of these genes functionally or genetically. The pathways highlighted by these mutations link HSP to cellular transport, nucleotide metabolism, and synapse and axon development. Network analysis revealed a host of further candidate genes, of which three were mutated in our cohort.

Studies on large cohorts of HSP patients showed that, by means of current technologies, the percentage of genetically solved cases is close to 50%. Notably, the percentage of molecularly confirmed diagnoses decreases significantly in sporadic patients. To describe our diagnostic molecular genetic approach on patients with pediatric-onset pure and complex HSP, 47 subjects with HSP underwent molecular screening of 113 known and candidate disease genes by targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing. Negative cases were successively analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis for the SPAST gene and high-resolution SNP array analysis for genome-wide CNV detection. Diagnosis was molecularly confirmed in 29 out of 47 (62%) patients, most of whom had clinical diagnosis of cHSP. Although SPG11 and SPG4 remain the most frequent cause of, respectively, complex and pure HSP, a large number of pathogenic variants were disclosed in POLR3A, FA2H, DDHD2, ATP2B4, ENTPD1, ERLIN2, CAPN1, ALS2, ADAR1, RNASEH2B, TUBB4A, ATL1, and KIF1A. In a subset of these disease genes, phenotypic expansion and novel genotype-phenotype correlations were recognized. Notably, SNP array analysis did not provide any significant contribution in increasing the diagnostic yield. Our findings document the high diagnostic yield of targeted sequencing for patients with pediatric-onset, complex, and pure HSP. MLPA for SPAST and SNP array should be limited to properly selected cases based on clinical suspicion.","dc:creator":"Travaglini L","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"The impact of next-generation sequencing on the diagnosis of pediatric-onset hereditary spastic paraplegias: new genotype-phenotype correlations for rare HSP-related genes."}},"rdfs:label":"Travaglini HSP-5"},{"id":"cggv:c946e9ab-138d-4020-be56-d4a8dbdf6f29","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c946e9ab-138d-4020-be56-d4a8dbdf6f29_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8634ea9c-3fce-4d72-94e9-2ac6756e5cb6_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:3e310d7f-c1f4-43b9-be7b-068ab58323ad_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e310d7f-c1f4-43b9-be7b-068ab58323ad","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:aca668f0-9fdb-40de-8c2c-65eabf02ce62","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001776.6(ENTPD1):c.978del (p.Gln327LysfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2579754006"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007340","obo:HP_0002342","obo:HP_0001332","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0002061","obo:HP_0000750"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c37d7415-d7de-4137-920d-63e3c8111020_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:aca668f0-9fdb-40de-8c2c-65eabf02ce62"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33771085","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by lower-limb spasticity and weakness.

More than 80 types of HSP have been defined to date. In complicated forms, lower limb spasticity and gait impairment is accompanied by an additional neurological finding. Autosomal recessive (AR) HSPs are usually identified in complicated forms and occur more frequently in countries where consanguineous marriage is more widespread. Next generation sequencing techniques, developed in the last decade, have led to the identification of many new types of HSP and reduced the \"diagnostic odyssey.\" Whole exome sequencing (WES) can diagnose up to 75% of undiagnosed HSP patients. Targeted genetic analysis with good clinical phenotyping gives the best diagnostic yields for rare diseases. Clinical heterogeneity is prominent in AR complicated HSP. However, some clinical features complicating the disease or magnetic resonance imaging findings, including thin corpus callosum or white matter abnormalities, can help to distinguish some types. AR spastic paraplegia type 64 (SPG64) is a very rare HSP, caused by a mutation in the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1) gene, first described in 2014.

A study describing a cohort of 27 individuals with homozygous variants in *ENTPD1* identified common features of gait impairment, progressive spastic paraplegia and developmental delay/intellectual disability, with variable additional features (Calame et al. 2022, PMID: 35471564). Seven variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 12 affected individuals in 6 publications (PMIDs: 24482476, 29691679, 30652007, 33771085, 35758610, 35471564) are included in this curation. Additional evidence has been reported in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ENTPD1* and autosomal recessive complex hereditary spastic paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
