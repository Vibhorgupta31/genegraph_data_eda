Its pathogenesis is unknown. X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited bone-marrow-failure syndrome characterized by skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy and leucoplakia which usually develop towards the end of the first decade of life. AA occurs in >90% of cases of DC. We speculated that mutations in the gene responsible for X-linked DC (DKC1) may account for the HH syndrome, due to the phenotypic similarities between the disease in respect of AA and gender bias. We therefore analysed the DKC1 gene in two HH families. In one family a nucleotide change at position 361(A --> G) in exon 5 was found in both affected brothers; in the other family a nucleotide change at position 146(C --> T) in exon 3 was found in the affected boys. The finding of these two novel missense DKC1 mutations demonstrates that HH is a severe variant of DC. They also show that mutations in DKC1 can give rise to a very wide clinical spectrum of manifestations.

This outcome suggests that while HSCT can correct bone marrow failure and immunodeficiency, it may fail to prevent or even aggravate other fatal processes, such as portal hypertension and pulmonary arteriovenous shunting.","dc:creator":"Chen RL","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Complications for a Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson Syndrome Patient with a Germline DKC1 A353V Variant Undergoing Unrelated Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31269755","rdfs:label":"Proband (no ID given)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:6752f94c-e756-496d-a7e9-620c126b1e53_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f216189-1e03-45c9-b33f-48ac38f93952","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0005528","obo:HP_0031826","obo:HP_0000967","obo:HP_0000155","obo:HP_0002599"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6752f94c-e756-496d-a7e9-620c126b1e53_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b77db20a-e4ec-44f9-b428-23fc560de778"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24914498","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome is a severe multisystem disorder that is characterized by bone-marrow failure, intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, immunodeficiency, and cerebellar atrophy.

Their integrity is maintained by telomerase, an enzyme consisting of a reverse transcriptase, TERT and an RNA template, TERC, and other components, including the pseudouridine synthase, dyskerin, the product of the DKC1 gene. When telomeres become critically short, a p53-dependent pathway causing cell cycle arrest is induced that can lead to senescence, apoptosis, or, rarely to genomic instability and transformation. The same pathway is induced in response to DNA damage. DKC1 mutations in the disease dyskeratosis congenita are thought to act via this mechanism, causing growth defects in proliferative tissues through telomere shortening. Here, we show that pathogenic mutations in mouse Dkc1 cause a growth disadvantage and an enhanced DNA damage response in the context of telomeres of normal length. We show by genetic experiments that the growth disadvantage, detected by disparities in X-inactivation patterns in female heterozygotes, depends on telomerase. Hemizygous male mutant cells showed a strikingly enhanced DNA damage response via the ATM/p53 pathway after treatment with etoposide with a significant number of DNA damage foci colocalizing with telomeres in cytological preparations. We conclude that dyskerin mutations cause slow growth independently of telomere shortening and that this slow growth is the result of the induction of DNA damage. Thus, dyskerin interacts with telomerase and affects telomere maintenance independently of telomere length.","dc:creator":"Gu BW","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"A pathogenic dyskerin mutation impairs proliferation and activates a DNA damage response independent of telomere length in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Pathogenic dyskerin mutation in mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Default score downgraded due to model not fully capturing the phenotype observed in humans."},{"id":"cggv:fed67d5f-0300-4067-91e1-45cbaa497086","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb7dd67f-7085-4bc9-819f-b44cf9cd91ca","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This experiment demonstrated that both deletions were lethal when maternally inherited.

The X-linked form is due to mutations in the DKC1 gene encoding dyskerin, a nucleolar protein predicted to be involved in rRNA processing and associated with the telomerase complex. Available evidence suggests the pathology of DC is due to telomerase defects. We have used the inducible Cre/loxP system to produce deletions in the murine Dkc1 gene in early embryogenesis. A large deletion lacking exons 12-15 and a small deletion lacking only the last exon, were produced. We found both deletions showed a parent-of-origin effect with 100% embryonic lethality when the mutation occurred on the maternal Dkc1. Embryonic analysis at day E7.5 and E9.5 showed no male embryos carrying either deletion whereas females with maternally derived deletions died around day E9.5, with degeneration of the extra embryonic tissue, in which the paternal X-chromosome is inactivated. Female mice carrying the deletion in the paternally derived Dkc1 show extreme skewing of X-inactivation with the wild type X-chromosome active in all cells. Since mice with no telomerase are viable in the first generations the lethality we observe is unlikely to be due to the effects of mutated dyskerin on telomerase activity.","dc:creator":"He J","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Targeted disruption of Dkc1, the gene mutated in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita, causes embryonic lethality in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Targeted Dkc1 disruption causes embryonic lethality in mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Default score downgraded due to model phenotype not accurately capturing human phenotype."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1319,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:20b4829c-fb7b-4de4-aa0b-de20365abc40","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100152","gene":"hgnc:2890","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"Variants in DKC1 have been reported since the 1990s, when patients exhibiting characteristics of dyskeratosis congenita (DC), or its more severe form, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH syndrome) were found to have variants in DKC1. Variants in patients are almost exclusively missense. DKC1-related disorders exist on a spectrum, and affect a range of tissues/organ systems. Children with HH syndrome tend to die in their infant/toddler years, and have classic DC symptoms alongside severe neurological/developmental features. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data: \nVariants in this gene have been reported in a number of individual probands (and some families with deceased siblings) since 1999, when Knight et al. (PMID:10583221) described five cases (two families) with DKC1-related disorders (only one surviving case from each family). Since then, additional publications have become available to support this genotype-phenotype relationship. Of note, it is unclear at this time why some patients experience mild symptoms, while others are severely affected, even for the same variant. Revesz syndrome, which includes a characteristic eye phenotype in addition to typical DC/HH syndrome features, may also be caused by DKC1 variants. Two publications (Teixeira et al., PMID:18195234; and Allingham, PMID:18195234) exist at this time supporting this association, but lack the detail necessary to make this conclusion. Future publications may help to elucidate this association.\n\nExperimental Evidence: \nNon-human model organisms have been used to investigate the impact of disrupting DKC1 gene function. Two studies, He et al. (PMID:12400016) and Gu et al. (PMID:18626023) both demonstrated that DKC1 variants can lead to effects in mice (embryonic lethality and cellular growth damage, respectively), however neither model fully captured the phenotype seen in humans with DKC1-related disorders. This could be due to the type of variants used in the study, which eliminated one or more exons, rather than the missense mutations observed in human cases. Scores for experimental evidence were downgraded due to this discrepancy.\n\nIn summary, at present there is sufficient genetic evidence to support a definitive classification for this gene-disease relationship. Future recurations may find additional experimental evidence, that provides an explanation for the range of severity observed in patients with DKC-1 variants.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:afd6a4ca-7a1c-42ef-a9cf-bef557128f12"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
