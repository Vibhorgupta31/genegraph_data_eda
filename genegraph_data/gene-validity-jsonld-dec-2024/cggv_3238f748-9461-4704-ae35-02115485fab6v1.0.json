Multisubunit outer dynein arm (ODA) motor complexes, produced and preassembled in the cytosol, are transported to the ciliary or flagellar compartment and anchored into the axonemal microtubular scaffold via the ODA docking complex (ODA-DC) system. In humans, defects in ODA assembly are the major cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), an inherited disorder of ciliary and flagellar dysmotility characterized by chronic upper and lower respiratory infections and defects in laterality. Here, by combined high-throughput mapping and sequencing, we identified CCDC151 loss-of-function mutations in five affected individuals from three independent families whose cilia showed a complete loss of ODAs and severely impaired ciliary beating. Consistent with the laterality defects observed in these individuals, we found Ccdc151 expressed in vertebrate left-right organizers. Homozygous zebrafish ccdc151(ts272a) and mouse Ccdc151(Snbl) mutants display a spectrum of situs defects associated with complex heart defects. We demonstrate that CCDC151 encodes an axonemal coiled coil protein, mutations in which abolish assembly of CCDC151 into respiratory cilia and cause a failure in axonemal assembly of the ODA component DNAH5 and the ODA-DC-associated components CCDC114 and ARMC4. CCDC151-deficient zebrafish, planaria, and mice also display ciliary dysmotility accompanied by ODA loss. Furthermore, CCDC151 coimmunoprecipitates CCDC114 and thus appears to be a highly evolutionarily conserved ODA-DC-related protein involved in mediating assembly of both ODAs and their axonemal docking machinery onto ciliary microtubules.","dc:creator":"Hjeij R","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"CCDC151 mutations cause primary ciliary dyskinesia by disruption of the outer dynein arm docking complex formation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3238f748-9461-4704-ae35-02115485fab6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3238f748-9461-4704-ae35-02115485fab6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:70e20861-a524-420c-99a5-f79c193730e7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d786bcc-ad88-45bf-b5f5-4dd9660caeb3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"GTEx showed high levels of expression of ODAD3 in tissues associated with PCD (lung, reproductive tissues, brain)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715323","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci for common diseases, but, for the majority of these, the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility remain unknown.

In humans, disruption of cilia motility or signaling leads to complex pleiotropic genetic disorders called ciliopathies. Cilia motility requires the assembly of multi-subunit motile components such as dynein arms, but mechanisms underlying their assembly pathway and transport into the axoneme are still largely unknown. We identified a previously uncharacterized coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC151, which is evolutionarily conserved in motile ciliated species and shares ancient features with the outer dynein arm-docking complex 2 of Chlamydomonas. In Drosophila, we show that CG14127/CCDC151 is associated with motile intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependent cilia and required for geotaxis behavior of adult flies. In zebrafish, Ccdc151 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, and morpholino-induced depletion of Ccdc151 leads to left-right asymmetry defects and kidney cysts. We demonstrate that Ccdc151 is required for proper motile function of cilia in the Kupffer's vesicle and in the pronephros by controlling dynein arm assembly, showing that Ccdc151 is a novel player in the control of IFT-dependent dynein arm assembly in animals. However, we observed that CCDC151 is also implicated in other cellular functions in vertebrates. In zebrafish, ccdc151 is involved in proper orientation of cell divisions in the pronephros and genetically interacts with prickle1 in this process. Furthermore, knockdown experiments in mammalian cells demonstrate that CCDC151 is implicated in the regulation of primary cilium length. Hence, CCDC151 is required for motile cilia function in animals but has acquired additional non-motile functions in vertebrates.","dc:creator":"Jerber J","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"The coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC151 is required for the function of IFT-dependent motile cilia in animals."},"rdfs:label":"ODAD3 induction with ciliary formation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3238f748-9461-4704-ae35-02115485fab6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f571985-d1f9-40e7-beb3-e5dedf36d0eb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ce855b00-6d99-4853-b95c-9c0e87853641","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"25% of the zebrafish (offspring from heterozygote parents) were presumed to be homozygous for the flanders variant.

KS is a genetically heterogeneous disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive form; however, X-linked inheritance has also been reported. As of this writing [late 2020], at least 34 loci, most of which have known genes, have been reported in the literature as associating with KS. In the present study, we identified a frame shift mutation, c.167delG (p.G56Dfs*26), in the coiled-coil domain containing 151 gene (CCDC151) responsible for KS in a Han-Chinese family. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a CCDC151 c.167delG mutation in the KS patient. These findings may expand the CCDC151 mutation spectrum of KS, and contribute to future genetic counseling and gene-targeted therapy for this disease.","dc:creator":"Deng S","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Identification of a frame shift mutation in the CCDC151 gene in a Han-Chinese family with Kartagener syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Deng_2020_IV:1"},{"id":"cggv:a7e5fb7f-fb30-4d09-b7f6-ef7072cf40a3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a7e5fb7f-fb30-4d09-b7f6-ef7072cf40a3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This variant was downscored due to consanguinity "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c6328d9e-af50-4bb1-9f26-4c46cfa5cf52_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6328d9e-af50-4bb1-9f26-4c46cfa5cf52","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"cggv:4ea124d5-a5cc-4d67-ad8a-7b21d246b2a8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_145045.5(ODAD3):c.1256C>A (p.Ser419Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA170853"}},"detectionMethod":"WES followed by autozygosity linkage analysis","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"situs solicitus ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0031353","obo:HP_0002643","obo:HP_0031245","obo:HP_0002090"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"ODA defect identified by TEM","secondTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:56bdf424-8103-4be4-991e-165c20acce8a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4ea124d5-a5cc-4d67-ad8a-7b21d246b2a8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25192045"},"rdfs:label":"Hjeij_2014_71154-II2"},{"id":"cggv:56bdf424-8103-4be4-991e-165c20acce8a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56bdf424-8103-4be4-991e-165c20acce8a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This variant was downscored due to consanguinity "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3238f748-9461-4704-ae35-02115485fab6_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5939,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:22cfde32-22aa-4869-bd1d-a6f9294b8550","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014465","gene":"hgnc:28303","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*ODAD3* (*CCDC151*) was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 30 (PCD30) in (Hjeij et al., PMID: 25192045). PCD30 is one of nearly 50 primary ciliary dyskinesias that have been observed to be inherited in a monogenic fashion. Most PCD patients present with a chronic productive cough, recurrent respiratory infection, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Some patients also demonstrate situs inversus and neonatal respiratory distress (PMID:33242470). \n\n7 variants (3 nonsense, 1 deletion, 2 out-of-frame duplications, and 1 out-of-frame indel) that have been reported in 7 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25192045, 31469207, 32490514, 31213628, 25224326, 33719352, 30504913) are included in this curation. One variant (NM_145045.5:c.925G>T [p.E309*]) is suspected to be a founder variant with origin in the Middle East/Northern Africa (PMID:31469207) despite its absence from gnomAD (v.2.1.1). To date, the p.E309* variant has been observed in 6 patients with PCD30 from 3 families. Of thse 6 patients, 2 were from Egypt, 2 were from Israel, and 2 were reportedly of Arabic/Bedouin ancestry. Only 1 proband with this variant was scored as a part of this curation due to the assertion that p.E309* is a founder variant. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, biochemical evidence, protein interactions, animal models, and a rescue experiment (PMIDs: 23715323, 25192045, 24067530). First, GTEx data showed high levels of expression of *ODAD3* in human tissues associated with PCD (lungs, testis, fallopian tubes) (PMID: 23715323). Next, Jerber et al. demonstrated that *Ccdc151* expression was shown to be strongly induced in mouse ependymal cells in vitro during the ciliary differentiation process. The level of expression of *Ccdc151* reached almost 7x higher than the comparison protein (Tpb) in ciliogenesis, which strongly suggests that *CCDC151* is important for the structure and function of cilia (PMID: 24067530). Hjeij et al. performed a co-immunoprecipitation which showed that *ODAD3* interacts physically with *ODAD1* in vitro (2019). Furthermore, they showed that the localization of *ODAD1* to the ciliary axonnome is dependent on the presence of *ODAD3* (PMID:25192045). Since *ODAD1*  was classified as definitively associated with PCD by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP, it is likely that LOF variants in *ODAD3* would result in PCD as well. Hjeij et al. also published a mouse model, zebrafish model, and zebrafish rescue experiment. Mice with the c.828+2T>C *Ccdc151* variant (identified within a mutagenesis screen) showed laterality defects as well as immotile cilia in the trachea and brain ventricles. TEM confirmed loss of the ODA in the tracheal cilia of the mice. The zebrafish models contained a c.631T>A (p.Lys211*) variant in *ccdc151* which was also discovered as part of a mutagenesis screen. These zebrafish demonstrated laterality defects and kidney cysts. High speed video microscopy revealed ciliary immotility in the developing kidney of the zebrafish. The laterality defects were partially rescued by inserting a wild-type copy of *ccdc151* into zebrafish embryos (PMID:25192045). \n\nIn summary, *ODAD3* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 30. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on 2/28/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3238f748-9461-4704-ae35-02115485fab6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
