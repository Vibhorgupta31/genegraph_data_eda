Special attention has been devoted to phosphorylation status and structure of these enzymic molecules, however, their regulation and roles remain intriguing. Until recently, CK2 was believed to represent a kinase especially required for cell cycle progression in non-neural cells. At present, with respect to recent findings, four essential features suggest potentially important roles for this enzyme in specific neural functions: (1) CK2 is much more abundant in brain than in any other tissue; (2) there appear to be a myriad of substrates for CK2 in both synaptic and nuclear compartments that have clear implications in development, neuritogenesis, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, information storage and survival; (3) CK2 seems to be associated with mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation in hippocampus; and (4) neurotrophins stimulate activity of CK2 in hippocampus. In addition, some data are suggestive that CK2 might play a role in processes underlying progressive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, chronic alcohol exposure or immunodeficiency virus HIV.

This review summarizes current knowledge of the structural and enzymic features of CK2, and discusses advances that challenge traditional views of this enzyme. For example, the recent demonstrations that individual CK2 subunits exist outside tetrameric complexes and that CK2 displays dual-specificity kinase activity raises new prospects for the precise elucidation of its regulation and cellular functions. This review also discusses a number of the mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of CK2 in cells, and will highlight emerging insights into the role of CK2 in cellular decisions of life and death. In this latter respect, recent evidence suggests that CK2 can exert an anti-apoptotic role by protecting regulatory proteins from caspase-mediated degradation. The mechanistic basis of the observation that CK2 is essential for viability may reside in part in this ability to protect cellular proteins from caspase action. Furthermore, this anti-apoptotic function of CK2 may contribute to its ability to participate in transformation and tumorigenesis.","dc:creator":"Litchfield DW","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Protein kinase CK2: structure, regulation and role in cellular decisions of life and death."},"rdfs:label":"CK2 review"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Pathogenic variants in the CSNK2A1 gene are associated with Okur-Chung neurodevelopmental syndrome and a similar spectrum of phenotypic features as those onserved in cases with de novo CSNK2B variants,  including delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability (ID), speech delay, behavioral abnormalities, brain malformations, and variable dysmorphic facial features.

However, little is known about the kinase-dependent pathways regulating NSC maintenance and oligodendrocyte development. We used a conditional knockout approach to target the murine regulatory subunit (beta) of protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2beta) in embryonic neural progenitors. Loss of CK2beta leads to defects in proliferation and differentiation of embryonic NSCs. We establish CK2beta as a key positive regulator for the development of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both in vivo and in vitro. We show that CK2beta directly interacts with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Olig2, a critical modulator of OPC development, and activates the CK2-dependent phosphorylation of its serine-threonine-rich (STR) domain. Finally, we reveal that the CK2-targeted STR domain is required for the oligodendroglial function of Olig2. These findings suggest that CK2 may control oligodendrogenesis, in part, by regulating the activity of the lineage-specific transcription factor Olig2.

The CK-beta subunits form homodimers at the core of the CK2 enzyme and are thought to contribute to the stability of the holoenzyme complex, regulating the catalytic activity and substrate recognition. CK2 is a ubiquitously expressed serine threonine kinase and plays a role in many cellular processes. CSNK2B was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Poirier-Bienvenu neurodevelopmental syndrome in 2017 (Poirier et al., PMID: 28585349). This disorder is characterized by mild to profound intellectual disability, with or without epilepsy. The epilepsy is often early-onset occurring before three years of age, often intractable with the most common seizure type being generalized tonic-clonic seizures (Nakashima et al., 2019, PMID: 30655572; Li et al., 2019, PMID: 31784560; Ernst et al., 2021, PMID: 34041744). The presentation is variable. Other phenotypes commonly seen in patients include global developmental delays with mild to severe delayed psychomotor development, speech and language delay, facial dysmorphic features and growth abnormalities (PMID: 28585349; Sakaguchi et al., 2017, PMID: 28762608; PMIDs: 30655572, 31784560; Selvam et al., 2021, PMID: 33166063). Some affected individuals also exhibit autistic features, hypotonia, dystonia, and cerebral atrophy (PMID: 34041744).\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least ten unrelated individuals in five publications. At least ten unique variants have been reported and include a spectrum of missense, splice site, frameshift, and nonsense variants. Variants typically occur de novo. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a temporal and spatial expression pattern of CK2 which is consistent with disease and studies reducing expression levels of Csnk2b mouse in neural stem cells and primary hippocampal neurons support a role for CSNK2B in the regulation of neuronal proliferation and differentiation as well as the modulation of synaptic transmission (Blanquet 2000, PMID: 10658642; Yang et al., 2018, PMID: 29483533). Furthermore, the CSNK2A gene which also encodes a subunit of CK2 holoenzyme, is associated with Okur-Chung neurodevelopmental syndrome and a similar phenotypic spectrum of disease (Okur et al., 2016; PMID: 27048600). In summary, CSNK2B is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Poirier-Bienvenu neurodevelopmental syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
