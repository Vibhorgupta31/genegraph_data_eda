To address this problem in the context of a genetically heterogeneous disease, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), we devised a candidate-gene prioritization strategy called cis-regulatory mapping that utilizes ChIP-seq data for the photoreceptor transcription factor CRX to rank candidate genes. Exome sequencing combined with this approach identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK) in the single affected member of a consanguineous Turkish family with RP. MAK encodes a cilium-associated mitogen-activated protein kinase whose function is conserved from the ciliated alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to humans. Mutations in MAK orthologs in mice and other model organisms result in abnormally long cilia and, in mice, rapid photoreceptor degeneration. Subsequent sequence analyses of additional individuals with RP identified five probands with missense mutations in MAK. Two of these mutations alter amino acids that are conserved in all known kinases, and an in vitro kinase assay indicates that these mutations result in a loss of kinase activity. Thus, kinase activity appears to be critical for MAK function in humans. This study highlights a previously underappreciated role for CRX as a direct transcriptional regulator of ciliary genes in photoreceptors. In addition, it demonstrates the effectiveness of CRX-based cis-regulatory mapping in prioritizing candidate genes from exome data and suggests that this strategy should be generally applicable to a range of retinal diseases.","dc:creator":"Ozgül RK","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Exome sequencing and cis-regulatory mapping identify mutations in MAK, a gene encoding a regulator of ciliary length, as a cause of retinitis pigmentosa."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee785a8d-420d-4c3a-a585-c963d06df52e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:12aa0844-3883-44e4-9b62-f0ddaa03fb39_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:12aa0844-3883-44e4-9b62-f0ddaa03fb39","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":67,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a9f38e8c-f001-4c50-b3c4-8990d936f238","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"MAK, 353-BP ALU INS, EX9","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/29780"}},"firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0030466","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:67ec1866-1921-4b9b-ad63-5ed4a66b9225_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a9f38e8c-f001-4c50-b3c4-8990d936f238"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22110072","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To determine the disease expression in autosomal recessive (ar) retinitis pigmentosa (RP) caused by mutations in the MAK (male germ cell-associated kinase) gene.","dc:creator":"Stone EM","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutations in the MAK gene."}},"rdfs:label":"P17"},{"id":"cggv:67ec1866-1921-4b9b-ad63-5ed4a66b9225","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67ec1866-1921-4b9b-ad63-5ed4a66b9225_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:67ec1866-1921-4b9b-ad63-5ed4a66b9225_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"See PMID: 21825139 from same authors re: this same cohort (Figure 4 - iPSC experiments show that this 353bp Alu insertion causes incorrect splicing and loss of typical MAK protein).

Superficial vascular complex (SVC), deep capillary complex (DCC) and choriocapillaris (CC) angiograms were registered with NIR-FAF acquisitions to comparatively assess subjects with and without central area of preserved NIR-FAF (APA). On the subset of patients showing an APA, the vessel densities for SVC and DCC and flow deficits for CC were assessed in three directions (superior, inferior and temporal) from the fovea and compared to healthy 1:1 age-matched controls. Nine patients with no APA had evidence of severe central OCTA alterations at all levels, especially in the DCC. In the other 29 subjects presenting APA, all OCTA parameters were similar to healthy eyes within the APA, where the retina preserves its structural integrity. Outside the APA, both the DCC and CC were significantly reduced in all directions. These alterations are probably related to the outer retinal atrophy outside the APA. Comparing OCTA to other imaging modalities is helpful to determine the potential interest of OCTA findings as an outcome measure for disease status and progression.","dc:creator":"Nassisi M","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Near-infrared fundus autofluorescence alterations correlate with swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography findings in patients with retinitis pigmentosa."}},{"id":"cggv:c0d97f0e-919a-4fb8-8a22-d88bbfe1cf22_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4559d41e-3df9-420a-8285-477cf0069eb6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542393"}],"rdfs:label":"CIC10105"},{"id":"cggv:43179e8b-0e07-44bc-ade8-5a770f8dea3b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43179e8b-0e07-44bc-ade8-5a770f8dea3b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:c0d97f0e-919a-4fb8-8a22-d88bbfe1cf22","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c0d97f0e-919a-4fb8-8a22-d88bbfe1cf22_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:85637f91-4c2e-44a7-b62a-7e5a062e9c80_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85637f91-4c2e-44a7-b62a-7e5a062e9c80","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:cc706e7a-1f9c-41db-9cf7-0cb8295583c3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001242957.3(MAK):c.518G>T (p.Arg173Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA362720668"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0011504","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:3086ed3f-9abf-458e-bf17-4040d20c91a0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cc706e7a-1f9c-41db-9cf7-0cb8295583c3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33921607","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is a powerful approach for detecting sequence variations in the human genome. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic defects in Jordanian patients with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) using WES. WES was performed on proband patients' DNA samples from 55 Jordanian families. Sanger sequencing was used for validation and segregation analysis of the detected, potential disease-causing variants (DCVs). Thirty-five putatively causative variants (6 novel and 29 known) in 21 IRD-associated genes were identified in 71% of probands (39 of the 55 families). Three families showed phenotypes different from the typically reported clinical findings associated with the causative genes. To our knowledge, this is the largest genetic analysis of IRDs in the Jordanian population to date. Our study also confirms that WES is a powerful tool for the molecular diagnosis of IRDs in large patient cohorts.","dc:creator":"Azab B","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Unique Variant Spectrum in a Jordanian Cohort with Inherited Retinal Dystrophies."}},"rdfs:label":"IRD04 III-6"},{"id":"cggv:3086ed3f-9abf-458e-bf17-4040d20c91a0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3086ed3f-9abf-458e-bf17-4040d20c91a0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:85d88b01-93c1-4608-9258-63370ab63856_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85d88b01-93c1-4608-9258-63370ab63856","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":77,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a9f38e8c-f001-4c50-b3c4-8990d936f238"},"firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0030466","obo:HP_0001133"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e1a298fa-5df5-4c25-8183-fec265cb1a59_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a9f38e8c-f001-4c50-b3c4-8990d936f238"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22110072"},"rdfs:label":"P24"},{"id":"cggv:e1a298fa-5df5-4c25-8183-fec265cb1a59","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e1a298fa-5df5-4c25-8183-fec265cb1a59_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e1a298fa-5df5-4c25-8183-fec265cb1a59_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"See PMID: 21825139 from same authors re: this same cohort (Figure 4 - iPSC experiments show that this 353bp Alu insertion causes incorrect splicing and loss of typical MAK protein).

We used exome sequencing to identify a homozygous Alu insertion in exon 9 of male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK) as the cause of disease in an isolated individual with RP. Screening of 1,798 unrelated RP patients identified 20 additional probands homozygous for this insertion (1.2%). All 21 affected probands are of Jewish ancestry. MAK encodes a kinase involved in the regulation of photoreceptor-connecting cilium length. Immunohistochemistry of human donor tissue revealed that MAK is expressed in the inner segments, cell bodies, and axons of rod and cone photoreceptors. Several isoforms of MAK that result from alternative splicing were identified. Induced pluripotent stem cells were derived from the skin of the proband and a patient with non-MAK-associated RP (RP control). In the RP control individual, we found that a transcript lacking exon 9 was predominant in undifferentiated cells, whereas a transcript bearing exon 9 and a previously unrecognized exon 12 predominated in cells that were differentiated into retinal precursors. However, in the proband with the Alu insertion, the developmental switch to the MAK transcript bearing exons 9 and 12 did not occur. In addition to showing the use of induced pluripotent stem cells to efficiently evaluate the pathogenicity of specific mutations in relatively inaccessible tissues like retina, this study reveals algorithmic and molecular obstacles to the discovery of pathogenic insertions and suggests specific changes in strategy that can be implemented to more fully harness the power of sequencing technologies.","dc:creator":"Tucker BA","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Exome sequencing and analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells identify the cilia-related gene male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK) as a cause of retinitis pigmentosa."}},"rdfs:label":"Tucker 1 (P14)"},{"id":"cggv:55aca46d-6f11-45bf-b467-7394eab45b59","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55aca46d-6f11-45bf-b467-7394eab45b59_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:55aca46d-6f11-45bf-b467-7394eab45b59_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Figure 4 - iPSC experiments show that this 353bp Alu insertion causes incorrect splicing and loss of typical MAK protein.

Mak was localized both in the connecting cilia and outer-segment axonemes of photoreceptor cells. In the Mak-null retina, photoreceptors exhibit elongated cilia and progressive degeneration. We observed accumulation of intraflagellar transport 88 (IFT88) and IFT57, expansion of kinesin family member 3A (Kif3a), and acetylated α-tubulin signals in the Mak-null photoreceptor cilia. We found abnormal rhodopsin accumulation in the Mak-null photoreceptor cell bodies at postnatal day 14. In addition, overexpression of retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1), a microtubule-associated protein localized in outer-segment axonemes, induced ciliary elongation, and Mak coexpression rescued excessive ciliary elongation by RP1. The RP1 N-terminal portion induces ciliary elongation and increased intensity of acetylated α-tubulin labeling in the cells and is phosphorylated by Mak.

In this population, 1 in 55 individuals are carriers and one third of all cases of recessive RP is caused by this gene. The purpose of this study was to determine if a viral gene augmentation strategy could be used to safely restore functional MAK protein as a step toward a treatment for early stage MAK-associated RP. Patient iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursor cells were generated and transduced with viral vectors containing the MAK transcript. One week after transduction, transcript and protein could be detected via rt-PCR and western blotting respectively. Using patient-derived fibroblast cells and mak knockdown zebra fish we demonstrate that over-expression of the retinal MAK transgene restored the cells ability to regulate primary cilia length. In addition, the visual defect in mak knockdown zebrafish was mitigated via treatment with the retinal MAK transgene. There was no evidence of local or systemic toxicity at 1-month or 3-months following subretinal delivery of clinical grade vector into wild type rats.

The initial reports described patients with adult-onset retinitis pigmentosa, with some cases described as sectoral retinitis pigmentosa. Patients typically presented with classic symptoms and signs of retinitis pigmentosa, including nyctalopia, constriction of the visual field, and pigmentary changes in the midperipheral retina. Stone et al. (2011; PMID: 22110072) describe a pattern of early superotemporal visual field loss. MAK-related retinopathy appears to cause non-syndromic retinal disease, and no associated extra-ocular features were identified in a cohort specifically screened for potential syndromic features (van Huet et al., 2015; PMID: 25385675). The *MAK* gene is associated with the phenotype retinitis pigmentosa (or rod-cone dystrophy) (MIM: 614181; ORPHA:791; HP:0000510). However, there is at least one report of a proband with a homozygous MAK variant and a diagnosis of cone-rod dystrophy and bull's eye maculopathy (PMID: 33921607). For consistency with the Retina GCEP curations, the disease entity MAK-related retinopathy has been selected. \n\nThirteen distinct variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, Alu repeat insertion) that have been reported in 31 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 21835304, 21825139, 22110072, 25255364, 33542393, 29781741, 33921607) are included in this curation. The most frequently reported variant is an insertion of a 353 base pair Alu repeat in exon 9 of *MAK* (often referred to as MAK-Alu insertion). This was first described by Tucker et al. (2011: PMID: 21825139) who identified it in multiple affected individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestries in a homozygous state. Notably, the MAK-Alu insertion is enriched in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (estimated carrier frequency of 1/55), and haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect (PMIDs: 25255364, 22110072). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum\nscore for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function (PMID: 34518651). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (e.g. animal models, expression studies, protein interactions, animal models, rescue experiments, etc.) (PMIDs: 21825139, 21148103, 34518651). The *MAK* (male germ cell-associated kinase) gene is important for long-term photoreceptor survival and serves as a negative regulator of cilia length (PMIDs: 21148103, 34518651). *MAK* is expressed in the photoreceptor cells, especially in the outer nuclear layer, axons, and inner segments (PMID: 21825139). There are two *MAK* transcripts expressed in the retina, one of which is a retina-specific transcript that contains a 75 base pair exon (exon 12) that is not present in the canonical transcript (PMID: 21825139). Mak is expressed in the developing mouse retina, and *Mak* knockout mice have photoreceptor degeneration (PMID: 21148103). The *mak* knockdown zebrafish also show signs of vision impairment and elongated cilia length, both of which can be rescued or partially rescued by injection of human *MAK* mRNA (PMID: 34518651). In addition, iPSC studies show rescue of the cilia defect in patient-derived fibroblasts when transduced with viral vectors driving canonical or retinal MAK expression (PMID: 34518651). More experimental evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, *MAK* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MAK-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on the meeting date March 2, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ee785a8d-420d-4c3a-a585-c963d06df52e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
