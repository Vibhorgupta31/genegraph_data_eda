In the current study, it took an extended challenge (4 − 6 hrs), yet significantly more CPT-1b+/− mice developed fatal hypothermia following a 6-hr cold challenge. This and the finding that 6−7% CPT-1b+/− mice verses none of the control mice had fatal hypothermia following a 3-hr cold challenge are consistent with tissue-specific expression of this enzyme in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, which mediates nonshivering and shivering thermogenesis, respectively.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18023382","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids (LCFA), the most abundant fatty acids in mammalian membranes and in energy metabolism. Human deficiency of the muscle isoform CPT-1b is poorly understood. In the current study, embryos with a homozygous knockout of Cpt-1b were lost before embryonic day 9.5-11.5. Also, while there were normal percentages of CPT-1b+/- pups born from both male and female CPT-1b+/- mice crossed with wild-type mates, the number of CPT-1b+/- pups from CPT-1b+/- breeding pairs was under-represented (63% of the expected number). Northern blot analysis demonstrated approximately 50% Cpt-1b mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT), heart and skeletal muscles in the CPT-1b+/- male mice. Consistent with tissue-specific expression of Cpt-1b mRNA in muscle but not liver, CPT-1+/- mice had approximately 60% CPT-1 activity in skeletal muscle and no change in total liver CPT-1 activity. CPT-1b+/- mice had normal fasting blood glucose concentration. Consistent with expression of CPT-1b in BAT and muscle, approximately 7% CPT-1b+/- mice (n=30) developed fatal hypothermia following a 3h cold challenge, while none of the CPT-1b+/+ mice (n=30) did. With a prolonged cold challenge (6h), significantly more CPT-1b+/- mice developed fatal hypothermia (52% CPT-1b+/- mice vs. 21% CPT-1b+/+ mice), with increased frequency in females of both genotypes (67% female vs. 38% male CPT-1b+/- mice, and 33% female vs. 8% male CPT-1b+/+ mice). Therefore, lethality of homozygous CPT-1b deficiency in the mice is consistent with paucity of human cases.","dc:creator":"Ji S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Homozygous carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b (muscle isoform) deficiency is lethal in the mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Cpt1b Knockout Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Decided not to give this model a score, since there are no genetically confirmed human phenotypes to compare the model phenotypes to.

CPT1B, like CPT1A, is a carnitine palmitoyltransferase\ninvolved in transport of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs from the\ncytoplasm into the mitochondrial. While CPT1A is specific to the liver, CPT1B is specific to skeletal muscle.  PMID: 18023382 reported homozygous Cpt1b-deficient mice that were embryonic lethal, while heterozygous mice exhibited decreased cold tolerance and fatal hypothermia after a cold-challenge test, suggesting the possibility that variation in CPT1B could be disease-\ncausing in humans or homozygous lethal. However, no cases have been reported in the literature. No convincing evidence for a causal role for CPT1B in an inherited fatty acid metabolism disorder has been reported. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the FAO GCEP on 09/25/2018.
