The brain appears swollen on magnetic resonance imaging, with diffuse white-matter abnormalities and the invariable presence of subcortical cysts. MLC was recently localized on chromosome 22q(tel). We have narrowed down the critical region by linkage analysis of 11 informative families with MLC to a region of approximately 250 kb, containing four known genes. One family with two patients who were siblings did not display linkage between the MLC phenotype and any of the analyzed microsatellite markers on chromosome 22q(tel), suggesting genetic heterogeneity and the existence of at least a second MLC locus. The maximum two-point LOD score for the 11 families was 6.6 at recombination fraction .02. Twelve different mutations in seven informative and six uninformative families were found in one of the candidate genes, KIAA0027, which we renamed \"MLC1.\" The gene encodes a putative membrane protein with eight predicted transmembrane domains. The patients of one family were compound heterozygotes for mutations that both introduced stop codons. The mutations further included frameshifts, splice-acceptor mutations, a putative splice-donor mutation, and amino acid substitutions of residues in predicted transmembrane domains. These data provide strong evidence that mutations of MLC1 cause the disease.","dc:creator":"Leegwater PA","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations of MLC1 (KIAA0027), encoding a putative membrane protein, cause megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c1543ab-f6b2-45ad-acea-b9a8945b1350","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8faefb9-ea7f-4597-b2c2-20141ee79605","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Astrocytes were infected or not with adenoviruses expressing wt MLC1 or S246R mutant containing two HA tags at different MOI.

MLC1 is an oligomeric plasma membrane (PM) protein of unknown function expressed mainly in glial cells and neurons. Most disease-causing missense mutations dramatically reduced the total and PM MLC1 expression levels in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. The impaired expression of the mutants was verified in primary cultures of rat astrocytes, as well as human monocytes, cell types that endogenously express MLC1, demonstrating the relevance of the tissue culture models. Using a combination of biochemical, pharmacological and imaging methods, we also demonstrated that increased endoplasmatic reticulum-associated degradation and endo-lysosomal-associated degradation can contribute to the cell surface expression defect of the mutants. Based on these results, we suggest that MLC1 mutations reduce protein levels in vivo. Since the expression defect of the mutants could be rescued by exposing the mutant-protein expressing cells to low temperature and glycerol, a chemical chaperone, we propose that MLC belongs to the class of conformational diseases. Therefore, we suggest the use of pharmacological strategies that improve MLC1 expression to treat MLC patients.","dc:creator":"Duarri A","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Molecular pathogenesis of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts: mutations in MLC1 cause folding defects."},"rdfs:label":"DUARRI 2008 FIG 5 RAT ASTROCYTES"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:347a2fd5-39d4-468c-bd26-7a1e9f041d23","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f87dac9d-fffa-4c40-be63-2ab7ee4c839a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The results show that severe and intermediate MLC1 mutants are mostly localized in lysosomes after internalization from the PM.

Screening of 200 normal Libyan Jewish individuals for the p.G59E mutation, revealed a carrier rate of 1/40 compared with an expected carrier rate of 1/81.

Two of the novel variations created a missense amino acid change and the other three were located in the introns and were putative splice mutations. One novel missense variation was observed in two unrelated patients from the central Black Sea region, and the data suggested a founder haplotype for this novel variation. Similarly, three unrelated patients with the previously reported p.Thr118Arg mutation shared a common haplotype. These data suggest an Anatolian origin for these two mutations.

Prior to this in 2000, (Topçu et al., PMID: 10677334) the location of the gene was mapped to Chromosome 22qtel. \n\nPrior to the identification of the gene, the condition was first clinically described in 1995 (Van der Knaap et al., PMID: 7695231).  A group of 8 children were described with infantile onset megaloencepahly and cerebral leukodystrophy with slowly progressive ataxia and spasticity. Brain MRI were significant for diffuse abnormality in signal intensity and swelling of the cerebral hemispheral white matter with cyst-like spaces in the frontoparietal and anterior-temporal subcortical areas.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern. Therefore, there is one disease entity, Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1 (OMIM:604004). \n\n11 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift,) that have been reported in 9 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 25497041, 32056211, 12189496, 21145992, 27389245) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (functional alteration, expression studies) (PMIDs: 18757878). Lower expression in rat astrocytes and altered pH distribution.\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *MLC1 *and autosomal recessive megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP at the meeting November 25, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
