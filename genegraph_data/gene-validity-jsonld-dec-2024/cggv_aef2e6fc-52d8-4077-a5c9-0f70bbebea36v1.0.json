In this investigation we have analysed the trafficking of gamma to the plasma membrane in cultures of inner medullary collecting duct cells (IMCD3) following acute hypertonic challenge and brefeldin A (BFA) treatment. Following hypertonic challenging for 24 hr immunofluorescence labeling revealed initial co-localization of the gamma subunit and 58K Golgi protein in the cytoplasm, but no co-localization of alpha1 and Golgi protein. Exposure of the challenged cells to BFA prevented the subsequent incorporation of gamma into the basolateral plasma membrane. The gamma subunit instead remained in cytoplasmic vesicles while cell proliferation and cell viability decreased simultaneously. Following removal of BFA from the hypertonic medium the IMCD3 cells recovered with distinct expression of gamma in the basolateral membrane. The alpha1 subunit was only marginally influenced by BFA. The results demonstrate that the gamma subunit trafficks to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus, despite the absence of a signal sequence. The results also suggest that the gamma and alpha subunits do not traffic together to the plasma membrane, and that the gamma and alpha subunit have different turnover rates during these experimental conditions.","dc:creator":"Pihakaski-Maunsbach K","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Expression and trafficking of the gamma subunit of Na,K-ATPase in hypertonically challenged IMCD3 cells."},"rdfs:label":"GTEx Data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:31089625-f188-4461-9945-f57534d23f3f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:038ccd31-895e-4496-ab0d-6307efccb339","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Due to the observations about the gamma subunit, it, not merely alpha/beta, then seems essential for the long-term adaptation to the hypertonic environments.

Administering EDTA to the oocytes with the variant stopped the inward flow, but EDTA did not impact the inward current flow in the normal FXYD2 oocytes. Extracellular ions, Ca2+, Ba2+, and La3+, prevented both wild-type and mutant FXYD2 currents. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Glycine 41 residue showed that a positive charge at this point is necessary for the inward flow. Mutating the 41 residue to a hydrophobic amino acid like leucine or valine allowed FXYD2 channel activity but such that was notably lower than the wild type.

Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with wild-type FXYD2 or the mutant G41R cRNAs expressed large nonselective ion currents. However, in contrast to the wild-type FXYD2 currents, inward rectifying cation currents were induced by hyperpolarization pulses in oocytes expressing the G41R mutant. Injection of EDTA into the oocyte removed inward rectification in the oocytes expressing the mutant, but did not alter the nonlinear current-voltage relationship of the wild-type FXYD2 pseudo-steady-state currents. Extracellular divalent ions, Ca2+ and Ba2+, and trivalent cations, La3+, blocked both the wild-type and mutant FXYD2 currents. Site-directed mutagenesis of G41 demonstrated that a positive charge at this site is required for the inward rectification.

Apparent affinities of Na,K-ATPase for Na(+), K(+) and ATP did not differ between patient and control cells or after hyperosmotic induction.

Several FXYD proteins have been shown to bind to Na,K-ATPase and modulate its properties, and each FXYD protein appears to alter enzyme kinetics differently. Different results have sometimes been obtained with different experimental systems, however. To test for effects of gamma in a native tissue environment, mice lacking a functional gamma subunit gene (Fxyd2) were generated. These mice were viable and without observable pathology. Prior work in the mouse embryo showed that gamma is expressed at the blastocyst stage. However, there was no delay in blastocele formation, and the expected Mendelian ratios of offspring were obtained even with Fxyd2-/- dams. In adult Fxyd2-/- mouse kidney, splice variants of gamma that have different nephron segment-specific expression patterns were absent. Purified gamma-deficient renal Na,K-ATPase displayed higher apparent affinity for Na+ without significant change in apparent affinity for K+. Affinity for ATP, which was expected to be decreased, was instead slightly increased. The results suggest that regulation of Na+ sensitivity is a major functional role for this protein, whereas regulation of ATP affinity may be context-specific. Most importantly, this implies that gamma and other FXYD proteins have their effects by local and not global conformation change. Na,K-ATPase lacking the gamma subunit had increased thermal lability. Combined with other evidence that gamma participates in an early step of thermal denaturation, this indicates that FXYD proteins may play an important structural role in the enzyme complex.","dc:creator":"Jones DH","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Na,K-ATPase from mice lacking the gamma subunit (FXYD2) exhibits altered Na+ affinity and decreased thermal stability."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"It's really just talking about indirectly molecular mechanisms, as opposed to an actual phenotype that resembles hypomagnesemia.

The gene is associated with low magnesium levels due to a loss of kidney magnesium, as well as hypokalemia, hypocalciuria, and renal failure. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no relevant differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern or phenotypic variability (there is only one disease assertion for this gene). Therefore, no pre-curation was needed. One variant (the missense variant Gly41Arg) has been reported in 18 probands from one family in 2 publications (PMIDs: 25765846, 11062458) included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (biochemical functional evidence, expression level data, functional alteration evidence, and a mouse model; PMIDs: 18787637, 18448590, 18448590, 15755730). In summary, FXYD2 is moderately associated with autosomal dominant renal hypomagnesemia 2. The disease is only associated with one variant in the gene, but there is case-level data (including lots of segregation) and various experimental evidence to support the relationship. Thus, a moderate classification, which was reached based on the point system (7.0 points were reached), felt appropriate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aef2e6fc-52d8-4077-a5c9-0f70bbebea36"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
