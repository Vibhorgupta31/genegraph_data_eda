The substrate of N-linked glycosylation, dolichol pyrophosphate (DolPP)-GlcNAc(2)Man(9)Glc(3), is assembled through a complex series of ordered reactions requiring the translocation of the intermediate DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) structure across the endoplasmic-reticulum membrane. A young patient diagnosed with a congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by an intracellular accumulation of DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) was found to carry a homozygous point mutation in the RFT1 gene. The c.199C-->T mutation introduced the amino acid substitution p.R67C. The human RFT1 protein shares 22% identity with its yeast ortholog, which is involved in the translocation of DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) from the cytosolic into the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite the low sequence similarity between the yeast and the human RFT1 proteins, we demonstrated both their functional orthology and the pathologic effect of the human p.R67C mutation by complementation assay in Deltarft1 yeast cells. The causality of the RFT1 p.R67C mutation was further established by restoration of normal glycosylation profiles in patient-derived fibroblasts after lentiviral expression of a normal RFT1 cDNA. The definition of the RFT1 defect establishes the functional conservation of the DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) translocation process in eukaryotes. RFT1 deficiency in both yeast and human cells leads to the accumulation of incomplete DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) and to a profound glycosylation disorder in humans.","dc:creator":"Haeuptle MA","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Human RFT1 deficiency leads to a disorder of N-linked glycosylation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:850304c8-4ac4-4d58-aaee-1ffa577cccf7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:850304c8-4ac4-4d58-aaee-1ffa577cccf7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6b69ddf4-2a54-4338-ad02-e32cbd1f0b25","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1835c886-fe3e-4739-8f8e-500458ce2991","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Based on yeast genetic analysis, Rft1 was proposed to be the LLO flippase that flips Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol from the cytoplasmic side to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum.

The tetradecasaccharide substrate (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is first assembled at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a dolichylpyrophosphate (Dol-PP)-linked intermediate, and then transferred to nascent polypeptide chains in the lumen of the ER. The assembly of the oligosaccharide starts on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane with the synthesis of a Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol intermediate. This lipid-linked intermediate is then translocated across the membrane so that the oligosaccharides face the lumen of the ER, where the biosynthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol continues to completion. The fully assembled oligosaccharide is transferred to selected asparagine residues of target proteins. The transmembrane movement of lipid-linked Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide is of fundamental importance in this biosynthetic pathway, and similar processes involving phospholipids and glycolipids are essential in all types of cells. The process is predicted to be catalysed by proteins, termed flippases, which to date have remained elusive.

One key step in the biosynthesis of the Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol precursor, essential for N-glycosylation, is the translocation of Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This step is facilitated by the RFT1 protein. Recently, the first RFT1-deficient CDG (RFT1-CDG) patient was identified and presented a severe N-glycosylation disorder. In the present study, we describe three novel CDG patients with an RFT1 deficiency. The first patient was homozygous for the earlier reported RFT1 missense mutation (c.199C>T; p.R67C), whereas the two other patients were homozygous for the missense mutation c.454A>G (p.K152E) and c.892G>A (p.E298 K), respectively. The pathogenic character of the novel mutations was illustrated by the accumulation of Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol and by reduced recombinant DNase 1 secretion. Both the glycosylation pattern and recombinant DNase 1 secretion could be normalized by expression of normal RFT1 cDNA in the patients' fibroblasts. The clinical phenotype of these patients comprised typical CDG symptoms in addition to sensorineural deafness, rarely reported in CDG patients. The identification of additional RFT1-deficient patients allowed to delineate the main clinical picture of RFT1-CDG and confirmed the crucial role of RFT1 in Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol translocation.","dc:creator":"Vleugels W","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"RFT1 deficiency in three novel CDG patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:17209911-f562-4464-acf1-213b6ead9a54","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17209911-f562-4464-acf1-213b6ead9a54_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD: - African/ African American (3/24972) (0.0001201)\n-European (non-finnish) 3/129158 (0.00002323)\nhttps://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/3-53157807-G-A\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f7c3956f-5f84-4a9e-a7a4-c8c0e30562a4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7c3956f-5f84-4a9e-a7a4-c8c0e30562a4","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9458fdff-5eb7-41a5-8ec3-5ba02ab74d49","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052859.4(RFT1):c.892G>A (p.Glu298Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA275920"}},"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0002093","obo:HP_0001181","obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0003186","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0007663","obo:HP_0008081","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0000470","obo:HP_0001336","obo:HP_0006532","obo:HP_0001252"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e5b3c621-6fee-43d5-8c46-01a422e50f68_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9458fdff-5eb7-41a5-8ec3-5ba02ab74d49"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19701946"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 3"},{"id":"cggv:e5b3c621-6fee-43d5-8c46-01a422e50f68","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5b3c621-6fee-43d5-8c46-01a422e50f68_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD: East Asian:  1/18388\t(0.00005438) \nhttps://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/3-53139754-C-T"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6fb07ee6-0257-4ce5-80c4-1062d029c352_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6fb07ee6-0257-4ce5-80c4-1062d029c352","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:4bef561e-3da7-4b48-9fbc-2e87108405f0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052859.4(RFT1):c.110G>T (p.Arg37Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353223937"}},{"id":"cggv:637685fb-1433-41af-9453-ccbab44157dd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052859.4(RFT1):c.1325G>A (p.Arg442Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA275927"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001276","obo:HP_0001662","obo:HP_0002273","obo:HP_0010851","obo:HP_0000737","obo:HP_0002098","obo:HP_0032792","obo:HP_0002104","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0000961","obo:HP_0000407"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:3b6c7587-7a76-43d3-ba81-82cf907dc506_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:637685fb-1433-41af-9453-ccbab44157dd"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26892341","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"RFT1-congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) syndrome, a recessive N-glycosylation disorder caused by mutation in the RFT1 gene, is a very rare subtype of CDG syndrome associated with deafness, developmental delay, and non-specific epilepsy.

A total of 1019 tests were performed in the period of March 2016-December 2016 comprising 972 solo (index only), 14 duo (parents or affected siblings only), and 33 trio (index and parents). Multigene panels accounted for 672 tests, while whole exome sequencing (WES) represented the remaining 347 tests. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that explain the clinical indications were identified in 34% (27% in panels and 43% in exomes), spanning 279 genes and including 165 novel variants. While recessive mutations dominated the landscape of solved cases (71% of mutations, and 97% of which are homozygous), a substantial minority (27%) were solved on the basis of dominant mutations. The highly consanguineous nature of the study population also facilitated homozygosity for many private mutations (only 32.5% of the recessive mutations are founder), as well as the first instances of recessive inheritance of previously assumed strictly dominant disorders (involving ITPR1, VAMP1, MCTP2, and TBP). Surprisingly, however, dual molecular diagnosis was only observed in 1.5% of cases.

If the novel candidate disease genes in this cohort are independently confirmed, the yield of WES will have increased to 83%, which suggests that most \"negative\" clinical exome tests are unsolved due to interpretation rather than technical limitations.","dc:creator":"Monies D","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"The landscape of genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia based on the first 1000 diagnostic panels and exomes."}},"rdfs:label":"16W-0235"},{"id":"cggv:a1dfebff-7651-4751-8eee-73031b7d548a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1dfebff-7651-4751-8eee-73031b7d548a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a1dfebff-7651-4751-8eee-73031b7d548a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"gnomAD: n/a"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Skipping of exon 7 causes a frameshift in exon 8 with a premature stop codon predicted to undergo non-sense-mediated decay."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:07437121-3f05-4e04-ab9f-2b5cac857021_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07437121-3f05-4e04-ab9f-2b5cac857021","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":11,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:bd242f04-3911-4558-b39c-c2e846dd8999","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052859.4(RFT1):c.887T>A (p.Ile296Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA275921"}},{"id":"cggv:6acdef1a-37fb-4d4b-9b53-b1933f420496","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052859.4(RFT1):c.887T>G (p.Ile296Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA275923"}}],"phenotypeFreeText":"Knee tendon reflexes were not elicitable","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0003186","obo:HP_0003256","obo:HP_0000422","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0003642","obo:HP_0000543","obo:HP_0000160","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0000463"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:fb4286de-8da7-4fda-b04d-2a9b4aa2b0e6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bd242f04-3911-4558-b39c-c2e846dd8999"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19856127","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are genetic diseases due to defects in the synthesis of glycans and in the attachment of glycans to lipids and proteins. Actually, some 42 CDG are known including defects in protein N-glycosylation, in protein O-glycosylation, in lipid glycosylation, and in multiple and other glycosylation pathways. Most CDG are multisystem diseases and a large number of signs and symptoms have already been reported in CDG. An exception to this is deafness. This symptom has not been observed as a consistent feature in CDG. In 2008, a novel defect was identified in protein N-glycosylation, namely in RFT1. This is a defect in the assembly of N-glycans. RFT1 is involved in the transfer of Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol from the cytoplasmic to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. According to the novel nomenclature (non-italicized gene symbol followed by -CDG) this defect is named RFT1-CDG. Recently, three other patients with RFT1-CDG have been reported and here we report two novel patients. Remarkably, all six patients with RFT1-CDG show sensorineural deafness as part of a severe neurological syndrome. We conclude that RFT1-CDG is the first 'deafness-CDG'. CDG should be included in the work-up of congenital, particularly syndromic, hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Jaeken J","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"RFT1-CDG: deafness as a novel feature of congenital disorders of glycosylation."}},{"id":"cggv:e7492af9-a446-425b-82c2-faec7a7a0ee2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6acdef1a-37fb-4d4b-9b53-b1933f420496"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19856127"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:fb4286de-8da7-4fda-b04d-2a9b4aa2b0e6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb4286de-8da7-4fda-b04d-2a9b4aa2b0e6_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD: N/A"},{"id":"cggv:e7492af9-a446-425b-82c2-faec7a7a0ee2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e7492af9-a446-425b-82c2-faec7a7a0ee2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD: N/A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:67cd8172-dd1b-4221-ad5b-b1ed039c4e20_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67cd8172-dd1b-4221-ad5b-b1ed039c4e20","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:c6eeaba4-128a-4d75-b813-1c14864e24b8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052859.4(RFT1):c.1222A>G (p.Met408Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA275925"}},{"id":"cggv:637685fb-1433-41af-9453-ccbab44157dd"}],"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0003256","obo:HP_0003642","obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002751","obo:HP_0001347"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:0b7939fd-75c0-4e6a-a2f0-f9a79ff104cd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c6eeaba4-128a-4d75-b813-1c14864e24b8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23111317","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"RFT1-CDG is a rare N-glycosylation disorder.

congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are defects in glycoprotein and glycolipid glycan synthesis and attachment. They affect multiple organ/systems, but non-specific symptoms render the diagnosis of the different CDG very challenging. Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2)-CDG is the most common CDG, but advances in genetic analysis have shown others to occur more commonly than previously thought. The present work reports the clinical and mutational spectrum of 25 non-PMM2 CDG patients. The most common clinical symptoms were hypotonia (80%), motor or psychomotor disability (80%) and craniofacial dysmorphism (76%). Based on their serum transferrin isoform profile, 18 were classified as CDG-I and 7 as CDG-II. Pathogenic variations were found in 16 genes (ALG1, ALG6, ATP6V0A2, B4GALT1, CCDC115, COG7, DOLK, DPAGT1, DPM1, GFPT1, MPI, PGM1, RFT1, SLC35A2, SRD5A3, and SSR4). Overall, 27 variants were identified, 12 of which are novel. The results highlight the importance of combining genetic and biochemical analyses for the early diagnosis of this heterogeneous group of disorders.","dc:creator":"Medrano C","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular diagnosis of non-phosphomannomutase 2 N-linked congenital disorders of glycosylation in Spain."}},"rdfs:label":"p22"},{"id":"cggv:c418d3db-4d5a-459d-86f0-dc5efb60653c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c418d3db-4d5a-459d-86f0-dc5efb60653c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"up scored because yeast assay on variant\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:18685406-5f4d-4647-a229-344126754f65_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:18685406-5f4d-4647-a229-344126754f65","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":58,"allele":{"id":"cggv:6a1fc193-5d36-427f-bee1-916d8487a694","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052859.4(RFT1):c.902A>G (p.Tyr301Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353229620"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0002120","obo:HP_0003642","obo:HP_0012471","obo:HP_0011097","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0000276","obo:HP_0000329","obo:HP_0001929","obo:HP_0001252"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:5b49fb85-9a44-4aab-83b3-7f1e12358cca_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6a1fc193-5d36-427f-bee1-916d8487a694"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28940310","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) represent an expanding group of conditions that result from defects in protein and lipid glycosylation. Different subgroups of CDG display considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity due to the highly complex nature of cellular glycosylation. This is further complicated by ethno-geographic differences in the mutational landscape of each of these subgroups. Ten Arab CDG patients from Latifa Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, were assessed using biochemical (glycosylation status of transferrin) and molecular approaches (next-generation sequencing [NGS] and Sanger sequencing). In silico tools including CADD and PolyPhen-2 were used to predict the functional consequences of uncovered mutations. In our sample of patients, five novel mutations were uncovered in the genes: MPDU1, PMM2, MAN1B1, and RFT1. In total, 9 mutations were harbored by the 10 patients in 7 genes. These are missense and nonsense mutations with deleterious functional consequences. This article integrates a single-center experience within a list of reported CDG mutations in the Arab world, accompanied by full molecular and clinical details pertaining to the studied cases.

Because of the limited number of reported cases in each type except PMM2-CDG, the complete clinical picture of other types is not known. RFT1-CDG is a rare type, with ten cases reported in the literature. Our patient presented as a floppy neonate with severe respiratory insufficiency and ventilator dependence in the newborn period. He had fetal growth restriction, facial dysmorphism, high arched palate, bilateral cryptorchidism, hypoplastic pons and cerebellum and probable hearing impairment. He succumbed to the illness on day 24 of life. There was a similar history of two previous sibling deaths in the early neonatal period due to respiratory insufficiency and history of multiple neonatal and infant deaths in the extended family. Transferrin iso-electric focusing was normal. Clinical exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.1018 G > A) in RFT1 gene [NM_052859; c.1018G > A; p.G340S; ENST00000296292] and the parents were heterozygous for the same (ClinVar SVC000778540).

At least 15 unique variants (missense and 1 frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands from 12 publications (PMIDs:18313027, 19701946, 1985612, 23111317, 29923091, 27172925, 28940310, 28600779, 36579437, 30071302, 30653653, and 28940097). Patient symptoms mainly include encephalopathy, epilepsy, and hearing impairment as well as variable feeding problems, dysmorphism, Global developmental delay, Type I transferrin isoform profile, and hypotonia. No supporting segregation information is available. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of RFT1, which is a putative flippase involved in the transfer of Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol from the cytoplasmic to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (PMID: 11807558). Functional alteration of non-patient cells also shows that mutations in the RFT1 gene resulted in variable degrees of impairment in RFT activity and N-linked glycosylation (PMID: 18313027). Finally, rescue in patient cells shows that the expression of the wild-type RFT1 cDNA in the respective patient-derived fibroblasts restored the synthesis of the complete LLO DolPP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 (PMID: 22213132). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence, genetic and experimental, is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
