Over 70 genes have been identified to date, and with the advent of massively parallel sequencing, the pace of novel gene discovery has accelerated. In a family segregating progressive autosomal-dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), we used OtoSCOPE® to exclude mutations in known deafness genes and then performed segregation mapping and whole-exome sequencing to identify a unique variant, p.Ser178Leu, in TBC1D24 that segregates with the hearing loss phenotype. TBC1D24 encodes a GTPase-activating protein expressed in the cochlea. Ser178 is highly conserved across vertebrates and its change is predicted to be damaging. Other variants in TBC1D24 have been associated with a panoply of clinical symptoms including autosomal recessive NSHL, syndromic hearing impairment associated with onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures (DOORS syndrome), and a wide range of epileptic disorders.

All TBC1D24 mutations reported so far were inherited in the recessive mode. In a dominant family segregated with late-onset, progressive, nonsyndromic hearing impairment, linkage analysis revealed a 2.07 Mb candidate region on chromosome 16p13.3 that contains TBC1D24. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous p.Ser178Leu variant of TBC1D24 as the only candidate mutation segregating with the hearing loss within the family. In perinatal mouse cochlea, we detected a restricted expression of Tbc1d24 in the stereocilia of the hair cells as well as in the spiral ganglion neurons. Our study suggested that the p.Ser178Leu mutation of TBC1D24 is a probable cause for dominant, nonsyndromic hearing impairment. Identification of TBC1D24 as the stereocilia-expressing gene may shed new light on its specific function in the inner ear.

At least 8 missense variants that have been reported in 12 humans in 6 publications are included in this curation (PMID: 24729547, 24729539, 33281559, 33986365, 36597107, 38413761). Variants in this gene have segregated with disease in 64 additional family members (PMIDs: 24729547, 24729539, 33281559, 33986365, 38413761). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies (PMIDs: 224729547, 24729539, 32987832). Other than expression in mouse cochlear hair cells, there is no experimental evidence for a dominant disease. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 3/27/2018 as per SOP v6. It was reevaluated on 5/3/2024 using SOP v10. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. New case-level and functional evidence has been reviewed or added, but the classification did not change (PMIDs: 36597107, 34440452, 32860223, 38413761, 32987832).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cd496a45-5ae0-4e56-8a3d-2c410a5bd0c8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
