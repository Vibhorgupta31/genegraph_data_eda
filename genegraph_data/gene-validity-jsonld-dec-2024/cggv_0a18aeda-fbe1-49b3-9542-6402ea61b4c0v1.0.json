By applying a combined strategy of linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing in the presented family, a homozygous nonsense mutation, c.4G>T (p.Glu2*), in FITM2 was identified. FITM2 and its paralog FITM1 constitute an evolutionary conserved protein family involved in partitioning of triglycerides into cellular lipid droplets. Despite the role of FITM2 in neutral lipid storage and metabolism, no indications for lipodystrophy were observed in the affected individuals. In order to obtain independent evidence for the involvement of FITM2 in the human pathology, downregulation of the single Fitm ortholog, CG10671, in Drosophila melanogaster was pursued using RNA interference. Characteristics of the syndrome, including progressive locomotor impairment, hearing loss and disturbed sensory functions, were recapitulated in Drosophila, which supports the causative nature of the FITM2 mutation. Mutation-based genetic counseling can now be provided to the family and insight is obtained into the potential impact of genetic variation in FITM2.","dc:creator":"Zazo Seco C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A homozygous FITM2 mutation causes a deafness-dystonia syndrome with motor regression and signs of ichthyosis and sensory neuropathy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a18aeda-fbe1-49b3-9542-6402ea61b4c0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a18aeda-fbe1-49b3-9542-6402ea61b4c0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:28aa3cb8-2fc7-4cc2-8ac1-860438d1e07f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3fc3d70-31a7-43ee-b229-39e37a9cee79","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The causative association of the syndrome with a loss-of-function mutation in FITM2 is supported by modeling of the disease in Drosophila melanogaster, which has been proven to be a suitable model for studying conserved aspects of lipid metabolism and LD biology.

The single homozygous 8.4 Mb region on chromosome 20q12–q13.2 was fully covered in the enrichment kit. In the linkage region, only non-synonymous exonic and canonical splice-site variants were selected that occurred with a frequency of less than 5% in the 1000 genomes and HapMap populations, and that were homozygous in both affected siblings and heterozygous in the parents. This revealed a single homozygous nonsense mutation in the second codon, c.4G>T (p.Glu2*, NM_001080472.1), of FITM2 that cosegregated in the family with the disease. This FITM2 c.4G>T variant was neither present in 274 Pakistani control alleles nor in whole-genome or -exome databases. In order to exclude other potentially causative variants, especially in genomic regions with a LOD score ≥−2, we selected all variants with a MAF (minor allele frequency) <5% that were heterozygous in the parents and compound heterozygous or homozygous in both affected siblings.

It encodes for the fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2, embedded in the wall of the endoplasmic reticulum where they regulate lipid droplet formation in the cytosol.\n*FITM2 *was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Siddiqi syndrome (SIDDIS) in 2017 (Zazo Seco et al., PMID: 28067622). This disease is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the *FITM2* gene. The associated phenotypes involve the nervous system and musculature including hypotonia, global developmental delay, poor fine motor skills, impaired intellectual development, and sensorineural hearing impairment. More variable features may include ichthyosis-like skin abnormalities or sensory neuropathy. Around 5 unique variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift, and missense) have been reported in at least 4 probands in various publications (PMID: 28067622, 30214770, 30288795, 35754111). A LOF nonsense variant was also found to segregate with the disorder in additional family members with a LOD score of 4.00 (PMID: 28067622). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence in Drosophila (animal model) where RNAi-induced gene downregulation of *Fitm* gene resulted in severely impaired and uncoordinated locomotion along with sensory neuropathy, thus recapitulating the phenotypic features of Siddiqi syndrome (PMID: 28067622). Symptomatic evidence for dyskinetic cerebral palsy has also been reported in one of the probands (PMID: 30214770).\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship of the *FITM2* gene with Siddiqi syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 17/10/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0a18aeda-fbe1-49b3-9542-6402ea61b4c0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
