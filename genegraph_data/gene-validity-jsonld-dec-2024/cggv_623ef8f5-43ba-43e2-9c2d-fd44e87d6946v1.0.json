An autosomal dominant, congenital form of the disease, also known as \"Milroy disease,\" has been mapped to the telomeric part of chromosome 5q, in the region 5q34-q35. This region contains a good candidate gene for the disease, VEGFR3 (FLT4), that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase specific for lymphatic vessels. To clarify the role of VEGFR3 in the etiology of the disease, we have analyzed a family with hereditary lymphedema. We show linkage of the disease with markers in 5q34-q35, including a VEGFR3 intragenic polymorphism, and we describe an A-->G transition that cosegregates with the disease, corresponding to a histidine-to-arginine substitution in the catalytic loop of the protein. In addition, we show, by in vitro expression, that this mutation inhibits the autophosphorylation of the receptor. Thus, defective VEGFR3 signaling seems to be the cause of congenital hereditary lymphedema linked to 5q34-q35.","dc:creator":"Irrthum A","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Congenital hereditary lymphedema caused by a mutation that inactivates VEGFR3 tyrosine kinase."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10835628","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Primary lymphoedema is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder that leads to a disabling and disfiguring swelling of the extremities and, when untreated, tends to worsen with time.

The newly cloned FLT4 receptor tyrosine kinase gene encodes a protein related to the VEGF receptors FLT1 and KDR/FLK-1. We have here studied the expression of FLT4 and the other two members of this receptor family in human fetal tissues by Northern and in situ hybridization. These results were also compared with the sites of expression of VEGF and the related placenta growth factor (PlGF). Our results reveal FLT4 mRNA expression in vascular endothelial cells in developing vessels of several organs. A comparison of FLT4, FLT1 and KDR/FLK-1 receptor mRNA signals shows overlapping, but distinct expression patterns in the tissues studied. Certain endothelia lack one or two of the three receptor mRNAs. These data suggest that the receptor tyrosine kinases encoded by the FLT gene family may have distinct functions in the regulation of the growth/differentiation of blood vessels.","dc:creator":"Kaipainen A","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"The related FLT4, FLT1, and KDR receptor tyrosine kinases show distinct expression patterns in human fetal endothelial cells."},"rdfs:label":"TOP tissue experiments"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c3f587bf-9d79-4a65-98ef-a042ee3e7cec","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b3487ae4-c755-42fd-93d0-8366a2d66f41","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The expression of FLT4 starts in the angioblasts in the early embryonic life (E7.5-8.5).

Transgenic mice develop a lymphedema-like phenotype characterized by swelling of feet, edema and dermal fibrosis.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism(s) and phenotypic variability between reported phenotypic assertions. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities; Lymphatic malformation (OMIM:153100) and Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 7 (OMIM:618780). The split curation for autosomal dominant Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 7 has been performed separately. \n\nLymphatic malformation 1 is primarily characterized by bilateral lower-limb lymphedema with inter and intra-familial variability, hydrocele in males, prominent (varicose) veins below the knees, and dysplastic toenails. Prenatal manifestations may include pedal edema, mild pleural effusions, and rarely non-immune fetal hydrops. Sixteen probands including 5 prenatal presentations are included in this curation along with affected family members (n = ~75) (PMIDs: 10835628, 10856194, 12960217, 16231305, 17250670, 18719607, 16965327, 23074044, 33027564, 34103024). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. To date, only nonsynonymous and in-frame deletion variants located in the exons encoding for the tyrosine kinase domain (aa 845-1173) have been reported, and affected individuals were not reported to have congenital heart defects. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence; expression studies demonstrating lymphatic endothelial expression (PMIDs: 7724599, 8245783), in vitro functional assays demonstrating abolished tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation and downstream target phosphorylation (PMIDs: 10835628, 10856194), and animal models demonstrating the phenotypes reported in humans (PMIDs: 11175851, 11592985). In summary, FLT4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Lymphatic malformation 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical diagnostic and research settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:623ef8f5-43ba-43e2-9c2d-fd44e87d6946"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
