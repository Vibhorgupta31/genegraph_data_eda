Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Complex IV subunit/assembly factor"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"More than 10 genes in this category have been associated with mitochondrial disease.\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:7b2b04f9-275d-45e9-acc6-ee86bf20c782_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:21e496ea-1bd2-4807-9007-0577268f6074","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c423c1bb-5a47-47a4-bc10-e36d4eab8b03","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Biochemistry/rescue: Performed in cells from S2 and S6, first showed low steady-state levels of COX subunits, reduced levels of fully assembled COX, and decreased COX activity; both cell lines were transduced with APOPT1 and showed full recovery of COX assembly and COX enzymatic activity, which were around 50% of the control in the non-transduced (naıve) and GFP alone transduced cells.\n\nResponse to ROS: With increased ROS, APOPT1 is stabilized, increasing its mature  intramitochondrial form and thereby protecting COX from oxidatively induced degradation.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30552096","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Loss-of-function mutations in ","dc:creator":"Signes A","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"APOPT1/COA8 assists COX assembly and is oppositely regulated by UPS and ROS."},"rdfs:label":"Signes_functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:039dd79a-43a2-41f7-9f4a-9c0256a22c65","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b163e28e-390b-4ce8-ad3d-6199f87da457","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Biochemistry: BNGE in S1 and S2 fibroblasts, amount of both COX holocomplex and cIII2þcIV supercomplex was clearly reduced in both mutant cells, more markedly in S2; other complexes similar to controls\n\nResponse to ROS: Expression of wild-type APOPT1 in mutant fibroblast cells led to an increase in the amount of COX and a reduction of ROS production to normal levels.

Whole-exome sequencing led to the identification of APOPT1 mutations in two Italian sisters and in a third Turkish individual presenting severe COX deficiency. All three subjects presented a distinctive brain MRI pattern characterized by cavitating leukodystrophy, predominantly in the posterior region of the cerebral hemispheres. We then found APOPT1 mutations in three additional unrelated children, selected on the basis of these particular MRI features. All identified mutations predicted the synthesis of severely damaged protein variants. The clinical features of the six subjects varied widely from acute neurometabolic decompensation in late infancy to subtle neurological signs, which appeared in adolescence; all presented a chronic, long-surviving clinical course. We showed that APOPT1 is targeted to and localized within mitochondria by an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is eventually cleaved off from the mature protein. We then showed that APOPT1 is virtually absent in fibroblasts cultured in standard conditions, but its levels increase by inhibiting the proteasome or after oxidative challenge. Mutant fibroblasts showed reduced amount of COX holocomplex and higher levels of reactive oxygen species, which both shifted toward control values by expressing a recombinant, wild-type APOPT1 cDNA. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of APOPT1 in myoblasts and fibroblasts caused dramatic decrease in cell viability. APOPT1 mutations are responsible for infantile or childhood-onset mitochondrial disease, hallmarked by the combination of profound COX deficiency with a distinctive neuroimaging presentation.","dc:creator":"Melchionda L","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mutations in APOPT1, encoding a mitochondrial protein, cause cavitating leukoencephalopathy with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Melchionda_functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Biochemistry and response to ROS consistent with disease mechanism."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:7b2b04f9-275d-45e9-acc6-ee86bf20c782_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2a0cdbf-ce90-48bb-9cf5-6e98160bfc90","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:14c07cef-a678-48ae-a313-3fe11b2a22b2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Recapitulation of phenotype:  impaired motor skills (decreased motor coordination and endurance evidenced by difficulty with treadmill and rotarod)\n\nBiochemistry: Reduced COX activity in multiple tissues, low steady-state levels of structural subunits and defective assembly in all the tested tissues.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30552096","rdfs:label":"Signes_mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"2 points: phenotype; 1 point: biochemistry"},{"id":"cggv:12e58d65-7f60-492e-9236-8264c752ce31","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5488f36f-6888-4117-9dab-fd739d187872","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"complex IV deficiency, neurologic impairment","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31555154","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cytochrome ","dc:creator":"Brischigliaro M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Knockdown of "},"rdfs:label":"Brischigliaro_drosophila"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"2 points - phenotype recapitulation; 1 point - biochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:7b2b04f9-275d-45e9-acc6-ee86bf20c782_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48e111c1-a171-4ea5-8060-45627ef78f81_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48e111c1-a171-4ea5-8060-45627ef78f81","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:557a65cd-0d87-436b-8db0-450ca5603656","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001370595.2(COA8):c.196C>T (p.Arg66Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA170865"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"26y woman with history of vomiting and poor growth followed by left hemiparesis, somnolence, irritability, loss of ambulation at 2.5y.

This gene was first reported to encode mitochondrial apoptogenic protein 1 (*APOPT1*) however subsequent studies have not shown evidence for a pro-apoptotic role. Rather, this gene is now known to encode cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 8 (*COA8*) and functions in protecting the nascent COX holoenzyme from oxidative damage, particularly during metal insertion into the enzyme’s catalytic sites (PMID: 31555154). Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\n*COA8* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2014 (PMID: 25175347), in several individuals with cavitating leukodystrophy and complex IV deficiency.  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COA8*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COA8* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven unique variants (three nonsense, one intronic, two exonic deletions, one missense) identified in eight affected individuals from seven kindreds reported in three publications (PMIDs: 25175347, 29577824, 32637636). Affected individuals have a broad spectrum of features ranging from acute neurometabolic decompensation in late infancy to mild neurologic features in adolescence. Also seen were encephalopathic episodes (acute loss of developmental milestones, somnolence, seizures, pyramidal signs progressing to spastic tetraparesis) that tended to stabilize or improve over time. Age of onset varied from two to five years old, with one adult reported with minimal neurologic features (PMID: 32637636). The outcomes were variable, ranging from death to stabilization/improvement. Muscle biopsies showed complex IV deficiency. Brain imaging showed a cavitating leukodystrophy predominantly involving the posterior cerebral white matter and the corpus callosum in the acute stage after which the abnormalities partially improved and then stabilized in some affected individuals. Metabolic screening labs were not routinely reported.\n  \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function (PMID: 33340416), model organisms including a drosophila knockdown (PMID: 31555154) and mouse knockout (PMID: 30552096), and functional alteration in human cells (PMIDs: 25175347, 30552096). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COA8* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 11, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
