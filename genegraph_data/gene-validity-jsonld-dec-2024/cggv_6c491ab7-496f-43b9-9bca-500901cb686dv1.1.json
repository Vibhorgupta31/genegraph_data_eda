Chronic destructive-airway disease is caused by abnormal respiratory-tract mucociliary clearance. Abnormal propulsion of sperm flagella contributes to male infertility. Genetic defects in most individuals affected by PCD cause randomization of left-right body asymmetry; approximately half show situs inversus or situs ambiguous. Almost 70 years after the hy3 mouse possessing Hydin mutations was described as a recessive hydrocephalus model, we report HYDIN mutations in PCD-affected persons without hydrocephalus. By homozygosity mapping, we identified a PCD-associated locus, chromosomal region 16q21-q23, which contains HYDIN. However, a nearly identical 360 kb paralogous segment (HYDIN2) in chromosomal region 1q21.1 complicated mutational analysis. In three affected German siblings linked to HYDIN, we identified homozygous c.3985G>T mutations that affect an evolutionary conserved splice acceptor site and that subsequently cause aberrantly spliced transcripts predicting premature protein termination in respiratory cells. Parallel whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous nonsense HYDIN mutation, c.922A>T (p.Lys307(∗)), in six individuals from three Faroe Island PCD-affected families that all carried an 8.8 Mb shared haplotype across HYDIN, indicating an ancestral founder mutation in this isolated population. We demonstrate by electron microscopy tomography that, consistent with the effects of loss-of-function mutations, HYDIN mutant respiratory cilia lack the C2b projection of the central pair (CP) apparatus; similar findings were reported in Hydin-deficient Chlamydomonas and mice. High-speed videomicroscopy demonstrated markedly reduced beating amplitudes of respiratory cilia and stiff sperm flagella. Like the hy3 mouse model, all nine PCD-affected persons had normal body composition because nodal cilia function is apparently not dependent on the function of the CP apparatus.","dc:creator":"Olbrich H","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Recessive HYDIN mutations cause primary ciliary dyskinesia without randomization of left-right body asymmetry."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c491ab7-496f-43b9-9bca-500901cb686d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c491ab7-496f-43b9-9bca-500901cb686d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04751790-c724-415a-9257-9c13e2878de4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db605738-ecbf-4855-a569-5110dda8c4f6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"To establish a resource database and associated tissue bank to study the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in human tissues, donors of any racial and ethnic group and sex who are age 21–70 in whom biospecimen collection can start within 24 hours of death were eligible.

We recently described a hydrocephalus-inducing transgenic insertional mutation, OVE459, which represents a new allele of hy3. Direct cDNA selection performed on a wild-type mouse BAC clone spanning the OVE459 insertion locus on chromosome 8 led to the identification of two novel candidate genes, Hydin and Vac14. The transgene insertion resulted in a rearrangement of Hydin exons in OVE459 mice. Hydin consists of at least 86 exons spanning over 340 kb of genomic DNA. The full-length Hydin transcript is nearly 16 kb, encoding a putative 5099 amino acid protein. Northern analysis revealed a marked reduction of Hydin mRNA in both OVE459 and hy3 homozygotes relative to wild-type littermates. A single CG base-pair deletion in exon 15 of Hydin was discovered specifically in mice carrying the spontaneous hy3 mutant allele. This deletion creates a premature termination signal two codons downstream of the mutation, likely resulting in the loss of 89% of the full-length gene product. Within the neonatal brain, Hydin expression is confined to the ciliated ependymal cell layer lining the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. Other sites of Hydin expression include the ciliated epithelial cells lining the bronchi and oviduct, as well as in the developing spermatocytes in the testis.

Symptoms include neonatal respiratory distress, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, situs inversus, and infertility. Clinical features may be subtle and highly variable, making the diagnosis of PCD challenging. The diagnosis can be confirmed with ciliary ultrastructure analysis and/or molecular genetic testing of 32 PCD-associated genes. However, because of this genetic heterogeneity, comprehensive molecular genetic testing is not considered the standard of care, and the most efficient molecular approach has yet to be elucidated. Here, we propose a cost-effective and time-efficient molecular genetic algorithm to solve cases of PCD. We conducted targeted copy number variation (CNV) analysis and/or whole-exome sequencing on 20 families (22 patients) from a subset of 45 families (52 patients) with a clinical diagnosis of PCD who did not have a molecular genetic diagnosis after Sanger sequencing of 12 PCD-associated genes. This combined molecular genetic approach led to the identification of 4 of 20 (20%) families with clinically significant CNVs and 7 of 20 (35%) families with biallelic pathogenic mutations in recently identified PCD genes, resulting in an increased molecular genetic diagnostic rate of 55% (11/20). In patients with a clinical diagnosis of PCD, whole-exome sequencing followed by targeted CNV analysis results in an overall molecular genetic yield of 76% (34/45).

Here, we used a combination of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to identify mutations in ARL2BP, which encodes an effector protein of the small GTPases ARL2 and ARL3, as causative for autosomal-recessive RP (RP66). In a family affected by RP and situs inversus, a homozygous, splice-acceptor mutation, c.101-1G>C, which alters pre-mRNA splicing of ARLBP2 in blood RNA, was identified. In another family, a homozygous c.134T>G (p.Met45Arg) mutation was identified. In the mouse retina, ARL2BP localized to the basal body and cilium-associated centriole of photoreceptors and the periciliary extension of the inner segment. Depletion of ARL2BP caused cilia shortening. Moreover, depletion of ARL2, but not ARL3, caused displacement of ARL2BP from the basal body, suggesting that ARL2 is vital for recruiting or anchoring ARL2BP at the base of the cilium. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the p.Met45Arg amino acid substitution reduced binding to ARL2 and caused the loss of ARL2BP localization at the basal body in ciliated nasal epithelial cells. These data demonstrate a role for ARL2BP and ARL2 in primary cilia function and that this role is essential for normal photoreceptor maintenance and function.","dc:creator":"Davidson AE","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in ARL2BP, encoding ADP-ribosylation-factor-like 2 binding protein, cause autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa."}},"rdfs:label":"GC19277 IV-3"},{"id":"cggv:e1ca3ac6-d260-417f-8947-cf360bdbd350","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e1ca3ac6-d260-417f-8947-cf360bdbd350_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e1ca3ac6-d260-417f-8947-cf360bdbd350_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from blood samples of the individual  revealed that the variant leads to aberrant pre-mRNA splicing "}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downscoring for homozygosity and consanguinity. upscoring for supportive functional information by RT-PCR.

The HYDIN gene was first reported to cause PCD5 in humans in 2012 (PMID 23022101). Major parts of the gene are duplicated in the HYDIN2 pseudogene which might confound genetic diagnosis. Ciliary defects of the respiratory epithelium in the reported patients result in otitis media, sinusitis, recurrent chest infection and progressive airway destruction. Male infertility due to dysfunctional sperm tails is also reported (PMID 23022101). Absence of the situs inversus phenotype characteristic of other forms of PCD reflects the underlying defect in central pair (CP) apparatus, which is considered irrelevant to the nodal cilium that establishes the left-right body asymmetry (PMID 31545650). Deficiency of the CP-apparatus-associated protein HYDIN results in lack of the C2b projection of the central pair with reduced beating amplitudes of respiratory cilia and stiff sperm flagella (PMID 23022101).\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and autosomal recessive mode of inheritance to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, the asserted disease associated with HYDIN variants, primary ciliary dyskinesia 5 (MONDO:0012088), was curated as a single entity.\nTen splice site, nonsense and frameshift variants were reported in 5 publications (PMIDS 23022101, 23849777, 31089940, 31545650, 26139845). The disease consistently segregates in 1 German and 3  Faroe Islander families, and provides a scorable genetic evidence for segregation analysis of the autosomal recessive disease (PMID 23022101).\nExperimental evidence also supports this gene disease association. HYDIN expression in ciliated epithelial tissues relevant to PCD was identified in multiple papers (PMIDs 23715323, 12719380).  The biochemical function of HYDIN protein in the axonemal central pair and its functional alteration in patient cells are consistent with a critical role in motile cilia structure and function (PMID 23022101). Abnormal ciliary structure and function were also evident in Hydin mutant mice (PMID 18250199). Similarly, Hydin knockdown causes flagellar paralysis in Chlamydomonas (PMID 17296796).\nIn summary, HYDIN is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on February 10th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6c491ab7-496f-43b9-9bca-500901cb686d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
