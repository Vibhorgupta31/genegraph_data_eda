Here we have cloned human and mouse cDNAs for a novel Fhos homolog, designated Fhos2. The messages for Fhos2 are expressed in the heart, kidney, and brain, where the Fhos1 mRNAs are not abundant. Two splice variants of Fhos2 exist in a tissue-specific manner; the longer variant Fhos2L is the major form in the heart, whereas the kidney and brain predominantly express Fhos2S that encodes a shorter protein. Over-expression of an active form of the two Fhos2 variants, as well as that of Fhos1, induces the formation of actin stress fibers in HeLa cells, suggesting that Fhos2 acts as an actin-organizing protein. Biochemical analysis using rat cardiomyoblastic H9c2 (2-1) cells reveals that endogenous Fhos2 is enriched in the intermediate filament fraction. Consistent with this, Fhos2 localizes to the nestin intermediate filament but not to other cytoskeletons, as demonstrated by staining of H9c2 (2-1) cells with anti-Fhos2 antibodies. Furthermore, Fhos2 is present in nestin-expressing neuroepithelial cells of the fetal rat brain. Thus, Fhos2 not only has the actin-organizing activity but also associates with nestin, which may imply a Fhos2-mediated link between the nestin intermediate filament and actin microfilament.","dc:creator":"Kanaya H","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Fhos2, a novel formin-related actin-organizing protein, probably associates with the nestin intermediate filament."},"rdfs:label":"Kanaya expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 for RNA expression and 0.5 for protein expression"},{"id":"cggv:10c82162-1ae8-4ccd-b263-2af91de1ce82","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:674be6d9-3e6a-4401-baf3-be190d2262d9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Co-localization of FHOD3 with MYBPC3 and actin in embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes\nCoimmunoprecipitation of FHOD3 and MYBPC3\nBinding mediated through COC2 domain of MYBPC3\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29686099","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) are a major cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Although cMyBP-C has been considered to regulate the cardiac function via cross-bridge arrangement at the C-zone of the myosin-containing A-band, the mechanism by which cMyBP-C functions remains unclear. We identified formin Fhod3, an actin organizer essential for the formation and maintenance of cardiac sarcomeres, as a cMyBP-C-binding protein. The cardiac-specific N-terminal Ig-like domain of cMyBP-C directly interacts with the cardiac-specific N-terminal region of Fhod3. The interaction seems to direct the localization of Fhod3 to the C-zone, since a noncardiac Fhod3 variant lacking the cMyBP-C-binding region failed to localize to the C-zone. Conversely, the cardiac variant of Fhod3 failed to localize to the C-zone in the cMyBP-C-null mice, which display a phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathic phenotype of cMyBP-C-null mice was further exacerbated by Fhod3 overexpression with a defect of sarcomere integrity, whereas that was partially ameliorated by a reduction in the Fhod3 protein levels, suggesting that Fhod3 has a deleterious effect on cardiac function under cMyBP-C-null conditions where Fhod3 is aberrantly mislocalized. Together, these findings suggest the possibility that Fhod3 contributes to the pathogenesis of cMyBP-C-related cardiomyopathy and that Fhod3 is critically involved in cMyBP-C-mediated regulation of cardiac function via direct interaction.","dc:creator":"Matsuyama S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Interaction between cardiac myosin-binding protein C and formin Fhod3."},"rdfs:label":"Matsuyama protein interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:654c0d7d-ce5e-47fe-8336-0c2397674f2b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23bc8d04-3596-42ad-adfa-2e1325a764da","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Co-localization with FHOD3 and Î±-actinin immunofluorescence \n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19706596","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Actin filament assembly in nonmuscle cells is regulated by the actin polymerization machinery, including the Arp2/3 complex and formins.

Fhod3(-/-) mice appear normal up to embryonic day (E) 8.5, when the developing heart, composed of premyofibrils, initiates spontaneous contraction. However, these premyofibrils fail to mature and myocardial development does not continue, leading to embryonic lethality by E11.5. Transgenic expression of wild-type Fhod3 in the heart restores myofibril maturation and cardiomyogenesis, which allow Fhod3(-/-) embryos to develop further. Moreover, cardiomyopathic changes with immature myofibrils are caused in mice overexpressing a mutant Fhod3, defective in binding to actin. These findings indicate that actin dynamics, regulated by Fhod3, participate in sarcomere organization during myofibrillogenesis and thus play a crucial role in heart development.","dc:creator":"Kan-O M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mammalian formin Fhod3 plays an essential role in cardiogenesis by organizing myofibrillogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Kan-O KO mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Not an HCM model (reduced further to 0.5 by working group at presentation)"},{"id":"cggv:091e5e21-3566-4aa7-8de3-2d6d5e8dc6a2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9abc48a2-f0e7-4572-987b-ceff6c12b7a3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Increased heart weight but otherwise features were more consistent with a late onset dilated cardiomyopathy rather than HCM.

Over 50 variants (missense, nonsense, splice variants and in frame del/dup variants) that have been reported in over 100 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 29907873, 30442288, 30898215, 31742804, 32335906, 33586461) are included in this curation. The majority of variants are located at exon 12 and exon 15, including two recurring variants p.Ser527del and p.Tyr528Cys in exon 12. Most reported variants are missense with a smaller number of truncating, CNV and splice variants identified at these locations. Two CNVs were too large to be registered, an 11kb deletion from c.1836-1527 in intron 14 to c.2022-2042 in intron 16 and an 11kb deletion c.1836-2543 in intron 14 to c.2021+2217 in intron 16, but contribute 0.25 points each to the overall score (Ochoa JP, et al., 2020, PMID: 32335906). The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, protein interaction, functional alteration and animal models (PMIDs: 15966898, 19706596, 29158260, 29686099, 23213483). However, it should be noted that while experimental studies have shown an important role for FHOD3 in heart and sarcomeric development, no studies have demonstrated a clear HCM phenotype. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between FHOD3 and autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
