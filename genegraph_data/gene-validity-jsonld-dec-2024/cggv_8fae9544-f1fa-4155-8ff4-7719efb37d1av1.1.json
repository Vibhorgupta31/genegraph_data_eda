Mab21l1 knockout mice present a strikingly similar malformative association of ophthalmological malformations of the anterior chamber and preputial glands hypoplasia.

It is now known to constitute a family of genes that are highly conserved from vertebrates to invertebrates, and two homologs, Mab21l1 and Mab21l2, have been identified in many species. We describe the generation of Mab21l1-deficient mice with defects in eye and preputial gland formation. The mutant mouse eye has a rudimentary lens resulting from insufficient invagination of the lens placode caused by deficient proliferation. Chimera analyses suggest that the lens placode is affected in a cell-autonomous manner, although Mab21l1 is expressed in both the lens placode and the optic vesicle. The defects in lens placode development correlate with delayed and insufficient expression of Foxe3, which is also required for lens development, while Maf, Sox2, Six3 and PAX6 levels are not significantly affected. Significant reduction of Mab21l1 expression in the optic vesicle and overlying surface ectoderm in Sey homozygotes indicates that Mab21l1 expression in the developing eye is dependent upon the functions of Pax6 gene products. We conclude that Mab21l1 expression dependent on PAX6 is essential for lens placode growth and for formation of the lens vesicle; lack of Mab21l1 expression causes reduced expression of Foxe3 in a cell-autonomous manner.","dc:creator":"Yamada R","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Cell-autonomous involvement of Mab21l1 is essential for lens placode development."},"rdfs:label":"Yamada knockout mouse "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:8fae9544-f1fa-4155-8ff4-7719efb37d1a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bacddf81-1754-4063-bcab-8708d50ed8fa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bacddf81-1754-4063-bcab-8708d50ed8fa","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d81b1b2a-9a2a-4e60-9694-50335b83ad8e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001385012.1(NBEA):c.6585+2762del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913191238"}},"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing with Sanger confirmation","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"small labia minora","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000666","obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0001007","obo:HP_0031936","obo:HP_0010747","obo:HP_0001321","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000294","obo:HP_0000718","obo:HP_0011230","obo:HP_0002463","obo:HP_0001305","obo:HP_0000463","obo:HP_0002136","obo:HP_0007018","obo:HP_0002370","obo:HP_0000343","obo:HP_0008729","obo:HP_0000280","obo:HP_0001097","obo:HP_0011825","obo:HP_0000664","obo:HP_0001131","obo:HP_0000505","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0000557"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:232130ce-7b74-4ee0-a737-6d5ad4126ce7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d81b1b2a-9a2a-4e60-9694-50335b83ad8e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30487245","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Putative nucleotidyltransferase MAB21L1 is a member of an evolutionarily well-conserved family of the male abnormal 21 (MAB21)-like proteins.

COFG is characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia with ataxia, ocular anomalies, facial dysmorphism, scrotal agenesis, absent or underdeveloped nipples and underdeveloped labioscrotal folds, accompanied by moderate to severe developmental delay and intellectual disability. The mechanism of disease is reported to be loss of function. At least six unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in a homozygous statein 11 individuals from six consanguineous families in two publications (PMIDs: 27103078, 30487245) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated in seven additional family members in two families (PMID: 30487245, 27075597). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by evidence of persistent and restricted expression of *Mab21l1* to the cerebellum and eye in mouse, and a mouse model which displayed eye and preputial gland anomalies (PMIDs: 10349626, 25434003). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between *MAB21L* and autosomal recessive cerebellar, ocular, craniofacial, and genital syndrome. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the assertion to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted.
