Autosomal recessive forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT. Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the disease. Here, we report a novel GDAP1 mutation in an Old Order Amish family with CMT. To ascertain the Amish CMT locus, we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis on one of three patients from a consanguineous pedigree. Assuming mutation homogeneity, the analysis sought large homozygous SNP blocks that also contained known CMT loci. The largest homozygous SNP block in the patient was localized to chromosome 8q13.1-21.3 and contained the GDAP1 gene. Sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous mutation, c.692C>T, at codon 231 (p.P231L) in exon 5 of GDAP1 in all patients. Neither the unaffected individuals in the family nor the healthy control samples were homozygous for this mutation.

Additionally, intra-axonal mitochondria of peripheral neurons are larger in Gdap1(-/-) mice and mitochondrial transport is impaired in cultured sensory neurons of Gdap1(-/-) mice compared with controls.

We demonstrate that mitochondrial DNA biogenesis and content is increased in the peripheral nervous system but not in the central nervous system of Gdap1(-/-) mice compared with control littermates. In search for a molecular mechanism we turned to the paralogue of GDAP1, GDAP1L1, which is mainly expressed in the unaffected central nervous system. GDAP1L1 responds to elevated levels of oxidized glutathione by translocating from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it inserts into the mitochondrial outer membrane.

Variants in this gene are inherited in both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant fashions, with phenotypes presenting as a spectrum of severity depending on the specific mutation and number of alleles present in trans. The phenotypes associated with GDAP1 variants include both axonal, intermediate, and demyelinating neuropathy (based on the nerve conduction velocities), with the clinical features of symmetric muscle weakness, atrophy of feet and hands, reduced to normal motor and sensory nerve conduction studies, mild sensory loss, areflexia, vocal cord paresis, and pes cavus. \n\nGDAP1 is also expressed in peroxisomes as a tail-anchored protein and is thought to function as a peroxisomal fission factor and to be involved in regulating peroxisome morphology (PMID: 30669311). GDAP1 is also reported to increase cellular glutathione-s-transferase in neuronal cells, decrease reactive oxygen species production and protect against oxidative stress (PMID: 26848201). Experimentally, GDAP1 knockdown was shown to result in more cells with elongated peroxisomes, due to the decrease in fission. No peroxisome biochemical functions were measured. Re-introduction of wild-type GDAP1 and CMT-related GDAP1 N-terminal variants into knockdown cells restored peroxisomal morphology, while CMT-related C-terminal variants of GDAP1 did not (PMID: 23628762). This gene has been included in a few sequencing panels testing for peroxisomal disorders, but till date, no GDAP1 variants have been reported in patients showing a peroxisome biogenesis disorder phenotype, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nAt least 10 unique variants have been reported in humans, including nonsense, missense, and frameshift variants. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in at least 5 publications (PMIDs:11743579, 15805163, 11743580, 12499475, 18492089). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 19 additional family members across three different families. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, functional studies, and animal models. GDAP1 has been shown to be predominantly expressed in neural tissue, with expression in both neurons and Schwann cells (PMIDs: 11743580, 16172208). Functional studies have revealed that GDAP1 overexpression increases mitochondrial fragmentation, while GDAP1 knockdown increased mitochondrial fusion, therefore confirming the role of GDAP1 as a mitochondrial fission-inducing factor (PMID: 16172208). In a drosophila model, both overexpression and knockdown of the fly ortholog, Gdap1, was shown to result in neuromuscular degeneration and alterations of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics (PMID: 25122658). A Gda1 knockout mouse model resulted in late onset hypomyelinating peripheral neuropathy with changes in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics (PMID: 24480485). In summary, GDAP1 is DEFINITIVELY associated with recessive and dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Charcot Marie Tooth Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 9, 2020. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, it was determined that variants in this gene result in a spectrum of the similars pathophysiology and lead to similar phenotypes underlying the disease entities: (1) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2K (MIM:607831), (2) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, with vocal cord paresis (MIM:607706), (3) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, recessive intermediate, A (MIM:608340), (4) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4A (MIM:214400). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c6d93637-02f5-4f5d-b7a9-17356f084149"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
