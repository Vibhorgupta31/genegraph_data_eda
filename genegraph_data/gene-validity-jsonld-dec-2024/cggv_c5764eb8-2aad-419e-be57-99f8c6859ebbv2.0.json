The his mutation, a G to A transition at nucleotide +965, changes Arg-322 to Gln (R322Q). Expression of the R322Q allele in COS cells resulted in proportionately reduced amounts of histidase protein and activity compared to the wildtype allele. Hal maps approximately 4 cM distal to the insulin-like growth factor-1 locus and approximately 10 cM proximal to steel. Hsd was found to be tightly linked to Hal, and the low-histidase-activity Hsd allele was associated with reduced histidase mRNA.

It is the most frequent inborn metabolic error in Japan. Although the original description included mental retardation and speech impairment, neonatal screening programs have identified the majority of histidinemic patients with normal intelligence. Molecular characteristics of histidase in histidinemia have not been determined, and cytogenetically visible deletions of 12q22-24.1 in which histidase gene resides have not been identified in histidinemic patients. In order to investigate whether individuals with this disorder have small deletions, additions, or point mutations in the histidase gene, we screened genomic DNA isolated from 50 histidinemic individuals who were discovered by the neonatal screening program. The methods employed included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exons 1-21 of the histidase gene, followed by mutation detection enhancement gel electrophoresis and sequencing of the PCR products displaying heteroduplex bands. Four missense mutations (R322P, P259L, R206T, and R208L), two exonic polymorphisms (T141T c.423A-->T and P259P c.777A-->G), and two intronic polymorphisms (IVS6-5T-->C and IVS9+25A-->G) were identified. The frequencies of each polymorphism estimated either by dot blot allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, restriction enzyme digestion, or direct sequencing of the PCR products amplified from 50 unrelated normal individuals were 0.28, 0.30, 0.40, and less than 0.01, respectively. Mutation analysis of one family demonstrated that the patient inherited R322P from the mother and P259L from the father.

The disease was first described by Ghadimi et al in 1961, who observed elevated levels of histidine in blood and urine of two patients. This metabolic disorder seems to be benign in most affected individuals, although, under unusual circumstances, the disorder may be harmful and produce the central nervous system disease noted in a few histidinemic patients (Reviewed in Levy H., Histidinemia. Orphanet encyclopedia, May 2002). HAL catalyzes the reaction: L-histidine = urocanate + NH3; in patients with deficiency of HAL there is a consequent accumulation of histidine and decreased concentration of urocanate. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Biallelic missense variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication (PMID: 15806399). At least 7 additional variants (splice site, nonsense, missense, and frameshift) have been associated with mildly increased histidine levels in the heterozygous state (PMIDs: 25575548, 27453504, 26990548). This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of HAL which is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities observed in individuals with histidinemia (Takeuchi, J. Biochem., Japan, 34, 1 (1941)), the functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 7211776) and the biochemical features of a histidinemic mouse (PMID: 8486363). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/24/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited with no new evidence identified.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c5764eb8-2aad-419e-be57-99f8c6859ebb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
