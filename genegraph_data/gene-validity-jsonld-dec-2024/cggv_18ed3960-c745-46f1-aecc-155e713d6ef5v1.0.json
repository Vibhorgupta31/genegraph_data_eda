This inborn error of metabolism, previously thought to be rare, is now being increasingly detected in severe and milder presentations. Mutations of a phase 1 detoxicating gene, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), have been shown to cause TMAuria. Herein we describe a cohort of individuals ascertained in North America with severe TMAuria, defined by a reduction of TMA oxidation below 50% of normal with genotype-phenotype correlations. We detected four new FMO3 mutations; two were missense (A52T and R387L), one was nonsense (E314X).

This confers, to the affected individual a very unpleasant body odor resembling that of rotting fish. This disorder has been relatively well-documented in British, Australian, and American populations and reports have appeared regarding patients in Thailand and Hong Kong, but no Italian families affected by trimethylaminuria have been reported in the literature. We have collected a cohort of Italian families and investigated the genetic basis of the disorder in these Italian pedigrees disclosing a spectrum of molecular variation in the FM03 gene comprising three novel deleterious mutations: the first documented de novo missense mutation causative of trimethylaminuria; a guanidine nucleotide deletion (G1182del) at codon 394 and a novel missense mutation (R238P) that altered highly conserved amino acid in the exon 6. Moreover, we investigated by aplotype analysis a family with mild TMAuria identifying a putative causative aplotype. Finally, we failed to detect any variation in other Italian families suggesting that this gene is not associated with all clinical form of trimethylaminuria or that polymorphisms in this gene could be susceptibility factors for developing the disease. Our findings support the hypothesis that TMAuria is not a rare recessive disorder but rather a spectrum of malodour phenotypes in which diet and environmental exposures can play a role in triggering symptoms.","dc:creator":"Teresa E","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"A spectrum of molecular variation in a cohort of Italian families with trimethylaminuria: identification of three novel mutations of the FM03 gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16600650","rdfs:label":"Family 1 proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This individual with trimethylaminuria is compound heterozygous for a frameshift (c.1184del; written as c.1182 in the paper, but 3 G's in a row, therefore c.1184del is correct HGVS nomenclature; note that this G is the first nucleotide of an exon; not in gnomAD) and a missense variant (p.Pro153Leu) in FMO3.

Purified rabbit FMO2 and eleven heterologously expressed human P450 isoforms were also tested. \nHuman FMO3 was by far the most active isoform (Figure 4). \nHuman fetal liver, adult liver, kidney and intestine microsomes were also screened for TMA oxidation. Only human adult liver microsomes provided substantial TMAO-formation. This is consistent with the expression pattern of TMO3 in humans.

This is consistent with the finding of high levels of TMA, and low level of oxidized TMA in individuals with loss of function variants in FMO3.\nNote that the role of FMO3 in the metabolism of TMA has been supported by many studies over the years including analysis of the activity of normal and variant FMO3 in different in vitro systems (e.g. see PMIDs 23567996, 31317802 for review; https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/FMO3)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9776311","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In the present study, we expressed human flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 (FMO1), FMO3, FMO4t (truncated), and FMO5 in the baculovirus expression vector system at levels of 0.6 to 2.4 nmol FMO/mg of membrane protein. These four isoforms, as well as purified rabbit FMO2, and eleven heterologously expressed human P450 isoforms were examined for their capacity to metabolize trimethylamine (TMA) to its N-oxide (TMAO), using a new, specific HPLC method with radiochemical detection.

None of the other monooxygenases formed TMAO at rates greater than 1 nmol/nmol FMO/min under these conditions. Human fetal liver, adult liver, kidney and intestine microsomes were screened for TMA oxidation, and only human adult liver microsomes provided substantial TMAO-formation (range 2.9 to 9.1 nmol TMAO/mg protein/min, N = 5).

Primary trimethylaminuria is characterized by an unpleasant fishy body odor, similar to that of rotten fish, which results from increased excretion of trimethylamine in the urine, sweat, saliva, and reproductive fluids. Affected individuals appear healthy, with no physical symptoms, but the odor often results in social and psychological issues (GeneReviews, Philips and Shepard, 2015, PMID 20301282). Metabolism of trimethylamine is primarily via N-oxygenation in the liver, catalyzed by flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which converts it to the non-odorous trimethylamine N-oxide. Trimethylamine is derived from the dietary, via the action of gut bacteria. Severe reduction in the activity of TMO3, caused by rare, deleterious variants in the FMO3 gene, is associated with primary trimethylaminuria. More common FMO3 variants, such as p.[(Glu158Lys);(Glu308Gly)], can moderately affect activity of FMO3 and may cause mild or transient trimethylaminuria (reviewed in Philips and Shepard, 2020, PMID 31317802).\nThe relationship between FMO3 and trimethylaminuria is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Biallelic variants in FMO3 were first reported in a patient with trimethylaminuria in 1997 (Dolphin et al, PMID 9398858). More than 40 variants have been reported to be associated with trimethylaminuria (FMO3 database, https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/FMO3/unique, PMID 12938085; Philips and Shepard, 2020, PMID 31317802).\nFourteen unique variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) in 10 probands from 5 publications were curated (Dolphin et al, 1997, PMID 9398858; Akerman et al, 1999, PMID 10479479; Teresa et al, 2006, PMID 16600650; Treacy et al, 2008, PMID 9536088; Shimizu et al, 2015, PMID 28649550). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of FMO3, which is consistent with the biochemical findings in patients (Lang et al, 1998, PMID 9776311; Cashman et al, 1995, PMID, 7720103; reviewed in Philips and Shepard, 2020, PMID 31317802), and fishy-tasting milk and eggs, in cows and hens respectively, homozygous for FMO3 variants (Lundén et al, 2002, PMID 12466292; Honkatukia et al, 2005, PMID 15916878). \nIn summary, FMO3 is definitively associated with trimethylaminuria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:18ed3960-c745-46f1-aecc-155e713d6ef5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
