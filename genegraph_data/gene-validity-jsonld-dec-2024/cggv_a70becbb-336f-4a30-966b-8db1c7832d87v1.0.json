The clinical presentation ranges from very severe multi-organ failure to mild neurological problems. A plethora of PMM2 mutations has been described and the vast majority are missense mutations. This selection reflects the requirement of a minimal phosphomannomutase activity to be compatible with life. We describe the characterization of two unusual truncating mutations in two CDG-Ia patients. The first patient is compound heterozygous for the PMM2 mutation p.V231M (c.691G>A) and a deep intronic point mutation (c.639-15.479C>T). The latter variant activates a cryptic splice site which results in an in-frame insertion of a pseudoexon of 123 bp between exon 7 and 8. The second patient is compound heterozygous for the mutation p.V44A (c.131T>C) and an Alu retrotransposition mediated complex deletion of approximately 28 kb encompassing exon 8. These types of mutations have not been described before in CDG-Ia patients. Their detection stresses the importance to combine PMM2 mutation screening on genomic DNA with analysis of the transcripts and/or with the enzymatic analysis of the phosphomannomutase activity. Next to the exonic deletions, which already receive more attention than before, it is likely that deep intronic mutations represent an increasingly important category of mutations.","dc:creator":"Schollen E","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Characterization of two unusual truncating PMM2 mutations in two CDG-Ia patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Schollen et al, 2007: Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:abc8230a-3bca-4299-8d55-252dfe5c820a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:abc8230a-3bca-4299-8d55-252dfe5c820a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:abc8230a-3bca-4299-8d55-252dfe5c820a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When expressed in E. coli, residual activity 16% WT, 67% immunoreactive protein (PMID: 21541725).

The Ka values for both mannose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate are significantly lower in the case of PMM2 than in the case of PMM1. Like PMM1, PMM2 forms a phosphoenzyme with the chemical characteristics of an acyl-phosphate. PMM1 and PMM2 hydrolyse different hexose bisphosphates (glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, mannose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) at maximal rates of approximately 3.5 and 0.3% of their PMM activity, respectively. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate does not activate PMM2 but causes a time-dependent stimulation of PMM1 due to the progressive formation of mannose 1,6-bisphosphate from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and mannose 1-phosphate. Experiments with specific antibodies, kinetic studies and Northern blots indicated that PMM2 is the only detectable isozyme in most rat tissues except brain and lung, where PMM1 accounts for about 66 and 13% of the total activities, respectively.","dc:creator":"Pirard M","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Kinetic properties and tissular distribution of mammalian phosphomannomutase isozymes."},"rdfs:label":"Function of PMM2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a70becbb-336f-4a30-966b-8db1c7832d87_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16f5a691-98df-4f71-b173-986a764f37ec","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:61890e53-abca-4a1a-8a4e-d89a0a884e20","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Fibroblast cells from a patient who is compound heterozygous for PMM2 p.

Patients have wide-spectrum clinical abnormalities associated with impaired protein N-glycosylation. Although it has been widely proposed that Pmm2 deficiency depletes M1P, a precursor of GDP-mannose, and consequently suppresses lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) levels needed for N-glycosylation, these deficiencies have not been demonstrated in patients or any animal model. Here we report a morpholino-based PMM2-CDG model in zebrafish. Morphant embryos had developmental abnormalities consistent with PMM2-CDG patients, including craniofacial defects and impaired motility associated with altered motor neurogenesis within the spinal cord. Significantly, global N-linked glycosylation and LLO levels were reduced in pmm2 morphants. Although M1P and GDP-mannose were below reliable detection/quantification limits, Pmm2 depletion unexpectedly caused accumulation of M6P, shown earlier to promote LLO cleavage in vitro. In pmm2 morphants, the free glycan by-products of LLO cleavage increased nearly twofold. Suppression of the M6P-synthesizing enzyme mannose phosphate isomerase within the pmm2 background normalized M6P levels and certain aspects of the craniofacial phenotype and abrogated pmm2-dependent LLO cleavage.

PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG), also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1a, and Jaeken syndrome, is the only disorder listed for PMM2 in OMIM (MIM#212065).\n\nPMM2 encodes phosphomannomutase 2, and enzyme that converts mannose-6-phosphate into mannose-1- phosphate. Mannose-1-phosphate is a precursor of guanosine diphosphate mannose (GDP-Man) and dolichol-P-mannose (Dol-P-Man). Deficiency of GDP-Man and Dol-P-Man, due to loss of PMM2 activity, causes hypoglycosylation of numerous glycoproteins and results in a multisystemic disorder (Haeuptle and Hennet, 2009, PMID: 19862844).\n\nPMM2-CDG is the most common disorder of N-linked glycosylation. Clinical findings are highly variable and range from severely affected infants to mildly affected adults (Lam and Krasnewich, 2021, PMID: 20301289). Symptoms in affected infants include axial hypotonia, inverted nipples, abnormal fat distribution, esotropia, developmental delay, failure to thrive, and cerebellar hypoplasia. About 20% of severely affected infants die before a year of age. Those who survive may develop ataxia, severe developmental delay, inability to walk, intellectual disability, seizures, stroke-like episodes, coagulopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, joint contractures, and skeletal deformities in childhood. Adults have stable intellectual disability, variable peripheral neuropathy, premature aging is observed, lack of secondary sexual development in females and decreased testicular volume in males, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and increased risk for deep venous thrombosis is increased (Lam and Krasnewich, 2021, PMID: 20301289). Diagnosis is established by established type I transferrin isoform analysis, genetic testing (biallelic variants in PMM2), and/or deficient phosphomannomutase enzyme activity (Lam and Krasnewich, 2021, PMID: 20301289).\n\nThere is a clear prenatal/neonatal phenotype associated with PMM2-CDG, evident in many probands demonstrating the gene-disease association. The most severe cases of PMM2-CDG are characterized by non-immune hydrops fetalis, which also stands as the predominant antenatal presentation for this condition. Concomitant observations include hydropic placenta, polyhydramnios, and potential mirror syndrome. Among all individuals presenting with hydrops fetalis, the longest reported survival was three months after birth. Additionally, antenatal examinations may reveal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cerebral and cerebellar anomalies—specifically ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy, and skeletal deformities. Currently, there is no known association between PMM2-CDG and early pregnancy loss (PMID: 16915591, 18203160, 19176971, 17307006, 34277356, 20638314).\n\nThirteen variants (eleven missense, one frameshift, and one intronic variant) that have been reported in eight probands in six publications (Westphal et al, 2001; PMID: 11715002; Schollen et al, 2007, PMID: 17307006; Wurm et al, 2007, PMID: 16941129; de la Morena-Barrio et al, 2012, PMID: 23082948; Bortot et al, 2013, PMID: 23988505; González-Domínguez et al, 2021, PMID: 34277356) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Of note, individuals with PMM2-CDG are typically compound heterozygous for one severe and one mild variant, and it is thought that being biallelic for a severe variant is incompatible with life. For example, the most common variant identified in individuals with PMM2-CDG, c.422G>A (p.Arg141His) (ClinVar Variation ID: 7706), results in almost complete deficiency of PMM2 activity in functional assays (Pirard et al, 1999, PMID: 10386614; Kjaergaard et al, 1999, PMID: 10602363; Yuste-Checa et al, 2015, PMID:26014514). While this variant is present in about 75% of individuals with PMM2 of central European ancestry, and it has a carrier frequency of 1 in 60 and 1 in 79 in the Danish and Dutch populations respectively, it has never been reported in the homozygous state, thus lacks Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Matthijs et al, 1998, PMID: 9497260; Kjaergaard et al, 1999, PMID: 10602363; Schollen et al, 2000, PMID: 10854097).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of the gene product which is consistent with the phenotype observed in humans (Pirard et al, 1999, PMID: 10085245; Haeuptle and Hennet, 2009, PMID: 19862844), rescue of mannose metabolism defect by lentiviral transduction of PMM2-deficient human fibroblasts with wild type PMM2 (Chan et al, 2016, PMID: 27053713), features observed in a zebrafish model in which Pmm2 has been knocked down using siRNA (Cline et al, 2012, PMID: 22956764), recapitulation of features observed in humans in mice with knock-in missense variants Pmm2 p.Arg137His and p.Phe115Leu, which correspond to the most common variants in human patients, p.Arg141His and p.Phe119Leu (Chan et al, 2016, PMID: 27053713). Additional evidence is available in the literature but the maximum number of point for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between PMM2 and autosomal recessive PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 9, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a70becbb-336f-4a30-966b-8db1c7832d87"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
