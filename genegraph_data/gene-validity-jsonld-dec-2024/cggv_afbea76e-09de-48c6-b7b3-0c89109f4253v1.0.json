We investigated a cohort of 28 new patients and reviewed previously described cases, providing a comprehensive characterization of 40 subjects. Exome sequencing was performed to identify underlying ITPA pathogenic variants. Brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans were systematically analyzed to delineate the neuroradiological spectrum. Survival curves according to the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to investigate outcome predictors in different subgroups of patients. We identified 18 distinct ITPA pathogenic variants, including 14 novel variants, and two deletions. All subjects showed profound developmental delay, microcephaly, and refractory epilepsy followed by neurodevelopmental regression. Brain MRI revision revealed a recurrent pattern of delayed myelination and restricted diffusion of early myelinating structures. Congenital microcephaly and cardiac involvement were statistically significant novel clinical predictors of adverse outcomes. We refined the molecular, clinical, and neuroradiological characterization of ITPase deficiency, and identified new clinical predictors which may have a potentially important impact on diagnosis,

Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by onset of seizures early in life along with delays in development. Other individuals with monoallelic or biallelic variants in *ITPA* may present with inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPase) deficiency, which is a common condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of inosine triphosphate (ITP) in erythrocytes (PMIDs: 12436200, 12384777). These patients are otherwise asymptomatic and do not present with any developmental delays nor with epilepsy. When evaluating these conditions, we found differences in inheritance pattern between individuals with DEE and individuals with isolated ITPase deficiency; individuals with ITPase deficiency may have monoallelic or biallelic variants, whereas individuals with DEE presented solely with biallelic ITPA variants. Additionally, we found a strong difference in phenotypic variability between these patients. Individuals reported with isolated ITPase deficiency were asymptomatic, whereas DEE is an often severe neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood onset. Currently, the molecular mechanism underlying these different phenotypic presentations is not well understood. However, the current hypothesis is that DEE is the result of putative loss of function or destruction of crucial binding sites (PMID: 34989426). Therefore, per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have decided to split these disease assertions and will not be including individuals with isolated ITPase deficiency in this curation for DEE.\n\nSix variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense, single exon deletion) that have been reported in seven probands in three publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 26224535, 34989426, 33593863). In addition to epilepsy and developmental delays, patients commonly present with microcephaly and hypotonia. Patients may also exhibit delayed myelination and mild to moderate cerebral atrophy on brain MRIs. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between ITPA and autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (MONDO:0100062). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date February 6, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:afbea76e-09de-48c6-b7b3-0c89109f4253"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
