Recessive mutations in KIF1A were previously described in families with spastic paraparesis or sensory and autonomic neuropathy type-2. Here, we report 11 heterozygous de novo missense mutations (p.S58L, p.T99M, p.G102D, p.V144F, p.R167C, p.A202P, p.S215R, p.R216P, p.L249Q, p.E253K, and p.R316W) in KIF1A in 14 individuals, including two monozygotic twins. Two mutations (p.T99M and p.E253K) were recurrent, each being found in unrelated cases. All these de novo mutations are located in the motor domain (MD) of KIF1A. Structural modeling revealed that they alter conserved residues that are critical for the structure and function of the MD. Transfection studies suggested that at least five of these mutations affect the transport of the MD along axons. Individuals with de novo mutations in KIF1A display a phenotype characterized by cognitive impairment and variable presence of cerebellar atrophy, spastic paraparesis, optic nerve atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and epilepsy. Our findings thus indicate that de novo missense mutations in the MD of KIF1A cause a phenotype that overlaps with, while being more severe, than that associated with recessive mutations in the same gene.

Recently, the new kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) have been identified as candidate motor proteins involved in organelle transport. Among them KIF1A, a murine homologue of unc-104 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, is a unique monomeric neuron- specific microtubule plus end-directed motor and has been proposed as a transporter of synaptic vesicle precursors (Okada, Y., H. Yamazaki, Y. Sekine-Aizawa, and N. Hirokawa. 1995. Cell. 81:769-780). To elucidate the function of KIF1A in vivo, we disrupted the KIF1A gene in mice. KIF1A mutants died mostly within a day after birth showing motor and sensory disturbances. In the nervous systems of these mutants, the transport of synaptic vesicle precursors showed a specific and significant decrease. Consequently, synaptic vesicle density decreased dramatically, and clusters of clear small vesicles accumulated in the cell bodies. Furthermore, marked neuronal degeneration and death occurred both in KIF1A mutant mice and in cultures of mutant neurons. The neuronal death in cultures was blocked by coculture with wild-type neurons or exposure to a low concentration of glutamate. These results in cultures suggested that the mutant neurons might not sufficiently receive afferent stimulation, such as neuronal contacts or neurotransmission, resulting in cell death. Thus, our results demonstrate that KIF1A transports a synaptic vesicle precursor and that KIF1A-mediated axonal transport plays a critical role in viability, maintenance, and function of neurons, particularly mature neurons.","dc:creator":"Yonekawa Y","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Defect in synaptic vesicle precursor transport and neuronal cell death in KIF1A motor protein-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Kif1a knockout mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Heterozygous knockout mice showed no obvious morphological or behavioral abnormalities.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in enrichment-induced neuronal changes; however, the precise mechanism underlying these effects remains uncertain. In this study, a specific upregulation of kinesin superfamily motor protein 1A (KIF1A) was observed in the hippocampi of mice kept in an enriched environment and, in hippocampal neurons in vitro, BDNF increased the levels of KIF1A and of KIF1A-mediated cargo transport. Analysis of Bdnf(+/-) and Kif1a(+/-) mice revealed that a lack of KIF1A upregulation resulted in a loss of enrichment-induced hippocampal synaptogenesis and learning enhancement. Meanwhile, KIF1A overexpression promoted synaptogenesis via the formation of presynaptic boutons. These findings demonstrate that KIF1A is indispensable for BDNF-mediated hippocampal synaptogenesis and learning enhancement induced by enrichment. This is a new molecular motor-mediated presynaptic mechanism underlying experience-dependent neuroplasticity.","dc:creator":"Kondo M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Motor protein KIF1A is essential for hippocampal synaptogenesis and learning enhancement in an enriched environment."},"rdfs:label":"kif1a knockout mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1249,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8f7c5c1e-a2d6-4771-9f3a-093a7108f2e7","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0000508","gene":"hgnc:888","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"KIF1A was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability in 2011 (Hamdan, et al., PMID: 21376300). Affected individuals present with global developmental delay, spasticity, and variable intellectual disability. Additional features may include optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and cerebral atrophy. More than 70 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in KIF1A have been reported in ClinVar; the majority of the variants are missense and are enriched in the motor domain of KIF1A protein. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model. Of note, recent findings suggested that KIF1A-related disorders constitute a wide phenotypic spectrum (Nemani, et al., PMID: 32096284). Defects in the KIF1A gene may result in 1) NESCAV (neurodegeneration and spasticity with or without cerebellar atrophy or cortical visual impairment) syndrome, 2) Neuropathy, hereditary sensory, type IIC, 3) Spastic paraplegia 30, autosomal dominant, and 4) Spastic paraplegia 30, autosomal recessive (see OMIM). In summary, KIF1A is definitively associated with autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/02/20 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1d586d93-7066-4db0-b623-8b7e3eafdc06"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
