TS patients have heterozygous mutations (G402S and G406R) located in the alternatively spliced exon 8, causing a gain-of-function by reduced voltage-dependence of inactivation. Screening 540 unrelated patients with non-syndromic forms of LQTS, we identified six functional relevant CACNA1C mutations in different regions of the channel. All these mutations caused a gain-of-function combining different mechanisms, including changes in current amplitude, rate of inactivation and voltage-dependence of activation or inactivation, similar as in TS. Computer simulations support the theory that the novel CACNA1C mutations prolong action potential duration. We conclude that genotype-negative LQTS patients should be investigated for mutations in CACNA1C, as a gain-of-function in Cav1.2 is likely to cause LQTS and only specific and rare mutations, i.e. in exon 8, cause the multi-systemic TS.","dc:creator":"Wemhöner K","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Gain-of-function mutations in the calcium channel CACNA1C (Cav1.2) cause non-syndromic long-QT but not Timothy syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25633834","rdfs:label":"681-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:88965874-5a5b-4cf0-91fc-59069ada96da_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e2b2482-dfe2-41ae-ae12-dcf56262d1e9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"detectionMethod":"Complete sequencing of CACNA1C gene completed","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"presyncope, palpitations","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0005184","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"clinically relevant LQTS genes tested (see group info)","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:88965874-5a5b-4cf0-91fc-59069ada96da_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8af81853-6d0d-40b4-af81-5de895970039","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000012.12:g.2115256G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6388386"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25633834"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25633834","rdfs:label":"612-5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e209b2d7-51af-418e-b916-a4175c54b15b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:53378a1b-66c0-49c7-9396-c2147b297590","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":27,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0005184","obo:HP_0001279"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Commercially available LQTS genetic testing panel","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:e209b2d7-51af-418e-b916-a4175c54b15b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:65469579-05ad-495f-9a77-473feb272735","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000012.12:g.2593252C>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6389012"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23677916","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is the most common cardiac channelopathy with 15 elucidated LQTS-susceptibility genes.

In contrast, inactivation of A582D and R858H channels showed an \u00022 mV positive shift. Thus,\nboth R858H and A582D mutations exerted gain-of-function effects, and eventually their window currents were larger than those of the WT.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24728418","rdfs:label":"Channel activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6a59b30b-3bf1-442b-93a2-d8e256525b77","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9df6a01e-f1f1-41db-aecd-27a9a12ecd68","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Different experiments demonstrate GOF for different variants.\nPeak current amplitudes were increased for A28T, I1166T and I1166V.\nWhile wild-type Cav1.2 channels reach their peak current maximum at about +20 mV (green trace), I1475M and E1496K mutants showed a leftward shifted peak current potential, with maximal inward currents at+10 mV (red traces).\nCorrecting for the shift in the voltage-dependence of the different LQT mutants, only E1496K has a strong change in inactivation kinetics.

Pathogenic variants in CACNA1C are the cause for Timothy Syndrome, a rare multi-organ disorder whose manifestations include QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias (PMID 15454078). Boczek at al. were the first to identify a variant in CACNA1C in a family with genotype-negative cardiac-specific typical LQTS (PMID 23677916). They performed exome sequencing of 3 members of the family and filtered the shared genetic variants identified using bioinformatics tools. Several other studies have provided additional genetic and experimental evidence to support the association of CACNA1C with typical LQTS, however, no segregation or case-control data is available and the overall level of evidence for this association was classified by the Working Group as moderate.\nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Working Group. The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this Working Group's analysis according to evidence available at time of publication. The scores presented here are the result of only one of the three curation teams' efforts. For a detailed discussion of this group's work and the scores of all 3 teams please see \"Adler et al.
