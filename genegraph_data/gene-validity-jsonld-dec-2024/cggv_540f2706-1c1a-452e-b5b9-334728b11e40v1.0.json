ILK is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays important roles in cell matrix interactions and induction of biomechanical signals for cytoskeleton remodeling, angiogenesis, cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and segregation data. At least 7 missense variants of uncertain significance have been published in patients with cardiomyopathy. Five variants were found in patients with DCM (Knoll et al, 2007, PMID: 17646580; Meder et al, 2011, PMID: 21252143; Haas et al, 2015, PMID: 25163546). Two of them were functionally analyzed and showed aberrations 2 or more of the following experiments: binding-, kinase-, cellular localization-assays and zebrafish rescue experiments (Brodehl et al, 2019, PMID: 30802431; Knoll et al, 2007, PMID: 17646580). Functional analysis of all tested ILK variants are in line with a loss of function mechanism. In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and animal models. The gene is expressed in many tissues but especially high in heart (Hannigan et al, 1996, PMID: 8538749). Several ILK animal models have been made that show cardiac phenotypes. Targeted ablation of ILK from the murine heart using different cardiac specific promoter (mck and αMHC) driven Cre expression results in DCM with spontaneous and inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias (White et al, 2006, PMID: 16951252, Dai et al, 2014, PMID: 24319095, Quang et al, 2015, 26071395). In addition, a forward genetic screen in zebrafish identified the loss of contact mutant (ilk Y319X). These loc/ilk mutant embryos display a variety of severe defects, including blood vessel dilation and ruptures due to thinning of the endothelial wall and a failure of the ventricle to form a proper chamber (Knoll et al, 2007, PMID: 17646580). ILK gene therapy improves cardiac function and survival in a Rat model of DCM (Gu et al, 2012, PMID: 22348065). Moreover, ILK expression is increased in the hypertrophic ventricles from human patients with congenital and acquired outflow tract obstruction (Lu et al, 2006, PMID: 17088456).  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of ILK with autosomal dominant DCM.   This classification was approved by the Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on September 27, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:540f2706-1c1a-452e-b5b9-334728b11e40"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
