In about 70% of cases, AS is caused by de novo maternal deletions at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Approximately 2% of AS cases are caused by paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 (ref. 3) and 2-3% are caused by \"imprinting mutations'. In the remaining 25% of AS cases, no deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), or methylation abnormality is detectable, and these cases, unlike deletions or UPD, can be familial. These cases are likely to result from mutations in a gene that is expressed either exclusively or preferentially from the maternal chromosome 15. We have found that a 15q inversion inherited by an AS child from her normal mother disrupts the 5' end of the UBE3A (E6-AP) gene, the product of which functions in protein ubiquitination. We have looked for novel UBE3A mutations in nondeletion/non-UPD/non-imprinting mutation (NDUI) AS patients and have found one patient who is heterozygous for a 5-bp de novo tandem duplication. We have also found in two brothers a heterozygous mutation, an A to G transition that creates a new 3' splice junction 7 bp upstream from the normal splice junction. Both mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination of translation. Our results demonstrate that UBE3A mutations are one cause of AS and indicate a possible abnormality in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during brain development in this disease.","dc:creator":"Kishino T","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"UBE3A/E6-AP mutations cause Angelman syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8988171","rdfs:label":"WJK14"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"c.1549-8A>G, splice predictors predict strong novel splice site created -7 to canonical splice site.

Classical lesions, including deletion, paternal disomy, or epigenetic mutation, are confirmatory of AS diagnoses in 80% of cases. Loss-of-function mutations of the UBE3A gene have been identified in approximately 8% of AS cases, failing to account for the remaining patient population, and there appears to be a higher prevalence of mutations in familial than sporadic cases. We screened UBE3A in 45 index cases of AS without obvious 15q11-13 abnormalities. Pathological mutations were identified in 3/6 (50%) familial and 4/39 (>10%) sporadic cases. By combining our data with those of the literature, we demonstrate statistically that the frequency of UBE3A mutations is significantly higher in the familial than sporadic subsets of AS. This indicates that an independent molecular mechanism or 'phenocopy' exists for the sporadic group. Rett syndrome (RS), caused by mutations of the MECP2 gene, and patients with deletions of 22q13.3 --> qter, have overlapping clinical features with AS. We screened 24 of the sporadic AS cases without detectable UBE3A mutations for mutations of MECP2, but found none. A separate cohort of 43 atypical patients with features common to AS and RS, in whom 15q11-13 lesions and 22q13.3 --> qter deletion had been ruled out, were also screened for MECP2 mutations.

Although the gene for E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) was mapped to the critical region for AS, evidence of expression from both parental alleles initially suggested that it was an unlikely candidate gene for this disorder. Because attempts to identify any novel maternally expressed transcripts were unsuccessful and because the UBE3A gene remained within a narrowed AS critical region, we searched for mutations in UBE3A in 11 AS patients without known molecular defects (large deletion, uniparental disomy, or imprinting mutation). This analysis tested the possibility that deficiency of an undefined, maternally expressed transcript or isoform of the UBE3A gene could cause AS. Four mutations were identified including a de novo frameshift mutation and a de novo nonsense mutation in exon 3 and two missense mutations of less certain significance. The de novo truncating mutations indicate that UBE3A is the AS gene and suggest the possibility of a maternally expressed gene product in addition to the biallelically expressed transcript.

The paternal copy of the gene is imprinted in the brain, so variants on the paternal allele do not manifest as AS in the individual. Angelman syndrome is characterized by severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, speech impairment, gait ataxia, trembling of limbs, microcephaly, seizures, and happy demeanor. About 70% of AS is caused by microdeletions of 15q11-13, about 7% by uniparental disomy, 3% by imprinting center defects, 10% by variants in the UBE3A gene, and the remaining 10% are unknown (see Fang et al. 1999 for review of UBE3A variant spectrum). Variants can arise de novo or be inherited from the patient's mother. Mouse models with maternally-derived null alleles recapitulate many of the phenotypic features of AS, and unsilencing of paternal wild-type UBE3A expression in mice ameliorated many of the phenotypic defects seen in the mouse model (Jiang et al. 1998, Miura et al. 2002, Meng et al. 2013). In summary, the UBE3A gene is definitively associated with AS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
