In many patients, the underlying genetic etiology remains unsolved. Isolated muscular dystrophy has not been described in the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) caused by N-linked protein glycosylation defects. Here, we present a genetic N-glycosylation disorder with muscular dystrophy in the group of CDG type I. Extensive biochemical investigations revealed a strongly reduced dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase activity. Sequencing of the three DPM subunits and complementation of DPM3-deficient CHO2.38 cells showed a pathogenic p.L85S missense mutation in the strongly conserved coiled-coil domain of DPM3 that tethers catalytic DPM1 to the ER membrane. Cotransfection experiments in CHO cells showed a reduced binding capacity of DPM3(L85S) for DPM1. Investigation of the four Dol-P-Man-dependent glycosylation pathways in the ER revealed strongly reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in a muscle biopsy, thereby explaining the clinical phenotype of muscular dystrophy. This mild Dol-P-Man biosynthesis defect due to DPM3 mutations is a cause for alpha-dystroglycanopathy, thereby bridging the congenital disorders of glycosylation with the dystroglycanopathies.","dc:creator":"Lefeber DJ","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Deficiency of Dol-P-Man synthase subunit DPM3 bridges the congenital disorders of glycosylation with the dystroglycanopathies."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76bcf111-b22b-4be4-8fe7-870c9744bf44_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76bcf111-b22b-4be4-8fe7-870c9744bf44_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1d5aa9b-ebf1-4760-a5b2-d909e45df47f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7578979-c379-46d4-b568-fe903e7e7b48","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"DMP synthase activity in all patient cells was reduced by more than 70%.

Most CDG are caused by defects in the N-glycan biosynthesis, leading to multisystem phenotypes. However, the occurrence of tissue-restricted clinical symptoms in the various defects in dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthesis remains unexplained. To deepen our understanding of the tissue-specific characteristics of defects in the DPM synthesis pathway, we investigated N-glycosylation and O-mannosylation in skeletal muscle of three DPM3-CDG patients presenting with muscle dystrophy and hypo-N-glycosylation of serum transferrin in only two of them. In the three patients, O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (αDG) was strongly reduced and western blot analysis of beta-dystroglycan (βDG) N-glycosylation revealed a consistent lack of one N-glycan in skeletal muscle. Recently, defective N-glycosylation of βDG has been reported in patients with mutations in guanosine-diphosphate-mannose pyrophosphorylase B (GMPPB). Thus, we suggest that aberrant O-glycosylation of αDG and N-glycosylation of βDG in skeletal muscle is indicative of a defect in the DPM synthesis pathway. Further studies should address to what extent hypo-N-glycosylation of βDG or other skeletal muscle proteins contribute to the phenotype of patients with defects in DPM synthesis. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the tissue-restricted phenotype of DPM3-CDG and other defects in the DPM synthesis pathway.","dc:creator":"van Tol W","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Toward understanding tissue-specific symptoms in dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthesis disorders; insight from DPM3-CDG."},"rdfs:label":"DPM3 Expression in Patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:436b7d51-b90a-4b4d-8f06-d36715e2ca21","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3fdc790e-4a57-4fce-9600-cfd1273460a7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Patients with this mutations in this gene show phenotypes associated with muscular dystrophy and  similar to other types of CDG.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10835346","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthase generates mannosyl donors for glycosylphosphatidylinositols, N-glycan and protein O- and C-mannosylation.

Here we report that human DPM synthase consists of three subunits. The third subunit, DPM3, comprises 92 amino acids associated with DPM1 via its C-terminal domain and with DPM2 via its N-terminal portion. The stability of DPM3 was dependent upon DPM2. However, overexpression of DPM3 in Lec15 cells, a null mutant of DPM2, restored the biosynthesis of DPM with an increase in DPM1, indicating that DPM3 directly stabilized DPM1. Therefore, DPM2 stabilizes DPM3 and DPM3 stabilizes DPM1. DPM synthase activity was 10 times higher in the presence of DPM2, indicating that DPM2 also plays a role in the enzymatic reaction.

The present study highlights several aspects related to DPM3 gene mutations such as mild to moderately severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and abnormal N-glycosylation profile suggestive of CDG type 1.","dc:creator":"Svahn J","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Dilated cardiomyopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy due to novel pathogenic variants in the DPM3 gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:25809bb7-7e6d-41d6-82e1-e6ab7734accd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:25809bb7-7e6d-41d6-82e1-e6ab7734accd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"European (non-Finnish): 33/1180048 (0.00002796)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:574081fb-1ae8-4b85-b18d-2a95cb788572_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:574081fb-1ae8-4b85-b18d-2a95cb788572","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":27,"allele":{"id":"cggv:8eab2b80-3e2a-4d16-b725-ec4bf7312d3f"},"detectionMethod":"direct sequencings of the 3 genes of the Dol-P-Man synthase complex","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Elevated CK: 1500 to 3000 U/L\n\nMildly elevated transaminases (ASAT 80, ALAT 98, normal < 50 IU/L)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003642","obo:HP_0003701","obo:HP_0002515","obo:HP_0030234","obo:HP_0003198","obo:HP_0001644","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0003560","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0001315","obo:HP_0003487"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:2e78643a-4eb5-46e1-b69a-32b9470e69d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8eab2b80-3e2a-4d16-b725-ec4bf7312d3f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19576565"},"rdfs:label":"Patient (Lefeber et. al)"},{"id":"cggv:2e78643a-4eb5-46e1-b69a-32b9470e69d2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e78643a-4eb5-46e1-b69a-32b9470e69d2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2e78643a-4eb5-46e1-b69a-32b9470e69d2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transfecting CHO2.38 cells with full-length DPM3 successfully restored Dol-P-Man synthase activity, while transfection with plasmids DeltaC and the L74S/L85S double mutant showed no complementation.

We report a female patient who developed isolated pelvic girdle muscle weakness and wasting, which became symptomatic at age 42. Exome sequencing uncovered a homozygous c.131T > G (p.Leu44Pro) substitution in DPM3, encoding dolichol-P-mannose (DPM) synthase subunit 3, leading to a 50% reduction of enzymatic activity. Decreased availability of DPM as an essential donor substrate for protein O-mannosyltransferase (POMT) 1 and 2 explains defective skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan O-glycosylation. Our findings show that DPM3 mutations may lead to an isolated and mild limb girdle muscular dystrophy phenotype without cardiomyopathy.","dc:creator":"Van den Bergh PYK","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A homozygous DPM3 mutation in a patient with alpha-dystroglycan-related limb girdle muscular dystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient (Van den Bergh et. al)"},{"id":"cggv:690ddbcf-f56a-4770-8d08-ff1537065e82","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:690ddbcf-f56a-4770-8d08-ff1537065e82_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":" European (non-Finnish): 33/1180048 (0.00002796)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:75eceb3a-9065-478b-ae27-8c16a8d861a1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:75eceb3a-9065-478b-ae27-8c16a8d861a1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a5426801-06df-4aa9-a68f-f96883b42c30"},"detectionMethod":"Trio whole exome sequencing\n","phenotypeFreeText":"recurrent generalized seizures since infancy; The EEG showed changes suggestive of generalised epilepsy; myography revealed myopathic features\n\nSerum CK: 1507 U/L;  ammonia levels: 53 μmol/L\n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002540","obo:HP_0034295","obo:HP_0002280","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0030234"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:c7397680-fb05-4299-a3e6-1b3548924e0d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a5426801-06df-4aa9-a68f-f96883b42c30"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35932216"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 5"},{"id":"cggv:c7397680-fb05-4299-a3e6-1b3548924e0d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7397680-fb05-4299-a3e6-1b3548924e0d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"African/African American: 1/16058 (0.00006227)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.4}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":7299,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":6.4,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d3c23ba7-1177-4a6f-bc8d-cc63f391e078","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013049","gene":"hgnc:3007","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*DPM3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation by Lefeber DJ et al., 2009 (PMID: 19576565). At least 5 unique variants, all missense, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental findings. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands from publications (PMIDs: 19576565, 28803818, 30931530, 31266720, 31469168, 35932216). Patients exhibit a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, creatine kinase elevation, cardiomyopathy, developmental delay, microcephaly, and neurological symptoms. Common neurological phenotypes associated with *DPM3* mutations include seizures, motor signs such as Babinski and Gowers signs, and other abnormalities like cerebral arteriovenous malformation, abnormal brain morphology, ataxia, dysarthria, and focal-onset seizures with associated motor and sensory deficits. No supporting segregation information is available, and the disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of *DPM3*, which encodes the stabilizer subunit of the dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM) synthase complex, tethering catalytic subunit *DPM1* to the endoplasmic reticulum (PMID: 10835346). Altered expression of DPM3 in patients shows that DPM synthase activity in all patient cells was reduced by more than 70%. Immunoblotting in those same cells revealed a significant reduction in IIH6 labeling, indicating glycosylation problems (PMID: 30931530). In summary, there is strong evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship. Although additional genetic and experimental evidence is needed to establish a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. A classification of **MODERATE** was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on 12/6/23 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:76bcf111-b22b-4be4-8fe7-870c9744bf44"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
