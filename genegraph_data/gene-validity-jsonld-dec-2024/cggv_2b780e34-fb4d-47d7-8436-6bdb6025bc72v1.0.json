Here, we describe 11 young patients (5-13 years) with a predominant presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Metabolic investigations showed deficient protein N-glycosylation, leading to a diagnosis of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). Homozygosity mapping in the consanguineous families showed a locus with two known genes in the N-glycosylation pathway. In all individuals, pathogenic mutations were identified in DOLK, encoding the dolichol kinase responsible for formation of dolichol-phosphate. Enzyme analysis in patients' fibroblasts confirmed a dolichol kinase deficiency in all families. In comparison with the generally multisystem presentation in CDG, the nonsyndromic DCM in several individuals was remarkable. Investigation of other dolichol-phosphate dependent glycosylation pathways in biopsied heart tissue indicated reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan with concomitant functional loss of its laminin-binding capacity, which has been linked to DCM. We thus identified a combined deficiency of protein N-glycosylation and alpha-dystroglycan O-mannosylation in patients with nonsyndromic DCM due to autosomal recessive DOLK mutations.","dc:creator":"Lefeber DJ","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive dilated cardiomyopathy due to DOLK mutations results from abnormal dystroglycan O-mannosylation."},"rdfs:label":"Highest expression levels of DOLK mRNA in fetal and adult br"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Highest expression levels of DOLK mRNA were found in fetal and adult brain.

In S. cerevisiae, the SEC59 gene encodes a protein essential for the expression of DK, an enzyme activity that is required for cell viability and normal rates of lipid intermediate synthesis and protein N-glycosylation. This study identifies a cDNA clone from human brain that encodes the mammalian homolog of DK (hDK1p). hDK1 is capable of complementing the growth defect, elevating DK activity, and consequently increasing Dol-P levels in vivo and restoring normal N-glycosylation of carboxypeptidase Y at the restrictive temperature in the temperature-sensitive mutant sec59-1. The CTP-mediated phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) is unaffected by either the temperature-sensitive mutation in the sec59-1 strain, overexpression of the SEC59 gene, or the mammalian homolog hDK1 under conditions that produced a loss or elevation in the level of DK activity. Additionally, overexpression of hDK1p in Sf-9 cells resulted in a 15-fold increase in DK activity but not DAG kinase activity in crude microsomal fractions. The cloned cDNA contains an open reading frame that would encode a protein with 538 amino acids and a molecular weight of 59,268 kDa. Consistent with this prediction, new polypeptides were detected with an apparent molecular weight of 59-60 kDa when His(6)-tagged constructs of hDK1 or the SEC59 gene were expressed in Sf-9 cells or the temperature-sensitive sec59-1 mutant cells, respectively.

disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of genetic diseases caused by mutations in genes that are necessary for the addition of oligosaccharides to acceptor proteins or lipids. An early step in this process requires dolichol kinase (DK) to catalyze the formation of dolichyl phosphate, which acts as a membrane anchor for initial attachment of sugar residues that are subsequently built up to oligosaccharides and transferred to acceptor proteins and lipids for further processing. Biallelic mutations in DOLK, the gene for DK, result in human in a CDG with variable symptoms, ranging from nonsyndromic dilated cardiomypopathy to severe multiorgan involvement. We report two female siblings with novel compound heterozygous mutations in DOLK: c.951C>A (p.Tyr317Ter) and c.1558A>G (p.Thr520Ala). Both patients presented in the neonatal period with severe ichthyosis, unusual distal digital constrictions and dilated cardiomyopathy which resulted in death. Histology of the skin showed lipid droplet accumulation in the stratum corneum and keratinocytes, which suggests defective epidermal lipid metabolism. These patients represent an earlier and more severe form of DOLK-CDG (CDG-1m) with a striking presentation at birth that expands the known phenotypic spectrum.","dc:creator":"Rush ET","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Dolichol kinase deficiency (DOLK-CDG): Two new cases and expansion of phenotype."}},{"id":"cggv:5c82ee4d-7da2-4911-a0f2-64b5ed98317b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1e2c7c57-0c2b-41e4-8299-fb87c06e1055"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28816422"}],"rdfs:label":"Rush_Patient 1 "},{"id":"cggv:5c82ee4d-7da2-4911-a0f2-64b5ed98317b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c82ee4d-7da2-4911-a0f2-64b5ed98317b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Maternally derived, nonsense mutation that results in a greatly truncated protein lacking the carboxy-terminal 40% of the protein, including a critical CTP binding domain that is necessary for catalytic activity.

Screening for infectious and structural etiologies showed normal results. A metabolic investigation was undertaken to investigate the cause of his neurological disease. Screening for congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) by HPLC analysis of serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) showed a type 1 pattern with 18% disialotransferrin (reference < 2%) and 2% asialotransferrin (reference 0). An undiagnosed 10-year old sister with a similar clinical history with infantile spasms at age 4 months, intellectual disability and an autism spectrum disorder, also showed a type 1 CDT pattern. Both siblings lacked dysmorphic features and extra-cerebral symptoms. The boy had cytotoxic edema of the thalamus and mesencephalon on MRI at age 7 months, whereas the girl had normal MRI at age 8 months. Phosphomannomutase (PMM) and phosphomannose isomerase (MPI) activities in cultured fibroblasts were normal, excluding PMM2-CDG and MPI-CDG. Fibroblast lipid-linked oligosaccharide analysis was also normal, suggesting an early defect in glycan assembly. Sequence analysis of the dolichol kinase gene revealed a homozygous new missense mutation (p.M1?; c.2 T > C) in both siblings. In conclusion, two siblings were demonstrated to suffer from DOLK-CDG (MIM 610768) and to be homozygous for a new mutation. They presented with West syndrome and so far show a purely neurological phenotype.","dc:creator":"Helander A","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Dolichol kinase deficiency (DOLK-CDG) with a purely neurological presentation caused by a novel mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"Helander Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:15724a03-1013-4f64-b0d6-ecbaf9fab10e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:15724a03-1013-4f64-b0d6-ecbaf9fab10e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8061,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":11.3,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6a7b15c6-0bb0-4653-b803-6aef663613f5","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012556","gene":"hgnc:23406","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"DOLK was first reported in relation to DOLK-Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, [DOLK-CDG, (MONDO:0012556) in 2007 (Kranz C et al., 2007 PMID:17273964). DOLK-CDG is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by muscular hypotonia and ichthyosis. It has been described in four children from two consanguineous families. All the affected children died during early infancy, two from dilated cardiomyopathy. The syndrome is caused by a deficiency in dolichol kinase 1 (DK1), an enzyme involved in the de novo biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate. The mutations identified in the DK1 gene led to a 96 to 98% reduction in DK activity. DOLK provides instructions for making the enzyme dolichol kinase, which facilitates the final step of the production of a compound called dolichol phosphate. This compound is critical for glycosylation, which attaches the groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. \n \nMore than 500 unique variants (e.g., synonymous, missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans by ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. 9 variants (1 nonsense, and 8 missense) that have been reported in approximately 9 probands in 5 publication (Kranz C et al., 2007 PMID:17273964; Lefeber D et al., 2011; PMID: 22242004; Helander A et al., 2013; PMID:23890587; Lieu MT et al., 2013; PMID:24144945; Rush E et al., 2017 PMID:28816422), are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical functions, expression, and yeast models studies (Fernandez F, Et Al., 2002; PMID: 12213788; Lefeber et al., 2011; PMID: 22242004). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between DOLK and DOLK-CDG. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on the meeting date February 21, 2024 (SOP Version 10). \n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2b780e34-fb4d-47d7-8436-6bdb6025bc72"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
