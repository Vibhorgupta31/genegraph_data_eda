She was referred to our hospital because of delayed psychomotor development. She showed hypotonia and decreased spontaneous movements. Voluntary movements of the limbs were more frequent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. Occasional dyskinetic features, such as awkward hand/foot posturing and grimacing, were seen during the voluntary movements. Serum metabolic screening, head magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalography were unremarkable. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo mutation in the patient's GNAO1 gene, c.709 G > A (p.E237K). We calculated the free-energy change using the FoldX Suite to evaluate the impact of the E237K mutation. The FoldX calculations showed an increased free-energy change in the active state of the GNAO1 protein, indicating that the E237K mutation destabilizes the active state complexes. No seizures, chorea, tremor, or myoclonia, which are frequently reported in patients with GNAO1 mutations, were observed as of the last follow up.

At least 10 unique variants have been reported in humans. These are all missense variants except for one variant that is predicted to result in loss of a splice donor. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. All probands had hypotonia, developmental and motor delay, movement disorder, intellectual disability, and no to very limited speech. Some probands (6/20, 30%) had seizures, usually focal and well-controlled on anti-epileptic drugs. Many patients ( 8/20, 40%) had abnormal MRI or brain atrophy. There are many recurrent variants at two major residues: p.Arg209 and p.Glu246. This is because both of these sites are CpG sites that are prone to mutation. Variants identified include p.Arg209His, p.Arg209Gly, p.Arg209Cys, p.Arg209Leu, p.Glu246Lys and p.Glu246Gly. Seven probands improved with placement of deep brain stimulators into the bilateral internal globus pallidus (29758257). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 20 probands in 7 publications. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease may be heterozygous gain-of-function (28747448), but more experimental evidence is needed. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy. This has been assessed separately. In summary, GNAO1 is definitively associated with AD rare genetic movement disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/19/2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:418a5a18-3d0e-4cef-84b4-74c5accc0df1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
