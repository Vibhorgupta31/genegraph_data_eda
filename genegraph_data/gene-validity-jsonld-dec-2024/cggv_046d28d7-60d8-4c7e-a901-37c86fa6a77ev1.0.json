By screening a cohort of phenotype-matched subjects and a cohort of HI subjects in whom WES had been performed previously, we identified two additional families with biallelic truncating variants of MPZL2. Affected individuals demonstrated symmetric, progressive, mild to moderate sensorineural HI. Onset of HI was in the first decade, and high-frequency hearing was more severely affected. There was no vestibular involvement. MPZL2 encodes myelin protein zero-like 2, an adhesion molecule that mediates epithelial cell-cell interactions in several (developing) tissues. Involvement of MPZL2 in hearing was confirmed by audiometric evaluation of Mpzl2-mutant mice. These displayed early-onset progressive sensorineural HI that was more pronounced in the high frequencies. Histological analysis of adult mutant mice demonstrated an altered organization of outer hair cells and supporting cells and degeneration of the organ of Corti. In addition, we observed mild degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons, and this degeneration was most pronounced at the cochlear base. Although MPZL2 is known to function in cell adhesion in several tissues, no phenotypes other than HI were found to be associated with MPZL2 defects. This indicates that MPZL2 has a unique function in the inner ear. The present study suggests that deleterious variants of Mplz2/MPZL2 affect adhesion of the inner-ear epithelium and result in loss of structural integrity of the organ of Corti and progressive degeneration of hair cells, supporting cells, and spiral ganglion neurons.","dc:creator":"Wesdorp M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"MPZL2, Encoding the Epithelial Junctional Protein Myelin Protein Zero-like 2, Is Essential for Hearing in Man and Mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in human fetal cochlea"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3621dfd8-91e5-460f-85f3-e13f5ed00b5c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5aa76847-f466-4bd3-a44b-588f119a0155","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunofluorescence in WT mice showed that MPZL2 is expressed in the organ of Corti and stria vascularis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29961571","rdfs:label":"Expression in WT mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6cbde05f-32ec-4a5d-9613-afdeb0d03260","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1775b4a7-cc85-4b71-9ba9-5c585c5797b8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Audiograms show mild hearing loss in 4-week-old mice, and rapidly progressive moderate to severe hearing loss in 8 and 12-week-old mice respectively.\nLoss of hair and supporting cells in organ of Corti, and loss of neurons in spiral ganglion to some degree at all levels of mutant mice cochlea (basal, medial, and apical).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29961571","rdfs:label":"Wesdorp Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Upgraded to 3 points for histological analysis."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e18bd7f-4b07-4958-ae3c-077a743b7d85_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec7c3f86-662f-4490-98d9-eac7c121c499","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"Exome sequencing with Sanger sequencing to confirm","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Bilateral symmetric moderate sensorineural hearing loss.

While rare in other populations, the allele frequency of the variant is ~ 0.004 in Ashkenazi Jews, suggesting that it may be an important cause of moderate hearing loss in that population. We show that Mpzl2 is expressed in mouse inner ear, and the protein localizes in the auditory inner and outer hair cells, with an asymmetric subcellular localization.

At least three unique variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 29961571, 29982980, 32203226, 33234333). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 11 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of disease is suspected to be homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model and expression studies (PMID: 29961571, 29982980). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between MPZL2 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted.
