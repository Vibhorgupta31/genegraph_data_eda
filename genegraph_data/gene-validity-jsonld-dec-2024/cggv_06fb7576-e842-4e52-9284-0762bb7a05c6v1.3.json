To characterize the pattern of fibrocystin expression we have generated four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the cytoplasmic tail of the protein. Western analysis of human kidney membrane protein showed an identical pattern with each mAb; a strongly expressing large product (>450 kDa), consistent with the predicted protein size, and a weaker approximately 220 kDa band. The same large product was detected in rat and mouse kidney with lower level expression in liver. To further show that these mAbs recognize fibrocystin, tissue from ARPKD patients was analyzed and no fibrocystin products were detected. Immunohistochemical analysis of the developing kidney showed expression in the branching ureteric bud and collecting ducts, expression that persisted into adulthood. Biliary duct staining was found in the liver, plus staining in the pancreas and developing testis. Immunofluorescence analysis of MDCK cells showed a major site of expression in the primary cilia. Recent studies have associated the disease protein in various human and animal forms of PKD with cilia. The localization of fibrocystin to cilia further strengthens that correlation and indicates that the primary defect in ARPKD may be linked to ciliary dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Ward CJ","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Cellular and subcellular localization of the ARPKD protein; fibrocystin is expressed on primary cilia."},"rdfs:label":"No fibrocystin products detected in disease kidney tissue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2b731834-4b92-41bf-8ba3-4774b332ef55","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f59a0d8c-9d39-44a5-8df5-64bcb9f942e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Northern Blot analysis of expression showed the PKHD1 transcript is expressed at moderate levels in adult kidney and pancreas, lower levels in adult liver, and moderate levels in fetal kidney (not shown in paper).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11919560","rdfs:label":"Isolated RNA from normal human kidney"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Using the same methods, it was shown that the PKHD1 transcript is expressed at moderate levels in adult and fetal kidney, and at lower levels in adult liver and pancreas (Onuchic et al. 2002, PMID: 11898128)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:06fb7576-e842-4e52-9284-0762bb7a05c6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b62f2965-757e-4c5c-a9f3-bcb08391b76c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4152deb5-9946-4e69-97b6-a9351b930886","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Findings indicate that significant reduction/ loss of PKHD1 expression is associated with cystogenesis in ARPKD.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14983006","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene have been shown to cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), but the cellular functions of the gene product (PKHD1) remain uncharacterized.

During embryogenesis, PKHD1 is widely expressed in epithelial derivatives, including neural tubules, gut, pulmonary bronchi, and hepatic cells. In the kidneys of the pck rats, the rat model of which is genetically homologous to human ARPKD, the level of PKHD1 was significantly reduced but not completely absent. In cultured renal cells, the PKHD1 gene product colocalized with polycystin-2, the gene product of autosomal dominant polycystic disease type 2, at the basal bodies of primary cilia. Immunoreactive PKHD1 localized predominantly at the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells, suggesting it may be involved in the tubulogenesis and/or maintenance of duct-lumen architecture.

Our recent study reported that a deficiency in FPC increases the severity of cystic disease in Pkd2 mutants and down-regulates PC2 in vivo, but the precise molecular mechanism of these effects is unknown (Kim, I., Fu, Y., Hui, K., Moeckel, G., Mai, W., Li, C., Liang, D., Zhao, P., Ma, J., Chen, X.-Z., George, A. L., Jr., Coffey, R. J., Feng, Z. P., and Wu, G. (2008) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 19, 455-468). In this study, through the use of deletion and mutagenesis strategies, we identified a PC2-binding domain in the intracellular C terminus of FPC and an FPC-binding domain in the intracellular N terminus of PC2. These binding domains provide a molecular basis for the physical interaction between PC2 and FPC. In addition, we also found that physical interaction between the binding domains of PC2 and FPC is able to prevent down-regulation of PC2 induced by loss of FPC. In vivo, we generated a mouse model of ADPKD with hypomorphic Pkd2 alleles (Pkd2nf3/nf3) and show that PC2 down-regulation is accompanied by a phenotype similar to that of Pkhd1(-/-) mice. These findings demonstrate a common mechanism underlying cystogenesis in ADPKD and ARPKD and provide insight into the molecular relationship between PC2 and FPC.","dc:creator":"Kim I","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Polycystin-2 expression is regulated by a PC2-binding domain in the intracellular portion of fibrocystin."},"rdfs:label":"Pkhd1-/- mice phenocopy ARPKD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Further evidence on this model is included in Kim et al. 2008, PMID: 18235088."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5},{"id":"cggv:06fb7576-e842-4e52-9284-0762bb7a05c6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1547d6cf-d5d6-4a50-9ca9-33e3d0f0db76_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1547d6cf-d5d6-4a50-9ca9-33e3d0f0db76","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:8f736d10-b187-49ca-9c47-d88b06f562f9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_138694.4(PKHD1):c.2107G>A (p.Asp703Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA364444066"}},"detectionMethod":"SSCP analysis to detect base-pair changes, screened the 67 coding exons, tested segregation in families where possible, missense variants assessed by testing 150 normal chromosomes","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:155f4f52-4fc8-4d1b-987d-22f40321fcee_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8f736d10-b187-49ca-9c47-d88b06f562f9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12506140","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD/PKHD1) is an important cause of renal-related and liver-related morbidity and mortality in childhood. Recently mutations in the PKHD1 gene on chromosome 6p21.1-p12 have been identified as the molecular cause of ARPKD. The longest continuous open reading frame (ORF) is encoded by a 67-exon transcript and predicted to yield a 4074-amino acid protein (\"polyductin\") of thus far unknown function. By now, a total of 29 different PKHD1 mutations have been described. This study reports mutation screening in 90 ARPKD patients and identifies mutations in 110 alleles making up a detection rate of 61%. Thirty-four of the detected mutations have not been reported previously. Two underlying mutations in 40 patients and one mutation in 30 cases are disclosed, and no mutation was detected on the remaining chromosomes. Mutations were found to be scattered throughout the gene without evidence of clustering at specific sites. About 45% of the changes were predicted to truncate the protein. All missense mutations were nonconservative, with the affected amino acid residues found to be conserved in the murine polyductin orthologue. One recurrent missense mutation (T36M) likely represents a mutational hotspot and occurs in a variety of populations. Two founder mutations (R496X and V3471G) make up about 60% of PKHD1 mutations in the Finnish population. Preliminary genotype-phenotype correlations could be established for the type of mutation rather than for the site of the individual mutation. All patients carrying two truncating mutations displayed a severe phenotype with perinatal or neonatal demise. PKHD1 mutation analysis is a powerful tool to establish the molecular cause of ARPKD in a given family. Direct identification of mutations allows an unequivocal diagnosis and accurate genetic counseling even in families displaying diagnostic challenges.","dc:creator":"Bergmann

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in 2002 (Ward et al., PMID: 11919560). Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare, genetic hepatorenal fibrocystic syndrome characterized by cystic dilatation and ectasia of renal collecting tubules, and a ductal plate malformation of the liver resulting in congenital hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation, whilst typically in utero or at birth, is variable and in the most severe cases includes Potter-sequence, oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and massively enlarged echogenic kidneys. Heterozygous carriers of pathogenic variants in *PKHD1* have been associated with susceptibility to liver and/or kidney cysts in two publications (PMID: 21945273, 28375157). However, in reviewing the evidence associating *PKHD1* with monoallelic late-onset polycystic kidney disease, it was unclear if the relationship represents a monogenic disorder with reduced penetrance or a risk factor. Published family studies and long-term phenotypic data are currently limited so, without clear evidence, it was decided to not curate *PKHD1* for a separate monoallelic disorder. Seventeen variants (missense, indel, nonsense, and frameshift) reported in ten probands in two publications (PMIDs: 11919560, 12506140) are included in this biallelic curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models phenocopying the ARPKD liver phenotype, although the kidney disease is milder in rodents than humans, and expression studies including ciliary/basal body localization (PMIDs: 11919560, 12925574, 14983006, 18782757, 15830394, 17519956, 18286309). The pck rat with homozygous *Pkhd1* knockout exhibited significantly less immunoreactivity of the ARPKD protein, fibrocystin (FBC), than wild-type rats. Some collecting duct epithelia completely lacked detectable FPC expression at the cellular level and only ~5% of the pck renal cysts retained FPC labelling with most being at the early stage of cystogenesis with no FPC labelling in large cysts of the pck rat kidneys (PMID:14983006). These findings indicate that significant reduction/loss of *PKHD1* expression is associated with cystogenesis in ARPKD. Similar results were seen in a mouse model designed with a targeting construct disrupting exon 15 and deleting exon 16, which resulted in a variant allele. Mice heterozygous for the allele were intercrossed to produce homozygous *Pkhd1*-/- mice. These mice had cystic or dilated-duct phenotypes in the pancreas with mild-severe tubular dilation (PMID: 18235088, 18782757). In summary, *PKHD1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD-*PKHD1*). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 11/11/2020 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:06fb7576-e842-4e52-9284-0762bb7a05c6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
