We report a patient who presented at birth with severe lactic acidosis, proteinuria, dicarboxylic aciduria, and hepatic insufficiency. She also had dilation of left ventricle on echocardiography. Her neurological condition rapidly worsened and despite aggressive care she died at 23 h of life. Muscle histology displayed lipid accumulation. Electron microscopy showed markedly swollen mitochondria with fragmented cristae. Respiratory-chain enzymatic assays showed a reduction of combined activities of complex I+III and II+III with normal activities of isolated complexes. The defect was confirmed in fibroblasts, where it could be rescued by supplementing the culture medium with 10 Î¼M coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 levels were reduced (28% of controls) in these cells. We performed exome sequencing and focused the analysis on genes involved in coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis. The patient harbored a homozygous c.545T>G, p.(Met182Arg) alteration in COQ2, which was validated by functional complementation in yeast. In this case the biochemical and morphological features were essential to direct the genetic diagnosis. The parents had another pregnancy after the biochemical diagnosis was established, but before the identification of the genetic defect. Because of the potentially high recurrence risk, and given the importance of early CoQ10 supplementation, we decided to treat with CoQ10 the newborn child pending the results of the biochemical assays. Clinicians should consider a similar management in siblings of patients with CoQ10 deficiency without a genetic diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Desbats MA","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency presenting as fatal neonatal multiorgan failure."},"rdfs:label":"COQ2 Mitochondrial Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6261caaa-2b79-4303-84fa-a6500acbd2bf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fedeb241-8a18-449b-a68a-c2a3d1b13b7a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a cofactor for that shuttles electrons between the enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

We have identified 2 novel inborn errors of CoQ10 biosynthesis in 2 distinct families. In both cases, enzymologic studies showed that quinone-dependent OXPHOS activities were in the range of the lowest control values, while OXPHOS enzyme activities were normal. CoQ10 deficiency was confirmed by restoration of normal OXPHOS activities after addition of quinone. A genome-wide search for homozygosity in family 1 identified a region of chromosome 10 encompassing the gene prenyldiphosphate synthase, subunit 1 (PDSS1), which encodes the human ortholog of the yeast COQ1 gene, a key enzyme of CoQ10 synthesis. Sequencing of PDSS1 identified a homozygous nucleotide substitution modifying a conserved amino acid of the protein (D308E). In the second family, direct sequencing of OH-benzoate polyprenyltransferase (COQ2), the human ortholog of the yeast COQ2 gene, identified a single base pair frameshift deletion resulting in a premature stop codon (c.1198delT, N401fsX415). Transformation of yeast Deltacoq1 and Deltacoq2 strains by mutant yeast COQ1 and mutant human COQ2 genes, respectively, resulted in defective growth on respiratory medium, indicating that these mutations are indeed the cause of OXPHOS deficiency.","dc:creator":"Mollet J","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Prenyldiphosphate synthase, subunit 1 (PDSS1) and OH-benzoate polyprenyltransferase (COQ2) mutations in ubiquinone deficiency and oxidative phosphorylation disorders."}},"rdfs:label":"Mollet 2007 - Patient 3"},{"id":"cggv:1574f97a-cc21-48d0-887f-8873ea9e52fa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1574f97a-cc21-48d0-887f-8873ea9e52fa_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1574f97a-cc21-48d0-887f-8873ea9e52fa_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"coq2Î yeast were transformed with either wt human COQ2 or a construct carrying the c.1047del variant.

We identified two patients with early-onset glomerular lesions that harbored mutations in the COQ2 gene. The first patient presented with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome at the age of 18 months as a result of collapsing glomerulopathy, with no extrarenal symptoms. The second patient presented at five days of life with oliguria, had severe extracapillary proliferation on renal biopsy, rapidly developed end-stage renal disease, and died at the age of 6 months after a course complicated by progressive epileptic encephalopathy. Ultrastructural examination of renal specimens from these cases, as well as from two previously reported patients, showed an increased number of dysmorphic mitochondria in glomerular cells. Biochemical analyses demonstrated decreased activities of respiratory chain complexes [II+III] and decreased CoQ(10) concentrations in skeletal muscle and renal cortex. In conclusion, we suggest that inherited COQ2 mutations cause a primary glomerular disease with renal lesions that vary in severity and are not necessarily associated with neurological signs.

The *COQ2* gene encodes the 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase protein. This enzyme is required for the synthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which acts as an electron shuttle between enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.  \n\nThe *COQ2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2006 (PMID: 16400613). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COQ2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COQ2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to per the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine variants in eight probands across six publications (PMIDs: 16400613, 17855635, 17332895, 23631824, 15564041, 29637272). Common clinical manifestations include renal involvement (steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome), hypotonia, cerebral/cerebellar atrophy, encephalopathy and optic atrophy. Age of onset is typically in the first few years of life. Reduced levels of CoQ10 and reduced activities of complex I+III and II+III are commonly observed in patient tissues and cells. No segregation data were available.  Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function, a Drosophila model, and in vitro functional assays in patient cells demonstrating oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies due to variants in COQ2 (PMIDs: 33340416, 27493029, 21703546, 20495179, 26922674).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COQ2* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. More than three years have elapsed since the first assertion of this gene-disease relationship, and no contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 30, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
