The size of the epiblast marked by Oct3/4 is dramatically reduced in embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) Ddx3x-/Y embryos. Preferential paternal X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in extraembryonic tissues of Ddx3x heterozygous (Ddx3x-/+) female mice with a maternally inherited null allele leads to placental abnormalities and embryonic lethality during development. In the embryonic tissues, Ddx3x exhibits developmental- and tissue-specific differences in escape from XCI. Targeted Ddx3x ablation in the epiblast leads to widespread apoptosis and abnormal growth, which causes embryonic lethality in the Sox2-cre/+;Ddx3xflox/Y mutant around E11.5. The observation of significant increases in γH2AX and p-p53Ser15 indicates DNA damage, which suggests that loss of Ddx3x leads to higher levels of genome damage.

Previous studies have identified mutations in more than 100 genes on the X chromosome in males with ID, but there is less evidence for de novo mutations on the X chromosome causing ID in females. In this study we present 35 unique deleterious de novo mutations in DDX3X identified by whole exome sequencing in 38 females with ID and various other features including hypotonia, movement disorders, behavior problems, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and epilepsy. Based on our findings, mutations in DDX3X are one of the more common causes of ID, accounting for 1%-3% of unexplained ID in females. Although no de novo DDX3X mutations were identified in males, we present three families with segregating missense mutations in DDX3X, suggestive of an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. In these families, all males with the DDX3X variant had ID, whereas carrier females were unaffected. To explore the pathogenic mechanisms accounting for the differences in disease transmission and phenotype between affected females and affected males with DDX3X missense variants, we used canonical Wnt defects in zebrafish as a surrogate measure of DDX3X function in vivo. We demonstrate a consistent loss-of-function effect of all tested de novo mutations on the Wnt pathway, and we further show a differential effect by gender.

The phenotypes associated with DDX3X variants are heterogeneous and include brain and behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, and movement disorders and/or spasticity. The majority of DDX3X variants described are de novo mutations in females with ID. In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant. It has been suggested, therefore, that DDX3X exerts its effects through haploinsufficiency in females, and that affected males carry hypomorphic alleles that retain partial function. Given the lack of male de novo DDX3X variants, loss-of-function variants in this gene are suspected to be male lethal. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated males with hemizygous missense DDX3X variants and ID.

Rare or novel phenotypes observed include respiratory problems, congenital heart disease, skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA depletion, and late-onset neurologic decline.

More than 100 unique variants have been reported in the literature (PMID: 32135084). Approximately half of the variants observed in humans are missense, although nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and in-frame indel variants have also been reported. Eight variants were included in this curation to reach a classification of definitive, however more evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 26235985, 30349862, 30936465, 30734472). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 family members. More research is needed to determine whether disease is caused by haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative mechanism. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 27179789, 27656019, 32135084). In summary, DDX3X is definitively associated with X-linked syndromic intellectual disability.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3b7c89d4-ccb2-4d4e-ad11-9d6051a40b6d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
