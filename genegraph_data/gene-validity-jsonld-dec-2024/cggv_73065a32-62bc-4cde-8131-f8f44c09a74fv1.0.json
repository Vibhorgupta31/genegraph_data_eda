The polymerase δ complex is a heterotetramer comprising the catalytic subunit POLD1 and the accessory subunits POLD2, POLD3, and POLD4. Beyond DNA replication, the polymerase δ complex has emerged as a central element in genome maintenance. The essentiality of polymerase δ has constrained the generation of polymerase δ-knockout cell lines or model organisms and, therefore, the understanding of the complexity of its activity and the function of its accessory subunits. To our knowledge, no germline biallelic mutations affecting this complex have been reported in humans. In patients from 2 independent pedigrees, we have identified what we believe to be a novel syndrome with reduced functionality of the polymerase δ complex caused by germline biallelic mutations in POLD1 or POLD2 as the underlying etiology of a previously unknown autosomal-recessive syndrome that combines replicative stress, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and immunodeficiency. Patients' cells showed impaired cell-cycle progression and replication-associated DNA lesions that were reversible upon overexpression of polymerase δ. The mutations affected the stability and interactions within the polymerase δ complex or its intrinsic polymerase activity. We believe our discovery of human polymerase δ deficiency identifies the central role of this complex in the prevention of replication-related DNA lesions, with particular relevance to adaptive immunity.","dc:creator":"Conde CD","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Polymerase δ deficiency causes syndromic immunodeficiency with replicative stress."},"rdfs:label":"Conde et al.

Pol δ is anchored to one of the three PCNA monomers through the C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit. The catalytic core sits on top of PCNA in an open configuration while the regulatory subunits project laterally. This arrangement allows PCNA to thread and stabilize the DNA exiting the catalytic cleft and recruit FEN1 to one unoccupied monomer in a toolbelt fashion. Alternative holoenzyme conformations reveal important functional interactions that maintain PCNA orientation during synthesis.

To date, there are three probands, two homozygous, and one compound heterozygous individuals, reported with biallelic *POLD1* missense variants and the disease. Probands displayed phenotypes including recurrent infections, decreased CD4+ T cells, and T cell lymphocytopenia. Patient P1 from Cui et al. presented with T cells showing defective S phase DNA replication and restrictive V-J gene recombinations. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by one animal model (PMID:19145245). Homozygous POLD1 knock out mice were embryonic lethal by E7.5 with an apparent deficiency in cellular proliferation and DNA replication. The gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function showing that POLD1 is the catalytic component of DNA polymerase delta, which is a critical enzyme to both DNA replication and DNA repair. Additionally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by rescue, in which transfection of WT-POLD1 was able to restore a deficiency in DNA replication seen in patient cells. Finally, a co-IP assay has shown that POLD1 co-immunoprecipitates with POLD2, which serves as the scaffolding for DNA polymerase delta and has also been implicated in non-severe combined immunodeficiency due to polymerase delta deficiency. In summary, this curation reaches a classification of Limited due to the small number of published patients. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date February 16th (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:73065a32-62bc-4cde-8131-f8f44c09a74f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
