Joubert syndrome is characterized by a specific midbrain-hindbrain malformation ('molar tooth sign'), variably associated retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis, liver fibrosis and polydactyly and is included in the newly emerging group of 'ciliopathies'. In individuals with Joubert disease genetically linked to JBTS1, we identified mutations in the INPP5E gene, encoding inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E, which hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2. Mutations clustered in the phosphatase domain and impaired 5-phosphatase activity, resulting in altered cellular PtdIns ratios. INPP5E localized to cilia in major organs affected by Joubert syndrome, and mutations promoted premature destabilization of cilia in response to stimulation. These data link PtdIns signaling to the primary cilium, a cellular structure that is becoming increasingly recognized for its role in mediating cell signals and neuronal function.","dc:creator":"Bielas SL","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in INPP5E, encoding inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E, link phosphatidyl inositol signaling to the ciliopathies."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a5fb970a-8747-4c3e-8465-d8cb007c1428_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a5fb970a-8747-4c3e-8465-d8cb007c1428_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d6f06fa9-1c69-439c-baaf-25d3ca4726e6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6397184c-c642-48b6-a52f-8540326c9d37","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Increase in mTOR signaling implicated in cystic kidneys and this defect is rescued by inhibiting mTOR using everolimus","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27056978","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common cause of renal failure with few effective treatments.

The Inpp5e morphant zebrafish exhibited shortened and decreased cilia formation in the Kupffer's vesicle and pronephric ducts as compared to controls.

To date, 19 causative genes have been identified, all coding for proteins of the primary cilium. There is clinical and genetic overlap with other ciliopathies, in particular with Meckel syndrome (MKS), that is allelic to JSRD at nine distinct loci. We previously identified the INPP5E gene as causative of JSRD in seven families linked to the JBTS1 locus, yet the phenotypic spectrum and prevalence of INPP5E mutations in JSRD and MKS remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we performed INPP5E mutation analysis in 483 probands, including 408 JSRD patients representative of all clinical subgroups and 75 MKS fetuses. We identified 12 different mutations in 17 probands from 11 JSRD families, with an overall 2.7% mutation frequency among JSRD. The most common clinical presentation among mutated families (7/11, 64%) was Joubert syndrome with ocular involvement (either progressive retinopathy and/or colobomas), while the remaining cases had pure JS. Kidney, liver and skeletal involvement were not observed. None of the MKS fetuses carried INPP5E mutations, indicating that the two ciliopathies are not allelic at this locus.

syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by malformation of the mid and hindbrain leading to the pathognomonic molar tooth appearance of the brainstem and cerebellum on axial MRI. Core clinical manifestations include hypotonia, tachypnea/apnea, ataxia, ocular motor apraxia, and developmental delay of varying degrees. In addition, a subset of patients has retinal dystrophy, chorioretinal colobomas, hepatorenal fibrocystic disease, and polydactyly. Joubert syndrome exhibits genetic heterogeneity, with mutations identified in more than 30 genes, including INPP5E, a gene encoding inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase E, which is important in the development and stability of the primary cilium. Here, we report the detailed clinical phenotypes of two sisters with a novel homozygous variant in INPP5E (NM_019892.4: c.1565G>C, NP_063945.2: p.Gly552Ala), expanding the phenotype associated with Joubert syndrome type 1. Expression studies using patient-derived fibroblasts showed changes in mRNA and protein levels. Analysis of fibroblasts from patients revealed that a significant number of cells had shorter or no cilia, indicating defects in ciliogenesis, and cilia maintenance.","dc:creator":"Hardee

was first linked to autosomal recessive Joubert syndrome (JBTS) in 2009 (PMIDs: 19668215, 19668216), although the genomic region was linked to JBTS in 1999 (PMID: 10577920). Biallelic pathogenic variants in INPP5E are associated with JBTS (MIM #213300) and a lesser studied, MORM (mental retardation, truncal obesity, retinal dystrophy and micropenis) syndrome (MIM #610156). While the majority of JBTS-causing variants are missense that occur within the phosphatase domain of INPP5E (PMIDs: 19668216, 23386033, 27434533, 25818971, 29052317, 32139166), a few loss-of-function variants are also reported. Only 2 MORM-related, nonsense variants in the C-terminal CAAX box of the protein (PMIDs: 16493448, 31173343, 34211432), have been described. Functional studies demonstrate that JBTS-causing variants do not affect protein localization but lead to loss of enzymatic activity, while MORM-related variants result in loss of protein localization while retaining enzymatic function (PMID: 19668215). Both diseases also have different clinical presentations - including different organ involvement (PMIDs: 10577920, 16493448). Importantly, MORM syndrome does not have any notable renal manifestations (PMID: 16493448). Therefore, based on criteria established by the Lumping and Splitting working group, the gene disease association of INPP5E has been split and here we specifically describe the relationship between INPP5E and JBTS.  \nThere have been many reports of probands with homozygous recessive or compound heterozygous variants in INPP5E (at least 15 unique gene variants) that lead to JBTS (PMIDs: 19668216, 23386033, 27434533, 25818971, 29052317, 32139166). Within these reports, not all, but many probands also present with renal symptoms including nephronophthisis, cysts and other nephropathy (PMIDs: 25818971, 27434533, 29146704, 29052317, 29230161). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship not only includes genetic case-level data but also experimental data using mouse and zebrafish animal models. These animal models have recapitulated an array of defects observed in JBTS patients including cystic kidneys, cerebellar, skeletal and ocular abnormalities (PMIDs: 19668215, 23022135, 27056978). Further, the animal and cell-based studies have demonstrated the role of INPP5E in regulating PIP3 levels via its 5’ phosphatase function for ciliary maintenance (PMIDs: 27998989, 19668216). Results also demonstrate the ability of WT INPP5E to rescue ciliary defects in cells lacking endogenous enzyme (PMIDs: 19668215, 23022135). The experimental evidence was scored at a total of 5 points. \nIn summary, INPP5E is definitely associated with autosomal recessive JBTS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 09/08/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a5fb970a-8747-4c3e-8465-d8cb007c1428"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
