Mutant animals were normal at birth but grew slower than their wild-type littermates and developed short-limb dwarfism. In the growth plates of mutant mice chondrocyte columns were reduced in number and poorly organized, while mutant COMP was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. Chondrocyte proliferation was reduced and apoptosis was both increased and spatially dysregulated. Previous studies on COMP mutations have shown mutant COMP is co-localized with chaperone proteins, and we have reported an unfolded protein response (UPR) in mouse models of PSACH-MED (multiple epiphyseal dysplasia) harboring mutations in Comp (T585M) and Matn3, Comp etc (V194D). However, we found no evidence of UPR in this mouse model of PSACH. In contrast, microarray analysis identified expression changes in groups of genes implicated in oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, which is consistent with the chondrocyte pathology.

Radiographs of patients with PSACH often show small and irregular epiphyses, irregular metaphyses, and a delay in the ossification of annular epiphyses of the vertebrae (vertebral beaking) (Beighton and McKusick et al. 1993). Notably, COMP has also been associated with Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) which represents the mild end of this disease spectrum. This gene-disease relationship has been assessed separately by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders Expert Panel and was found to have a definitive association. Monoallelic mutations are necessary and sufficient to cause both PSACH and MED phenotypes. Numerous unique variants in COMP have been identified in patients with PSACH (PMIDs: 29899997, 21644213, 21922596, 8307577, 27330822, 9388247). Case-level, segregation, and experimental evidence including a mouse model support this gene-disease relationship. In summary, COMP is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Pseudoachondroplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/7/2020.
