The elucidation of the mechanisms underlying folate action has been challenging. This study introduces Xenopus laevis as a model to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in folate action during neural tube formation. We show that knockdown of folate receptor 1 (Folr1; also known as FRα) impairs neural tube formation and leads to NTDs. Folr1 knockdown in neural plate cells only is necessary and sufficient to induce NTDs. Folr1-deficient neural plate cells fail to constrict, resulting in widening of the neural plate midline and defective neural tube closure. Pharmacological inhibition of folate action by methotrexate during neurulation induces NTDs by inhibiting folate interaction with its uptake systems. Our findings support a model in which the folate receptor interacts with cell adhesion molecules, thus regulating the apical cell membrane remodeling and cytoskeletal dynamics necessary for neural plate folding. Further studies in this organism could unveil novel cellular and molecular events mediated by folate and lead to new ways of preventing NTDs.","dc:creator":"Balashova OA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Folate receptor 1 is necessary for neural plate cell apical constriction during Xenopus neural tube formation."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue in Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Neural tube defects is not present in human patient and because it is frog downgrade to 0.5 point"},{"id":"cggv:1a98633b-53b1-4cba-a0e2-e30486f38dc9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2fd636aa-760b-4a71-8dbe-560c46c09821","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Supplementing het mom partially rescue the phenotype in homozygous pups.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10508523","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces the occurrence of several human congenital malformations, including craniofacial, heart and neural tube defects. Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, there may be a maternal-to-fetal folate-transport defect or an inherent fetal biochemical disorder that is neutralized by supplementation. Previous experiments have identified a folate-binding protein (Folbp1) that functions as a membrane receptor to mediate the high-affinity internalization and delivery of folate to the cytoplasm of the cell. In vitro, this receptor facilitates the accumulation of cellular folate a thousand-fold relative to the media, suggesting that it may be essential in cytoplasmic folate delivery in vivo. The importance of an adequate intracellular folate pool for normal embryogenesis has long been recognized in humans and experimental animals. To determine whether Folbp1 is involved in maternal-to-fetal folate transport, we inactivated Folbp1 in mice. We also produced mice lacking Folbp2, another member of the folate receptor family that is GPI anchored but binds folate poorly. Folbp2-/- embryos developed normally, but Folbp1-/- embryos had severe morphogenetic abnormalities and died in utero by embryonic day (E) 10. Supplementing pregnant Folbp1+/- dams with folinic acid reversed this phenotype in nullizygous pups. Our results suggest that Folbp1 has a critical role in folate homeostasis during development, and that functional defects in the human homologue (FOLR1) of Folbp1 may contribute to similar defects in humans.","dc:creator":"Piedrahita JA","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mice lacking the folic acid-binding protein Folbp1 are defective in early embryonic development."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Because homozygous truncation patients is not embryonic lethal, so downgrade to 1.0"},{"id":"cggv:9f73e55c-9d5f-4d49-9a52-0b162a2942df","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07e10dc2-b25f-4229-8373-c0d1e0fb8a81","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"severe morphogenetic abnormalities","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10508523","rdfs:label":"Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"because homozygous truncation patients is not embryonic lethal, so downgrade to 1.0"},{"id":"cggv:9705da2f-1d60-4957-a50f-c56509b6882f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0945e9a3-3597-4ae6-9049-a01e35d01128","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Folate receptor localized in the superficial neural plate is necessary for the apical constriction of neural plate cells and is required for neural plate folding.

Three individuals presenting a milder clinical phenotype revealed very similar biochemical and brain imaging data but partially shared pathogenic alleles with more severely affected patients.

We report a case of cerebral folate transport deficiency due to a novel homozygous mutation in the FOLR1 gene, in an effort to clarify phenotype-genotype correlation in this newly identified neurometabolic disorder. A previously healthy infant developed an ataxic syndrome in the second year of life, followed by choreic movements and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. At the age of 26 months, we analyzed CSF 5MTHF by HPLC with fluorescence detection and conducted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy studies. Finally, we performed mutational screening in the coding region of the FOLR1 gene. MR showed a diffuse abnormal signal of the cerebral white matter, cerebellar atrophy and a reduced peak of choline in spectroscopy. A profound deficiency of CSF 5MTHF (2 nmol/L; NV 48-127) with reduced CSF/plasma folate ratio (0.4; NV 1.5-3.5) was highly suggestive of defective brain folate-specific transport across the blood-CSF/brain barrier. Mutation screening of FOLR1 revealed a new homozygous missense mutation (p.Cys105Arg) that is predicted to abolish a disulfide bond, probably necessary for the correct folding of the protein. Both parents were heterozygous carriers of the same variant. Mutation screening in the FOLR1 gene is advisable in children with profound 5MTHF deficiency and decreased CSF/serum folate ratio. Progressive ataxia and myoclonic epilepsy, together with impaired brain myelination, are clinical hallmarks of the disease.","dc:creator":"Pérez-Dueñas B","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Progressive ataxia and myoclonic epilepsy in a patient with a homozygous mutation in the FOLR1 gene."}},"rdfs:label":"P1"},{"id":"cggv:6c365162-2e54-4b29-b614-6fb4b9efa2f5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c365162-2e54-4b29-b614-6fb4b9efa2f5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"unspecified significance in clinvar with the same amino acid variant c.314G>T (p.Cys105Phe)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ffda27de-6b5b-4c87-a83d-470717232f24_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffda27de-6b5b-4c87-a83d-470717232f24","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:4ba2a721-da2c-43d3-82f3-59aaae99972a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016729.3(FOLR1):c.466T>G (p.Trp156Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6169197"}},{"id":"cggv:3af966d0-8929-4958-9227-10ac7369e1e0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016729.3(FOLR1):c.374G>T (p.Arg125Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA381733043"}}],"phenotypeFreeText":"intellecutal disability, ataxia, seizures, hypotonia, cerebellar atrophy","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:71cdd5a8-a37d-4dd8-8451-169395f38e0d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4ba2a721-da2c-43d3-82f3-59aaae99972a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24091540","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy is recognized in various types of childhood disorders with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Although careful evaluation of clinical features and neuroimaging can lead to correct diagnosis of disorders, their diagnosis is sometimes difficult because clinical features can overlap with each other. In this study, we performed family-based whole exome sequencing of 23 families including 25 patients with cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy in childhood, who were unable to be diagnosed solely by clinical examination. Pathological mutations of seven genes were found in ten patients from nine families (9/23, 39.1 %): compound heterozygous mutations in FOLR1, C5orf42, POLG, TPP1, PEX16, and de novo mutations in CACNA1A, and ITPR1. Patient 1A with FOLR1 mutations showed extremely low concentration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and Patient 6 with TPP1 mutations demonstrated markedly lowered tripeptidyl peptidase 1 activity in leukocytes. Furthermore, Patient 8 with PEX16 mutations presented a mild increase of very long chain fatty acids in the serum as supportive data for genetic diagnosis. The main clinical features of these ten patients were nonspecific and mixed, and included developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Brain MRI revealed both cerebellar and vermis atrophy in eight patients (8/10, 80 %), vermis atrophy/hypoplasia in two patients (2/10, 20 %), and brainstem atrophy in one patient (1/10, 10 %).

Both conditions are exceptionally rare autosomal recessive inherited diseases mapped to 11q13. Our patient was found to have novel homozygous nonsense mutations in the FOLR1 gene (p.R204X), and FGF3 gene (p.C50X). While the FRα defect is a disorder of brain-specific folate transport accompanied with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) causing progressive neurological symptoms, LAMM syndrome is a solely malformative condition, with normal physical growth and cognitive development. Our patient presented with congenital deafness, hypotonia, dysphygia and ataxia in early childhood. At the age of 6 years he developed intractable epilepsy, and deteriorated clinically with respiratory arrest and severe hypercapnea at the age of 8 years. In contrast to the previously published patients with a FOLR1 gene defect, our patient presented with an abnormal l-dopa metabolism in CSF and high 3-O-methyl-dopa. Upon oral treatment with folinic acid the boy regained consciousness while the epilepsy could be successfully managed only with additional pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). This report pinpoints the importance of CSF folate investigations in children with unexplained progressive neurological presentations, even if a malformative syndrome is obviously present, and suggests a trial with PLP in folinic acid-unresponsive seizures.","dc:creator":"Dill P","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Pyridoxal phosphate-responsive seizures in a patient with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) and congenital deafness with labyrinthine aplasia, microtia and microdontia (LAMM)."}},"rdfs:label":"P1"},{"id":"cggv:c85d0db7-f21c-4f63-8414-50a3abe15107","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c85d0db7-f21c-4f63-8414-50a3abe15107_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4845,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0e5010a2-4993-4fe5-8447-a5b5d6aadda5","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013110","gene":"hgnc:3791","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*FOLR1* variants were first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neurodegenerative syndrome due to cerebral folate transport deficiency in 2009 (PMID:19732866). *FOLR1* encodes a protein involved in folic acid binding. Neurodegenerative syndrome due to cerebral folate transport deficiency is characterized by severe developmental regression, neurodegeneration, intellectual disability/developmental delay, ataxia, and seizures.\n\nAt least 14 unique variants (nonsense, splice-site, missense, etc.) have been reported in 14 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs:19732866, 27743887, 20857335, 27328863, 24091540, 22586289, 25274592, 27066576, 24556562, 21752681) in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by several lines of experimental evidence, including rescues and mouse models (PMIDs:28255006 and 10508523). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between *FOLR1* and autosomal recessive neurodegenerative syndrome due to cerebral folate transport deficiency. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 20, 2017. As of July 2022, this record underwent administrative updates to include an evidence summary text and update scoring to be consistent with SOP Version 9.
