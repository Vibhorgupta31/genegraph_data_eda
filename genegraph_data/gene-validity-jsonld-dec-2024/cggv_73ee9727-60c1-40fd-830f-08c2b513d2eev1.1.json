The clinical definition of four WS types is based on additional features due to defects in structures mostly arising from the neural crest, with type I and type II being the most frequent. While type I is tightly associated to PAX3 mutations, WS type II (WS2) remains partly enigmatic with mutations in known genes (MITF, SOX10) accounting for only 30% of the cases. We performed exome sequencing in a WS2 index case and identified a heterozygous missense variation in EDNRB. Interestingly, homozygous (and very rare heterozygous) EDNRB mutations are already described in type IV WS (i.e., in association with Hirschsprung disease [HD]) and heterozygous mutations in isolated HD. Screening of a WS2 cohort led to the identification of an overall of six heterozygous EDNRB variations. Clinical phenotypes, pedigrees and molecular segregation investigations unraveled a dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. In parallel, cellular and functional studies showed that each of the mutations impairs the subcellular localization of the receptor or induces a defective downstream signaling pathway. Based on our results, we now estimate EDNRB mutations to be responsible for 5%-6% of WS2.","dc:creator":"Issa S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"EDNRB mutations cause Waardenburg syndrome type II in the heterozygous state."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28236341","rdfs:label":"Family 2 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant inherited from unaffected father.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the relationship between EDNRB and autosomal recessive Waardenburg syndrome has been assessed separately. Variants in EDNRB were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2009 (Tuysuz et al., PMID 19764031). At least 6 missense, nonsense and frameshift variants have been reported in humans (Issa et al. 2017, PMID 28236341). Variants in this gene segregate with disease in multiple family members, however phenotypes vary among family members. A mouse model from Matsushima et al. 2002 shows a heterozygous Ednrb variant mouse without Waardenburg phenotypes, and a mouse model by Ida-Eto et al. 2011 shows recovered hearing in a heterozygous Ednrb variant mouse (PMIDs 11773966, 21715336). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 5/8/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:73ee9727-60c1-40fd-830f-08c2b513d2ee"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
