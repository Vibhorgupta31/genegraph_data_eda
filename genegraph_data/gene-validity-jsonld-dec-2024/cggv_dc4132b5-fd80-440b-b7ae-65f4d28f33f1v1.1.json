The molecular basis has not yet been elucidated. Here, we report that KTS is caused by mutations in ROGDI. Using a combination of autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous frameshift deletion, c.229_230del (p.Leu77Alafs(∗)64), in ROGDI in two affected individuals from a consanguineous family. Molecular studies in two additional KTS-affected individuals from two unrelated Austrian and Swiss families revealed homozygosity for nonsense mutation c.286C>T (p.Gln96(∗)) and compound heterozygosity for the splice-site mutations c.531+5G>C and c.532-2A>T in ROGDI, respectively. The latter mutation was also found to be heterozygous in the mother of the Swiss affected individual in whom KTS was reported for the first time in 1974. ROGDI is highly expressed throughout the brain and other organs, but its function is largely unknown. Possible interactions with DISC1, a protein involved in diverse cytoskeletal functions, have been suggested. Our finding that ROGDI mutations cause KTS indicates that the protein product of this gene plays an important role in neuronal development as well as amelogenesis.","dc:creator":"Schossig A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in ROGDI Cause Kohlschütter-Tönz Syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Schossig_Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9378231c-4a03-4e94-be56-0dba06ba30cf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:274c95ff-1bad-4217-9186-3ee55eb18d1b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Immunostaining of labeled dermal fibroblasts cultured from individual II-1 (p.Arg157*) and control showed that WT ROGDI colocalized with the nuclear envelope marker LAMIN A and\nROGDI was not detected in the fibroblasts from affected individual II-1.

Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome, originally described in Kohlschutter et al. (1974),  (PMID: 4372200), is characterized by the presence of epilepsy, impaired intellectual development, and amelogenesis imperfecta. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function. All variants identified to date are expected to either cause premature mRNA degradation by NMD or dramatically alter the protein structure. Seven variants (3 nonsense, 3 splice site, and 1 frameshift) that have been reported in 12 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22424600, 22482807,29153277,33866847) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies. (PMIDs: 22424600, 22482807). In summary, ROGDI is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
