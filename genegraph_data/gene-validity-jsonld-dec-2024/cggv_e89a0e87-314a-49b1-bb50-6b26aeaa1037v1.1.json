The syndrome is caused either by microdeletions in the 17q21.31 chromosomal region or by variants in the KANSL1 gene. The reciprocal 17q21.31 microduplication syndrome is associated with psychomotor delay, and reduced social interaction. To investigate the pathophysiology of 17q21.31 microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, we generated three mouse models: 1) the deletion (Del/+); or 2) the reciprocal duplication (Dup/+) of the 17q21.31 syntenic region; and 3) a heterozygous Kansl1 (Kans1+/-) model. We found altered weight, general activity, social behaviors, object recognition, and fear conditioning memory associated with craniofacial and brain structural changes observed in both Del/+ and Dup/+ animals. By investigating hippocampus function, we showed synaptic transmission defects in Del/+ and Dup/+ mice. Mutant mice with a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in Kansl1 displayed similar behavioral and anatomical phenotypes compared to Del/+ mice with the exception of sociability phenotypes. Genes controlling chromatin organization, synaptic transmission and neurogenesis were upregulated in the hippocampus of Del/+ and Kansl1+/- animals. Our results demonstrate the implication of KANSL1 in the manifestation of KdVS phenotypes and extend substantially our knowledge about biological processes affected by these mutations. Clear differences in social behavior and gene expression profiles between Del/+ and Kansl1+/- mice suggested potential roles of other genes affected by the 17q21.31 deletion. Together, these novel mouse models provide new genetic tools valuable for the development of therapeutic approaches.","dc:creator":"Arbogast T","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mouse models of 17q21.31 microdeletion and microduplication syndromes highlight the importance of Kansl1 for cognition."},"rdfs:label":"Kansl1+/- mice cultured hippocampal neurons"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e89a0e87-314a-49b1-bb50-6b26aeaa1037_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38a4d1e4-46f1-4f08-a6ca-51577fbc4121","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:71d9f97b-3278-4793-afb3-c5aeda48abe9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Kansl1+/- mice showed similar phenotypes observed in KdVS patients: recognition memory deficit, abnormal locomotor activity, reduced body weight.

Prior to its association with KdVS, *KANSL1* was known to be one of the protein-coding genes deleted in patients with 17q21.31 deletion syndrome (PMIDs: 16906163, 16906164). KdVS is caused by pathogenic sequence variants in *KANSL1* or by 17q21.31 microdeletions encompassing *KANSL1* (PMIDs: 22544363, 22544367). KdVS is characterized by intellectual disability and/or developmental delay, hypotonia, speech and language delay, dysmorphic features, and behavioral disorders including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (PMIDs: 22544363, 22544367, 26306646). Truncating variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants, have been identified in over 20 individuals with KdVS reported in 6 publications (PMIDs: 22544363, 22544367, 26306646, 30293248, 33361104, 33393407). The disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including non-human model organisms, and functional in vitro studies (PMID: 28704368).\n\nIn summary, *KANSL1* is definitively associated with Koolen-de Vries syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 18, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e89a0e87-314a-49b1-bb50-6b26aeaa1037"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
