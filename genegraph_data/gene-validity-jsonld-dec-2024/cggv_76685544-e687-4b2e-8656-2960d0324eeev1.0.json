The disorder has previously been described in a family with an \"autosomal dominant myopathy, with joint contractures, ophthalmoplegia, and rimmed vacuoles.\" Linkage analysis and radiation hybrid mapping showed that the gene locus (Human Genome Map locus name: IBM3) is situated in a 2-Mb region of chromosome 17p13, where also a cluster of MyHC genes is located. These include the genes encoding embryonic, IIa, IIx/d, IIb, perinatal, and extraocular MyHCs. Morphological analysis of muscle biopsies from patients from the family indicated to us that the type 2A fibers frequently were abnormal, whereas other fiber types appeared normal. This observation prompted us to investigate the MyHC-IIa gene, since MyHC-IIa is the major isoform in type 2A fibers. The complete genomic sequence for this gene was deduced by using an \"in silico\" strategy. The gene, found to consist of 38 exons, was subjected to a complete mutation scan in patients and controls. We identified a missense mutation, Glu-706 --> Lys, which is located in a highly conserved region of the motor domain, the so-called SH1 helix region. By conformational changes this region communicates activity at the nucleotide-binding site to the neck region, resulting in the lever arm swing. The mutation in this region is likely to result in a dysfunctional myosin, compatible with the disorder in the family.","dc:creator":"Martinsson T","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Autosomal dominant myopathy: missense mutation (Glu-706 --> Lys) in the myosin heavy chain IIa gene."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59326418-44c1-4d44-bbd2-52fb1fc629e0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3136cbb4-32b5-47bd-a96a-58bf1021ee18","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Hybridization of different human skeletal muscle with cRNA probes specific for the 3â€™UTR of MYH2 revealed expression in fast, type IIa muscle fibers.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7545970","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Several members of the sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene family have been mapped in the human genome but many of them have not yet been identified.

The distribution of these two gene products as well as that of the beta/slow MHC gene was analyzed in human skeletal muscles by in situ hybridization. The distribution of beta/slow, IIa, and IIx MHC transcripts defines three major muscle fiber types expressing a single MHC mRNA, i.e., either beta/slow, IIa, or IIx MHC mRNA, and two populations of hybrid fibers coexpressing beta/slow with IIa or IIa with IIx MHC mRNA.

The MyHC IIa E706K mutation is associated with congenital joint contractures, early-onset muscle weakness, and progressive course with moderate to severe muscle weakness later in life. To study the pathogenicity of this MyHC mutation, we investigated the effect of the corresponding mutation (E710K) in the major MyHC isoform (MyHC B) of the body wall muscle of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms with null mutations in the MyHC B gene (unc-54) are severely paralyzed and depleted of thick filaments in the body wall muscle sarcomeres. unc-54 null mutants with extrachromosomal arrays of a gene construct including the entire wild-type unc-54 gene were partially rescued as determined by a motility assay and by morphological analysis of the body wall muscle. Analysis of unc-54 null mutants with extrachromosomal arrays of the unc-54 gene with the E710K mutation were severely paralyzed but showed formation of thick filaments in the body wall muscle. We conclude that the MyHC E706K (E710K in C. elegans) mutation is pathogenic and that the effect is primarily functional rather than structural because thick filaments are formed. The C. elegans model may be useful to study suspected pathogenic mutations in MyHC genes associated with human muscle diseases.","dc:creator":"Tajsharghi H","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"A Caenorhabditis elegans model of the myosin heavy chain IIa E706K [corrected] mutation."},"rdfs:label":"C. elegans unc-54 E710K (MYH2 E706K) model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score for this experimental evidence was reduced to 1 point (from a default score of 2 points) due to the severity of the phenotype observed in the worms and the high homology of unc-54 to multiple other human myosin genes, as well as the finding that overexpression of even normal MyHC B has a negative effect."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2.2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.7}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":8409,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":7.2,"subject":{"id":"cggv:516af52c-4ade-4bf1-a6a6-79ec97a313aa","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0011577","gene":"hgnc:7572","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*MYH2* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant proximal myopathy and ophthalmoplegia in 2000 (Martinsson et al., PMID: 11114175).
