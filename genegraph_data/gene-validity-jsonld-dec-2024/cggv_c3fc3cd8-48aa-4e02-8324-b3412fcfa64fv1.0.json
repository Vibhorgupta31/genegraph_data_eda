LBSL is an autosomal recessive disease, most often manifesting in early childhood. Affected individuals develop slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, spasticity and dorsal column dysfunction, sometimes with a mild cognitive deficit or decline. We performed linkage mapping with microsatellite markers in LBSL families and found a candidate region on chromosome 1, which we narrowed by means of shared haplotypes. Sequencing of genes in this candidate region uncovered mutations in DARS2, which encodes mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, in affected individuals from all 30 families. Enzyme activities of mutant proteins were decreased. We were surprised to find that activities of mitochondrial complexes from fibroblasts and lymphoblasts derived from affected individuals were normal, as determined by different assays.","dc:creator":"Scheper GC","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase deficiency causes leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3fc3cd8-48aa-4e02-8324-b3412fcfa64f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3fc3cd8-48aa-4e02-8324-b3412fcfa64f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:27e3bbee-6606-404d-befa-9970addbe7fa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43b90cf3-69d5-47e4-b481-aaf7d5e4403f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are key enzymes in the translation of the genetic information. In fact, they catalyze the specific attachment of each of the 20 amino acids (aa) to a cognate tRNA, through a two-step reaction, where they first activate the amino acid with ATP, forming an intermediate aminoacyl-adenylate, and then transfer the aminoacyl group to the 3'-end of its own tRNA. There are 19 mt-aaRSs, which are enoded by nuclear genes, imported into mitochondria, and their interaction with cognate tRNAs seems to be essential for their amount and stability.

For the 4 variants affecting nonconserved residues located in an otherwise conserved stretch (Arg58, Phe157, Val481, and Leu588 corresponding to yLys42, yAla136, yIle484, and yMet608, respectively), the yeast amino acid was replaced by the human wild-type mtAspRS amino acid to serve as humanized control. Subsequently, the variants were introduced at these amino acids and results obtained with these yeast strains were compared with their humanized controls. The yeast mutant alleles and the humanized controls were\nexpressed in a yeast strain deleted of MSD1 (Δmsd1) that failed to grow in medium containing oxidative carbon sources. The ability to grow in the presence of respiratory substrates (ethanol) at 28°C was first analyzed (data not shown). The humanized MSD1 alleles (msd1Lys42Arg, msd1Ile484Val, and msd1Met608Leu) rescued the absence of MSD1. By contrast, the oxidative growth of both the humanized\nmsd1Ala136Phe allele and the corresponding mutant msd1Phe136Ile was compromised and therefore not further assessed. The oxidative growth ability of the strains expressing the msd1Leu232Val, msd1Phe487Leu, msd1Arg157Cys, msd1Ser617Gly, and msd1Leu608Val variants was severely affected, whereas the msd1Ala244Val variant led to a mild reduction of growth (fig 4). The growth of the strains expressing msd1Arg42Gly, msd1Lys626Met, and msd1Val484Met was similar to that of wild type. However, incubation at 37°C revealed a severe growth defect for the msd1Val484Met strain, indicating that a change in this position affects mitochondrial function in yeast in a temperature sensitive manner. \n\"\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33977142","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is regarded a relatively mild leukodystrophy, diagnosed by characteristic long tract abnormalities on MRI and biallelic variants in ","dc:creator":"Stellingwerff MD","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"LBSL: Case Series and DARS2 Variant Analysis in Early Severe Forms With Unexpected Presentations."},"rdfs:label":"rescue of oxidative growth in yeast"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduced points as yeast is used as a model organism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:c3fc3cd8-48aa-4e02-8324-b3412fcfa64f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a4d96f41-6f97-430b-8fe5-b4bf52749f06_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a4d96f41-6f97-430b-8fe5-b4bf52749f06","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:f5aa26d9-98c9-4e1e-b281-633c8cd2cc02","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018122.5(DARS2):c.1273G>T (p.Glu425Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251682"}},{"id":"cggv:5b1ec8db-69d6-4e58-9a56-2926c2b8f292","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018122.5(DARS2):c.536G>A (p.Arg179His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251681"}}],"detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis followed by sequence analysis of all coding exons and flanking intron sequences of 16 genes.\n","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"Inclusion criteria: Signal abnormalities in: the cerebral white matter, either in homogeneous and spotty or homogeneous and confluent, relatively sparing the U-fibers; the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts of the spinal cord; visualization of such abnormalities in the cervical spinal cord suffices; the pyramids of the medulla oblongata.

The *DARS2* gene encodes mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe *DARS2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2007 in 30 families (PMID: 17384640). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *DARS2*-related disease, most commonly “**l**eukoencephalopathy with **b**rainstem and **s**pinal cord involvement and **l**actate elevation” (LBSL), pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *DARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Affected individuals have been reported with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement, developmental delay, ataxia, muscle weakness/atrophy, tremor, and neuropathy. Almost all published cases have compound heterozygous variants, and 95% of the cases have one splice-site variant at the 3'-end of intron 2. This curation included 14 unique variants including four intronic, four stop-gained, three consensus splice site, and three missense variants from three publications (PMIDs: 17384640, 33977142, 21493805). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function either at the transcript or protein level. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration studies in HEK293 cells showing disrupted enzyme activity, and lack of rescue of oxidative growth by pathogenic missense variants in MDS1, the yeast (S. cerevisae) orthologue of DARS2, in yeast cells deleted for *MDS1* (PMIDs: 24639874, 33977142). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 4, 2022 (SOP Version 8).
