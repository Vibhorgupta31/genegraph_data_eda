At the very severe end of the NEM clinical spectrum are genetically unresolved cases of autosomal-recessive fetal akinesia sequence. We studied a multinational cohort of 143 severe-NEM-affected families lacking genetic diagnosis. We performed whole-exome sequencing of six families and targeted gene sequencing of additional families. We identified 19 mutations in KLHL40 (kelch-like family member 40) in 28 apparently unrelated NEM kindreds of various ethnicities. Accounting for up to 28% of the tested individuals in the Japanese cohort, KLHL40 mutations were found to be the most common cause of this severe form of NEM. Clinical features of affected individuals were severe and distinctive and included fetal akinesia or hypokinesia and contractures, fractures, respiratory failure, and swallowing difficulties at birth. Molecular modeling suggested that the missense substitutions would destabilize the protein. Protein studies showed that KLHL40 is a striated-muscle-specific protein that is absent in KLHL40-associated NEM skeletal muscle. In zebrafish, klhl40a and klhl40b expression is largely confined to the myotome and skeletal muscle, and knockdown of these isoforms results in disruption of muscle structure and loss of movement. We identified KLHL40 mutations as a frequent cause of severe autosomal-recessive NEM and showed that it plays a key role in muscle development and function. Screening of KLHL40 should be a priority in individuals who are affected by autosomal-recessive NEM and who present with prenatal symptoms and/or contractures and in all Japanese individuals with severe NEM.","dc:creator":"Ravenscroft G","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in KLHL40 are a frequent cause of severe autosomal-recessive nemaline myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"KLHL40 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"These qRT-PCR and immunoblotting experiments in both human and mouse are in agreement with the tissue enriched expression in skeletal muscle reported by HPA, GTEx, and FANTOM5."},{"id":"cggv:c3f1ef1b-a159-4a82-badc-a729523e8736","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:29436e45-8ff7-464b-bcbc-9a11a1b21190","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Using Y2H, TAP-tagging, and coimmunoprecipitation in COS7 cells authors found that KLHL40 binds to NEB.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24960163","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital myopathy that can result in lethal muscle dysfunction and is thought to be a disease of the sarcomere thin filament. Recently, several proteins of unknown function have been implicated in NM, but the mechanistic basis of their contribution to disease remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrated that loss of a muscle-specific protein, kelch-like family member 40 (KLHL40), results in a nemaline-like myopathy in mice that closely phenocopies muscle abnormalities observed in KLHL40-deficient patients. We determined that KLHL40 localizes to the sarcomere I band and A band and binds to nebulin (NEB), a protein frequently implicated in NM, as well as a putative thin filament protein, leiomodin 3 (LMOD3). KLHL40 belongs to the BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK) family of proteins, some of which have been shown to promote degradation of their substrates. In contrast, we found that KLHL40 promotes stability of NEB and LMOD3 and blocks LMOD3 ubiquitination. Accordingly, NEB and LMOD3 were reduced in skeletal muscle of both Klhl40-/- mice and KLHL40-deficient patients.

Exome sequencing was first-tier test.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:be22f213-c8a0-4ecf-81ef-d0b6c9b83d07_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:25a2db61-4a08-46a7-b0cb-0f780d116364","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152393.3(KLHL40):c.1153-2A>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/541330"}},{"id":"cggv:2cd3cf45-940e-481a-b943-a9f919834942","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152393.3(KLHL40):c.472_475del (p.Ala158ThrfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913203476"}}],"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28973083","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"While congenital malformations and genetic diseases are a leading cause of early infant death, to our knowledge, the contribution of single-gene disorders in this group is undetermined.","dc:creator":"Meng L","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Use of Exome Sequencing for Infants in Intensive Care Units: Ascertainment of Severe Single-Gene Disorders and Effect on Medical Management."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28973083","rdfs:label":"1011"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The frameshift variant, Ala158Thrfs results in a premature stop codon 40 residues downstream and is expected to result in NMD.

At least 26 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23746549, 26754003, 28973083, 27528495). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by its exclusive expression in skeletal muscle which is altered in patients, its biochemical function in stabilization of LMOD3 and protein interaction with NEB, as well as zebrafish and mouse models which recapitulate disruption of muscle structures and loss of movement, and a rescue of the mouse model with muscle-specific wild type KLHL40. In summary, KLHL40 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy 8. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dd1008a8-dd54-43d0-962c-82453975dc3a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
