We demonstrate that the SS18-SSX fusion protein competes for assembly with wild-type SS18, forming an altered complex lacking the tumor suppressor BAF47 (hSNF5). The altered complex binds the Sox2 locus and reverses polycomb-mediated repression, resulting in Sox2 activation. Sox2 is uniformly expressed in SS tumors and is essential for proliferation. Increasing the concentration of wild-type SS18 leads to reassembly of wild-type complexes retargeted away from the Sox2 locus, polycomb-mediated repression of Sox2, and cessation of proliferation. This mechanism of transformation depends on only two amino acids of SSX, providing a potential foundation for therapeutic intervention.","dc:creator":"Kadoch C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Reversible disruption of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes by the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion in synovial sarcoma."},"rdfs:label":"SMARCA4 and SMARCB1 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:94bc19ae-9a94-4b6d-b8ed-396417c9d0ef","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f15ac18c-c418-4a9e-8b2e-99fddec7690d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"SMARCA4, as well as some other SWI/SNF components, play important roles in stem cell pluripotency, differentiation and development, and it is therefore conceivable that, without the central catalytic subunit, proliferation would not be controlled and a tumour may result.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24658004","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare, highly aggressive form of ovarian cancer primarily diagnosed in young women.

We reappraised a case from 1991, published in 1993, describing the unique occurrence of an ovarian immature teratoma arising in a young woman and a clonally distinct intracerebral immature teratoma developing in her daughter. We conducted whole-exome sequencing on constitutional DNA from the mother and her daughter and identified a previously unreported nonsense mutation (c.3533G>A; p.Trp1178*) in the chromatin remodelling gene, SMARCA4, that was present in both individuals and was subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Tumour analysis by Sanger sequencing revealed a somatic SMARCA4 mutation in both the mother (c.2438+1G>T) and her daughter (c.3229C>T; p.Arg1077*), which are predicted to be truncating. As immature teratomas are classified as germ cell tumours, we performed a comprehensive mutation survey of 106 apparently sporadic germ cell tumours, but did not find any other clearly deleterious SMARCA4 mutations. Recently, inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 have been found in two cases of rhabdoid tumour predisposition syndrome type 2. In the light of these findings, renewed efforts to locate previously unobtainable tumour samples were successfully undertaken. Histopathological and immunohistochemical re-analysis of the daughter's tumour revealed that it was indeed a rhabdoid tumour (atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour). In this context, the original pathology report of the mother's ovarian tumour was re-interpreted as describing a malignant rhabdoid tumour of the ovary. This report raises the question as to whether molecular genetic analysis should be included in tumour classification, alongside more traditional microscopy-based methods. The use of new sequencing technologies, particularly when applied to archived samples, will lead to many more 'molecular rediagnoses'. This is the earliest known case of rhabdoid tumour predisposition syndrome type 2 and the first described case with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, only discovered through an exome sequencing project.","dc:creator":"Witkowski L","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Familial rhabdoid tumour 'avant la lettre'--from pathology review to exome sequencing and back again."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23775540","rdfs:label":"Mother"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"De novo and Nonsense-mediated decay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":524,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f1fc0c8a-90bc-4274-8187-ed756c2278a8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013224","gene":"hgnc:11100","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"There has been sufficient amount of evidence published associating the SMARCA4 gene with rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 2 (RTPS) since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Schneppenheim et al. (2010). Plenty of case level studies have been performed with RTPS patients that have variants in the SMARCA4 gene. SMARCB1, another subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, also cause RTPS. Tumor cells from patients lacked SMARCA4 immunoreactivity and depletion of SMARCA4 increase cell growth. Reintroduction of SMARCA4 in SMARCA4-null H1299 cells resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of cell growth. SMARCA4 heterozygote mice are predisposed to exencephaly and tumors. All of these evidences suggest a definitive relationship between the SMARCA4 gene and rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 2 (RTPS).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e5edb191-f515-47a3-b1d8-cc723eaef665"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
