In heterozygotes, RCs, predominantly the clear cell type, develop from early preneoplastic lesions, which began to appear as early as 3 weeks of age, to adenocarcinomas by the age of 6 months. The Nihon rat is an example of a Mendelian dominantly inherited predisposition for development of RCs like the Eker (Tsc2 gene mutant) rat. We have previously shown that the Nihon mutation was tightly linked to genes that are located on the distal part of rat chromosome 10. The order of the genes is the Eker (Tsc2 gene (human 16p13.3)-Il3 gene-Nihon gene-Llgl1 locus- Myhse gene. We now describe a germ-line mutation in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé gene (Bhd) (human 17p11.2) caused by the insertion of a single nucleotide in the Nihon rat, resulting in a frameshift and producing a stop codon 26 aa downstream. We found that the homozygous mutant condition was lethal at an early stage of fetal life in the rat. We detected a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in primary RCs (10/11) at the Bhd locus and found a point mutation (nonsense) in one LOH-negative case, fitting Knudson's \"two-hit\" model. The Nihon rat may therefore provide insights into a tumor-suppressor gene that is related to renal carcinogenesis and an animal model of human BHD syndrome.","dc:creator":"Okimoto K","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A germ-line insertion in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) gene gives rise to the Nihon rat model of inherited renal cancer."},"rdfs:label":"BHD gene in Nihon rat model of inherited renal cancer"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:34297a61-1994-40e8-8c2d-42b1fc9d2b39","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f8db0740-ac86-4362-8e20-e6ddb30daeb0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Flcn+/- mice display preneoplastic kidney lesions and tumors (Figure 1 and Table 2).

has been sufficient amount of evidence published associating the FLCN gene with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Nickerson et al. (2002). Plenty of case level studies have been performed with BHD patients that have variants in the FLCN gene. FCLN, which is expressed in skin, lung, and kidney, acts as a general tumor suppressor in human RCC cells in vivo. Knockdown of FLCN in ACHN cells led to the formation of significantly larger tumors and reintroduction of FLCN in 786-0 cells led to a strong decrease in tumor growth. Flcn+/- mice display preneoplastic kidney lesions and tumors and a Nihon rat model of inherited renal cancer with an intragenic Flcn mutation was also established. All of these evidences suggest a definitive relationship between the FLCN gene and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD).\nThe segregation score should be 1.5 for candidate gene sequencing, but it doesn't change the total score.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c96620e8-f9c9-41a0-a979-31fb9928abb6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
