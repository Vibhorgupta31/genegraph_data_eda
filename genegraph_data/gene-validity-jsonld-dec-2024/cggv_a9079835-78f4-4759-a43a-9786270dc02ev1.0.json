Mutations in CLN6 were recently identified in recessive Kufs disease presenting as progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Type A), whereas the molecular basis of cases presenting with dementia and motor features (Type B) is unknown. We performed genome-wide linkage mapping of two families with recessive Type B Kufs disease and identified a single region on chromosome 11 to which both families showed linkage. Exome sequencing of five samples from the two families identified homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in CTSF within this linkage region. We subsequently sequenced CTSF in 22 unrelated individuals with suspected recessive Kufs disease, and identified an additional patient with compound heterozygous mutations. CTSF encodes cathepsin F, a lysosomal cysteine protease, dysfunction of which is a highly plausible candidate mechanism for a storage disorder like ceroid lipofuscinosis. In silico modeling suggested the missense mutations would alter protein structure and function. Moreover, re-examination of a previously published mouse knockout of Ctsf shows that it recapitulates the light and electron-microscopic pathological features of Kufs disease. Although CTSF mutations account for a minority of cases of type B Kufs, CTSF screening should be considered in cases with early-onset dementia and may avoid the need for invasive biopsies.","dc:creator":"Smith KR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Cathepsin F mutations cause Type B Kufs disease, an adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9079835-78f4-4759-a43a-9786270dc02e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb57df57-6e1b-457c-bd51-37b29cf2c265_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb57df57-6e1b-457c-bd51-37b29cf2c265","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":33,"allele":{"id":"cggv:552fda99-fb13-47c2-9b0f-4b3380078433","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003793.4(CTSF):c.993_1004delinsAGTAGGCA (p.Ala332ValfsTer13)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573050955"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations.

To which extent genetic aberrations dictate clinical presentation remains elusive. We investigated the spectrum of genetic causes and assessed the genotype-driven differences in biomarker profiles, disease severity and clinical manifestation by recruiting 509 FTD patients from different centers of the German FTLD consortium where individuals were clinically assessed including biomarker analysis. Exome sequencing as well as C9orf72 repeat analysis were performed in all patients. These genetic analyses resulted in a diagnostic yield of 18.1%. Pathogenic variants in C9orf72 (n = 47), GRN (n = 26), MAPT (n = 11), TBK1 (n = 5), FUS (n = 1), TARDBP (n = 1), and CTSF (n = 1) were identified across all clinical subtypes of FTD. TBK1-associated FTD was frequent accounting for 5.4% of solved cases. Detection of a homozygous missense variant verified CTSF as an FTD gene. ABCA7 was identified as a candidate gene for monogenic FTD. The distribution of APOE alleles did not differ significantly between FTD patients and the average population. Male sex was weakly associated with clinical manifestation of the behavioral variant of FTD. Age of onset was lowest in MAPT patients. Further, high CSF neurofilament light chain levels were found to be related to GRN-associated FTD. Our study provides large-scale retrospective clinico-genetic data such as on disease manifestation and progression of FTD. These data will be relevant for counseling patients and their families.","dc:creator":"Wagner M","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Clinico-genetic findings in 509 frontotemporal dementia patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:c40512af-b0e2-4923-a7d7-ef61c148c0fb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c40512af-b0e2-4923-a7d7-ef61c148c0fb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:a9079835-78f4-4759-a43a-9786270dc02e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9079835-78f4-4759-a43a-9786270dc02e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00dc1602-2667-4fc9-a82b-138412f95889","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:480f9a5f-c1ea-4843-968b-eaba7cef749e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Ctsf KO mice generated by homologous recombination developed neurological disease at 12-16 months.

Biallelic pathogenic variants in *CTSF* cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, type 13 (NCL13) or Kufs disease type B, an adult-onset form of NCL without reported retinal disease.  Kufs disease type B is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, tremor, ataxia, myoclonus, rigidity, perioral dyskinesias, dysarthria, seizures, hyperreflexia, and behavior changes.  Affected individuals may be diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.  Onset of symptoms in reported individuals ranges from the third to sixth decade and affected individuals demonstrate cerebral and cerebellar atrophy on MRI and the characteristic autofluorescent storage bodies in a variety of cell types.  *CTSF* encodes for cathepsin F, a lysosomal cysteine protease, and the disease mechanism is loss of function. Fifteen different disease-causing variants have been reported in families in the literature, in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state.  The pathogenic variant spectrum includes nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site, missense variants, and a multi-exonic deletion (Smith et al, PMID 23297359; Di Fabio et al, PMID 25274848; Bras et al, PMID 27524508; van der Zee et al, PMID 27668283; Blauwendraat et al, PMID 28749476; Wang et al, PMID 29120254; Kulkarni et al, PMID 33578366; Wagner et al, PMID 34561610; Gultekin et al, PMID 35139754).  A number of the reported families demonstrate complete co-segregation of the *CTSF* variants with disease, and one family from a small isolated Italian community demonstrates pseudo-dominant inheritance (Smith et al, PMID 23297359; van der Zee et al, PMID 27668283; Di Fabio et al, PMID 25274848).  Supporting experimental evidence includes a non-human model organism; a Ctsf deficient mouse model that developed neurological disease comparable to the human phenotype and an accumulation of autofluorescent granules in brain tissue (Tang et al, 16508006; Smith et al, PMID 23297359).\n\nCase level genetic evidence provides a score of 12 points and experimental evidence provides a score of 2 points, resulting in a total score of 14 points.  Evidence supporting an association between *CTSF* and NCL has been replicated over time; therefore, the gene-disease validity has been classified as DEFINITIVE.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on March 1, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a9079835-78f4-4759-a43a-9786270dc02e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
