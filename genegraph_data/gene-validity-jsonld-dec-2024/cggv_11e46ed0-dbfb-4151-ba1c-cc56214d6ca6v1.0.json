Using exome sequencing, we identified 38 heterozygous TCF12 mutations in 347 samples from unrelated individuals with craniosynostosis. The mutations predominantly occurred in individuals with coronal synostosis and accounted for 32% and 10% of subjects with bilateral and unilateral pathology, respectively. TCF12 encodes one of three class I E proteins that heterodimerize with class II bHLH proteins such as TWIST1. We show that TCF12 and TWIST1 act synergistically in a transactivation assay and that mice doubly heterozygous for loss-of-function mutations in Tcf12 and Twist1 have severe coronal synostosis.

Clinical assignment is a difficult challenge due to the high phenotypic variability observed between syndromes. During routine diagnostics, we screened 182 Spanish craniosynostosis probands, implementing a four-tiered cascade screening of FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR1, TWIST1 and EFNB1. A total of 43 variants, eight novel, were identified in 113 (62%) patients: 104 (92%) detected in level 1; eight (7%) in level 2 and one (1%) in level 3. We subsequently screened additional genes in the probands with no detected mutation: one duplication of the IHH regulatory region was identified in a patient with craniosynostosis Philadelphia type and five variants, four novel, were identified in the recently described TCF12, in probands with coronal or multisuture affectation. In the 19 Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) individuals in whom a variant was detected, 15 (79%) carried a TWIST1 variant, whereas four (21%) had a TCF12 variant. Thus, we propose that TCF12 screening should be included for TWIST1 negative SCS patients and in patients where the coronal suture is affected. In summary, a molecular diagnosis was obtained in a total of 119/182 patients (65%), allowing the correct craniosynostosis syndrome classification, aiding genetic counselling and in some cases provided a better planning on how and when surgical intervention should take place and, subsequently the appropriate clinical follow up.

Here, we report 13 families (12 autosomal dominant and one autosomal recessive) with an anosmic form of IGD (Kallmann syndrome) with loss-of-function mutations in TCF12, a locus also known to cause syndromic and non-syndromic craniosynostosis. We show that loss of tcf12 in zebrafish larvae perturbs GnRH neuronal patterning with concomitant attenuation of the orthologous expression of tcf3a/b, encoding a binding partner of TCF12, and stub1, a gene that is both mutated in other syndromic forms of IGD and maps to a TCF12 affinity network. Finally, we report that restored STUB1 mRNA rescues loss of tcf12 in vivo.

The bHLH factor TWIST1 plays pleiotropic roles during development. However, which combinations of TWIST1 dimers are involved and what impact each dimer imposes on the gene regulation network controlled by TWIST1 remain elusive. In this work, proteomic profiling of human TWIST1-expressing cell lines and transcriptome analysis of mouse cranial mesenchyme have revealed that TWIST1 homodimers and heterodimers with TCF3, TCF4, and TCF12 E-proteins are the predominant dimer combinations. Disease-causing mutations in TWIST1 can impact dimer formation or shift the balance of different types of TWIST1 dimers in the cell, which may underpin the defective differentiation of the craniofacial mesenchyme. Functional analyses of the loss and gain of TWIST1-E-protein dimer activity have revealed previously unappreciated roles in guiding lineage differentiation of embryonic stem cells: TWIST1-E-protein heterodimers activate the differentiation of mesoderm and neural crest cells, which is accompanied by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. At the same time, TWIST1 homodimers maintain the stem cells in a progenitor state and block entry to the endoderm lineage.","dc:creator":"Fan X","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"TWIST1 Homodimers and Heterodimers Orchestrate Lineage-Specific Differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Co-Immunoprecipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded because shown in two different cell lines"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:11e46ed0-dbfb-4151-ba1c-cc56214d6ca6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca9997b7-b9d6-4348-bea1-933ab26ee839","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb147c2b-f9b7-4e59-a4bf-7ae48f1df9c6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both zebrafish and humans experience coronal synostosis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30375332","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9241381b-fabf-4d64-b458-6e283ee871d0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7491fb86-8e5e-4097-ad65-35630af9a2a2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both humans and mice develop coronal craniosynostosis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354436","rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2493,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:dcd9aec2-cff2-4b7e-8f22-99130a352dcf","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014128","gene":"hgnc:11623","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"TCF12 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant TCF12-related craniosynostosis in 2013 (Sharma et al., PMID: 23354436). TCF12-related craniosynostosis most often involve the fusion of coronal sutures and individuals can present with other syndromic features including dental malocclusion, blepharoptosis, dysmorphic appearance of the face and external ears, and minor limb anomalies (PMID: 23354436). Eleven variants (frameshift, nonsense, splice) that have been reported in 11 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23354436, 25271085, 24736737, 30858722) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be haploinsufficiency (heterozygous loss of function). This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interaction with TWIST1 (PMIDs: 23354436, 30375332, 32179550). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between TCF12 and autosomal dominant TCF12-related craniosynostosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
