One autosomal dominant (LGMD1A, at chromosome 5q22.3-31.3) (ref. 3) and five autosomal recessive (AR) loci responsible for this phenotype have been identified: LGMD2A at 15q (ref. 4); LGMD2B at 2p (ref. 5), LGMD2C at 13q (ref. 6), LGMD2D at 17q (ref. 7) and LGMD2E at 4q (refs 8,9). In the muscle membrane, dystrophin associates with several proteins and glycoproteins organized in two main subcomplexes: the dystroglycan (DG) and sarcoglycan (SG) complexes. The genes for LGMD2C, LGMD2D and LGMD2E code for proteins of the SG complex. We recently mapped a sixth AR form of LGMD, LGMD2F, to chromosome 5q33-34 in two Brazilian families. In the same chromosomal interval we also mapped the delta SG gene, encoding a novel 35-kD component of the sarcoglycan (SG) complex. We now show that a homozygous mutation in the delta SG gene (a single nucleotide deletion that alters its reading frame) is the cause of LGMD2F.","dc:creator":"Nigro V","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, LGMD2F, is caused by a mutation in the delta-sarcoglycan gene."}},"rdfs:label":"33V-1"},{"id":"cggv:0e8e67c7-4ab8-4a2a-bd6d-bbcc4c1227bd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e8e67c7-4ab8-4a2a-bd6d-bbcc4c1227bd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Since this is not the first homozygote of a known founder variant, this proband is not counted."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c9918d52-4f35-414d-88d3-4c3b883922bc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c9918d52-4f35-414d-88d3-4c3b883922bc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3faf6d1e-27ed-4311-99f1-05f471943219","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000337.5(SGCD):c.89G>A (p.Trp30Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340750"}},"detectionMethod":"The complete coding sequence of δ-sarcoglycan was analyzed via total RNA from patient muscle biopsies. cDNA was synthesized and amplified using PCR and SSCP analysis was used to detect abberant products.

Deficiency of dystrophin causes the most common types of muscular dystrophy, Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. Muscular dystrophy patients showing normal dystrophin protein and gene analysis are generally isolated cases with a presumed autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy). Recently, linkage and candidate gene analyses have shown that some cases of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can be caused by deficiency of other components of the dystrophin membrane cytoskeleton. The most recently identified component, delta-sarcoglycan, has been found to show mutations in a series of Brazilian muscular dystrophy patients. All patients were homozygous for a protein-truncating carboxy-terminal mutation, and showed a deficiency of the four sarcoglycan proteins. To determine if delta-sarcoglycan deficiency occurred in other world populations, to identify the range of mutations and clinical phenotypes, and to test for the biochemical consequences of delta-sarcoglycan gene mutations, we studied Duchenne-like and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients who we had previously shown not to exhibit gene mutations of dystrophin, alpha-, beta-, or gamma-sarcoglycan for delta-sarcoglycan mutations (n = 54). We identified two American patients with novel nonsense mutations of delta-sarcoglycan (W30X, R165X). One was apparently homozygous, and we show likely consanguinity through homozygosity for 13 microsatellite loci covering a 38 cM region of chromosome 5. The second was heterozygous. Both were girls who showed clinical symptoms consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in males. Our data shows that delta-sarcoglycan deficiency occurs in other world populations, and that most or all patients show a deficiency of the entire sarcoglycan complex, adding support to the hypothesis that these proteins function as a tetrameric unit.","dc:creator":"Duggan DJ","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutations in the delta-sarcoglycan gene are a rare cause of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2)."}},"rdfs:label":"44"},{"id":"cggv:f1b31ecb-8938-4bc6-93a8-ef7beff36c78","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1b31ecb-8938-4bc6-93a8-ef7beff36c78_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Since there is no confirmed second pathogenic variant in SCGD for this autosomal recessive disease entity, this proband cannot be counted."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1ad12a23-af71-4b3b-8a79-831b4d338c97_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:7143b0c8-02e6-4d4d-813b-ef4b64284ace_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7143b0c8-02e6-4d4d-813b-ef4b64284ace","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":{"id":"cggv:56c23120-b020-4be0-8bd7-d113851a7cad"},"detectionMethod":"In PMID:8776597, linkage analysis was performed starting with a genome-wide search of 310 markers.

DNA sequencing of all candidate genes can be expensive and laborious, whereas a selective sequencing approach often fails to provide a molecular diagnosis. We aimed to efficiently identify pathogenic mutations via homozygosity mapping in a population in which the genetics of LGMD2 has not been well characterized. Thirteen consanguineous families containing a proband with LGMD2 were recruited from Saudi Arabia, and for 11 of these families, selected individuals were genotyped at 10,204 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Linkage analysis excluded all but one or two known genes in ten of 11 genotyped families, and haplotype comparisons between families allowed further reduction in the number of candidate genes that were screened. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing in all 13 families, including five novel mutations in four genes, by sequencing at most two genes per family. One family was reclassified as having a different myopathy based on genetic and clinical data after linkage analysis excluded all known LGMD2 genes. LGMD2 subtypes A and B were notably absent from our sample of patients, indicating that the distribution of LGMD2 mutations in Saudi Arabian families may be different than in other populations. Our data demonstrate that homozygosity mapping in consanguineous pedigrees offers a more efficient means of discovering mutations that cause heterogeneous disorders than comprehensive sequencing of known candidate genes.","dc:creator":"Boyden SE","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Efficient identification of novel mutations in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"1190-1"},{"id":"cggv:4865ac19-7cdf-4578-8e31-6c28b22016ac","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4865ac19-7cdf-4578-8e31-6c28b22016ac_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"NMD expected, downgraded for homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5c03cc22-5796-4da6-bfbe-c4e55880bd29_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c03cc22-5796-4da6-bfbe-c4e55880bd29","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ef9a7627-75e8-4496-bd6c-10db07b2a6c9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000337.6(SGCD):c.784G>A (p.Glu262Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340753"}},"detectionMethod":"Twenty five unrelated LGMD families were tested to identify LGMD2F patients.

To-date, thirty-one loci have been identified for LGMD including seven autosomal dominant (LGMD type 1) and twenty four autosomal recessive (LGMD type 2) inherited loci. Methodology/Laboratory Examination: The present report describes a consanguineous family segregating LGMD2F in an autosomal recessive pattern. The affected individual is an 11-year-old boy having two brothers and a sister. Direct targeted next generation sequencing was performed for the single affected individual (VI-1) followed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Targeted next generation sequencing revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation (c.289C>T; p.Arg97∗) in the exon 3 of the delta-sarcoglycan (SGCD) gene, that introduces a premature stop codon (TCA), resulting in a nonsense mediated decay or a truncated protein product. Discussion and Conclusion: This is the first report of LGMD2F caused by an SGCD variant in a Pakistani population. The mutation identified in the present investigation extends the body of evidence implicating the gene SGCD in causing LGMD2F and might help in genetic counseling, which is more important to deliver the risk of carrier or affected in the future pregnancies.","dc:creator":"Younus M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"SGCD Homozygous Nonsense Mutation (p.Arg97∗) Causing Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2F (LGMD2F) in a Consanguineous Family, a Case Report."}},"rdfs:label":"IV-1"},{"id":"cggv:515c30c7-c5fa-4d3e-abd5-5e753ae7b936","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:515c30c7-c5fa-4d3e-abd5-5e753ae7b936_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"NMD expected, downgraded for homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:72049de5-a52c-4018-8d40-ba17d79a94a2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72049de5-a52c-4018-8d40-ba17d79a94a2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":{"id":"cggv:39fd4c63-9072-4cd2-82bc-5807398e6184","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000337.5(SGCD):c.391G>C (p.Ala131Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340756"}},"detectionMethod":"DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples.

Here we report that mice lacking (delta)-sarcoglycan developed muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy similar to mice lacking (gamma)-sarcoglycan. However, unlike muscle lacking (gamma)-sarcoglycan, (delta)-sarcoglycan-deficient muscle was sensitive to eccentric contraction-induced disruption of the plasma membrane.

In contrast, without (gamma)-sarcoglycan, reduced levels of (alpha)-, (beta)- and (delta)-sarcoglycan were expressed, glycosylated and formed a complex with each other. Thus, the elimination of (gamma)- and (delta)-sarcoglycan had different molecular consequences for the assembly and function of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

Within this complex resides the sarcoglycan subcomplex, which consists of four transmembrane glycoproteins (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan). During assembly, beta-sarcoglycan tightly associates with delta-sarcoglycan to form a functional core that then recruits gamma- and alpha-sarcoglycan to form the sarcoglycan complex. Together with sarcospan, the sarcoglycan complex binds other components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex and integrates into the myofibre's membrane. Once integrated, the sarcoglycan complex plays a pivotal role in mechanically stabilising the sarcolemma as well as the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. Additionally, the sarcoglycan complex undergoes chemical modifications in response to muscle contractions, thereby transducing mechanical information into a cellular signal. Mutations in the sarcoglycans induce limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and several animal models have been established to study the molecular biology and function of the sarcoglycan complex. This review discusses the role of the sarcoglycan complex in skeletal muscle and describes the functional deficiencies that lead to muscular dystrophies.

In the >60% group rescue of the dystrophic phenotype, including fibrosis, fiber-size dispoportion, and nucleation, was observed in all but the diaphram muscle which still showed a minor amount of recovery. The cardiac muscle was also rescued for fibrosis, mononuclear invasion, and decreased ejection fraction in the >60% group. Immunostaining for SGβ, SGα, and SGδ in the KO mice consistently returned absent, however in the >60% mice the staining returned positive for all three sarcoglycans and the sarcoglycan complex was demonstrated to be returned to nearly WT levles in the skeletal muscle but not all of the cardiac muscle.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328522","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-2F (LGMD-2F) is an incurable degenerative muscle disorder caused by a mutation in the sarcoglycan-δ (SGδ)-encoding gene (SGCD in humans). The lack of SGδ results in the complete disruption of the sarcoglycan complex (SGC) in the skeletal and cardiac muscle within the larger dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). The long-term consequences of SG ablation on other members of the DGC are currently unknown. We produced mosaic mice through the injection of wild-type (WT) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into SGδ-knockout (KO) blastocysts. ESC-derived SGδ was supplied to the sarcolemma of 18-month-old chimeric muscle, which resulted in the restoration of the SGC. Despite SGC rescue, and contrary to previous observations obtained with WT/mdx chimeras (a mouse rescue paradigm for Duchenne muscular dystrophy), low levels of ESC incorporation were insufficient to produce histological corrections in SGδ-KO skeletal muscle or heart. The inefficient process of ESC rescue was more evident in the SGδ-KO diaphragm, which had reduced levels of dystrophin and no compensatory utrophin, and needed almost full WT ESC reconstitution for histological improvement. The results suggest that the SGδ-KO mouse model of LGMD is not amenable to ESC treatment.","dc:creator":"Vitale JM","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Dystrophin-compromised sarcoglycan-δ-knockout diaphragm requires full wild-type embryonic stem cell reconstitution for correction."},"rdfs:label":"δ-sarcoglycan KO Mice Partially Rescued"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The incorporation of ESCs with wild-type SGCD rescued many of the presenting phenotypes of AR LGMD in mice.

The loss of δ-sarcoglycan in SGCD mutants is compounded by the complete loss of each other sarcoglycan in the presence of dystrophin in nearly every human case and in the model. Increased blue dye uptake into the muscles and orange dye uptake into the sarcolemma further support the pathogenic mechanism of the carcoglycan complex failing to form and destabilizing the sarcolemma, weakening the muscle and causing increased degeneration and regeneration.

At least eight variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least eleven probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 8841194, 19259135, 20623375, 10838250, 10735275, 9832045, 30733730). Variants in this gene segregated with the disease in eight additional family members and many other heterozygous carriers. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is protein loss of function, with the loss or disruption of δ-sarcoglycan causing disruption and mislocalization of the sarcoglycan complex which causes destabilization of the sarcolemma and the resulting muscular phenotypes (PMID: 26709803). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy which has been assessed separately.This gene-disease association is supported by two KO mouse models, expression studies, a partial mouse rescue, and intercellular protein interactions. The KO mouse models provide strong evidence by recapitulating the observed phenotypes in humans and a partial rescue in one was performed via restoring some of the wildtype SGCD functionality via embryonic stem cells. Expression evidence clearly links the protein to skeletal and cardiac muscle where phenotypes are observed. Finally, the protein physically interacts with all the other sarcoglycans which are all associated with AR LGMD when their function is affected.\nIn summary, SGCD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on April 10, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nThis gene curation was re-approved and published on 11/14/24 by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP to reflect the change in the panel's name from LGMD GCEP to MDM GCEP. As part of this process, the genetic evidence was re-scored in accordance with SOP version 11.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1ad12a23-af71-4b3b-8a79-831b4d338c97"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
