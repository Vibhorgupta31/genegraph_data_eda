The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases.

The locus encodes three cell cycle inhibitory proteins: p15INK4b encoded by CDKN2b, p16INK4a encoded by CDKN2a and p14ARF (p19Arf in mice) encoded by an alternative reading frame of CDKN2a (ref. 1). Whereas the tumour suppressor functions for p16INK4a and p14ARF have been firmly established, the role of p15INK4b remains ambiguous. However, many 9p21 deletions also remove CDKN2b, so we hypothesized a synergistic effect of the combined deficiency for p15INK4b, p14ARF and p16INK4a. Here we report that mice deficient for all three open reading frames (Cdkn2ab-/-) are more tumour-prone and develop a wider spectrum of tumours than Cdkn2a mutant mice, with a preponderance of skin tumours and soft tissue sarcomas (for example, mesothelioma) frequently composed of mixed cell types and often showing biphasic differentiation. Cdkn2ab-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are substantially more sensitive to oncogenic transformation than Cdkn2a mutant MEFs. Under conditions of stress, p15Ink4b protein levels are significantly elevated in MEFs deficient for p16Ink4a. Our data indicate that p15Ink4b can fulfil a critical backup function for p16Ink4a and provide an explanation for the frequent loss of the complete CDKN2b-CDKN2a locus in human tumours.","dc:creator":"Krimpenfort P","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"p15Ink4b is a critical tumour suppressor in the absence of p16Ink4a."},"rdfs:label":"Cdkn2ab-null MEFs are sensitive to oncogenic transformation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:5e84ca48-87ff-4f9e-a246-e9e6a49afecf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:391d6aa2-9a8c-4f78-9ab5-7cfe2c6a335a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Within seven months, all Cdkn2ab-/- animals develop one or more tumours (Fig. 1b).

However, because CDKN2A encodes two distinct cell cycle inhibitory proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF (p19Arf in mice), the mechanism of tumour suppression by CDKN2A has remained controversial. Genetic disruption of Cdkn2a(p19Arf) (hereafter Arf) alone predisposes mice to tumorigenesis, demonstrating that Arf is a tumour-suppressor gene in mice. We mutated mice specifically in Cdkn2a(p16Ink4a) (hereafter Ink4a). Here we demonstrate that these mice, designated Ink4a*/*, do not show a significant predisposition to spontaneous tumour formation within 17 months. Embryo fibroblasts derived from them proliferate normally, are mortal, and are not transformed by oncogenic HRAS. The very mild phenotype of the Ink4a*/* mice implies that the very strong phenotypes of the original Ink4a/ArfDelta2,3 mice were primarily or solely due to loss of Arf. However, Ink4a*/Delta2,3 mice that are deficient for Ink4a and heterozygous for Arf spontaneously develop a wide spectrum of tumours, including melanoma. Treatment of these mice with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) results in an increased incidence of melanoma, with frequent metastases. Our results show that, in the mouse, Ink4a is a tumour-suppressor gene that, when lost, can recapitulate the tumour predisposition seen in humans.","dc:creator":"Krimpenfort P","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Loss of p16Ink4a confers susceptibility to metastatic melanoma in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Loss of p16Ink4a confers metastatic melanoma in mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":43,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:1b2c362b-7ebb-47bb-9319-e0362c00fed4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0011713","gene":"hgnc:1787","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"There is abundant evidence published associating the CDKN2A gene with melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Hussussian et al. (1994). Multiple case level studies have been performed with melanoma patients that have variants in the CDKN2A gene. Over 200 families has been reported worldwide and many variants are founder variants. The CDKN2A gene produces two different proteins p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) by alternative splicing. Both proteins function as inhibitors of cell cycle progression, but regulate cell cycle through the TP53 pathway and the RB1 pathway respectively. CDKN2A germline mutations that result in the disruption of one of each transcripts or both have all been reported in patients with melanoma. But the spectrum of disease is slightly different in patients' phenotypes and in the mouse models. The patients with disruption of p14 also can have nerve sheath tumors, which has been reported in a few studies. CDK4 that is inhibited by p16 is also associate with Melanoma, cutaneous malignant. Assessment of CDK4 binding and p16 subcellular localization can accurately and rapidly determine the functional significance of melanoma associated p16INK4a mutations. Multiple in vivo knock-out mouse models with CDKN2A deficiency have been established to show tumorigenesis of melanoma and other types of tumors. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the CDKN2A gene and melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0c0d2fc0-12b2-4855-b537-60394d0987dd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
