Integration of calcium and DAG signals has been suggested to occur primarily through protein kinase C family members, which bind both calcium and DAG. However, an alternative pathway may involve members of the CalDAG-GEF/RasGRP protein family, which have structural features (calcium-binding EF hands and DAG-binding C1 domains) that suggest they can function in calcium and DAG signal integration. To gain insight into the signaling systems that may be regulated by CalDAG-GEF/RasGRP family members, we have focused on CalDAG-GEFI, which is expressed preferentially in the brain and blood. Through genetic ablation in the mouse, we have found that CalDAG-GEFI is crucial for signal integration in platelets. Mouse platelets that lack CalDAG-GEFI are severely compromised in integrin-dependent aggregation as a consequence of their inability to signal through CalDAG-GEFI to its target, the small GTPase Rap1.

Rap proteins, members of the Ras small G protein superfamily, can inhibit Ras signaling through the Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway or, through B-Raf, can activate MAP kinase. Rap and Ras proteins both can be activated through guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Many Ras GEFs, but to date only one Rap GEF, have been identified. We now report the cloning of a brain-enriched gene, CalDAG-GEFI, which has substrate specificity for Rap1A, dual binding domains for calcium (Ca2+) and diacylglycerol (DAG), and enriched expression in brain basal ganglia pathways and their axon-terminal regions. Expression of CalDAG-GEFI activates Rap1A and inhibits Ras-dependent activation of the Erk/MAP kinase cascade in 293T cells. Ca2+ ionophore and phorbol ester strongly and additively enhance this Rap1A activation. By contrast, CalDAG-GEFII, a second CalDAG-GEF family member that we cloned and found identical to RasGRP [Ebinu, J. O., Bottorff, D. A., Chan, E. Y. W., Stang, S. L., Dunn, R. J. & Stone, J. C.

We propose that CalDAG-GEF proteins have a critical neuronal function in determining the relative activation of Ras and Rap1 signaling induced by Ca2+ and DAG mobilization.

We here report two new RASGRP2 variants associated with platelet dysfunction and bleeding in patients. The homozygous patients had normal platelet and neutrophil counts and morphology. Platelet phenotyping showed: prolonged PFA-100 closure times; normal expression of major glycoprotein receptors; severely reduced platelet aggregation response to ADP and collagen (both patients); aggregation response to PAR1 and arachidonic acid markedly impaired in one patient; PMA-induced aggregation unaffected; platelet secretion, clot retraction, and spreading minimally affected. Genetic analysis identified two new homozygous variants in RASGRP2: c.706C>T (p.Q236X) and c.887G>A (p.C296Y). In both patients, CalDAG-GEFI protein was not detectable in platelet lysates, and platelet αIIbβ3 activation, as assessed by fibrinogen binding, was greatly impaired in response to all agonists except PMA. Patient neutrophils showed normal integrin expression, but impaired Mn2+-induced fibrinogen binding.

At least 20 unique variants (including mostly missense, as well as nonsense, and a few splicing and frameshift variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 24958846, 27235135, 28637664, 27663674, 28762304). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by the protein function in integrin activation, functional alteration and rescue in patient cells, and mouse models (including a knockout mouse and a humanized knock-in partial rescue). In summary, RASGRP2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive platelet-type bleeding disorder 18. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Of note, this gene was previously implicated to be associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-3 (LAD3) (PMID:17576779), however it was later shown (PMIDs:19064721, 19234463, and 19234460) to not be the case and LAD3 is associated with defects in the FERMT3 gene.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f4401e99-145a-4b93-aa73-6854b8037895"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
