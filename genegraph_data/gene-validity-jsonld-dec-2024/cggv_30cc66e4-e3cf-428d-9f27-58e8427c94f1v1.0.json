Vertebrate cohesin consists of Smc1, Smc3, Rad21/Scc1 and either stromal antigen 1 (SA1) or SA2. To explore the functional specificity of these two versions of cohesin and their relevance for embryonic development and cancer, we generated a mouse model deficient for SA1. Complete ablation of SA1 results in embryonic lethality, while heterozygous animals have shorter lifespan and earlier onset of tumourigenesis. SA1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts show decreased proliferation and increased aneuploidy as a result of chromosome segregation defects. These defects are not caused by impaired centromeric cohesion, which depends on cohesin-SA2. Instead, they arise from defective telomere replication, which requires cohesion mediated specifically by cohesin-SA1. We propose a novel mechanism for aneuploidy generation that involves impaired telomere replication upon loss of cohesin-SA1, with clear implications in tumourigenesis.","dc:creator":"Remeseiro S","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Cohesin-SA1 deficiency drives aneuploidy and tumourigenesis in mice due to impaired replication of telomeres."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgraded for lack of overlap with human phenotype.

Phenotypes reported with *STAG1* variants most frequently include intellectual disability, autism, seizures, hypotonia, hyperlaxity, and dysmorphic features. Considering the additional features that present with intellectual disability, variants in this gene have been curated for disease assertion “complex neurodevelopmental disorder”. \n\nFourteen variants (missense and frameshift) in 14 probands, reported in three publications (PMIDs: 30158690, 34440290, 28119487) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is believed to be haploinsufficiency (PMID: 28119487). No experimental evidence currently supports this gene-disease relationship. While one knockout mouse model has been reported, it was not scored as evidence due to insufficient face validity regarding the human phenotype (PMID: 22415365). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *STAG1* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on September 20, 2022 (SOP 9). \n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:30cc66e4-e3cf-428d-9f27-58e8427c94f1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
