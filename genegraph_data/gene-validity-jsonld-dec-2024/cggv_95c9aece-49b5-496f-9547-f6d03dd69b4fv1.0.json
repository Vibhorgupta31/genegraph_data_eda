Two of the patients were of European and Chinese origin; the third was from consanguineous Turkish parents. CACT activity was totally deficient in cultured skin fibroblasts from all three patients. Patient 1 was heterozygous for a paternal frameshift mutation (120 del T in exon 1) and a maternal lariat branch point mutation (-10 T --> G in intron 2). Patient 2 was heterozygous for the same lariat branch point (-10T --> G intron 2) mutation, derived from the father, and a maternal frameshift mutation (362 del G in exon 3). Patient 3 was homozygous for a frameshift mutation (306 del C in exon 3). All of the three frameshift mutations give rise to the same stop codon at amino acid residue 127 which is predicted to cause premature protein truncation. In addition, cDNA transcript analysis showed that these coding sequence mutations also increase the amount of aberrant mRNA splicing and exon skipping at distances up to 7.7 kb nucleotides from mutation sites. The data suggest that the stability of mRNA transcripts is decreased or the frequency of aberrant splicing is increased in the presence of CACT coding sequence mutations.

CACT deficiency is a life-threatening, recessively inherited disorder of lipid beta-oxidation which manifests in early infancy with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, liver failure, and muscle weakness. We report here the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of six CACT-deficient patients from Italy, Spain, and North America who exhibited significant clinical heterogeneity. In five patients (Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) the disease manifested in the neonatal period, while the remaining patient (Patient 3), the younger sibling of an infant who had died with clinical suspicion of fatty acid oxidation defect, has been treated since birth and was clinically asymptomatic at 4.5 years of age. Patients 1 and 4 were deceased within 6 months from the onset of this study, while the remaining four are still alive at 8, 4.5, 3.5, and 2 years, respectively. Sequence analysis of the CACT gene (SLC25A20) disclosed five novel mutations and three previously reported mutations. Three patients were homozygous for the identified mutations. Two of the novel mutations (c.718+1G>C and c.843+4_843+50del) altered the donor splice site of introns 7 and 8, respectively. The 47-nt deletion in intron 8 caused both skipping of exon 8 only and skipping of exons 6-8. Four mutations [[c.159dupT;c.163delA] ([p.Gly54Trp;p.Thr55Ala]) c.397C>T (p.Arg133Trp), c.691G>C (p.Asp231His), and c.842C>T (p.Ala281Val)] resulted in amino acid substitutions affecting evolutionarily conserved regions of the protein. Interestingly, one of these exonic mutations (p.Ala281Val) was associated with a splicing defect also characterized by skipping of exons 6-8. The deleterious effect of the p.Arg133Trp substitution was demonstrated by measuring CACT activity upon expression of the normal and the mutant protein in E. coli and functional reconstitution into liposomes. Combined analysis of clinical, biochemical, and molecular data failed to indicate a correlation between the phenotype and the genotype.","dc:creator":"Iacobazzi V","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Molecular and functional analysis of SLC25A20 mutations causing carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15365988","rdfs:label":"Patient 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"In variant CA658760378 G54W occurs in cis with T55A, both are nonconservative substitutions predicted to occur in the first intramitochondrial hydrophilic loop.

The disease usually presents at neonatal period with severe hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, cardiomyopathy and/or arrhythmia, hepatic dysfunction, skeletal muscle weakness, and encephalopathy. Definitive diagnosis of CACT deficiency by molecular analysis of the SLC25A20 gene has recently become clinically available. In contrast to biochemical analysis, sequence analysis is a more rapid and reliable method for diagnosis of CACT deficiency. In this study, we used Sanger sequencing and target array CGH to identify molecular defects in the SLC25A20 gene of patients with clinical features and an acylcarnitine profile consistent with CACT deficiency. Eight novel mutations, including a large 25.9 kb deletion encompassing exons 5 to 9 of SLC25A20 were found. Review of the published cases revealed that CACT deficiency is a pan-ethnic disorder with a broad mutation spectrum. Mutations are distributed along the entire gene without a hot spot. Two thirds of them are nonsense, frame-shift, or splice site mutations resulting in premature stop codons. This study underscores the importance of comprehensive molecular analysis, including sequencing and targeted array CGH of the SLC25A20 gene when CACT deficiency is suspected.","dc:creator":"Wang GL","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Expanded molecular features of carnitine acyl-carnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency by comprehensive molecular analysis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21605995","rdfs:label":"Patient-III"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The CA252625833 nonsense variant (R275X) is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon and the large deletion CA658761347 involves multiple exons and is considered deleterious."},{"id":"cggv:28db883a-9f31-43ca-bb13-75da241f11e9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6309553-e7fb-43e0-a5ad-aae7283c6db8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Prepared cDNA from fibroblast RNA and amplified the entire coding region.
