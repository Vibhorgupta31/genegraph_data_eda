In this study, we describe 11 asymptomatic non-Hmong patients brought to medical attention by elevated C5-carnitine found by newborn screening and one discovered because of clinical symptoms. The diagnosis of SBCAD deficiency was determined by metabolite analysis of blood, urine, and fibroblast samples. PCR and bidirectional sequencing were performed on genomic DNA from five of the patients covering the entire SBCAD (ACADSB) gene sequence of 11 exons. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA from each patient identified variations in the SBCAD gene not previously reported. Escherichia coli expression studies revealed that the missense mutations identified lead to inactivation or instability of the mutant SBCAD enzymes. These findings confirm that SBCAD deficiency can be identified through newborn screening by acylcarnitine analysis.

We investigated a patient with isolated 2-methylbutyrylglycinuria, suggestive of a defect in isoleucine catabolism. Enzyme assay of the patient's fibroblasts, using 2-methylbutyryl-CoA as substrate, confirmed the defect. Sequence analysis of candidate ACADs revealed heterozygosity for the common short-chain ACAD A625 variant allele and no mutations in ACAD-8 but a 100-bp deletion in short/branched-chain ACAD (SBCAD) cDNA from the patient. Our identification of the SBCAD gene structure (11 exons; >20 kb) enabled analysis of genomic DNA. This showed that the deletion was caused by skipping of exon 10, because of homozygosity for a 1228G-->A mutation in the patient. This mutation was not present in 118 control chromosomes. In vitro transcription/translation experiments and overexpression in COS cells confirmed the disease-causing nature of the mutant SBCAD protein and showed that ACAD-8 is an isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and that both wild-type proteins are imported into mitochondria and form tetramers.

Little is known about the clinical presentation associated with this enzyme defect, as it has been reported in only a limited number of patients. Because the presence of C5-carnitine in blood may indicate SBCADD, the disorder may be detected by MS/MS-based routine newborn screening. It is, therefore, important to gain more knowledge about the clinical presentation and the mutational spectrum of SBCADD. In the present study, we have studied two unrelated families with SBCADD, both with seizures and psychomotor delay as the main clinical features. One family illustrates the fact that affected individuals may also remain asymptomatic. In addition, the normal level of newborn blood spot C5-acylcarnitine in one patient underscores the fact that newborn screening by MS/MS currently lacks sensitivity in detecting SBCADD. Until now, seven mutations in the SBCAD gene have been reported, but only three have been tested experimentally. Here, we identify and characterize an IVS3+3A>G mutation (c.303+3A>G) in the SBCAD gene, and provide evidence that this mutation is disease-causing in both families. Using a minigene approach, we show that the IVS3+3A>G mutation causes exon 3 skipping, despite the fact that it does not appear to disrupt the consensus sequence of the 5' splice site. Based on these results and numerous literature examples, we suggest that this type of mutation (IVS+3A>G) induces missplicing only when in the context of non-consensus (weak) 5' splice sites. Statistical analysis of the sequences shows that the wild-type versions of 5' splice sites in which +3A>G mutations cause exon skipping and disease are weaker on average than a random set of 5' splice sites. This finding is relevant to the interpretation of the functional consequences of this type of mutation in other disease genes.","dc:creator":"Madsen PP","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency due to an IVS3+3A>G mutation that causes exon skipping."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16317551","rdfs:label":"Madsen Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Skipping of exon 3 confirmed by mRNA analysis and minigene assay.This leads to a shifted reading frame with a PTC and likely NMD (when mRNA from patient 2's fibroblasts, who is het. for the variant, was analyzed, they saw no product from the mutant allele).

Deficiencies of both enzymes may be detected by expanded neonatal screening with tandem-mass spectrometry due to elevated pentanoylcarnitine (C5 acylcarnitine) in blood, but little information is available on the clinical relevance of MBD deficiency. We biochemically and genetically characterize six individuals with MBD deficiency from four families of different ethnic backgrounds. None of the six individuals showed clinical symptoms attributable to MBD deficiency although the defect in isoleucine catabolism was demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Several mutations in the ACADSB gene were identified, including a novel one. MBD deficiency may be a harmless metabolic variant although significant impairment of valproic acid metabolism cannot be excluded and further study is required to assess the long-term outcome of individuals with this condition. The relatively high prevalence of ACADSB gene mutations in control subjects suggests that MBD deficiency may be more common than previously thought but is not detected because of its usually benign nature.","dc:creator":"Sass JO","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"2-Methylbutyryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency: functional and molecular studies on a defect in isoleucine catabolism."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17945527","rdfs:label":"Sass Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Polymorphism (MAF 0.4494)"},{"id":"cggv:dadeab6c-b766-43af-add5-189844e5db0b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7cdee42-729b-4eba-86b9-7fa54773d0a0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA sequencing of all exons and part of flanking introns.","phenotypeFreeText":"At birth, GC/MS of urine showed elevated 2-methylbutyrylglycine and 2-ethylhydracrylic acid, mildly elevated lactate.

The clinical significance of this disease is uncertain because almost 90% of patients are asymptomatic (Porta, 2019, PMID: 30730842). At least 15 variants have been reported in the literature (missense, nonsense, splicing).  In summary, ACADSB is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
