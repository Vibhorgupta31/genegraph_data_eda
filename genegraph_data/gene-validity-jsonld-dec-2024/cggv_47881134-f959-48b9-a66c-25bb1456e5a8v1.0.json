Under this paradigm, we have implemented systematic sequencing of neonates and young children with a suspected genetic disorder. Here, we report on two families with recessive mutations in NCAPG2 and overlapping clinical phenotypes that include severe neurodevelopmental defects, failure to thrive, ocular abnormalities, and defects in urogenital and limb morphogenesis. NCAPG2 encodes a member of the condensin II complex, necessary for the condensation of chromosomes prior to cell division. Consistent with a causal role for NCAPG2, we found abnormal chromosome condensation, augmented anaphase chromatin-bridge formation, and micronuclei in daughter cells of proband skin fibroblasts. To test the functional relevance of the discovered variants, we generated an ncapg2 zebrafish model. Morphants displayed clinically relevant phenotypes, such as renal anomalies, microcephaly, and concomitant increases in apoptosis and altered mitotic progression. These could be rescued by wild-type but not mutant human NCAPG2 mRNA and were recapitulated in CRISPR-Cas9 F0 mutants. Finally, we noted that the individual with a complex urogenital defect also harbored a heterozygous NPHP1 deletion, a common contributor to nephronophthisis. To test whether sensitization at the NPHP1 locus might contribute to a more severe renal phenotype, we co-suppressed nphp1 and ncapg2, which resulted in significantly more dysplastic renal tubules in zebrafish larvae. Together, our data suggest that impaired function of NCAPG2 results in a severe condensinopathy, and they highlight the potential utility of examining candidate pathogenic lesions beyond the primary disease locus.","dc:creator":"Khan TN","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Mutations in NCAPG2 Cause a Severe Neurodevelopmental Syndrome that Expands the Phenotypic Spectrum of

NCAPG2 gene is located on chromosome 7 at 7q36.3 and encodes the non-SMC condensin II complex subunit G2 protein, a regulatory subunit of the condensin-2 complex which is involved in establishing mitotic chromosome architecture and in maintaining the physical rigidity of the chromatid axis. NCAPG2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Khan-Khan-Katsanis syndrome in 2019 (Khan et al., PMID: 30609410). Khan-Khan-Katsanis syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder with variable involvement of the ocular, renal, skeletal, and sometimes cardiac systems. Three missense variants that have been reported in two probands in one publication (PMID: 30609410) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration in patient cells and zebrafish morpholino-induced animal models (PMID: 30609410). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
