Expression was specifically strong surrounding the nasal region and maxillary and mandibular areas. At this time, there was also high expression in the growing heart, frontonasal area, the trigeminal ganglion, and the tenth cranial nerve. Additionally, there was high expression in the brain within the rhombomeres, forebrain, and midbrain. \n\nAt human Carnegie day 21, there was high embryonic expression in the muscular area of the tongue: the superior longitudinal, the transversal muscles of tongue, and the extrinsic genioglossus muscle. At this time, there was also high CTNND1 mRNA expression in the epithelium of the developing tooth bud. Additionally, there was high CTNND1 expression in the dorsal epithelium of the palatal shelf and the tongueâ€™s epithelium.

Due to advances in next-generation sequencing, CTNND1 has been implicated in human diseases including cleft palate and blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome albeit only recently. In this study, we identify eight novel protein-truncating variants, six de novo, in 13 participants from nine families presenting with craniofacial dysmorphisms including cleft palate and hypodontia, as well as congenital cardiac anomalies, limb dysmorphologies and neurodevelopmental disorders. Using conditional deletions in mice as well as CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to target CTNND1 in Xenopus, we identified a subset of phenotypes that can be linked to p120-catenin in epithelial integrity and turnover, and additional phenotypes that suggest mesenchymal roles of CTNND1. We propose that CTNND1 variants have a wider developmental role than previously described and that variations in this gene underlie not only cleft palate and BCD but may be expanded to a broader velocardiofacial-like syndrome.","dc:creator":"Alharatani R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Novel truncating mutations in CTNND1 cause a dominant craniofacial and cardiac syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Expression-level evidence: Human embryos"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5000144a-71c1-4ae7-95a9-17ad67a388c5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e437d2e-7df8-4034-a0f5-de0bb6615e89","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31c7ac24-a369-4452-8574-ff6a806c98de","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The fact that the mutants had small craniofacial cartilages and reduced survival falls in line with the craniofacial phenotype seen in humans.

The phenotype of this disorder includes eye abnormalities, cleft lip/palate, and dental problems. 10 variants (frameshift, nonsense, missense) that have been reported in at least 15 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 28301459, 29348693, 32196547) are included in this curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence, animal models; PMID: 32196547). Expression-level evidence in human embryos shows high and specific craniofacial expression. A mouse model and a xenopus model both recapitulate the human phenotype of craniofacial structural anomalies/abnormal expression in mutants. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CTNND1* and autosomal dominant BCDS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
