Envoplakin and periplakin are components of the cornified envelope, but less is known about their role in tissues other than the stratified epithelium. Our tissue-wide survey utilizing RT-PCR revealed that periplakin, like plectin and desmoplakin, has a wide tissue distribution, but envoplakin expression is limited to certain tissues only, and BPAG1 is clearly specific for epidermal keratinocytes. Plectin, desmoplakin and BPAG1 are known to bind to the intermediate filaments through their C-terminal domains. The short C-terminal domain of periplakin is composed only of the linker domain, a region highly homologous between the plakin proteins. Here we demonstrate, through the use of yeast two-hybrid assay, a specific interaction of the periplakin linker domain with keratin 8 and vimentin. Co-expression of each plakin linker domain with keratin 8 revealed that periplakin and BPAG1 linkers co-localize with keratin signals in HaCaT cells, plectin and desmoplakin linkers were detected both in the nucleus and in cytoplasm together with the overexpressed keratin 8, while envoplakin linker localized independently into the nucleus. These results suggest that, in spite of its high homology and structural similarity with envoplakin, periplakin is functionally closer to the well-characterized plakin proteins plectin and desmoplakin, and thus may function tissue-wide as a scaffolding protein in intermediate filament assembly.","dc:creator":"Kazerounian S","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Unique role for the periplakin tail in intermediate filament association: specific binding to keratin 8 and vimentin."},"rdfs:label":"Human myocardium PCR analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3c89c603-de1b-4c6f-8d27-82ae159355cc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:558f93ca-0439-45e8-a340-fb70b7a755e0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"DSP is one of the intercalated disc components highly related to LV function","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28934278","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Alterations in myocardial structure and reduced cardiomyocyte adhesions have been previously described in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

We also visualized the intercalated disc (ID) structure and organization. The transcriptomic profile of 23 explanted LV samples was analyzed using RNA-sequencing (13 DCM, 10 control [CNT]), focusing on cell adhesion genes. Electron microscopy analysis to visualize ID structural differences and immunohistochemistry experiments of ID proteins was also performed. RT-qPCR and western blot experiments were carried out on ID components. We found 29 differentially expressed genes, most of all, constituents of the ID structure. We found that the expression of GJA3, DSP and CTNNA3 was directly associated with LV ejection fraction (r = 0.741, P = 0.004; r = 0.674, P = 0.011 and r = 0.565, P = 0.044, respectively), LV systolic (P = 0.003, P = 0.003, P = 0.028, respectively) and diastolic dimensions (P = 0.006, P = 0.001, P = 0.025, respectively). Electron microscopy micrographs showed a reduced ID convolution index and immunogold labeling of connexin 46 (GJA gene), desmoplakin (DSP gene) and catenin α-3 (CTNNA3 gene) proteins in DCM patients. Moreover, we observed that protein and mRNA levels analyzed by RT-qPCR of these ID components were diminished in DCM group. In conclusion, we report significant gene and protein expression changes and found that the ID components GJA3, DSP and CTNNA3 were highly related to LV function. Microscopic observations indicated that ID is structurally compromised in these patients.

To gain insights into the homozygous loss-of-function effects of desmoplakin in the heart, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific desmoplakin-deficient mice (DSP-cKO) using ventricular myosin light chain-2-Cre mice. Homozygous DSP-cKO mice are viable but display early ultrastructural defects in desmosomal integrity leading to a cardiomyopathy reminiscent of a biventricular form of ARVC, which includes cell death and fibro-fatty replacement within the ventricle leading to biventricular dysfunction, failure and premature death. DSP-cKO mice also exhibited ventricular arrhythmias that are exacerbated with exercise and catecholamine stimulation. Furthermore, DSP-cKO hearts exhibited right ventricular conduction defects associated with loss of connexin 40 expression and electrical wavefront propagation defects associated with loss of connexin 43 expression. Dose-dependent assessment of the effects of loss of desmoplakin in neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes revealed primary loss of connexin 43 levels, phosphorylation and function independent of the molecular dissociation of the mechanical junction complex and fibro-fatty manifestation associated with ARVC, suggesting a role for desmoplakin as a primary stabilizer of connexin integrity.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and case-control data. There are multiple families with DCM with truncating variants in DSP segregating in the family in the literature. Only case-level and segregation data was scored for DCM and there was no evidence suggesting the probands and/or family members met ARVC TFC. Case-control evidence shows that DSP variants are over-represented in cases versus controls (Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID 31983221). Additional human genetic evidence is available in the literature that was not included in the curation scoring as the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached. In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence, including expression data and animal models. DSP has been shown to be expressed in the heart, and also one of the intercalated disc components highly related to LV function, providing evidence of protein interaction (Kazerounian et al, 2002, PMID: 12366696; Ortega et al, 2017, PMID: 28934278). DSP KO mice exhibit a biventricular cardiomyopathy, although it is particularly arrhythmic with sudden death (Lyon et al, 2014, PMID: 24108106).  In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between DSP and autosomal dominant DCM.  Of note, DSP has also been curated by the ARVC Gene Curation Expert Panel for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with wooly hair and keratoderma (Strong, July 12, 2019), as there are also several families in which individuals meet arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) task force criteria (TFC).  Experts in the DCM GCEP encourage clinicians to carefully evaluate for a possibility of an ACM phenotype and treat patients and families with DSP variants accordingly.
