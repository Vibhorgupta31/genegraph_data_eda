A genome-wide screen for genetic linkage in a large family with an autosomal dominant form of Caffey disease (ADC) revealed a locus on chromosome 17q21 (LOD score, 6.78). Affected individuals and obligate carriers were heterozygous for a missense mutation (3040Ctwo head right arrowT) in exon 41 of the gene encoding the alpha1(I) chain of type I collagen (COL1A1), altering residue 836 (R836C) in the triple-helical domain of this chain. The same mutation was identified in affected members of 2 unrelated, smaller families with ADC, but not in 2 prenatal cases and not in more than 300 chromosomes from healthy individuals. Fibroblast cultures from an affected individual produced abnormal disulfide-bonded dimeric alpha1(I) chains. Dermal collagen fibrils of the same individual were larger, more variable in shape and size, and less densely packed than those in control samples. Individuals bearing the mutation, whether they had experienced an episode of cortical hyperostosis or not, had joint hyperlaxity, hyperextensible skin, and inguinal hernias resembling symptoms of a mild form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III. These findings extend the spectrum of COL1A1-related diseases to include a hyperostotic disorder.","dc:creator":"Gensure RC","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"A novel COL1A1 mutation in infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease) expands the spectrum of collagen-related disorders."},"rdfs:label":"Abnormal Collagen"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:78154430-73a8-4120-83ff-77bfa384d16d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb9daedb-e3c3-4334-a541-eacc12af75f6","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"This was demonstrated by TEM following skin biopsy.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34272483","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Infantile Caffey disease is a rare disorder characterized by acute inflammation with subperiosteal new bone formation, associated with fever, pain, and swelling of the overlying soft tissue.

Caffey disease is characterized by an infantile episode of massive subperiosteal new bone formation that typically involves the diaphyses of the long bones, mandible, and clavicles. Painful swelling and systemic fever often accompany the episode, which usually begins before the age of 5 months and resolves before age 2 years. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, osteogenesis imperfecta, type I (OMIM:166200), osteogenesis imperfecta, type II (OMIM:166210), osteogenesis imperfecta, type III (OMIM:259420), osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV (OMIM:166220), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 1 (OMIM:130060), combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 1 (OMIM:619115), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, classic type, 1 (not associated with COL1A1 in OMIM), and Caffey disease (OMIM:114000). The split curations have been curated separately. Two variants (c.3040C>T; p.Arg1014Cys and c.2752C>T; p.Arg918Cys) that have been reported in 40 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 15864348, 17309652, 18704262, 21249479, 21567126, 24390061, 34272483) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (11.9/12 pts.) has been reached. *COL1A1*-related Caffey disease is most frequently caused by the c.3040C>T (p.Arg1014Cys) variant (previously known as p.Arg836Cys), believed to disrupt specific type I collagen-ligand interaction (PMID: 24389367). This gene-disease association is also supported by expression throughout the skeletal system and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 15864348, 19669491, 34272483). In summary, *COL1A1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Caffey Disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 11/2/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:21b43a7b-79d4-4adf-b1a4-cd26e21ba8fa"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
