Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (9.5 points): Four variants (Nonsense, frameshift, canonical splicing, and multi exon deletion) in this gene have been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 32565547, 34685610, 34058075). A variant in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member (PMID: 34685610).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4.25 points): This gene-disease association is supported by studies of protein interaction with other subunits of BLOC-1 (PMID: 12923531), mouse (muted) (PMID: 11912185) and zebrafish (PMID: 34058075) model systems that recapitulate the HPS phenotype, and rescue models in mouse melanocytes (PMID: 32565547).\n\nIn summary, BLOC1S5 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 11. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has held up over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:85cca8f5-d263-42c4-b84a-2d49deeee682"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
