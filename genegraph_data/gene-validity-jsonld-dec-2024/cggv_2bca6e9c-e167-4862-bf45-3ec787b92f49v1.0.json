Mutations in the ACO2 gene were identified in patients suffering from a broad range of symptoms, including optic nerve atrophy, cortical atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, seizures and intellectual disabilities. In the present study, we identified a heterozygous 51 bp deletion (c.1699_1749del51) in ACO2 in a family with autosomal dominant inherited isolated optic atrophy. A complementation assay using aco1-deficient yeast revealed a growth defect for the mutant ACO2 variant substantiating a pathogenic effect of the deletion. We used patient-derived fibroblasts to characterize cellular phenotypes and found a decrease of ACO2 protein levels, while ACO2 enzyme activity was not affected compared to two age- and gender-matched control lines. Several parameters of mitochondrial function, including mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential or mitochondrial superoxide production, were not changed under baseline conditions. However, basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity were reduced in mutant cells. Furthermore, we observed a reduction of mtDNA copy number and reduced mtDNA transcription levels in ACO2-mutant fibroblasts. Inducing oxidative stress led to an increased susceptibility for cell death in ACO2-mutant fibroblasts compared to controls. Our study reveals that a monoallelic mutation in ACO2 is sufficient to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress as main drivers of cell death related to optic nerve atrophy.","dc:creator":"Neumann MA","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Haploinsufficiency due to a novel ACO2 deletion causes mitochondrial dysfunction in fibroblasts from a patient with dominant optic nerve atrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2bca6e9c-e167-4862-bf45-3ec787b92f49_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2bca6e9c-e167-4862-bf45-3ec787b92f49_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f54d801-e70c-4a4c-895d-eabb02e3e0ab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b6c67c51-dbd9-4a1f-97ae-d86c99246338","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Significant decrease of ACO2 on western blot of FCLs\nSignificantly reduced basal, maximal, and spare respiration by OCR in fibroblasts ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028849","rdfs:label":"III-4 FCL studies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score 0.5 Significant decrease of ACO2 on western blot of FCLs\n+0.5 Significantly reduced basal, maximal, and spare respiration by OCR in fibroblasts \nCase is entered but will not be scored separately"},{"id":"cggv:5745521f-c598-4e16-92d2-ea26bc3d178c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4287f2b9-88a9-472f-8bf7-e3a05a167248","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"-ACO2 western blot shows reduced protein compared to control\n-Normal CS activity, 50% aconitase activity \n-mtDNA depletion <50% of control\n-significant respiration defect with only citrate as substrate, restoration to WT with malate\n\nNote: comparable activity levels to arOA cell line with  c.36 + 5del; c.719G>C; p.

Numerous additional cases have been reported, some with reduced penetrance and with variable age of onset (PMID: 34056600).  This gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease (please see separate curation).\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine unique nonsense and frameshift variants predicted to result in protein truncation and loss of function from eight probands. There are >50 families reported with autosomal dominant *ACO2*-related disorders with reduced penetrance. At least 16 cases are reported with predicted null alleles (PMID: 34056600). Missense variants have also been reported and were reviewed but were not included in scoring given lack of functional evidence of variant impact resulting in loss-of-function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by functional alteration in patient cells and by a rescue study performed in yeast (PMIDs: 33028849, 34056600). \n\nIn summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between *ACO2* and autosomal dominant primary mitochondrial disease. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 19, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
