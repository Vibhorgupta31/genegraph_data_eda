Here we report a family with hereditary pancreatitis that carries a novel PRSS1 mutation (R122C). This mutation cannot be diagnosed with the conventional screening method using AflIII restriction enzyme digest. We therefore propose a new assay based on restriction enzyme digest with BstUI, a technique that permits detection of the novel R122C mutation in addition to the most common R122H mutation, and even in the presence of a recently reported neutral polymorphism that prevents its detection by the AflIII method. Recombinantly expressed R122C mutant human trypsinogen was found to undergo greatly reduced autoactivation and cathepsin B-induced activation, which is most likely caused by misfolding or disulfide mismatches of the mutant zymogen. The K(m) of R122C trypsin was found to be unchanged, but its k(cat) was reduced to 37% of the wild type. After correction for enterokinase activatable activity, and specifically in the absence of calcium, the R122C mutant was more resistant to autolysis than the wild type and autoactivated more rapidly at pH 8. Molecular modeling of the R122C mutant trypsin predicted an unimpaired active site but an altered stability of the calcium binding loop. This previously unknown trypsinogen mutation is associated with hereditary pancreatitis, requires a novel diagnostic screening method, and, for the first time, raises the question whether a gain or a loss of trypsin function participates in the onset of pancreatitis.","dc:creator":"Simon P","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Hereditary pancreatitis caused by a novel PRSS1 mutation (Arg-122 --> Cys) that alters autoactivation and autodegradation of cationic trypsinogen."},"rdfs:label":"Trypsinogen activation and trypsin autolysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5c83044e-b74f-4f00-8e95-f51ca1892b90","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2e5feb9-ae91-47d7-9cac-8b7ec28475eb","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Arg122His variant enhances autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen in vitro and inhibits autocatalytic inactivation of trypsin leading gain of enzyme activity.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11097832","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary pancreatitis (HP), an autosomal dominant disorder, has been associated with mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene.

The mode of inheritance suggests an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. The gene, or at least one of the genes, responsible for hereditary pancreatitis has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7 and a missense mutation, an arginine to histidine substitution at residue 117 in the trypsinogen cationic gene (try4) has been shown to segregate with the HP phenotype. The aim of this work was to investigate the molecular basis of hereditary pancreatitis. This study was performed on 14 HP families. The five exons of the trypsinogen cationic gene were studied using a specific gene amplification assay combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The present paper describes three novel mutations, namely K23R and N29I and a deletion -28delTCC in the promoter region. We also found a polymorphism in exon 4, D162D. In eight of these families we found a mutation which segregates with the disease. A segregation analysis using microsatellite markers carried out on the other families suggests genetic heterogeneity in at least one of them. Our findings confirm the implication of the cationic trypsinogen gene in HP and highlight allelic diversity associated with this phenotype. We also show that the pattern of inheritance of HP is probably complex and that other genes may be involved in this genetic disease.","dc:creator":"Férec C","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene and evidence for genetic heterogeneity in hereditary pancreatitis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10204851","rdfs:label":"N family proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"N29I (Asn29Ile), the second most common variant in PRSS1 gene associated with HP. gain of function."},{"id":"cggv:14dda66d-f549-4ee3-91e0-ae2d26da908e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7d14143e-0c44-4701-a817-e76c41ee5758","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Denaturing gradient gel","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0006280","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:14dda66d-f549-4ee3-91e0-ae2d26da908e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:22c06f12-d24e-4fce-9b6e-5943cace21a9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002769.5(PRSS1):c.365G>A (p.Arg122His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341151"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10204851"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10204851","rdfs:label":"Ve family proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"c.365G>A (p.R122H (Arg122His) is a CpG mutations, the most common variant in PRSS1 associated with HP. gain of function"},{"id":"cggv:37d5dfa0-9554-45e3-9d77-fb979e72ac96_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c464d766-3901-40d0-84ac-f3f67a1d6be8","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0006280","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:37d5dfa0-9554-45e3-9d77-fb979e72ac96_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:fb86ea8a-afee-4463-a8ab-9298e9db5d3f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002769.4(PRSS1):c.47C>T (p.Ala16Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/38363"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10381903","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In pancreatitis, a key role has been attributed to the inappropriate conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin.

At least 300 variants are reported, most are missense, in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1 *276000). The splicing and frameshift variants, as well as triplication of the gene locus (Marechal CL et al., PMID: 17072318) are also reported to be associated with Hereditary Pancreatitis. These variants have been reported to cause 'gain-of-function' of the trypsin activity. In this curation, large segregation studies lead to the identification of the most common missense variant, NM_002769.5(PRSS1):c.365G>A (p.Arg122His) (Ferec C et al, PMID 10204851 and Whitcomb DC et al., PMID8841182). Two other common missense variants, NM_002769.5(PRSS1):c.86A>T (p.Asn29Ile) and NM_002769.5(PRSS1):c.68A>G (p.Lys23Arg) were described. Additional missense variants, in familial and sporadic cases are described (Witt H et al., PMID 10381903l; Teich N et al., PMID 10930381; Chen JM et al., PMID 11073545; Simon P et al., PMID 1179509). These variants are repetitively reported and more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by functional studies (Simon P et al., PMID 11719509; Teich N et al., PMID 10930381; Sahin-Toth M et al., PIMD 1109832) and mouse model systems (Jancso Z et al., PMID31751559; Selilg L et al., PMID 17069643) for various pathogenic variants. Taken together these studies demonstrated that most pathogenic variants significantly enhance autoactivation in vitro, whereas some mutations such as p.R122H additionally inhibit autolysis of the active enzyme. In summary, these replicated studies revealed PRSS1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant inheritance pancreatitis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical diagnostic settings and experimental research. It has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d271c52b-b0bb-4e9b-a745-ea03dc716fa0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
