Here we report novel mutations in VPS33B in patients from Eastern Europe and South East Asia. One of the mutations was present in 7 unrelated Korean patients. Reduced expression of VPS33B and cellular phenotype was detected in fibroblasts from patients clinically diagnosed with ARC with and without known VPS33B mutations. One mutation-negative patient was found to have normal mRNA and protein levels. This patient's clinical condition improved and he is alive at the age of 2.5 years.

We generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of VPS33B deficiency, Vps33b(fl/fl)-ER(T2), and studied the platelet phenotype and α-granule biogenesis. Ultrastructural analysis of Vps33b(fl/fl)-ER(T2) platelets identified a marked reduction in α-granule count and the presence of small granule-like structures in agreement with the platelet phenotype observed in ARC patients. A reduction of ∼65% to 75% was observed in the α-granule proteins von Willebrand factor and P-selectin. Although platelet aggregation responses were not affected, a defect in δ-granule secretion was observed. Under arteriolar shear conditions, Vps33b(fl/fl)-ER(T2) platelets were unable to form stable aggregates, and tail-bleeding measurement revealed a bleeding diathesis. Analysis of bone marrow-derived megakaryocytes (MKs) by conventional and immuno-electron microscopy from Vps33b(fl/fl)-ER(T2) mice revealed a reduction in mature type-II multivesicular bodies (MVB II) and an accumulation of large vacuoles.

The classical presentation of ARC includes congenital joint contractures, renal tubular dysfunction, and cholestasis. Additional features include ichthyosis, central nervous system malformation, platelet anomalies, and severe failure to thrive. At least 19 unique variants (mostly nonsense but also frameshift, splicing, start loss, and missense) have been reported in humans with Pathogenic classifications in ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 15052268, 18853461), included in this curation. Additional evidence is available in the literature, however the maximum points for genetic evidence were reached.
