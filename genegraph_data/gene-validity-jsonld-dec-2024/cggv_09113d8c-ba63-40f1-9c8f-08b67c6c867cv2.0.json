While several BARD1 variants have been identified as pathogenic, many more missense variants exist that do not occur frequently enough to assign a clinical risk. In this paper, whole exome sequencing of over 10,000 cancer samples from 33 cancer types identified from somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity in tumors 76 potentially cancer-associated BARD1 missense and truncation variants. These variants were tested in a functional assay for homology-directed repair (HDR), as HDR deficiencies have been shown to correlate with clinical pathogenicity for BRCA1 variants. From these 76 variants, 4 in the ankyrin repeat domain and 5 in the BRCT domain were found to be non-functional in HDR. Two known benign variants were found to be functional in HDR, and three known pathogenic variants were non-functional, supporting the notion that the HDR assay can be used to predict the clinical risk of BARD1 variants. The identification of HDR-deficient variants in the ankyrin repeat domain indicates there are DNA repair functions associated with this domain that have not been closely examined. In order to examine whether BARD1-associated loss of HDR function results in DNA damage sensitivity, cells expressing non-functional BARD1 variants were treated with ionizing radiation or cisplatin. These cells were found to be more sensitive to DNA damage, and variations in the residual HDR function of non-functional variants did not correlate with variations in sensitivity. These findings improve the understanding of BARD1 functional domains in DNA repair and support that this functional assay is useful for predicting the cancer association of BARD1 variants.","dc:creator":"Adamovich AI","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Functional analysis of BARD1 missense variants in homology-directed repair and damage sensitivity."},"rdfs:label":"Adomvich HDR"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:09113d8c-ba63-40f1-9c8f-08b67c6c867c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d854a1c6-fe36-4b13-97fe-70e4158d3fc5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:438967c0-f289-4f4e-b5e6-29e91c779377","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Conditional deletion of BARD1 in mammary tissue induced mammary carcinoma that are indistinguishable from BRCA1 mice, which have been reported as  resembling basal-like breast tumors of human BRCA1 mutation carriers.

The protein product of BRCA1 is involved in a broad spectrum of biological processes and interacts with many diverse proteins. One of these, BARD1, associates with BRCA1 to form a heterodimeric complex that is enzymatically active as an ubiquitin E3 ligase. Although the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer has been implicated in several aspects of BRCA1 function, its role in tumor suppression has not been evaluated. To address this question, we generated mouse strains carrying conditional alleles of either Bard1 or Brca1 and used Cre recombination to inactivate these genes in mammary epithelial cells. Significantly, the conditional Bard1- and Brca1-mutant mice developed breast carcinomas that are indistinguishable from each other (and from those of double conditional Bard1/Brca1-mutant animals) with respect to their frequency, latency, histopathology, and cytogenetic features. Reminiscent of the basal-like breast carcinomas seen in human BRCA1 mutation carriers, these tumors are \"triple negative\" for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and HER2/neu amplification. They also express basal cytokeratins CK5 and CK14, have an elevated frequency of p53 lesions, and display high levels of chromosomal instability. The remarkable similarities between the mammary carcinomas of Bard1-, Brca1-, and Bard1/Brca1-mutant mice indicate that the tumor suppressor activities of both genes are mediated through the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer.","dc:creator":"Shakya R","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The basal-like mammary carcinomas induced by Brca1 or Bard1 inactivation implicate the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer in tumor suppression."},"rdfs:label":"BARD1 CKO - mammary"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Decreasing the score to allocate 2 points across two similar models, both are LOF variants resulting in breast cancer similar to human phenotype."},{"id":"cggv:56d4a0d3-752b-4b54-bbe1-9b14dc98abf2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07796aed-42c2-49c5-b736-c334b291d035","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"MCF7 derived tumor mass within the local mammary gland and were marked by prominent nucleoli with scant cytoplasm and high proliferation.

BARD1-related cancer predisposition is characterized by a susceptibility to breast cancer with emerging evidence suggesting the association of other cancer types including neuroblastoma. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) or inheritance pattern. Therefore, breast cancer and neuroblastoma have been lumped into this curation. Please note, autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer (MONDO:0016248) has been curated separately due to conflicting evidence. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function in which BRCA1 binding is disrupted and subsequent loss of DNA damage response. 6 predicted null variants (nonsense and frameshift) and 2 missense variants reported in 8 probands with breast cancer in 5 publications (PMIDs: 2550351, 31371347, 21344236, 23334666, 28726808) are included in this curation. Several case-control studies further support the association of breast cancer (PMIDs: 15342711, 28418444, 28649662, 31036035, 33471991, 35172496). Additionally, a case-control study supports the association of neuroblastoma (PMIDs: 37688579, 37688570, 36747619). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 Points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including in vitro functional assays and animal models (2.5 Points, PMIDs: 18443292, 30925164, 33623049). Cells models with BARD1 variants showed impaired DNA damage in line with the proposed mechanism. In addition, both mammary gland conditional knockout Bard1 mice and a BARD1 variant xenograft model showed development of a breast cancer-like mammary tumor. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between BARD1 and autosomal dominant inherited BARD1-related cancer predisposition. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive for hereditary breast cancer (MONDO:0016419) by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 08/09/2017.
