Its frequency is estimated at one per 10 000. Actions of numerous genes have been linked to heart development. However, no single gene defect causing ASD has yet been identified. Incomplete heart septation similar to ASD was reported in transgenic mice with both inactive alleles of gene encoding mammalian zinc metalloprotease a mammalian tolloid-like 1 (tll1). Here, we have screened 19 ASD patients and 15 healthy age-matched individuals for mutations in TLL1 gene. All 22 exons were analyzed exon by exon for heteroduplex formation. Subsequently, DNA fragments forming heteroduplexes were sequenced. In four nonrelated patients, three missense mutations in coding sequence, and one single base change in the 5'UTR have been detected. Two mutations (Met182Leu, and Ala238Val) were detected in ASD patients with the same clinical phenotype. As the second mutation locates immediately upstream of the catalytic zinc-binding signature, it might change the enzyme substrate specificity. The third change, Leu627Val in the CUB3 domain, has been found in an ASD patient with interatrial septum aneurysm in addition to ASD. The CUB3 domain is important for substrate-specific recognition. In the remaining 15 patients as well as in 15 reference samples numerous base substitutions, deletions, and insertions have been detected, but no mutations changing the coding sequence have been found. Lack of mutations in relation to ASD of these patients could possibly be because of genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome.","dc:creator":"Sta≈Ñczak P","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in mammalian tolloid-like 1 gene detected in adult patients with ASD."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.3},{"id":"cggv:37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:df78c78a-16af-4333-95a2-31a1163c9a6e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b82937f-5970-4cf4-b9ca-c34f16406408","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In situ hybridization was performed analyzing the expression of Tll1 in normal developing mouse hearts.

To investigate possible roles for mTLL-1 in mammalian development, we have used gene targeting in ES cells to produce mice with a disrupted allele for the corresponding gene, Tll1. Homozygous mutants were embryonic lethal, with death at mid-gestation from cardiac failure and a unique constellation of developmental defects that were apparently confined solely to the heart. Constant features were incomplete formation of the muscular interventricular septum and an abnormal and novel positioning of the heart and aorta. Consistent with roles in cardiac development, Tll1 expression was specific to precardiac tissue and endocardium in 7.5 and 8.5 days p.c. embryos, respectively. Tll1 expression was also high in the developing interventricular septum, where expression of the BMP-1 gene, Bmp1, was not observed. Cardiac structures that were not affected in Tll1-/- embryos either showed no Tll1 expression (atrio-ventricular cushions) or showed overlapping expression of Tll1 and Bmp1 (aortico-pulmonary septum), suggesting that products of the Bmp1 gene may be capable of functionally substituting for mTLL-1 at sites in which they are co-expressed. Together, the various data show that mTLL-1 plays multiple roles in formation of the mammalian heart and is essential for formation of the interventricular septum.","dc:creator":"Clark TG","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"The mammalian Tolloid-like 1 gene, Tll1, is necessary for normal septation and positioning of the heart."},"rdfs:label":"Clark In situ hybridization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a5d67b10-9410-4447-84cb-ea509a95bb83","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a6c98d0f-8be6-47cd-9a7b-d8cdbdb01891","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0935"},"dc:description":"Nkx2-5, which is definitive by ClinGen for NKX2-5 related congenital, conduction and myopathic heart disease, increased Tll-1 expression.\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366374","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (Tll-1) is a pleiotropic metalloprotease that is expressed by a small subset of cells within the precardiac mesoderm and is necessary for proper heart development.

Our previous studies have demonstrated a genetic interaction between Tbx5 and Osr1 in the second heart field (SHF) for atrial septation. We hypothesized that Osr1 and Tbx5 share a common signaling networking and downstream targets for atrial septation. To identify this molecular networks, we acquired the RNA-Seq transcriptome data from the posterior SHF of wild-type, Tbx5(+/) (-), Osr1(+/-), Osr1(-/-) and Tbx5(+/-)/Osr1(+/-) mutant embryos. Gene set analysis was used to identify the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways that were affected by the doses of Tbx5 and Osr1. A gene network module involving Tbx5 and Osr1 was identified using a non-parametric distance metric, distance correlation. A subset of 10 core genes and gene-gene interactions in the network module were validated by gene expression alterations in posterior second heart field (pSHF) of Tbx5 and Osr1 transgenic mouse embryos, a time-course gene expression change during P19CL6 cell differentiation. Pcsk6 was one of the network module genes that were linked to Tbx5. We validated the direct regulation of Tbx5 on Pcsk6 using immunohistochemical staining of pSHF, ChIP-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and luciferase reporter assay. Importantly, we identified Pcsk6 as a novel gene associated with ASD via a human genotyping study of an ASD family. In summary, our study implicated a gene network involving Tbx5, Osr1 and Pcsk6 interaction in SHF for atrial septation, providing a molecular framework for understanding the role of Tbx5 in CHD ontogeny.","dc:creator":"Zhang KK","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Gene network and familial analyses uncover a gene network involving Tbx5/Osr1/Pcsk6 interaction in the second heart field for atrial septation."},"rdfs:label":"Zhang Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f33fa57a-b24f-4eb5-a0f5-20d28e8172e3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e586c1c-db37-41d0-94bd-c5d35dfc7853","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Homozygous mutants were embryonic lethal (died between 14.5 and 16.5 dpc), with death at mid-gestation from cardiac failure and a unique constellation of developmental defects that were apparently confined solely to the heart.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10331975","rdfs:label":"Clark Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because the phenotype is only obvious in homozygous mutants for a dominant disease gene.

There are more variants reported in individuals with CHD in 6 publications, all of which were not scored due to a high minor allele frequency (>0.00001) in gnomAD v.4, being located in the 5‚Äô untranslated region of the gene, the proband having a syndromic phenotype, and/or the proband having an unclear phenotype (PMID: 18830233, 27418595, 28358424, 30293987, 32552793, 34328347).
