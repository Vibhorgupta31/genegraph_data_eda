The disorder was mapped to chromosome 20p11.21-p11.23, and a homozygous frameshift mutation in RIN2 was found to segregate with the disease phenotype in a large consanguineous kindred. The mutation identified results in decreased expression of RIN2, a ubiquitously expressed protein that interacts with Rab5 and is involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking. RIN2 deficiency was found to be associated with paucity of dermal microfibrils and deficiency of fibulin-5, which may underlie the abnormal skin phenotype displayed by the patients.","dc:creator":"Basel-Vanagaite L","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"RIN2 deficiency results in macrocephaly, alopecia, cutis laxa, and scoliosis: MACS syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7427a25e-68a1-4e1b-b951-f1a1d7b1e52b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f852533-d9dc-4c23-834d-00399f754e45_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f852533-d9dc-4c23-834d-00399f754e45","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:56b97c8e-0389-48b1-88a2-fbad0b8c8959","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018993.4(RIN2):c.1914_1915del (p.Glu638AspfsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129976"}},"detectionMethod":"Mutation screening of the RIN2 gene was performed for all coding exons included in transcript NM_018993.2 using PCR amplification and bidirectionally sequencing on the ABI 3730XL Genetic Analyzer","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"thorax was flattened, with a severely reduced anteroposterior diameter, subluxation of the talocalcaneal articulation, moderate hyperlaxity of all small joints, velvety skin of the palms, dextroconvex kyphoscoliosis became severe by 15yo, progression of facial swelling and coarseness, ankle instability","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000431","obo:HP_0002225","obo:HP_0000494","obo:HP_0000974","obo:HP_0000678","obo:HP_0001763","obo:HP_0002705","obo:HP_0012378","obo:HP_0000286","obo:HP_0000280","obo:HP_0002076","obo:HP_0000343","obo:HP_0002209","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0045075","obo:HP_0000978","obo:HP_0001058","obo:HP_0000348","obo:HP_0001054","obo:HP_0040211","obo:HP_0000278","obo:HP_0000244","obo:HP_0000765","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0000212","obo:HP_0000411","obo:HP_0002751","obo:HP_0040080","obo:HP_0032153"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Array comparative genome hybridization (no significant CNVs), genotyping with Mapping 250K Nsp array from Affymetrix","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:7c3ee521-8b75-4d11-a44a-8501dd115efa_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:56b97c8e-0389-48b1-88a2-fbad0b8c8959"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20424861","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Defects leading to impaired intracellular trafficking have recently been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of genodermatoses, such as the Ehlers-Danlos and the cutis laxa syndromes. A new genodermatosis, termed macrocephaly, alopecia, cutis laxa and scoliosis (MACS) syndrome has been described, resulting from a homozygous 1-bp deletion in RIN2. RIN2 encodes the Ras and Rab interactor 2, involved in the regulation of Rab5-mediated early endocytosis. We performed a clinical, ultrastructural and molecular study in a consanguineous Algerian family with three siblings affected by a distinctive autosomal recessive genodermatosis, reported in 2005 by Verloes et al. The most striking clinical features include progressive facial coarsening, gingival hypertrophy, severe scoliosis, sparse hair and skin and joint hyperlaxity. Ultrastructural studies of the skin revealed important abnormalities in the collagen fibril morphology, and fibroblasts exhibited a dilated endoplasmic reticulum and an abnormal Golgi apparatus with rarefied and dilated cisternae. Molecular analysis of RIN2 revealed a novel homozygous 2-bp deletion in all affected individuals. The c.1914_1915delGC mutation introduces a frameshift and creates a premature termination codon, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. These findings confirm that RIN2 defects are associated with a distinct genodermatosis and underscore the involvement of RIN2 and its associated pathways in the pathogenesis of connective tissue disorders. The current family displays considerable phenotypic overlap with MACS syndrome. However, our family shows a dermatological and ultrastructural phenotype belonging to the Ehlers-Danlos rather than the cutis laxa spectrum. Therefore, the MACS acronym is not entirely appropriate for the current family.","dc:creator":"Syx D","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"The RIN2 syndrome: a new autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder caused by deficiency of Ras and Rab interactor 2 (RIN2)."}},"rdfs:label":"Syx Patient 1 (PIII.1)"},{"id":"cggv:7c3ee521-8b75-4d11-a44a-8501dd115efa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c3ee521-8b75-4d11-a44a-8501dd115efa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This proband has a frameshift variant, p.Glu638fs, that is absent from gnomAD v2.1.1.

We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.","dc:creator":"GTEx Consortium","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"The GTEx Consortium atlas of genetic regulatory effects across human tissues."},"rdfs:label":"RIN2 Tissue Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This group typically does not award points for tissue specific expression.

RIN2 encodes RAS and RAB interactor 2 and biallelic mutations in this gene are reported to cause cell trafficking dysfunction. Individuals with RIN2 syndrome have varying clinical features including macrocephaly, coarsening of facial features, down-slanting palpebral fissures, full everted lips, soft redundant skin, gum hypertrophy, irregular dentition, sparse scalp hair, joint hypermobility, and scoliosis. Four frameshift variants that have been reported in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 19631308, 20424861, 24449201, 30769224) are included in this curation. In all cases, the variants presented in homozygosity. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies that show this gene is expressed in fibroblasts, a relevant tissue, and studies showing that the expression level of the gene was markedly decreased when analyzed by qRT-PCR and absent when analyzed by immunoblotting (PMID: 19631308). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RIN2 and autosomal recessive RIN2 syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7427a25e-68a1-4e1b-b951-f1a1d7b1e52b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
