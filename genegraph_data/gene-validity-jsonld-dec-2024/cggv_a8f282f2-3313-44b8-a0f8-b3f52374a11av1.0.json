We applied whole exome sequencing to 128 mostly consanguineous families with neurogenetic disorders that often included brain malformations. Rare variant analyses for both single nucleotide variant (SNV) and copy number variant (CNV) alleles allowed for identification of 45 novel variants in 43 known disease genes, 41 candidate genes, and CNVs in 10 families, with an overall potential molecular cause identified in >85% of families studied. Among the candidate genes identified, we found PRUNE, VARS, and DHX37 in multiple families and homozygous loss-of-function variants in AGBL2, SLC18A2, SMARCA1, UBQLN1, and CPLX1. Neuroimaging and in silico analysis of functional and expression proximity between candidate and known disease genes allowed for further understanding of genetic networks underlying specific types of brain malformations.","dc:creator":"Karaca E","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Genes that Affect Brain Structure and Function Identified by Rare Variant Analyses of Mendelian Neurologic Disease."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8f282f2-3313-44b8-a0f8-b3f52374a11a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bea05fd8-478e-4e20-b1cf-3aa8e9e7493a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bea05fd8-478e-4e20-b1cf-3aa8e9e7493a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:5d579900-fe9e-4cc4-b1ac-e9a7b345a242","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006295.3(VARS1):c.219_232dup (p.Leu78ArgfsTer35)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3723617"}},{"id":"cggv:3152a8df-3f04-4b00-8f1f-07d03b212503","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006295.3(VARS1):c.2825G>A (p.Arg942Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA363443159"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:555843dc-043d-41a7-9ae1-2c007a8ce5d6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3152a8df-3f04-4b00-8f1f-07d03b212503"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30755616","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARSs) link specific amino acids with their cognate transfer RNAs in a critical early step of protein translation.

In this study, we interrogate the genetic etiology of two siblings from a non-consanguineous family with severe early onset of neurological manifestations. Whole exome sequencing identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in VARS that segregated with the proband: a missense (c.3192G>A; p.Met1064Ile) and a splice site mutation (c.1577-2A>G). The VARS gene encodes cytoplasmic valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS), an enzyme that is essential during eukaryotic translation. cDNA analysis on patient derived fibroblasts revealed that the splice site acceptor variant allele led to nonsense mediated decay, thus resulting in a null allele. Three-dimensional modeling of ValRS predicts that the missense mutation lies in a highly conserved region and could alter side chain packing, thus affecting tRNA binding or destabilizing the interface between the catalytic and tRNA binding domains. Further quantitation of the expression of VARS showed remarkably reduced levels of mRNA and protein in skin derived fibroblasts. Aminoacylation experiments on patient derived cells showed markedly reduced enzyme activity of ValRS suggesting the mutations to be loss of function. Bi-allelic mutations in cytoplasmic amino acyl tRNA synthetases are well-known for their role in neurodegenerative disorders, yet human disorders associated with VARS mutations have not yet been clinically well characterized.

VARS1 plays a key role in protein translation as the cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase responsible for catalyzing the attachment of valine to its cognate transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. VARS1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, seizures, and cortical atrophy in 2015 (Karaca et al. 2015 26539891). The disorder is characterized by a severe global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly (typically present by 6 months of age) and an onset of seizures during early infancy (Friedman et al. 2019; Siekierska et al. 2019). Seizure types vary between affected cases and may include myoclonia, focal clonic seizures and or generalized seizures. Brain abnormalities detected by MRI are also variable, cortical atrophy being the most common feature. Partial agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum are frequently seen, as well as cerebellar atrophy. \nSeventeen variants (including 14 missense, 1 frameshift, 1 stop gained and 1 canonical splice site variant), that have been reported in 12 probands in five publications (PMIDs: 26539891, 29137650, 29691655, 30755616, 30755602) are included in this curation. The mechanism of disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been associated with gene disease relationships characterized neurodevelopmental phenotypes (PMID: 25035493). A zebrafish vars1 knockout model, generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, recapitulates the brain malformation, developmental delay and seizure phenotypes observed in the clinical phenotype. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between VARS1 and autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, seizures, and cortical atrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
