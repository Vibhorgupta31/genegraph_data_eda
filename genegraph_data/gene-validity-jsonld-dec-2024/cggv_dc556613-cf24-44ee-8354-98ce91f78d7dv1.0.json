This interaction involves a coiled-coil domain within the lumenal domain. beta-glucocerebrosidase activity and protein levels were severely decreased in LIMP-2-deficient mouse tissues.

LIMP-2 was identified as a sorting receptor for beta-glucocerebrosidase (beta-GC), which is defective in Gaucher disease. To date, six AMRF-causing mutations have been described, including splice site, missense and nonsense mutations. All mutations investigated in this study lead to a retention of LIMP-2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but affect the binding to beta-GC differentially. From the three nonsense mutations, only the Q288X mutation was still able to bind to beta-GC as efficiently as compared with wild-type LIMP-2, whereas the W146SfsX16 and W178X mutations lost their beta-GC-binding capacity almost completely. The LIMP-2 segment 145-288, comprising the nonsense mutations, contains a highly conserved coiled-coil domain, which we suggest determines beta-GC binding. In fact, disruption of the helical arrangement and amphiphatic nature of the coiled-coil domain abolishes beta-GC binding, and a synthetic peptide comprising the coiled-coil domain of LIMP-2 displays pH-selective multimerization properties. In contrast to the reduced binding properties of the nonsense mutations, the only missense mutation (H363N) found in AMRF leads to increased binding of beta-GC to LIMP-2, indicating that this highly conserved histidine modifies the affinity of LIMP-2 to its ligand. With the present study, we demonstrate that disruption of the coiled-coil structure or AMRF disease-causing mutations abolish beta-GC binding, indicating the importance of an intact coiled-coil structure for the interaction of LIMP-2 and beta-GC.","dc:creator":"Blanz J","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Disease-causing mutations within the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) reveal the nature of binding to its ligand beta-glucocerebrosidase."},"rdfs:label":"Localization and b-GC binding of AMRF-causing mutants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:dc556613-cf24-44ee-8354-98ce91f78d7d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc556613-cf24-44ee-8354-98ce91f78d7d_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af9274bc-c603-4676-b223-919120eefdcd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:564eed55-1585-4fb1-82bb-db6f1ad889e6","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001337","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0001336"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:af9274bc-c603-4676-b223-919120eefdcd_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:52f132d4-d247-494b-8168-bb2d187bd909","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005506.4(SCARB2):c.361C>T (p.Arg121Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA317064"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23659519","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the SCARB2 gene cause a rare autosomal recessive disease, progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) with or without renal failure, the former also being designated action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome.

Here, we employed a novel combination of molecular strategies to find the responsible gene and show its effects in an animal model. Utilizing only three unrelated affected individuals and their relatives, we used homozygosity mapping with single-nucleotide polymorphism chips to localize AMRF. We then used microarray-expression analysis to prioritize candidates prior to sequencing. The disorder was mapped to 4q13-21, and microarray-expression analysis identified SCARB2/Limp2, which encodes a lysosomal-membrane protein, as the likely candidate. Mutations in SCARB2/Limp2 were found in all three families used for mapping and subsequently confirmed in two other unrelated AMRF families. The mutations were associated with lack of SCARB2 protein. Reanalysis of an existing Limp2 knockout mouse showed intracellular inclusions in cerebral and cerebellar cortex, and the kidneys showed subtle glomerular changes. This study highlights that recessive genes can be identified with a very small number of subjects. The ancestral lysosomal-membrane protein SCARB2/LIMP-2 is responsible for AMRF.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 unrelated probands in 3 publications (Berkovic et al. 2008, PMID: 18308289; Balreira et al. 2008, PMID: 18424452; Fu et al. 2014, PMID: 23659519).
