The objective of this report is to expand the phenotypic spectrum of BRAT1 disorders and propose new nomenclature for this condition.","dc:creator":"Hanes I","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Lethal Neonatal Rigidity and Multifocal Seizure Syndrome--A Misnamed Disorder?"}},{"id":"cggv:3baa0dfa-dd45-4f2f-9967-bc7e865f4ce7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8b91c397-e391-4984-8203-2109415339d5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26483087"}],"rdfs:label":"Hanes 1"},{"id":"cggv:3baa0dfa-dd45-4f2f-9967-bc7e865f4ce7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3baa0dfa-dd45-4f2f-9967-bc7e865f4ce7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:c4cbcf8c-d1a9-479f-b3c0-e5760712f198","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c4cbcf8c-d1a9-479f-b3c0-e5760712f198_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:85a4d81c-00b5-4869-9753-00adf70921d8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85a4d81c-00b5-4869-9753-00adf70921d8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:b20009e2-b38f-4154-8886-14654f6ecc1e"},{"id":"cggv:e021fb64-5d1f-4b5b-a087-d2ddfa18cc1c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152743.4(BRAT1):c.1564G>A (p.Glu522Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/840355"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0012758"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"The results of routine laboratory screening, including thyroid function, and neurometabolic\ntests were within normal range.

BRAT1 acts as a regulator of cellular proliferation and migration and is required for mitochondrial function. The loss of these functions may explain the cerebral atrophy observed in this case of PE. This case highlights the extraordinary potential of next generation technologies for the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases, including PE.

We expand the phenotypic spectrum of BRAT1 related disorders by reporting on four individuals with various BRAT1 mutations resulting in clinical severity that is either mild or moderate compared to the severe phenotype seen in RMFSL. Representing mild severity are three individuals (Patients 1-3), who are girls (including two sisters, Patients 1-2) between 4 and 10 years old, with subtle dysmorphisms, intellectual disability, ataxia or dyspraxia, and cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI; additionally, Patient 3 has well-controlled epilepsy and microcephaly. Representing moderate severity is a 15-month-old boy (Patient 4) with severe global developmental delay, refractory epilepsy, microcephaly, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, dysautonomia, and chronic lung disease. In contrast to RMFSL, his seizure onset occurred later at 4 months of age, and he is still alive. All four of the individuals have compound heterozygous BRAT1 mutations discovered via whole exome sequencing: c.638dupA (p.Val214Glyfs*189); c.803+1G>C (splice site mutation) in Patients 1-2; c.638dupA (p.Val214Glyfs*189); c.419T>C (p.Leu140Pro) in Patient 3; and c.171delG (p.Glu57Aspfs*7); c.419T>C (p.Leu140Pro) in Patient 4. Only the c.638dupA (p.Val214Glyfs*189) mutation has been previously reported in association with RMFSL. These patients illustrate that, compared with RMFSL, BRAT1 mutations can result in both moderately severe presentations evident by later-onset epilepsy and survival past infancy, as well as milder presentations that include intellectual disability, ataxia/dyspraxia, and cerebellar atrophy.

One form of this phenotype associated with BRAT1 has been reported in the literature as neurodevelopmental disorder with cerebellar atrophy and with or without seizures. Another form associated with more severe phenotypes (BRAT1/Neonatal-onset encephalopathy with rigidity and seizures) has been assessed separately. Compared to an earlier onset more severe presentation usually within the first days of life (documented in the literature as rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome, lethal neonatal- RMFSL), for this phenotype, onset of symptoms is variable, usually around infancy and more attenuated. Clinical presentation is also variable with most individuals reported with developmental delay, microcephaly, hypertonia or hypotonia; of note, seizures have been reported in some but not all individuals with features of disease. \n\nLoss of function variants have been commonly reported in association with disease, however missense and inframe deletions also been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 26483087, 26494257, 31742228, 25131622, 29997391, 27282546). Supporting experimental data has demonstrated that variants in this gene result in the inability for the protein to localize to the nucleus and may affect the stability of the protein (PMIDs: 22279524, 31742228).  \n\nAt the time of this review, no difference in variant type has been noted between the phenotypes of this gene. In addition, the same variant has been identified in both the severe and attenuated forms of this disease.  In all instances the identified variants were either homozygous or compound heterozygous supporting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. BRAT1 is definitively associated with neurodevelopmental disorder with cerebellar atrophy and with or without seizures. This has been demonstrated in the clinical and research settings and this evidence has been maintained over time.
