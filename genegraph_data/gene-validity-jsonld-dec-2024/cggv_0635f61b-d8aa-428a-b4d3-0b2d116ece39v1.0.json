It was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant PHIP-related behavioral problems-intellectual disability-obesity-dysmorphic features syndrome in 2016 (Webster et al., 2016 PMID: 27900362). The most common features in individuals with *PHIP* variants include intellectual disability, overgrowth, behavioral problems, facial dysmorphism (high forehead, full eyebrows and/or snynophrys, large ears, upturned nose and/or thick alae nasi), and other features including visual problems, tapering fingers, clinodactyly fifth fingers, gastrointestinal problems. *PHIP* has been associated with the following disease entities: AD Chung-Jansen syndrome (MIM:617991, ORPHA:589905 ) and AD PHIP-related behavioral problems-intellectual disability-obesity-dysmorphic features syndrome (MONDO:0035133,  ORPHA:589905). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: PHIP-related behavioral problems-intellectual disability-obesity-dysmorphic features syndrome.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be haploinsufficiency. Analysis suggests haploinsufficiency of PHIP/DCAF14, but not NDRP, is causative of the observed phenotype. At least 11 variants (4 missense and 7 nonsense/frameshift) that have been reported in 12 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs:29209020, 31167805 ) are included in this curation. Affected individuals typically harbor de novo, heterozygous loss-of-function and missense variants (PMID: 34773373). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *PHIP* and autosomal dominant PHIP-related behavioral problems-intellectual disability-obesity-dysmorphic features syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 19, 2022 (SOP version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0635f61b-d8aa-428a-b4d3-0b2d116ece39"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
