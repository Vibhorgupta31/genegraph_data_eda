Branchio-otic (BO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by hearing loss. In branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome, malformations of the kidney or urinary tract are associated. Haploinsufficiency for the human gene EYA1, a homologue of the Drosophila gene eyes absent (eya), causes BOR and BO syndromes. We recently mapped a locus for BOR/BO syndrome (BOS3) to human chromosome 14q23.1. Within the 33-megabase critical genetic interval, we located the SIX1, SIX4, and SIX6 genes, which act within a genetic network of EYA and PAX genes to regulate organogenesis. These genes, therefore, represented excellent candidate genes for BOS3. By direct sequencing of exons, we identified three different SIX1 mutations in four BOR/BO kindreds, thus identifying SIX1 as a gene causing BOR and BO syndromes. To elucidate how these mutations cause disease, we analyzed the functional role of these SIX1 mutations with respect to protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. We demonstrate that all three mutations are crucial for Eya1-Six1 interaction, and the two mutations within the homeodomain region are essential for specific Six1-DNA binding. Identification of SIX1 mutations as causing BOR/BO offers insights into the molecular basis of otic and renal developmental diseases in humans.","dc:creator":"Ruf RG","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"SIX1 mutations cause branchio-oto-renal syndrome by disruption of EYA1-SIX1-DNA complexes."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15141091","rdfs:label":"F1120 IV:5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0732cc55-46c9-43c6-aa47-01e9fa3dd13a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d824fc7b-af6d-4f5f-b756-cb77eca4a60b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"This study screened individuals from 90 different families with BOR/BO for variants in SIX1, SIX4, and SIX6.

However, their roles during auditory system development have not been studied. We report that Six1 is required for mouse auditory system development. During inner ear development, Six1 expression was first detected in the ventral region of the otic pit and later is restricted to the middle and ventral otic vesicle within which, respectively, the vestibular and auditory epithelia form. By contrast, Six1 expression is excluded from the dorsal otic vesicle within which the semicircular canals form. Six1 is also expressed in the vestibuloacoustic ganglion. At E15.5, Six1 is expressed in all sensory epithelia of the inner ear. Using recently generated Six1 mutant mice, we found that all Six1(+/-) mice showed some degree of hearing loss because of a failure of sound transmission in the middle ear. By contrast, Six1(-/-) mice displayed malformations of the auditory system involving the outer, middle and inner ears. The inner ear development in Six1(-/-) embryos arrested at the otic vesicle stage and all components of the inner ear failed to form due to increased cell death and reduced cell proliferation in the otic epithelium. Because we previously reported that Six1 expression in the otic vesicle is Eya1 dependent, we first clarified that Eya1 expression was unaffected in Six1(-/-) otic vesicle, further demonstrating that the Drosophila Eya-Six regulatory cassette is evolutionarily conserved during mammalian inner ear development. We also analyzed several other otic markers and found that the expression of Pax2 and Pax8 was unaffected in Six1(-/-) otic vesicle. By contrast, Six1 is required for the activation of Fgf3 expression and the maintenance of Fgf10 and Bmp4 expression in the otic vesicle. Furthermore, loss of Six1 function alters the expression pattern of Nkx5.1 and Gata3, indicating that Six1 is required for regional specification of the otic vesicle. Finally, our data suggest that the interaction between Eya1 and Six1 is crucial for the morphogenesis of the cochlea and the posterior ampulla during inner ear development. These analyses establish a role for Six1 in early growth and patterning of the otic vesicle.","dc:creator":"Zheng W","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"The role of Six1 in mammalian auditory system development."},"rdfs:label":"SIX1 expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d51fe465-4ad4-42d5-b4fa-eff766ba21b2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5aadab1e-e956-4b7c-a19f-93c8e62d380c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"This study performed multiple experiments to determine the effect of 3 variants identified in BOR patients in this paper.

Recently, eight mutations in the SIX1 homeobox gene were discovered in BOR patients. To characterize the effect of SIX1 BOR mutations on the EYA-SIX1-DNA complex, we expressed and purified six of the eight mutants in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that only the most N-terminal mutation in SIX1 (V17E) completely abolishes SIX1-EYA complex formation, whereas all of the other mutants are able to form a stable complex with EYA. We further show that only the V17E mutant fails to localize EYA to the nucleus and cannot be stabilized by EYA in the cell. The remaining five SIX1 mutants are instead all deficient in DNA binding. In contrast, V17E alone has a DNA binding affinity similar to that of wild type SIX1 in complex with the EYA co-factor. Finally, we show that all SIX1 BOR mutants are defective in transcriptional activation using luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that the SIX1 BOR mutations contribute to the pathology of the disease through at least two different mechanisms that involve: 1) abolishing the formation of the SIX1-EYA complex or 2) diminishing the ability of SIX1 to bind DNA. Furthermore, our data demonstrate for the first time that EYA: 1) requires the N-terminal region of the SIX1 Six domain for its interaction, 2) increases the level of the SIX1 protein within the cell, and 3) increases the DNA binding affinity of SIX1.","dc:creator":"Patrick AN","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Biochemical and functional characterization of six SIX1 Branchio-oto-renal syndrome mutations."},"rdfs:label":"variant interaction with EYA2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This study performed extensive experimental analyses on all of the variants in SIX1 published in the literature to date.

We mapped the catweasel mutation to a critical region of 13 Mb on chromosome 12 containing the Six1, -4 and -6 genes. We identified a basepair substitution in exon 1 of the Six1 gene that changes a conserved glutamic acid (E) at position 121 to a glycine (G) in the Six1 homeodomain.

The first case was published in 2004 by Ruf et al. Some affected individuals do not have any renal phenotype, and are sometimes considered to have branchio-otic syndrome. Mutai 2013 reported a mother and child with the p.Arg110Trp variant in SIX1, which was previously reported in a family with BOR syndrome, who did not have any other clinical features of BOR other than hearing loss. The association with nonsyndromic hearing loss, however, has not been replicated. In a family reported by Salam et al. 2000 with linkage to a novel autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss locus DFNA23, Ruf 2004 later identified a missense variant in SIX1, but also that an affected individual had progressive renal failure, indicating this family may have actually had BOR syndrome. Functional studies indicate that SIX1 interacts with EYA1, the most common cause of BOR syndrome, and that pathogenic variants in SIX1 impair the protein's ability to bind EYA1 or to bind DNA (Ruf et al. 2004, Patrick et al. 2009) and two mouse models of BOR syndrome have been generated (Zheng et al. 2003, Bosman et al. 2009). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern for BOR and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. Therefore, all of the disease entitites have been lumped into one disease entity, AD BOR. In summary, SIX1 is definitively associated with AD BOR.
