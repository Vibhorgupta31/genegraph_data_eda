Compared with human L-type PK, R-type PK was 31 amino acids longer at the amino terminus. We also cloned and characterized R-type PK cDNA clones from patients with hereditary hemolytic anemia from a PK deficiency, PK Tokyo. A single nucleotide substitution (ACG to ATG) was found at nucleotide 1151 of the coding sequence of the R-type PK, which caused an amino acid substitution, Thr384----Met. Dot blot hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from patients and their parents by allele-specific oligonucleotide probes showed that the parents, who were second cousins, were heterozygous. To confirm that the nucleotide change was responsible for the variant phenotype, we expressed the L-type PK with the single amino acid change in Escherichia coli and characterized the enzyme. The variant PK was thermolabile and moved slowly in the polyacrylamide gel buffered in 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.3; these characteristics were fully compatible with data obtained from the patient's PK.

These studies are the first to correlate the clinical symptoms with the molecular properties of the mutant enzymes. Mutations greatly impairing thermostability and/or activity are associated with severe anemia. Some mutant proteins exhibit moderate changes in the kinetic parameters, which are sufficient to cause mild to severe anemia, underlining the crucial role of RPK for erythrocyte metabolism. Prediction of the effects of mutations is difficult because there is no relation between the nature and location of the replaced amino acid and the type of molecular perturbation.

Molecular characterisation of the PK gene mutations included restriction enzyme analysis, mutation scanning and gene sequencing.

Eight mutations involved a splice site, 31 missense mutations were located in crucial domains of the molecule (catalytic site, cleft between the A and C domains, A/A' interface) and two cases of insertion-deletion were found. In total, 20 new mutations modifying the structure of the enzyme and seven affecting a splice site are reported. PK deficiency is an under diagnosed disease.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found distinct differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotype. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal recessive pyruvate kinase deficiency and autosomal dominant pyruvate kinase hyperactivity. Due to very limited evidence, a curation for autosomal dominant pyruvate kinase hyperactivity was deemed unnecessary. At least 19 variants (missense, in-frame deletion, splicing, and nonsense) that have been reported in more than 20 probands in 4 publications are included in this curation (PMID: 1896471, 9057665, 9827908, 16704447). While a wide array of mutations are linked to disease, there are three recurrent mutations seen in affected patients (two missense and one nonsense). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression, functional alteration, and a mouse model; PMID: 1896471, 17466543, 11960989). Prenatal anemia can present with hydrops fetalis or fetal demise. Confirmation of anemia and PKD deficiency is possible via umbilical blood vessel sampling and amniocentesis. Neonatal diagnosis of jaundice/anemia is also possible. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between PKLR and autosomal recessive PKD. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Prenatal GCEP on the meeting date 2/07/2024 (SOP Version 10).\nThe genetic evidence should total to 10.7 pts. as I added 1.5 pts. to the total score (0.5 each for recurrent mutations p.Arg486Trp, p.Arg532Trp, & p.Gln241Ter).
