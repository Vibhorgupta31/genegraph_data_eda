A critical step in this process is DNA ligation, involving the Xrcc4-DNA ligase IV complex. DNA end processing is often a prerequisite for ligation, but the coordination of these events is poorly understood. We show that polynucleotide kinase (PNK), with its ability to process ionizing radiation-induced 5'-OH and 3'-phosphate DNA termini, functions in NHEJ via an FHA-dependent interaction with CK2-phosphorylated Xrcc4. Analysis of the PNK FHA-Xrcc4 interaction revealed that the PNK FHA domain binds phosphopeptides with a unique selectivity among FHA domains. Disruption of the Xrcc4-PNK interaction in vivo is associated with increased radiosensitivity and slower repair kinetics of DSBs, in conjunction with a diminished efficiency of DNA end joining in vitro. Therefore, these results suggest a new role for Xrcc4 in the coordination of DNA end processing with DNA ligation.","dc:creator":"Koch CA","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Xrcc4 physically links DNA end processing by polynucleotide kinase to DNA ligation by DNA ligase IV."},"rdfs:label":"PNK physically interacts with Xrcc4 in an FHA-dependent mann"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:804bf63c-e29c-4aa6-a480-0fbb7f5fc589","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0d2f5270-d81d-4314-8bc8-400d5d32d824","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"DNA repair is required for neuron proliferation in early development.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20118933","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Maintenance of DNA integrity is crucial for all cell types, but neurons are particularly sensitive to mutations in DNA repair genes, which lead to both abnormal development and neurodegeneration.

Using genome-wide linkage analysis in consanguineous families, we mapped the disease locus to chromosome 19q13.33 and identified multiple mutations in PNKP (polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase) that result in severe neurological disease; in contrast, a splicing mutation is associated with more moderate symptoms. Unexpectedly, although the cells of individuals carrying this mutation are sensitive to radiation and other DNA-damaging agents, no such individual has yet developed cancer or immunodeficiency.

To investigate the molecular basis of this disease, we examined the impact of MCSZ mutations on PNKP activity in vitro and in cells. Three of the four mutations currently associated with MCSZ greatly reduce or ablate DNA kinase activity of recombinant PNKP at 30°C (L176F, T424Gfs48X and exon15Δfs4X), but only one of these mutations reduces DNA phosphatase activity under the same conditions (L176F). The fourth mutation (E326K) has little impact on either DNA kinase or DNA phosphatase activity at 30°C, but is less stable than the wild-type enzyme at physiological temperature. Critically, all of the MCSZ mutations identified to date result in ∼ 10-fold reduced cellular levels of PNKP protein, and reduced rates of chromosomal DNA strand break repair. Together, these data suggest that all four known MCSZ mutations reduce the cellular stability and level of PNKP protein, with three mutations likely ablating cellular DNA 5'-kinase activity and all of the mutations greatly reducing cellular DNA 3'-phosphatase activity.","dc:creator":"Reynolds JJ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Impact of PNKP mutations associated with microcephaly, seizures and developmental delay on enzyme activity and DNA strand break repair."},"rdfs:label":"PNKP levels and activity in MCSZ lymphoblastoid cell extract"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:901a984a-c678-4f35-81c2-9436785d3698_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:901a984a-c678-4f35-81c2-9436785d3698_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:901a984a-c678-4f35-81c2-9436785d3698_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:756b2aa9-f5fb-4132-83a1-0edd8018b52b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c4d037e-2b8d-433b-a2a6-9aa05ff39066","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0012444"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:756b2aa9-f5fb-4132-83a1-0edd8018b52b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:cd74f91d-3e42-4294-b956-7b3456089a20","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007254.4(PNKP):c.1028C>T (p.Pro343Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA309494116"}},{"id":"cggv:408a9047-81ed-44d3-80e5-3c38da886dfd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007254.4(PNKP):c.1315_1320del (p.Arg439_Ala440del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA916079811"}}],"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29243230","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Taniguchi-Ikeda M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Two patients with PNKP mutations presenting with microcephaly, seizure, and oculomotor apraxia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29243230","rdfs:label":"29243230_Patient2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9fdf626c-9bb9-48e9-bf83-8236a793bed8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20183d56-d1da-4ba4-8da0-258a1162d7b5","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","variant":{"id":"cggv:9fdf626c-9bb9-48e9-bf83-8236a793bed8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:2df05d6f-5af0-4ccf-b3ed-aa7aee6a296d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007254.4(PNKP):c.1253_1269dup (p.Thr424GlyfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA213109"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20118933"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20118933","rdfs:label":"20118933_Family5_II:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"First family with founder variant was scored with full 2 points;
