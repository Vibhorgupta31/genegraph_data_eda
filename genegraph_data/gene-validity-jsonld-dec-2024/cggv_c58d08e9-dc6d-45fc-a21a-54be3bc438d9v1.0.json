GAG accumulation in these lesions leads to unique skeletal dysplasia in MPS IVA patients. Clinical, radiographic, and biochemical tests are needed to complete the diagnosis of MPS IVA since some clinical characteristics in MPS IVA are overlapped with other disorders. Early and accurate diagnosis is vital to optimizing patient management, which provides a better quality of life and prolonged life-time in MPS IVA patients. Currently, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are available for patients with MPS IVA. However, ERT and HSCT do not have enough impact on bone and cartilage lesions in patients with MPS IVA. Penetrating the deficient enzyme into an avascular lesion remains an unmet challenge, and several innovative therapies are under development in a preclinical study. In this review article, we comprehensively describe the current diagnosis, treatment, and management for MPS IVA.

Additionally, by 12 months old, vacuolar change is observed in the visceral epithelial cells of glomeruli and cells at the base of heart valves but it is not present in parenchymal cells such as hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells. In the brain, hippocampal and neocortical neurons and meningeal cells had lysosomal storage.

All data were analyzed to determine common alleles, geographic distribution, level of homozygosity, and genotype-phenotype correlation. Moreover, variants were classified according to their pathogenicity as suggested by ACMG. Including those previously published, we assembled 446 unique variants, among which 68 were novel, from 1190 subjects (including newborn screening positive subjects). Variants' distribution was missense (65.0%), followed by nonsense (8.1%), splicing (7.2%), small frameshift deletions(del)/insertions(ins) (7.0%), intronic (4.0%), and large del/ins and complex rearrangements (3.8%). Half (50.4%) of the subjects were homozygous, 37.1% were compound heterozygous, and 10.7% had only one variant detected. The novel variants underwent in silico analysis to evaluate their pathogenicity. All variants were submitted to ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) to make them publicly available.

The nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA derived from a patient with classical Morquio disease revealed a two-base deletion at nucleotide position 1343-1344 (1344-1345 or 1345-1346) that altered the reading frame (designated 1342delCA). This mutation, inherited from the proband's consanguineous parents, was revealed by TaqI restriction analysis of a cDNA fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. In the proband with the mild form of the disease, a C to G transversion at nucleotide 667 predicted the substitution of Lys for Asn204 (N204K). Since a new AluI site was created by the N204K mutation, restriction analysis indicated that the affected brothers were homozygous for this mutation, as confirmed by the finding that both their parents had this lesion.

The phenotypic spectrum of mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is a continuum that ranges from a severe and rapidly progressive early-onset form to a slowly progressive later-onset form (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148668/). The characteristic features include kyphoscoliosis, genu valgum (knock-knee), pectus carinatum, arthritis, respiratory compromise, obstructive sleep apnea, valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, visual impairment from corneal clouding, dental abnormalities, and hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of MPS IVA involves identification of low N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase (GALNS) enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts.\n\n*GALNS* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive MPS IVA in 1992 (Fukuda et al, PMID: 1522213). More than 200 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 1522213, PMID: 1522213). Several variants are reported to be recurrent and common in affected individuals in specific populations (e.g., Arg386Cys, Ile113Phe, Met391Val). \n\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function.  \n\nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional studies, model organisms and rescue evidence. Patients with MPS IVA show accumulation of keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in various tissues due to the lack of degradation of GAGs because of GALNS deficiency. *GALNS* overexpression or silencing is experimentally shown to inversely affect chondroitin sulfate content (PMID: 18285341, 32102177). *GALNS* knock-out mouse model recapitulates GALNS deficiency, urinary excretion of GAGs and lysosomal accumulation of keratin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate; however, the skeletal features are absent in KO mice (PMID: 14583446). The mouse phenotype is rescued by administration of recombinant human GALNS enzyme produced in CHO cells (PMID: 18056156). The recombinant enzyme (elosulfase alfa) is also an FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy in humans and is reported to improve symptoms of MPS IVA (PMID: 24810369).\n\nIn summary, *GALNS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive mucopolysaccharidosis type 4A. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c58d08e9-dc6d-45fc-a21a-54be3bc438d9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
