More than 95% of patients are homozygous for 90-1,300 repeat expansion on both alleles. The remaining patients have been shown to be compound heterozygous for a GAA expansion on one allele and a micromutation on the other. The reduction of both frataxin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was found to be proportional to the size of the smaller GAA repeat allele. We report a clinical and molecular study of 12 families in which classical FRDA patients were heterozygous for a GAA expansion on one allele. Sequence analysis of the FXN gene allowed the identification of the second disease-causing mutation in each heterozygous patient, which makes this the second largest series of FRDA compound heterozygotes reported thus far. We have identified seven mutations, four of which are novel. Five patients carried missense mutations, whereas eight patients carried null (frameshift or nonsense) mutations. Quantitation of frataxin levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from six compound heterozygous patients showed a statistically significant correlation of residual protein levels with the age at onset (r = 0.82, p < 0.05) or the GAA expansion (r = -0.76, p < 0.1). In the group of patients heterozygous for a null allele, a strong (r = -0.94, p < 0.01) correlation was observed between the size of GAA expansion and the age at onset, thus lending support to the hypothesis that the residual function of frataxin in patients' cells derive exclusively from the expanded allele.","dc:creator":"Gellera C","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Frataxin gene point mutations in Italian Friedreich ataxia patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17703324","rdfs:label":"P585"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The GAA trinucleotide expansion was shown to pertub transcription, supporting one varint LOF.

Human frataxin (fxn) is severely reduced in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), a frequent autosomal recessive neuro- and cardio-degenerative disease. Whereas the function of fxn is unknown, the yeast frataxin homolog (Yfh1p) has been shown to be involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from free radical toxicity. Evidence of iron accumulation and oxidative damage in cardiac tissue from FRDA patients suggests that fxn may have a similar function, but whether yeast and human frataxin actually have interchangeable roles in mitochondrial iron homeostasis is unknown. We show that a wild-type FRDA cDNA can complement Yfh1p-deficient yeast (yfh1 delta) by preventing the mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative damage associated with loss of Yfh1p. We analyze the functional effects of two FRDA point mutations, G130V and W173G, associated with a mild and a severe clinical presentation, respectively. The G130V mutation affects protein stability and results in low levels of mature (m) fxn, which are nevertheless sufficient to rescue yfh1 delta yeast. The W173G mutation affects protein processing and stability and results in severe m-fxn deficiency. Expression of the FRDA (W173G) cDNA in yfh1 delta yeast leads to increased levels of mitochondrial iron which are not as elevated as in Yfh1p-deficient cells but are above the threshold for oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA and iron-sulfur centers, causing a typical yfh1 delta phenotype.

Despite the importance of neurodegeneration in FRDA, little is known about the consequences of frataxin deficiency in neuronal cells. Here we describe a neuronal cell model for FRDA based on the use of lentiviral vectors that carry minigenes encoding frataxin-specific shRNAs that silence the expression of this gene. These lentivectors can knockdown frataxin expression in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which results in large-scale cell death in differentiated neuron-like cells but not in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells. Frataxin-deficient neuron-like cells appear to die through apoptosis that is accompanied by up-regulation of p53, PUMA and Bax and activation of caspase-3. No significant autophagy is observed in frataxin-deficient neuron-like cells and the pharmacological activation of autophagy does not significantly increase neuronal cell death in response to the frataxin deficiency. Cell death triggered by frataxin knockdown can be impaired by interference with p53, caspase inhibitors and gene transfer of FXN. These results suggest that frataxin gene silencing in human neuron-like cells may constitute a useful cell model to characterize the molecular changes triggered by frataxin deficiency in neurons, as well as to search for therapies that may protect against neurodegeneration.","dc:creator":"Palomo GM","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Silencing of frataxin gene expression triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in human neuron-like cells."},"rdfs:label":"FXN Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ec3f674b-1e71-4254-a0f9-f8909becff59_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb66a8bc-1872-4db6-9c7b-a190699b652a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:679aa4a4-0fc0-4757-8bf2-e3ee8a3aed46","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":" Line Y47 was originally shown to only have one copy of the transgene incorportated, but all subsequent generations showed 2 copies.

The human frataxin was expressed in the appropriate tissues at levels comparable to the endogenous mouse frataxin, and it was correctly processed and localised to mitochondria.

FRDA is caused by severely reduced levels of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein of unknown function. Yeast knockout models as well as histological and biochemical data from heart biopsies or autopsies of FRDA patients have shown that frataxin defects cause a specific iron-sulfur protein deficiency and intramitochondrial iron accumulation. We have recently shown that complete absence of frataxin in the mouse leads to early embryonic lethality, demonstrating an important role for frataxin during mouse development. Through a conditional gene-targeting approach, we have generated in parallel a striated muscle frataxin-deficient line and a neuron/cardiac muscle frataxin-deficient line, which together reproduce important progressive pathophysiological and biochemical features of the human disease: cardiac hypertrophy without skeletal muscle involvement, large sensory neuron dysfunction without alteration of the small sensory and motor neurons, and deficient activities of complexes I-III of the respiratory chain and of the aconitases.

Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and ataxia, dysarthria, scoliosis, and cardiomyopathy. Homozygous inheritance of a GAA trinucleotide expansion within intron 1 of FXN accounts for 95% of Friedrich ataxia cases, while 5% of cases are due to compound heterozygous mutations including missense and nonsense mutations in FXN on one allele and the GAA trinucleotide repeat on the second allele (Burk 2017; PMID: 28405347; Delatycki 2000, PMID: 10633128). Friedreich ataxia was first described in 1863, by Nikolaus Friedreich, but it was not until 1996 that Campuzano and colleagues (PMID: 8596916) identified FXN as the causative gene responsible for Friedreich ataxia (Schulz 2013, PMID: 24024236). Many more cases are reported in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has already been reached. Of note, FXN is a gene that is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals, and haplotype analysis has revealed a common ancestor originating from the Franco-Cantabrian ice age refuge (reviewed in Burk 2017, PMID: 28405347). The mechanism for disease is loss of function, as the GAA trinucleotide expansion results in the loss of FXN transcript due to epigenetic regulation. Loss of FXN (frataxin) results in reduced iron homeostasis within mitochondria, and results in mitochondrial dysfunction. This gene-disease association is supported by the function of the gene product, animal models, and rescue experiments. In summary, FXN is definitively associated with Friedreich ataxia. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nData on the occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or cardiomyopathy in individuals with Friedreich ataxia was collected by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Committee (subgroup of the Cardiovascular Working Group). Loss of FXN results in the development of cardiomyopathy in ~92% of patients with Friedreich ataxia, and for 60% of these individual’s heart failure is the primary cause of death within the third to fifth decade of life (Payne and Wagner 2012, PMID: 22764179). The cardiomyopathy involved in Friedreich ataxia includes left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired myocardial perfusion, and arrhythmias. The cardiac hypertrophy observed in Friedreich ataxia was noted to differ from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as it is caused by increased proliferation of dysfunctional mitochondria within the cardiomyocytes which can ultimately lead to a dilated left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction (Payne and Wagner 2012, PMID: 22764179; Payne and Perverill 2012; PMID: 22373590).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ec3f674b-1e71-4254-a0f9-f8909becff59"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
