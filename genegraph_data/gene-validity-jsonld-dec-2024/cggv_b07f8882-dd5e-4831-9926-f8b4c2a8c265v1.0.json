Impaired p27(KIP1) expression and/or localization are often observed in tumor cells, further confirming its central role in regulating the cell cycle. Recently, germline mutations in CDKN1B have been associated with the inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 4, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by varying combinations of tumors affecting at least two endocrine organs. In this study we identified a 4-bp deletion in a highly conserved regulatory upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5'UTR of the CDKN1B gene in a patient with a pituitary adenoma and a well-differentiated pancreatic neoplasm. This deletion causes the shift of the uORF termination codon with the consequent lengthening of the uORF-encoded peptide and the drastic shortening of the intercistronic space. Our data on the immunohistochemical analysis of the patient's pancreatic lesion, functional studies based on dual-luciferase assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and on polysome profiling show a negative influence of this deletion on the translation reinitiation at the CDKN1B starting site, with a consequent reduction in p27(KIP1) expression. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to the previously described mechanisms leading to reduced p27(KIP1) activity, such as degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway or non-covalent sequestration, p27(KIP1) activity can also be modulated by an uORF and mutations affecting uORF could change p27(KIP1) expression.

Currently, the molecular mechanisms mediating the role of p27 in tumor predisposition are ill defined. We here report a novel germline missense variant in CDKN1B (c.678C>T, p.P69L) found in a patient with multiple endocrine tumors. We previously reported a nonsense p27 mutation (c.692G>A, p.W76X) in two patients with MEN1-like phenotype. Functional assays were used to characterize p27P69L and p27W76X in vitro. We show that p27P69L is expressed at reduced level and is impaired in both binding toCdk2 and inhibiting cell growth. p27W76X, which is mislocalized to the cytoplasm, can no longer efficiently bind Cyclins-Cdks, nor inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis. In the patient’s tumor tissues, p27P69L associates with reduced/absent p27 expression and in one tumor with loss-of heterozygosity.Our results extend previous findings of CDKN1B mutations in patients with MEN1-related states and support the hypothesis of a tumor suppressor role for p27 in neuroendocrine cells.","dc:creator":"Molatore S","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A novel germline CDKN1B mutation causing multiple endocrine tumors: clinical, genetic and functional characterization."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20824794","rdfs:label":"FL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"p27P69L is consistently expressed at reduced level compared to p27wt in all cell lines (Fig. 1B).

CDKN1B is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, and its loss is associated with disease progression and unfavorable outcome in many cancer types. CDKN1B show very low nuclear expression in parathyroid adenoma cells and endocrine pancreatic tumor from MEN4 patients. p27wt inhibits the growth of p27-negative GH3 cells in clonogenic assay while p27W76X does not. Mouse and Rat models have been established to show the development of multiple endocrine tumors with CDKN1B deficiency.
