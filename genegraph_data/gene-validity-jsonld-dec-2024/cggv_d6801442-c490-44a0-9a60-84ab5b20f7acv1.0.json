The term MYH9-RD encompasses four autosomal-dominant thrombocytopenias that were previously described as distinct disorders, namely May-Hegglin Anomaly, Sebastian, Fechtner and Epstein syndromes. Thrombocytopenia is usually mild and derives from complex defects of megakaryocyte maturation and platelet formation. It is easily diagnosed, in that the presence of giant platelets in peripheral blood raises the suspicion of MYH9-RD and a simple immunofluorescence test on blood films confirms the diagnostic hypothesis. However, genotype/phenotype correlations have been recognized and mutation screening is therefore required to define the risk of acquiring extra-haematological defects.

A primary step toward the understanding of the role of MYH9 in hearing and its dysfunction is the documentation of its cellular and sub-cellular localization within the cochlea, the auditory organ. We describe the localization of Myh9 within the mouse cochlea using a polyclonal anti-Myh9-antibody, generated against an 18 amino acid long peptide corresponding to the sequence at the C-terminus of mouse Myh9. The anti-Myh9 antibody identified a single, specific, immunoreactive band of 220 kDa in immunoblot analysis of homogenate from a variety of different mouse tissues. The Myh9 antibody cross-reacts with the rat but not the human orthologue. Myh9 is expressed predominantly within the spiral ligament as well as in the sensory hair cells of the organ of Corti. Confocal microscopy of cochlear surface preparations, identified Myh9 within the inner and outer hair cells and their stereocilia.

We used negative-stain electron microscopy to analyze paracrystal morphology, a model system for the assembly of individual myosin-II molecules into bipolar filaments. Wild-type tail fragments formed ordered paracrystal arrays, whereas mutants formed aberrant aggregates. In mixing experiments, the mutants act dominantly to interfere with the proper assembly of wild type. Using circular dichroism, we find that 2 mutants affect the alpha-helical coiled-coil structure of individual molecules, and 2 mutants disrupt the lateral associations among individual molecules necessary to form higher-order assemblies, helping explain the dominant effects of these mutants.

In subjects with R1933X and E1945X mutations, the whole NMMHC-IIA of platelets and Mks was wild-type. No NMMHC-IIA inclusions were observed at any time of Mk maturation. In granulocytes, the extent of NMMHC-IIA reduction in patients with respect to control cells was significantly greater than that measured in platelets and Mks, and we found that wild-type protein was sequestered within most of the NMMHC-IIA inclusions. Altogether these results indicate that haploinsufficiency of NMMHC-IIA in megakaryocytic lineage is the mechanism of macrothrombocytopenia consequent to MYH9 mutations, whereas in granulocytes a dominant-negative effect of mutant allele is involved in the formation of inclusion bodies. The finding that the same mutations act through different mechanisms in different cells is surprising and requires further investigation.","dc:creator":"Pecci A","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Pathogenetic mechanisms of hematological abnormalities of patients with MYH9 mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Patient protein expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:d6801442-c490-44a0-9a60-84ab5b20f7ac_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:befc8b9a-d0b0-4d10-8c1f-1aefbe2882d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eba0711d-a306-4b8d-a47f-153ffd9f7063","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Replicates results of embryonic lethality of homozygous LOF in Matsushita 2004 and Conti 2004","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16630581","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Multiple mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell banks expand the capability to characterize functions of genes implicated in human disease and to develop mouse models for the further understanding of disease pathology. Genetic diseases that result in hearing loss can provide insight into causative molecular mechanisms for deafness. We utilized BayGenomics, the public mouse ES cell bank, to identify gene-trapped ES cell lines associated with hearing loss. We identified two gene-trapped ES cell lines specific for the non-muscle myosin heavy chain class IIA or myosin heavy chain IX (Myh9). Inherited mutations in the Myh9 gene have been linked to non-syndromic hereditary hearing impairment DFNA17 as well as 'MYH9-related disease' characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, leukocyte inclusions, and in some patients deafness. Mutant Myh9 mice were derived from one of these ES cell lines that underwent germline transmission for in-depth otological examination. No homozygous mice however were identified at birth, consistent with recently published data describing the embryonic lethality of homozygous mutations in Myh9. We provide evidence that adult heterozygous Myh9 mouse inner ears contain half wild-type levels of Myh9 mRNA. Hearing loss however was not observed in heterozygous Myh9 mice in contrast to human Myh9-related diseases. Aged heterozygous Myh9 mice also did not show signs of cochleosaccular degeneration common in DFNA17. Although inheritance of Myh9 mutations in humans is dominant, we conclude that heterozygous loss of Myh9 is not critical to hearing function in mice by itself.","dc:creator":"Parker LL","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Absence of hearing loss in a mouse model for DFNA17 and MYH9-related disease: the use of public gene-targeted ES cell resources."},"rdfs:label":"Homozygous MYH9 loss mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Embryonic lethality is not consistent with human phenotype but this was homozygous and inheritance pattern is AR."},{"id":"cggv:2541f045-ef99-4ff5-9657-d378322751e0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43057a4d-0df6-44ab-a572-3bb27c8f3414","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"All three developed macrothrombocytopenia with prolonged bleeding times, a defect in clot retraction, increased megakaryocytes.

R702C mutant human cDNA fused with green fluorescent protein was introduced into the first coding exon of Myh9, and D1424N and E1841K mutations were introduced directly into the corresponding exons.

All heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice show macrothrombocytopenia with prolonged bleeding times, a defect in clot retraction, and increased extramedullary megakaryocytes. Studies of cultured megakaryocytes and live-cell imaging of megakaryocytes in the BM show that heterozygous R702C megakaryocytes form fewer and shorter proplatelets with less branching and larger buds. The results indicate that disrupted proplatelet formation contributes to the macrothrombocytopenia in mice and most probably in humans. We also observed premature cataract formation, kidney abnormalities, including albuminuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and progressive kidney disease, and mild hearing loss.

MYH9 disorders are characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and very characteristic inclusion bodies in granulocytes. MYH9 disorders frequently cause nephritis, sensorineural hearing disability and cataracts. One of the most common and deleterious mutations causing these disorders is the R702C missense mutation. We generated knock-in mice expressing the Myh9 R702C mutation. R702C knock-in hetero mice (R702C+/- mice) showed macrothrombocytopenia. We studied megakaryopoiesis of cultured fetal liver cells of R702C+/- mice and found that proplatelet formation was impaired: the number of proplatelet tips was decreased, proplatelet size was increased, and proplatelet shafts were short and enlarged. Although granulocyte inclusion bodies were not visible by May-Grünwald Giemsa staining, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that NMMHCIIA proteins aggregated and accumulated in the granulocyte cytoplasm. In other organs, R702C+/- mice displayed albuminuria which increased with age. Renal pathology examination revealed glomerulosclerosis. Sensory hearing loss was indicated by lowered auditory brainstem response. These findings indicate that Myh9 R702C knock-in mice mirror features of human MYH9 disorders arising from the R702C mutation.

This association was assessed using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 12/11/2017. Recent reviews report that missense variants are located at only 21 of the 1,960 amino acid residues of the protein (Balduini 2011, De Rocco 2013, Pecci 2014). Nonsense or frameshift variants of MYH9 have only been reported in the last exon of the gene. A genotype-phenotype correlation has been shown repeatedly (Dong 2005, Pecci 2008, Pecci 2014, Saposnik 2014). There are several reports of the p.Arg705His variant in MYH9 causing nonsyndromic hearing loss, DFNA17 (Lalwani 2000, Hildebrand 2006). However, no testing for the blood phenotype was reported in any affected individuals in these families, and at least two other individuals with the hematological features of MYH9-RD had the same variant (Verver 2015). These data suggest nonsyndromic hearing loss may not be a distinct entity from MYH9-RD. Hearing loss is not a fully penetrant feature of MYH9-RD; a review of cases indicated approximately 48% of patients have hearing loss (Pecci 2014). Individuals presenting with nonsyndromic hearing loss who are found to have a pathogenic variant in MYH9 should be tested for the other phenotypes of MYH9-RD. In vitro functional evidence indicates that disease-causing variants may act through different molecular mechanisms in different cell types (Franke 2005, Hu 2002, Pecci 2005), exhibiting a dominant-negative effect on wild-type protein in granulocytes and haploinsufficiency in megakaryocytes and platelets (Pecci 2005). Four knock-in mouse models harboring 3 different human variants in MYH9 fully recapitulated the human phenotype of MYH9-RD (Zhang 2012, Suzuki 2013). In summary, MYH9 is definitively associated with AD MYH9-RD. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/20/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d6801442-c490-44a0-9a60-84ab5b20f7ac"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
