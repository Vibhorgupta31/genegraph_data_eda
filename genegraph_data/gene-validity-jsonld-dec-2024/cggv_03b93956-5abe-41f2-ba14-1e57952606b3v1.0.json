Congenital (inherited) forms of myelofibrosis (cMF) have been described, but the underlying genetic mechanisms remain elusive. Here we describe 4 families with autosomal recessive inherited macrothrombocytopenia with focal myelofibrosis due to germ line loss-of-function mutations in the megakaryocyte-specific immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-containing receptor G6b-B (G6b, C6orf25, or MPIG6B). Patients presented with a mild-to-moderate bleeding diathesis, macrothrombocytopenia, anemia, leukocytosis and atypical megakaryocytes associated with a distinctive, focal, perimegakaryocytic pattern of bone marrow fibrosis. In addition to identifying the responsible gene, the description of G6b-B as the mutated protein potentially implicates aberrant G6b-B megakaryocytic signaling and activation in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis. Targeted insertion of human G6b in mice rescued the knockout phenotype and a copy number effect of human G6b-B expression was observed. Homozygous knockin mice expressed 25% of human G6b-B and exhibited a marginal reduction in platelet count and mild alterations in platelet function; these phenotypes were more severe in heterozygous mice that expressed only 12% of human G6b-B. This study establishes G6b-B as a critical regulator of platelet homeostasis in humans and mice. In addition, the humanized G6b mouse will provide an invaluable tool for further investigating the physiological functions of human G6b-B as well as testing the efficacy of drugs targeting this receptor.","dc:creator":"Hofmann I","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Congenital macrothrombocytopenia with focal myelofibrosis due to mutations in human G6b-B is rescued in humanized mice."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29898956","rdfs:label":"2-II-6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The homozygous frameshift variant Ala52Glyfs generates a premature stop codon in exon 4 of 6 which is predicted to result in NMD.

Megakaryocyte/platelet (MP)-specific deletion of Shp1 in mice resulted in platelets being less responsive to collagen-related peptide due to reduced GPVI expression and signaling via the Src family kinase (SFK)-Syk-PLCγ2 pathway, and fibrinogen due to reduced SFK activity. By contrast, deletion of Shp2 in the MP lineage resulted in macrothrombocytopenia and platelets being hyper-responsive to anti-CLEC-2 antibody and fibrinogen. Shp1- and Shp2-deficient megakaryocytes had partial blocks at 2N/4N ploidy; however, only the latter exhibited reduced proplatelet formation, thrombopoietin, and integrin signaling. Mice deficient in both Shp1 and Shp2 were severely macrothrombocytopenic and had reduced platelet surface glycoprotein expression, including GPVI, αIIbβ3, and GPIbα. Megakaryocytes from these mice were blocked at 2N/4N ploidy and did not survive ex vivo. Deletion of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-containing receptor G6b-B in the MP lineage phenocopied multiple features of Shp1/2-deficient mice, suggesting G6b-B is a critical regulator of Shp1 and Shp2. This study establishes Shp1 and Shp2 as major regulators of megakaryocyte development, platelet production, and function.","dc:creator":"Mazharian A","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Megakaryocyte-specific deletion of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases Shp1 and Shp2 causes abnormal megakaryocyte development, platelet production, and function."},"rdfs:label":"Megakaryocyte-specific KO mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The authors found that in MP-specific G6b conditional KO mice there was a reduced platelet half-life and platelet recovery following antibody-mediated depletion and that proplatelet formation was severely abrogated in G6b-B–deficient megakaryocytes.

Hematological analysis revealed that G6b−/− mice were markedly macrothrombocytopenic. The mean platelet count of G6b−/− mice was reduced by 77% and the mean platelet volume was increased by 38% compared with age-matched wild-type control mice (G6b+/+). The spleen, which acts as a site of platelet clearance and production in cases of bone marrow damage, such as myelofibrosis, was moderately enlarged in G6b−/− mice compared to that in control mice. Clusters of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and red pulp of G6b−/− mice suggested that myelofibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis had occurred.

Paradoxically, megakaryocytes, which produce platelets in the bone marrow, remain relatively refractory to the ECM-rich environment of the bone marrow despite having the same repertoire of receptors as platelets. These include the ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)-containing collagen receptor complex, which consists of glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and the Fc receptor γ-chain, and the ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif)-containing receptor G6b-B. We showed that mice lacking G6b-B exhibited macrothrombocytopenia (reduced platelet numbers and the presence of enlarged platelets) and a susceptibility to bleeding as a result of aberrant platelet production and function. Platelet numbers were markedly reduced in G6b-B-deficient mice compared to those in wild-type mice because of increased platelet turnover. Furthermore, megakaryocytes in G6b-B-deficient mice showed enhanced metalloproteinase production, which led to increased shedding of cell-surface receptors, including GPVI and GPIbα. In addition, G6b-B-deficient megakaryocytes exhibited reduced integrin-mediated functions and defective formation of proplatelets, the long filamentous projections from which platelets bud off. Together, these findings establish G6b-B as a major inhibitory receptor regulating megakaryocyte activation, function, and platelet production.","dc:creator":"Mazharian A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mice lacking the ITIM-containing receptor G6b-B exhibit macrothrombocytopenia and aberrant platelet function."},"rdfs:label":"KO Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The authors found that platelet half-life was reduced in G6b−/− mice, demonstrating a substantial increase in platelet clearance in the G6b−/− mice.

At least 5 unique variants (e.g. missense, splicing, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 27743390, 29898956, 31276734). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 7 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its enhanced expression in lymphoid tissue (PMID: 17311996), its inhibitory biochemical function in platelet activation (PMID: 17311996), and mouse models (including knockout, knock-in, megakaryocyte specific conditional knockout, and humanized models) which recapitulate human disease (PMIDs: 23112346, 23509158, 29891536, 29898956).
