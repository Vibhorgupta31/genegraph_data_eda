Truncus arteriosus (TA), characterized by a single arterial vessel arising from both ventricles giving rise to the coronary, pulmonary and systemic arteries, is rare and only responsible for 1% of all CHD. Two consanguineous families with TA were previously identified to have homozygous nonsense variants within the gene NKX2-6. NKX2-6 is a known downstream target of TBX1, an important transcriptional regulator implicated in the cardiac phenotype of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. Herein, we report two siblings with TA presumably caused by compound heterozygous NKX2-6 variants without a history of consanguinity. Two in-house cohorts with conotruncal defects (CTD) were sequenced for variants in NKX2-6 and no additional cases of biallelic NKX2-6 variants were identified. The similar phenotype of these cases, and the clustering of variants that likely result in a truncated protein that disrupts the homeobox domain, suggest that biallelic loss of function for NKX2-6 is a rare genetic etiology for TA in particular, and possibly other types of CHD.","dc:creator":"Ritter A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"NKX2-6 related congenital heart disease: Biallelic homeodomain-disrupting variants and truncus arteriosus."}},{"id":"cggv:99c9f0c2-dbdc-476b-883b-bf53810b3630_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f17d3cb0-9433-4b0c-a3df-f66ae3540f7d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32198970"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:99c9f0c2-dbdc-476b-883b-bf53810b3630","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:99c9f0c2-dbdc-476b-883b-bf53810b3630_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:2023670c-21e7-4c8c-b91d-fd52ffad3d97","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2023670c-21e7-4c8c-b91d-fd52ffad3d97_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:de0bb269-26ce-4bdf-b650-f930bda4fcf7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de0bb269-26ce-4bdf-b650-f930bda4fcf7","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9ed5df0b-b519-47bc-a072-6f4a6d0ca4d1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001136271.3(NKX2-6):c.453_454insT (p.Lys152Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA156433"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"conotruncal heart malformations","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:66a96340-da2d-4eb4-8493-5de2567851b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9ed5df0b-b519-47bc-a072-6f4a6d0ca4d1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24421281","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Truncus arteriosus (TA) accounts for ~1% of congenital heart defects.

A common arterial trunk (CAT) is often diagnosed as PTA in the absence of evidence of embryological mechanism. We have used autozygosity mapping of a large consanguineous family segregating CAT to map the causative locus to chromosome 8p21. An F151L mutation was identified in the homeodomain of NKX2.6, a transcription factor expressed in murine pharyngeal endoderm and embryonic OFT myocardium. Although expression of Nkx2.6 during murine embryogenesis is strongly suggestive of a role for this gene in heart development, mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of Nkx2.6 are normal. However, in these mice, it has been shown that Nkx2.5 expression expands into regions lacking Nkx2.6, suggesting functional complementation. As transcriptional targets of NKX2.6 are unknown, we investigated functional effects of the mutation in transcriptional and protein interaction assays using NKX2.5 as a surrogate. Introduction of F157L into human NKX2.5 substantially reduced its transcription activating function, its synergism with partners at the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and connexin-40 (Cx40) promoters and its specific DNA binding. We tested NKX2.5 target promoters for NKX2.6 activity. NKX2.6 was inactive at ANF but weakly activated transcription of a Cx40 promoter, whereas the F151L mutant lacked this activity. These findings indicate a previously unsuspected role for NKX2.6 in heart development, which should be re-evaluated in more sophisticated model systems.","dc:creator":"Heathcote K","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Common arterial trunk associated with a homeodomain mutation of NKX2.6."}},"rdfs:label":"Kuwaiti family proband"},{"id":"cggv:ff938b4e-4f28-429e-b939-4441eb8205b6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff938b4e-4f28-429e-b939-4441eb8205b6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ff938b4e-4f28-429e-b939-4441eb8205b6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Shows impaired activation and interactions with cofactors at the ANF promoter and DNA binding for NKX binding sites"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"0.1 (x2) points - missense variant \n+0.4 points- functional evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:f3910a6d-6df0-419b-8dee-e5075bfee8f8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":8009,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:eaa99515-5c6a-4a1f-b5e2-9f20a920f016","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:32940","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*NKX2-6* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive congenital heart disease in 2005 (Heathcote et al. 2005; PMID: 15649947).
