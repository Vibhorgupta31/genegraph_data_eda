In 2019, Heyn et al. (PMID: 30478443) described three unrelated probands with a reciprocal phenotype characterized by pre- and post-natal proportionate extreme growth restriction with microcephaly, and global developmental delay, now termed Heyn-Sproul-Jackson  syndrome (HESJAS). While haploinsufficiency is believed to be the mechanism behind the Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome phenotype, the two missense variants currently reported by Heyn et al. are thought to be acting via a gain of function mechanism (PMID:30478443). The split curation for Tatton-Brown-Rahman overgrowth syndrome is assessed separately. \nTwo adjacent variants (W330R and D333N) in three unrelated probands (PMID:30478443) are included in this curation. Neither variant is present in gnomAD. In vitro functional expression studies demonstrated that both W330R and D333N substitutions likely impair DNMT3Aâ€™s binding of methylated histone peptides (PMID:30478443). \n\nThere is evidence of a gain-of-function mechanism of pathogenicity. Analysis of patient-derived fibroblasts and peripheral blood leukocytes showed that the variants altered chromatin binding specificity leading to significant DNA hypermethylation of multiple genes (PMID:30478443). Finally, mouse models harboring these heterozygous variants recapitulated the human phenotype with reduced brain size, and body weight compared to controls(PMID: 30478443). \n \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between *DNMT3A* and  Heyn-Sproul-Jackson (HSJ) syndrome. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 8, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6c4959e0-72fe-49e2-8e7e-639539dc9095"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
