Many factors influence the development of the cerebral cortex to its normal size and neuronal composition. Of these, the mechanisms that influence the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells are of particular interest, as they may have the greatest consequence on brain size, not only during development but also in evolution. In this context, causative genes of human autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, such as ASPM and MCPH1, are attractive candidates, as many of them show positive selection during primate evolution. MCPH1 causes microcephaly in mice and humans and is involved in a diverse array of molecular functions beyond brain development, including DNA repair and chromosome condensation. Positive selection of MCPH1 in the primate lineage has led to much insight and discussion of its role in brain size evolution. In this review, we will present an overview of MCPH1 from these multiple angles, and whilst its specific role in brain size regulation during development and evolution remain elusive, the pieces of the puzzle will be discussed with the aim of putting together the full picture of this fascinating gene.","dc:creator":"Pulvers JN","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"MCPH1: a window into brain development

in *MCPH1* were first reported in relation to autosomal recessive microcephaly with intellectual disability in 2010 (PMID: 20978018). Probands are characterized by microcephaly with mild to moderate intellectual disability or developmental delay, and dysmorphic features including up-slanting palpebral fissure and broad tip nose (PMIDs: 22855649, 25870538, 20978018). Nineteen unique homozygous or compound loss-of-function variants, reported in multiple unrelated probands, in five publications, are included in this curation (PMIDs: 20978018, 25870538, 22855649, 35281599, 35456400). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism for the disease is reported as haploinsufficiency. Currently, the gene-disease relationship is not supported by experimental evidence. Mouse models recapitulating microcephaly are described but were not scored as no developmental delay phenotype was described (PMID: 33542216). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between MCPH1 and autosomal recessive microcephaly with intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
