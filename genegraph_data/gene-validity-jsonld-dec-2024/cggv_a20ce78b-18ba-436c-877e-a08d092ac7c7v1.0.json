BMPR-II is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase that binds BMP-2 and BMP-7 in association with multiple type I receptors, including BMPR-IA/Brk1, BMPR-IB, and ActR-I, which is also an activin type I receptor. Cloning of BMPR-II resulted from a strong interaction of its cytoplasmic domain with diverse transforming growth factor beta family type I receptor cytoplasmic domains in a yeast two-hybrid system. In mammalian cells, however, the interaction of BMPR-II is restricted to BMP type I receptors and is ligand dependent. BMPR-II binds BMP-2 and -7 on its own, but binding is enhanced by coexpression of type I BMP receptors. BMP-2 and BMP-7 can induce a transcriptional response when added to cells coexpressing ActR-I and BMPR-II but not to cells expressing either receptor alone. The kinase activity of both receptors is essential for signaling. Thus, despite their ability to bind to type I and II receptors receptors separately, BMPs appear to require the cooperation of these two receptors for optimal binding and for signal transduction. The combinatorial nature of these receptors and their capacity to crosstalk with the activin receptor system may underlie the multifunctional nature of their ligands.","dc:creator":"Liu F","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Human type II receptor for bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs): extension of the two-kinase receptor model to the BMPs."},"rdfs:label":"Receptor-receptor and receptor-ligand interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b255a52a-f218-45ad-a979-97ea6fea89de","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9a83773-e5df-4634-b292-1b3c88a90465","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The BMPR-II signaling pathway regulates proliferation of pulmonary vascular cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells.

Our objectives were to assess the effect on PAH of upregulating BMPR2 by targeted adenoviral BMPR2 gene delivery to the pulmonary vascular endothelium. We used two established rat models of PAH: chronic hypoxia and monocrotaline (MCT). In both hypertensive models, those receiving BMPR2 had less right ventricular hypertrophy, less pulmonary vascular resistance, improved cardiac function and reduced vascular remodelling. In the MCT model, there was an increase in TGF-Î², which was prevented by BMPR2 treatment. In vitro, TGF-Î²1-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, which was associated with reduced BMPR2 expression. EndMT was partially ameliorated by stimulating BMPR2 signalling with appropriate ligands even in the ongoing presence of TGF-Î²1.

More than 500 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, case-control, segregation and experimental data.\nSummary of case-level data: 12 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 2 publications (PMID:10903931, PMID:10973254). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism is haploinsufficiency (PMID:11115378, PMID: 16429395).\nSummary of experimental data: 6 points. This gene-disease association is supported by expression, biochemical, in vitro functional and animal model data. In summary, BMPR2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PH Working Group on Sept 9, 2020.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a20ce78b-18ba-436c-877e-a08d092ac7c7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
