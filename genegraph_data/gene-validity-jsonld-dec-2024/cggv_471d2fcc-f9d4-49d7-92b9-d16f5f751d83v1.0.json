To date, nine nonsense or frameshift PRX mutations have been reported in eight families with CMT. The patients with PRX mutations appeared to show characteristic clinical features with early onset but slow or no progression, a common result of mutations that lead to missing a C-terminal acidic domain. Here, we report a Japanese CMT patient with these characteristic clinical features, who was a compound heterozygote for PRX R1070X and L132FsX153 mutations. We previously reported that three Japanese isolated families also had the homozygous R1070X mutation. To examine the potential founder effect of the R1070X mutation in the Japanese population, we performed haplotype analysis and found that each R1070X allele lay on a different haplotype background in these four families. Therefore, the high frequency of the R1070X mutation among the Japanese population is not likely the consequence of a founder effect, but probably a result of a mutation hot spot.","dc:creator":"Otagiri T","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Periaxin mutation in Japanese patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease."}},"rdfs:label":"II-1"},{"id":"cggv:add1ad55-b889-4284-b3e6-c1be23d44f2c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:add1ad55-b889-4284-b3e6-c1be23d44f2c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant located in the last exon, it might scape nonsense mRNA decay."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:483971f0-7cae-4e4a-99e0-9476f1039656_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:483971f0-7cae-4e4a-99e0-9476f1039656","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:8154491f-4d82-4deb-8ba1-d7f8a441ad43","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_181882.3(PRX):c.2787del (p.Lys930fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA277608"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:22343ce6-2a97-499c-8e2c-fe6b1e4658b5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8154491f-4d82-4deb-8ba1-d7f8a441ad43"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11133365","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The periaxin gene (PRX) encodes two PDZ-domain proteins, L- and S-periaxin, that are required for maintenance of peripheral nerve myelin.

Each patient had marked sensory involvement; two siblings with a homozygous C715X mutation had much worse sensory impairment than motor impairment. Despite early disease onset, these siblings with the C715X mutation had relatively slow disease progression and adult motor impairment typical of classic demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. In contrast, a patient with the homozygous R82fsX96 mutation had a disease course consistent with Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy. The neuropathology of patients in both families was remarkable for demyelination, onion bulb and occasional tomacula formation with focal myelin thickening, abnormalities of the paranodal myelin loops, and focal absence of paranodal septate-like junctions between the terminal loops and axon.

Inheritance can be autosomal dominant, X-linked or autosomal recessive (ARCMT). Recently, a locus responsible for a demyelinating form of ARCMT disease, named CMT4F, has been mapped on 19q13 in a large consanguineous Lebanese family. L- and S-periaxin are proteins of myelinating Schwann cells and homozygous periaxin-null mice display extensive demyelination of myelinated fibers in the peripheral nervous system, which suggests that the periaxin gene is a good candidate gene for an ARCMT disease. The human gene encoding the periaxins (PRX) was mapped to 19q13, in the CMT4F candidate interval. After characterizing the human PRX gene, we identified a nonsense R196X mutation in the Lebanese family which cosegregated with CMT. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of a sural nerve biopsy of one patient revealed common features with the mouse mutant and the absence of L-periaxin from the myelin sheath. These data confirm the importance of the periaxin proteins to normal Schwann cell function and substantiate the utility of the periaxin-null mouse as a model of ARCMT disease.","dc:creator":"Guilbot

adult rat nerve, periaxin is expressed exclusively in myelinating Schwann cells and is predominately localized to their abaxonal surface.

In developing nerves, periaxin is first detected as Schwann cells ensheathe axons, prior to the appearance of the proteins that characterize the myelin sheath. Periaxin is initially concentrated in the adaxonal membrane (apposing the axon) but, during development, as myelin sheaths mature, periaxin becomes predominately localized at the abaxonal Schwann cell membrane (apposing the basal lamina). In permanently axotomized adult nerves, periaxin is lost from the abaxonal and adaxonal membranes, becomes associated with degenerating myelin sheaths and is phagocytosed by macrophages. In crushed nerves, in which axons regenerate and are remyelinated, periaxin is first detected in the adoxonal membrane as Schwann cells ensheathe regenerating axons, but again prior to the appearance of other myelin proteins. Periaxin mRNA and protein levels change in parallel with those of other myelin-related genes after permanent axotomy and crush. These data demonstrate that periaxin is expressed by myelinating Schwann cells in a dynamic, developmentally regulated manner. The shift in localization of periaxin in the Schwann cell after completion of the spiralization phase of myelination suggests that periaxin participates in membrane-protein interactions that are required to stabilize the mature myelin sheath.","dc:creator":"Scherer SS","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Periaxin expression in myelinating Schwann cells: modulation by axon-glial interactions and polarized localization during development."},"rdfs:label":"Immunohistochemical analysis of periaxin in the PNS"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:471d2fcc-f9d4-49d7-92b9-d16f5f751d83_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:798980fc-f541-41a1-a932-e3fb60cc7189","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31a706fe-7826-4e94-97e9-e8598b9de68d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The knockout mice developed demyelinating neuropathy similar to humans","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10839370","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The Prx gene in Schwann cells encodes L- and S-periaxin, two abundant PDZ domain proteins thought to have a role in the stabilization of myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

Patients had severe and slowly progressive demyelinating CMT with onset in early childhood. A homozygous stop-gain variant, Arg196X, segregated in the affected individuals. Linkage analysis revealed a LOD score of 5.3. PRX mutations have also been frequently reported in patients diagnosed with Dejerine Sottas neuropathy (Boerkoel et al., PMID: 11133365). Both phenotypes are part of the same disease spectrum consisting of early-onset severe demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, autosomal recessive CMT type 4. Ten families with biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense and frameshift) from different publications have been included in this curation. Most variants are localized to the last exon and escape nonsense mediated mRNA decay. Expression of a truncated protein was detected in patient nerve biopsies (PMID: 12112076). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is not known. This gene-disease association is also supported by a PRX knockout mouse model, which developed an unsteady gait phenotype and demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy (PMID: 10839370). In summary, the final classification for PRX is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:471d2fcc-f9d4-49d7-92b9-d16f5f751d83"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
