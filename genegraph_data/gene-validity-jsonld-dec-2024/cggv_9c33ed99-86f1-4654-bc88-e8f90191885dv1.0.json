Recessive mutations in any of 15 genes linked to FA lead to the pathognomonic increased susceptibility to double-strand DNA breaks. Methods Autozygome and exome analysis of a patient with classic FA phenotype Results The authors identified a novel truncating mutation in XRCC2. Consistent with the proposed causal link to FA, this gene is an essential non-redundant component of the RAD51 family of homologous repair proteins and its deficiency in a murine model has been shown to lead to a highly similar phenotype to that of this patient both at the cellular and organismal level. Conclusion This study implicates XRCC2 in the pathogenesis of FA and calls for further investigation of the potential contribution of XRCC2 mutations to the overall mutational load of FA.","dc:creator":"Shamseldin HE","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Exome sequencing reveals a novel Fanconi group defined by XRCC2 mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:bb72e5b4-4894-4256-aa96-4f71d77f080f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb72e5b4-4894-4256-aa96-4f71d77f080f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:bb72e5b4-4894-4256-aa96-4f71d77f080f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The R215X mutant of XRCC2 was generated by Directed Mutagenesis (900677 cells) that have reduced levels of other proteins in the XRCC2-RAD51B-C-D complex, and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.

It forms the BCDX2 complex with RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D, and is required for HR repair. XRCC2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia, complementation group U in 2012 (Shamseldin HE, et al., PMID: 22232082). Fanconi anemia is a rare hereditary disease characterized by genomic instability, developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition, mainly leukemia and solid tumors. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer into separate curations due to phenotypic variability and different inheritance patterns. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal recessive FA-U. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. One homozygous nonsense variant has been reported in one proband in two publications (3 Points, PMIDs: 22232082, 27208205) is included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (2 Points). in vitro functional assays (PMID: 27208205) showed that cells (900677A) from a previously identified patient with biallelic mutation of XRCC2 display cellular hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agent or IR, similar to cells with deficiencies with other well-known FA genes. Importantly, these cellular phenotypes can be rescued by expression of wildtype XRCC2. In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between XRCC2 and autosomal recessive inheritance Fanconi anemia, complementation group U . This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on the meeting date October 27, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
