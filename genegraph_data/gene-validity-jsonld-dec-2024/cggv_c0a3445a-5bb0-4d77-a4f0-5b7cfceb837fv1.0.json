Here, we describe the loss of a gene within the deletion that is responsible for the cardiomyopathy associated with monosomy 1p36, and we confirm its role in nonsyndromic left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). With our own data and publically available data from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we identified a minimal deletion for the cardiomyopathy associated with 1p36del syndrome that included only the terminal 14 exons of the transcription factor PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16), a gene that had previously been shown to direct brown fat determination and differentiation. Resequencing of PRDM16 in a cohort of 75 nonsyndromic individuals with LVNC detected three mutations, including one truncation mutant, one frameshift null mutation, and a single missense mutant. In addition, in a series of cardiac biopsies from 131 individuals with DCM, we found 5 individuals with 4 previously unreported nonsynonymous variants in the coding region of PRDM16. None of the PRDM16 mutations identified were observed in more than 6,400 controls. PRDM16 has not previously been associated with cardiac disease but is localized in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes throughout murine and human development and in the adult heart. Modeling of PRDM16 haploinsufficiency and a human truncation mutant in zebrafish resulted in both contractile dysfunction and partial uncoupling of cardiomyocytes and also revealed evidence of impaired cardiomyocyte proliferative capacity. In conclusion, mutation of PRDM16 causes the cardiomyopathy in 1p36 deletion syndrome as well as a proportion of nonsyndromic LVNC and DCM.

cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heritable, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive heart failure. DCM typically remains clinically silent until adulthood, yet symptomatic disease can develop in childhood. We sought to identify the genetic basis of pediatric DCM in 15 sporadic and three affected-siblings cases, comprised of 21 affected children (mean age, five years) whose parents had normal echocardiograms (mean age, 39 years). Twelve underwent cardiac transplantation and five died with severe heart failure. Parent-offspring whole exome sequencing (WES) data were filtered for rare, deleterious, de novo and recessive variants. In prior work, we reported de novo mutations in TNNT2 and RRAGC and compound heterozygous mutations in ALMS1 and TAF1A among four cases in our cohort. Here, de novo mutations in established DCM genes-RBM20, LMNA, TNNT2, and PRDM16-were identified among five additional cases. The RBM20 mutation was previously reported in familial DCM. An identical unreported LMNA mutation was identified in two unrelated cases, both harboring gene-specific defects in cardiomyocyte nuclear morphology. Collectively, WES had a 50% diagnostic yield in our cohort, providing an explanation for pediatric heart failure and enabling informed family planning.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. The Arndt et al study included analysis of 131 heart biopsies from simplex cases of DCM, from which 4 missense variants (p.Glu271Lys, p.Pro291Leu, p.Lue887Pro and p.Val1101Met) in 5 unrelated individuals were identified. An additional 12 year old patient with mild to moderate LV dysfunction and LV dilatation in addition to features of LV non-compaction carried a truncating variant (p.Lys702X). Another study (Long et al, 2017, PMID: 29367541), reported a 4 month old DCM patient carrying a de novo predicted truncating variant, c.1047dupC (p.S350fsX48).  In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental data. Cardiac localization studies showing that PRDM16 is expressed in LV myocardium in human and mouse hearts. Further, PRDM16 knockdown zebrafish and transgenic zebrafish for the c.2104A>T (p.Lys702X) variant demonstrated bradycardia and significantly reduced cardiac output, however, cardiac output was restored in morphant embryos with increased doses of wild-type human PRDM16 (Ardnt et al, 2013, PMID: 23768516). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of PRDM16 with autosomal dominant DCM.
