These biochemically complex organelles have more than 250 and 150 polypeptides, respectively. To identify the proteins involved in ciliary and basal body biogenesis and function, we undertook a comparative genomics approach that subtracted the nonflagellated proteome of Arabidopsis from the shared proteome of the ciliated/flagellated organisms Chlamydomonas and human. We identified 688 genes that are present exclusively in organisms with flagella and basal bodies and validated these data through a series of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo studies. We then applied this resource to the study of human ciliation disorders and have identified BBS5, a novel gene for Bardet-Biedl syndrome. We show that this novel protein localizes to basal bodies in mouse and C. elegans, is under the regulatory control of daf-19, and is necessary for the generation of both cilia and flagella.","dc:creator":"Li JB","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Comparative genomics identifies a flagellar and basal body proteome that includes the BBS5 human disease gene."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdb1249e-ab95-4d34-a43f-1dbb09eb3d94_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0c44b60-e895-454c-ba84-f8df45a25746_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0c44b60-e895-454c-ba84-f8df45a25746","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:5eb89804-1937-44f8-8e9c-ebe9ddf81ba1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152384.3(BBS5):c.543del (p.Phe181LeufsTer5)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA645520013"}},{"id":"cggv:e261887c-25fc-4459-9662-edab17a64e0e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152384.3(BBS5):c.412C>T (p.Arg138Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA349164655"}}],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:952560fc-f14c-44ea-8a8a-726dd3ad3b80_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5eb89804-1937-44f8-8e9c-ebe9ddf81ba1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31506453","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The multiple genetic approaches available for molecular diagnosis of human diseases have made possible to identify an increasing number of pathogenic genetic changes, particularly with the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. However, the main challenge lies in the interpretation of their functional impact, which has resulted in the widespread use of animal models. We describe here the functional modelling of seven BBS loci variants, most of them novel, in zebrafish embryos to validate their in silico prediction of pathogenicity. We show that target knockdown (KD) of known BBS (BBS1, BB5 or BBS6) loci leads to developmental defects commonly associated with ciliopathies, as previously described. These KD pleiotropic phenotypes were rescued by co-injecting human wild type (WT) loci sequence but not with the equivalent mutated mRNAs, providing evidence of the pathogenic effect of these BBS changes. Furthermore, direct assessment of cilia located in Kupffer's vesicle (KV) showed a reduction of ciliary length associated with all the studied variants, thus confirming a deleterious effect. Taken together, our results seem to prove the pathogenicity of the already classified and unclassified new BBS variants, as well as highlight the usefulness of zebrafish as an animal model for in vivo assays in human ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Castro-SÃ¡nchez S","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Functional analysis of new human Bardet-Biedl syndrome loci specific variants in the zebrafish

These specialized structures require a unique signaling protein composition relative to the rest of the cell to carry out their functions. Defects in ciliary structure and signaling result in a broad group of disorders collectively known as ciliopathies. One ciliopathy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS; OMIM 209900), presents with diverse clinical features, many of which are attributed to defects in ciliary signaling during both embryonic development and postnatal life. For example, patients exhibit obesity, polydactyly, hypogonadism, developmental delay and skeletal abnormalities along with sensory and cognitive deficits, but for many of these phenotypes it is uncertain, which are developmental in origin. A subset of BBS proteins assembles into the core BBSome complex, which is responsible for mediating transport of membrane proteins into and out of the cilium, establishing it as a sensory and signaling hub. Here, we describe two new mouse models for BBS resulting from a targeted LacZ gene trap allele (Bbs5-/-) that is a predicted congenital null mutation and conditional (Bbs5flox/flox) allele of Bbs5. Bbs5-/- mice develop a complex phenotype consisting of increased pre-weaning lethality craniofacial and skeletal defects, ventriculomegaly, infertility and pituitary anomalies. Utilizing the conditional allele, we show that the male fertility defects, ventriculomegaly and pituitary abnormalities are only present when Bbs5 is disrupted prior to postnatal day 7, indicating a developmental origin. In contrast, mutation of Bbs5 results in obesity, independent of the age of Bbs5 loss.","dc:creator":"Bentley-Ford MR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A mouse model of BBS identifies developmental and homeostatic effects of BBS5 mutation and identifies novel pituitary abnormalities."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Incomplete loss of function allele affecting specific tissues; partial phenotype overlap."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8557,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:89d81d65-0329-4d73-87c9-e68701cbbf54","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005308","gene":"hgnc:970","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*BBS5* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) in 2004 (Li et al., PMID: 15137946).
