It is usually inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait, but autosomal-recessive inheritance has also been documented. In an individual with autosomal-recessive AOS, we combined autozygome analysis with exome sequencing to identify a homozygous truncating mutation in dedicator of cytokinesis 6 gene (DOCK6) which encodes an atypical guanidine exchange factor (GEF) known to activate two members of the Rho GTPase family: Cdc42 and Rac1. Another homozygous truncating mutation was identified upon targeted sequencing of DOCK6 in an unrelated individual with AOS. Consistent with the established role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, we demonstrate a cellular phenotype typical of a defective actin cytoskeleton in patient cells. These findings, combined with a Dock6 expression profile that is consistent with an AOS phenotype as well as the very recent demonstration of dominant mutations of ARHGAP31 in AOS, establish Cdc42 and Rac1 as key molecules in the pathogenesis of AOS and suggest that other regulators of these Rho GTPase proteins might be good candidates in the quest to define the genetic spectrum of this genetically heterogeneous condition.","dc:creator":"Shaheen R","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Recessive mutations in DOCK6, encoding the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor DOCK6, lead to abnormal actin cytoskeleton organization and Adams-Oliver syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea64d74c-583d-4ed1-af91-6a7c6f80a1d3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea64d74c-583d-4ed1-af91-6a7c6f80a1d3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64462b5a-3494-41ad-8bf0-ec6687fbd81c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1372a83b-457d-4d4d-b6d1-3511b4d854ae","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblasts from proband V5 showed defects in cytoskeletal organization (rounded phenotype with “blebbing”, unusual elongated morphology and lack of lamellopodia and lateral ruffles).\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21820096","rdfs:label":"Patient and Control Fibroblast Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ea64d74c-583d-4ed1-af91-6a7c6f80a1d3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f55b7b4-564c-433b-85d5-7a3a83cab9c4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42e308f3-5343-43dc-844f-3db330351a83","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Promoted neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17196961","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Small GTPases of the Rho family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are critical regulators of the changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Rho GTPases are typically activated by Dbl-homology (DH)-domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Recent genetic and biochemical studies revealed a new type of GEF for the Rho GTPases. This family is composed of 11 genes, designated as Dock1 to Dock11, and is structurally divided into four classes Dock-A, -B, -C, and -D. Dock-A and -B subfamilies are typically GEFs specific for Rac1, while the Dock-D subfamily is specific for Cdc42. Here we show that Dock6, a member of the Dock-C subfamily, exchanges GDP for GTP for Rac1 and Cdc42 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we find that, in mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, expression of Dock6 is increased following differentiation. Transfection of the catalytic Dock Homology Region-2 (DHR-2) domain of Dock6 promotes neurite outgrowth mediated by Rac1 and Cdc42. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous Dock6 by small interference RNA reduces activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results suggest that Dock6 differs from all of the identified Dock180-related proteins, in that it is the GEF specific for both Rac1 and Cdc42 and may be one of physiological regulators of neurite outgrowth.","dc:creator":"Miyamoto Y","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Dock6, a Dock-C subfamily guanine nucleotide exchanger, has the dual specificity for Rac1 and Cdc42 and regulates neurite outgrowth."},"rdfs:label":"Overexpression of human DOCK6 "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:f76190c8-df81-4f1b-9c20-6843bdff8537","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8aa13148-0557-471b-9b46-6b4b7a53a5c5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Fibroblasts from affected proband showed defects in cytoskeletal organization (rounded phenotype, unusual elongated morphology and lack of lamellopodia and lateral ruffles).

Many affected individuals also have additional malformations, including a variety of intracranial anomalies such as periventricular calcification in keeping with cerebrovascular microbleeds, impaired neuronal migration, epilepsy, and microcephaly. Cardiac malformations can be present, as can vascular dysfunction in the forms of cutis marmorata telangiectasia congenita, pulmonary vein stenoses, and abnormal hepatic microvasculature. Elucidated genetic causes include four genes in different pathways, leading to a model of AOS as a multi-pathway disorder. We identified an infant with mild aplasia cutis congenita and terminal transverse limb defects, developmental delay and a severe, diffuse angiopathy with incomplete microvascularization. Whole-genome sequencing documented two rare truncating variants in DOCK6, a gene associated with a type of autosomal recessive AOS that recurrently features periventricular calcification and impaired neurodevelopment. We highlight an unexpectedly high frequency of likely deleterious mutations in this gene in the general population, relative to the rarity of the disease, and discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy.","dc:creator":"Lehman A","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Diffuse angiopathy in Adams-Oliver syndrome associated with truncating DOCK6 mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:d07dfbcd-dac2-477e-be83-c9424b0adfc3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:95ae6916-41f2-4fe2-9a1a-aba888270cb7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25091416"}],"rdfs:label":"Proband from Lehman et al study"},{"id":"cggv:d07dfbcd-dac2-477e-be83-c9424b0adfc3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d07dfbcd-dac2-477e-be83-c9424b0adfc3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d81878f0-f514-481d-ba29-3de45de2cca1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d81878f0-f514-481d-ba29-3de45de2cca1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:42f51fff-336f-439b-b7b0-b0de0e91c49c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42f51fff-336f-439b-b7b0-b0de0e91c49c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7605347-9cea-441d-b4a5-5dda0f63f317","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020812.4(DOCK6):c.4786C>T (p.Arg1596Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1675721"}},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:8c38c789-59c0-44c2-b2b5-51fcc4a16e3b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7605347-9cea-441d-b4a5-5dda0f63f317"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25824905","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is characterized by the association of aplasia cutis congenita with terminal transverse limb defects, often accompanied by additional cardiovascular or neurological features.

Mutations of the DOCK6 gene were first described in autosomal-recessive cases of AOS and only five DOCK6-related families have been reported to date. Recently, a second type of autosomal-recessive AOS has been attributed to EOGT mutations in three consanguineous families. Here, we describe the identification of 13 DOCK6 mutations, the majority of which are novel, across 10 unrelated individuals from a large cohort comprising 47 sporadic cases and 31 AOS pedigrees suggestive of autosomal-recessive inheritance.

syndrome (AOS) is a rare developmental disorder, characterized by scalp aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) and transverse terminal limb defects (TTLD). Autosomal dominant forms of AOS are linked to mutations in ARHGAP31, DLL4, NOTCH1 or RBPJ, while DOCK6 and EOGT underlie autosomal recessive inheritance. Data on the frequency and distribution of mutations in large cohorts are currently limited. The purpose of this study was therefore to comprehensively examine the genetic architecture of AOS in an extensive cohort. Molecular diagnostic screening of 194 AOS/ACC/TTLD probands/families was conducted using next-generation and/or capillary sequencing analyses. In total, we identified 63 (likely) pathogenic mutations, comprising 56 distinct and 22 novel mutations, providing a molecular diagnosis in 30% of patients. Taken together with previous reports, these findings bring the total number of reported disease variants to 63, with a diagnostic yield of 36% in familial cases. NOTCH1 is the major contributor, underlying 10% of AOS/ACC/TTLD cases, with DLL4 (6%), DOCK6 (6%), ARHGAP31 (3%), EOGT (3%), and RBPJ (2%) representing additional causality in this cohort. We confirm the relevance of genetic screening across the AOS/ACC/TTLD spectrum, highlighting preliminary but important genotype-phenotype correlations. This cohort offers potential for further gene identification to address missing heritability.","dc:creator":"Meester JAN","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Elucidating the genetic architecture of Adams-Oliver syndrome in a large European cohort."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband from family 36"},{"id":"cggv:31a7c725-0c34-4191-8823-e5dd7b6d2623","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31a7c725-0c34-4191-8823-e5dd7b6d2623_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2b852ba1-1535-4142-ada5-e2ed69914533_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b852ba1-1535-4142-ada5-e2ed69914533","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:d0cd7f06-2566-4f18-9fa3-cad59fe90f9f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020812.4(DOCK6):c.2520dup (p.Arg841fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA143931"}},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:8069bdb6-990c-4b4e-9bce-5667eb57dbad_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d0cd7f06-2566-4f18-9fa3-cad59fe90f9f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25824905"},"rdfs:label":"10.1"},{"id":"cggv:8069bdb6-990c-4b4e-9bce-5667eb57dbad","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8069bdb6-990c-4b4e-9bce-5667eb57dbad_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:27b440c4-5fe9-411d-b01b-ff3c08d7ac3b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:27b440c4-5fe9-411d-b01b-ff3c08d7ac3b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:96d3afb3-ee7b-4d4e-b855-86914697e8f8"},"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:31a4cc9d-0b81-43b0-8c8b-eff5b024f7a5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:96d3afb3-ee7b-4d4e-b855-86914697e8f8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31654484"},"rdfs:label":"Proband 10"},{"id":"cggv:31a4cc9d-0b81-43b0-8c8b-eff5b024f7a5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31a4cc9d-0b81-43b0-8c8b-eff5b024f7a5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:576cdaa3-1083-4e86-a4b0-edd925e685c9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:576cdaa3-1083-4e86-a4b0-edd925e685c9","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:96d3afb3-ee7b-4d4e-b855-86914697e8f8"},{"id":"cggv:95ae6916-41f2-4fe2-9a1a-aba888270cb7"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"terminal transverse limb defects, polymicrogyria,large patent ductus aquaticus, calcified papules on fingers and toes","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007229","obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0001057","obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0000952","obo:HP_0001655","obo:HP_0008386"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:3bf26038-9417-4db4-9a3d-88a2beb29279_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:96d3afb3-ee7b-4d4e-b855-86914697e8f8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28884918","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) and transverse terminal limb defects (TTLDs).

Recently, we demonstrated that homozygous mutations in DOCK6 cause an autosomal-recessive form of AOS. In this study, we sought to determine the contribution of DOCK6 mutations to the etiology of AOS in several consanguineous families. In two of the five families studied, we identified two homozygous truncating mutations (a splice-site mutation and a frameshift duplication). DOCK6 sequencing revealed no mutation in the remaining three families, consistent with their autozygosity mapping and linkage-analysis results, which revealed a single candidate locus in 3p14.1 on three different haplotype backgrounds in the three families. Indeed, exome sequencing in one family revealed one missense mutation in EOGT (C3orf64), and subsequent targeted sequencing of this gene revealed a homozygous missense mutation and a homozygous frameshift deletion mutation in the other two families. EOGT encodes EGF-domain-specific O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase, which is involved in the O-GlcNAcylation (attachment of O-GlcNAc to serine and threonine residues) of a subset of extracellular EGF-domain-containing proteins. It has a documented role in epithelial-cell-matrix interactions in Drosophila, in which deficiency of its ortholog causes wing blistering. Our findings highlight a developmental role of O-GlcNAcylation in humans and expand the genetic heterogeneity of autosomal-recessive AOS.","dc:creator":"Shaheen R","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in EOGT confirm the genetic heterogeneity of autosomal-recessive Adams-Oliver syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"IV 4"},{"id":"cggv:7f471fc9-5557-4f66-a3e3-c85127d962f0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f471fc9-5557-4f66-a3e3-c85127d962f0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:33da797f-d09d-4561-a3b7-811dc960b513_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33da797f-d09d-4561-a3b7-811dc960b513","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a5e6ffd1-80fb-4937-b114-8d9868fd5fe1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020812.4(DOCK6):c.4107-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251328"}},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:f80ff893-9a20-4a93-823b-be06bd933715_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a5e6ffd1-80fb-4937-b114-8d9868fd5fe1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23522784"},"rdfs:label":"IV 1"},{"id":"cggv:f80ff893-9a20-4a93-823b-be06bd933715","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f80ff893-9a20-4a93-823b-be06bd933715_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f80ff893-9a20-4a93-823b-be06bd933715_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RNA studies indicated loss of 7bp in exon 33 which results in a premature stop codon "}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4701,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f7355ddd-ed06-4532-ad1a-8d65af4b1005","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007034","gene":"hgnc:19189","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Adams Oliver syndrome (AOS) was initially described in 1945 by F. H. Adams and C. P. Oliver as an autosomal dominant disorder clinically characterized by an absence of the lower extremities, digits and some of the metacarpals; and skin and skull lesions similar to those of aplasia cutis congenita. Variants inherited in autosomal recessive manner in *DOCK6* gene were first reported in individuals with AOS in 2011 (Shaheen R. et al., PMID:21820096).\n\n*DOCK6* is a member of the conserved DOCK-C (dedicator of cytokinesis) subfamily and has crucial role on cytoskeletal organization. *DOCK6 *acts as a guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for CDC42 and RAC1 proteins which belong to the Rho GTPase family.\n\nPhenotypic variability has been reported in patients carrying pathogenic variants in *DOCK6* gene with some patients exhibiting also seizures and ocular defects. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biparentally inherited loss-of-function variants. Nine frameshift variants were reported in 11 probands across eight publications (PMIDs: 21820096, 23522784, 25091416, 25824905, 29924900, 31654484, 32498638, 33655927), 7 splice site in 10 probands (PMIDs: 23522784, 25824905, 28884918, 29631299, 30898718, 31654484, 33655927), 5 nonsense variants in 6 probands (PMIDs: 25091416, 25824905, 28884918, 29924900, 29631299, 30898718), 4 missense in 4 probands (PMID: 25824905) and one intragene deletion including exons 42-47 in one proband (PMID: 25824905).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the observed defects in cytoskeletal organization in fibroblasts from an affected proband (PMID:21820096) and in vitro with the use of cell lines indicating the cytoskeletal and neurite defects after knockdown of *DOCK6* (PMID:17196961).\n\nIn summary, *DOCK6* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Adams Oliver syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and has been upheld over time. This was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 28, 2022 (SOP version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ea64d74c-583d-4ed1-af91-6a7c6f80a1d3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
