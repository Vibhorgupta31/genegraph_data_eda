Here, we investigated a boy with congenital myopathy, deafness, and neuropathy from a consanguineous Kurdish family by autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing. We found a homozygous nonsense mutation in SPTBN4 [c.1597C>T, NM_020971.2; p.(Q533*), NP_066022.2; ClinVar SUB2292235] encoding βIV-spectrin, a non-erythrocytic member of the β-spectrin family. Western blot confirmed the absence of the full-length 288 kDa isoform in muscle and of a specific 72 kDa isoform in fibroblasts. Clinical symptoms of the patient largely corresponded to those described for the quivering mouse, a loss-of-function animal model. Since the human phenotype of βIV-spectrin deficiency included a myopathy with incomplete congenital fiber-type disproportion, we investigated muscle of the quivering (qv4J) mouse and found complete absence of type 1 fibers (fiber-type 2 uniformity). Immunohistology confirmed expression of βIV-spectrin in normal human and mouse muscle at the sarcolemma and its absence in patient and quivering (qv4J) mouse. SPTBN4 mRNA-expression levels in healthy skeletal muscle were found in the range of other regulatory proteins. More patients have to be described to confirm the triad of congenital myopathy, neuropathy and deafness as the defining symptom complex for βIV-spectrin deficiency.","dc:creator":"Knierim E","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A recessive mutation in beta-IV-spectrin (SPTBN4) associates with congenital myopathy, neuropathy, and central deafness."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff8934be-15d6-474e-b5fa-30328f633170_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9dbb470a-7ff8-43ef-b741-11b90fec866c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9dbb470a-7ff8-43ef-b741-11b90fec866c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:9dbd6936-3bdf-4e79-bd55-3eea13eff29b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020971.3(SPTBN4):c.1813C>T (p.Gln605Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/985015"}},{"id":"cggv:e58a0fde-6be1-4663-82a9-fad3671ef87a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020971.3(SPTBN4):c.3829del (p.Gln1277fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/986056"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"profound intellectual disability, severe congenital hypotonia, global developmental delay, seizures (severe, drug resistant), feeding difficulties, respiratory difficulties, hypo/areflexia, non-ambulatory, profound weakness, severe cognitive delays, with no language development, cortical visual impairment, and abnormal MRI.","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:e518c557-53f4-4169-9b7f-7a920998a17d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9dbd6936-3bdf-4e79-bd55-3eea13eff29b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29861105","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"βIV spectrin links ankyrinG (AnkG) and clustered ion channels at axon initial segments (AISs) and nodes of Ranvier to the axonal cytoskeleton.

The list of monogenic forms of ID has increased rapidly in recent years thanks to the implementation of genomic sequencing techniques. In this study, we describe the phenotypic and genetic findings of 68 families (105 patients) all with novel ID-related variants. In addition to established ID genes, including ones for which we describe unusual mutational mechanism, some of these variants represent the first confirmatory disease-gene links following previous reports (TRAK1, GTF3C3, SPTBN4 and NKX6-2), some of which were based on single families. Furthermore, we describe novel variants in 14 genes that we propose as novel candidates (ANKHD1, ASTN2, ATP13A1, FMO4, MADD, MFSD11, NCKAP1, NFASC, PCDHGA10, PPP1R21, SLC12A2, SLK, STK32C and ZFAT). We highlight MADD and PCDHGA10 as particularly compelling candidates in which we identified biallelic likely deleterious variants in two independent ID families each. We also highlight NCKAP1 as another compelling candidate in a large family with autosomal dominant mild intellectual disability that fully segregates with a heterozygous truncating variant. The candidacy of NCKAP1 is further supported by its biological function, and our demonstration of relevant expression in human brain.

The betaIV spectrin gene is located on human and mouse chromosomes 19q13.13 and 7b2, respectively. Alternative splicing of betaIV spectrin generates at least four distinct isoforms, numbered betaIVSigma1-betaIVSigma4 spectrin. The longest isoform (betaIVSigma1 spectrin) includes an actin-binding domain, followed by 17 spectrin repeats, a specific domain in which the amino acid sequence ERQES is repeated four times, several putative SH3-binding sites and a pleckstrin homology domain. betaIVSigma2 and betaIVSigma3 spectrin encompass the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal halves of betaIVSigma1 spectrin, respectively, while betaIVSigma4 spectrin lacks the ERQES and the pleckstrin homology domain. Northern blots revealed an abundant expression of betaIV spectrin transcripts in brain and pancreatic islets. By immunoblotting, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is recognized as a protein of 250 kD. Anti-betaIV spectrin antibodies also react with two additional isoforms of 160 and 140 kD. These isoforms differ from betaIVSigma1 spectrin in terms of their distribution on subcellular fractionation, detergent extractability, and phosphorylation. In islets, the immunoreactivity for betaIV spectrin is more prominent in alpha than in beta cells. In brain, betaIV spectrin is enriched in myelinated neurons, where it colocalizes with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. Likewise, betaIV spectrin is concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier in the rat sciatic nerve. In the rat hippocampus, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is detectable from embryonic day 19, concomitantly with the appearance of immunoreactivity at the initial segments. Thus, we suggest that betaIVSigma1 spectrin interacts with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD and participates in the clustering of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and cell-adhesion molecules at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.","dc:creator":"Berghs S","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"betaIV spectrin, a new spectrin localized at axon initial segments and nodes of ranvier in the central and peripheral nervous system."},"rdfs:label":"Northern blot for SPTBN4 in human tissues/IHC rat brain "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ff8934be-15d6-474e-b5fa-30328f633170_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:401a5314-2fea-4486-85ed-0e0cc8804822","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7eb4fe8-6445-4ebc-879e-9e0f9b58e010","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Reexpression of Sptbn4 in Sptbn4geo mutants prevented axonal degeneration and paralysis,  restored body weight, motor performance, nerve conduction velocities, and increased survival rate.

Mechanisms that allow nodal recovery during pathological processes remain poorly understood. A highly enriched nodal cytoskeletal protein βIV spectrin anchors and stabilizes the nodal complex to actin cytoskeleton. Loss of murine βIV spectrin allows the initial nodal organization, but causes gradual nodal destabilization. Mutations in human βIV spectrin cause auditory neuropathy and impairment in motor coordination. Similar phenotypes are caused by nodal disruption due to demyelination. Here we report on the precise timelines of nodal disorganization and reorganization by following disassembly and reassembly of key nodal proteins in βIV spectrin mice of both sexes before and after βIV spectrin re-expression at specifically chosen developmental time points. We show that the timeline of nodal restoration has different outcomes in the PNS and CNS with respect to nodal reassembly and functional restoration. In the PNS, restoration of nodes occurs within 1 month regardless of the time of βIV spectrin re-expression. In contrast, the CNS nodal reorganization and functional restoration occurs within a critical time window; after that, nodal reorganization diminishes, leading to less efficient motor recovery. We demonstrate that timely restoration of nodes can improve both the functional properties and the ultrastructure of myelinated fibers affected by long-term nodal disorganization. Our studies, which indicate a critical timeline for nodal restoration together with overall motor performance and prolonged life span, further support the idea that nodal restoration is more beneficial if initiated before any axonal damage, which is critically relevant to demyelinating disorders.","dc:creator":"Saifetiarova J","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Reorganization of Destabilized Nodes of Ranvier in β"},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of Sptbn4geo mouse mutant "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:25e9a81c-00ab-4fb8-ac2d-b0fd45020dd9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:28fb6426-d980-4fd6-b4e2-0b7a14e4a27c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"see overalpping human phenotypes above.

The protein acts as a scaffold that links the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane and is important for appropriate localization of specific membrane proteins, including ion channels in axons of neurons. SPTBN4 was first reported in relation to an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder in 2017 (Knierim et al., PMID: 28540413). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 8 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense) in this gene that have been reported in at least 7 unrelated individuals in 4 publications (PMID: 28540413; Wang et al., 2018, PMID: 29861105; Hausler et al., 2019, PMID: 31857255) have been included in this curation. Segregation with disease was seen in at least one additional family member in two families (PMID: 29861105; PMID: 31857255). At least seven unique variants have been reported, which are predicted to result in a truncated or abnormal gene product. Loss of function appears to be the mechanism of disease. Although missense variants have been reported, their role in the disorder remains less clear. This gene-disease relationship is supported by multiple mouse and piglet models that recapitulate the human phenotype, displaying hypotonia, tremors, neuropathy, myopathy, and central hearing loss (Derks et al., 2019, PMID: 31850074; Parkinson et al., 2001, PMID: 11528393). Expression is enriched in nervous system and consistent with the neuronal/neuromuscular pathology observed in patients and animal models, with high expression in neurons and enrichment in nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segment (Berghs et al., 2000; PMID: 11086001). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SPTBN4 and autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, neuropathy, and deafness.
