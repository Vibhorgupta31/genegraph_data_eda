Here we applied whole-exome sequencing to 51 individuals with multiple colonic adenomas from 48 families. In seven affected individuals from three unrelated families, we identified a homozygous germline nonsense mutation in the base-excision repair (BER) gene NTHL1. This mutation was exclusively found in a heterozygous state in controls (minor allele frequency of 0.0036; n = 2,329). All three families showed recessive inheritance of the adenomatous polyposis phenotype and progression to CRC in at least one member. All three affected women developed an endometrial malignancy or premalignancy. Genetic analysis of three carcinomas and five adenomas from different affected individuals showed a non-hypermutated profile enriched for cytosine-to-thymine transitions. We conclude that a homozygous loss-of-function germline mutation in the NTHL1 gene predisposes to a new subtype of BER-associated adenomatous polyposis and CRC.

During analysis of the area adjacent to the human tuberous sclerosis gene (TSC2) in chromosome region 16p13.3, we identified a gene, OCTS3, that encodes a 1-kb transcript. Analysis of OCTS3 cDNA clones revealed an open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 34.3 kDa that shares extensive sequence similarity with E. coli endonuclease III and a related enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, including a conserved active site region and an iron/sulfur domain. The product of the OCTS3 gene was therefore designated hNTH1 (human endonuclease III homolog 1). The hNTH1 protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The recombinant protein had spectral properties indicative of the presence of an iron/sulfur cluster, and exhibited DNA glycosylase activity on double-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides containing urea and thymine glycol residues, as well as an apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity.

However, no proper functional characterization of variant NTHL1 proteins has been done so far. Herein, we report functional evaluation of variant NTHL1 proteins to aid in the accurate diagnosis of NAP. First, we investigated whether it would be appropriate to use 5-hydroxyuracil (5OHU), an oxidation product of cytosine, for the evaluation. In the supF forward mutation assay, 5OHU caused an increase of the mutation frequency in human cells, and the C→T mutation was predominant among the 5OHU-induced mutations. In addition, in DNA cleavage activity assay, 5OHU was excised by NTHL1 as well as four other DNA glycosylases (SMUG1, NEIL1, TDG, and UNG2). When human cells overexpressing the five DNA glycosylases were established, it was found that each of the five DNA glycosylases, including NTHL1, had the ability to suppress 5OHU-induced mutations. Based on the above results, we performed functional evaluation of eight NTHL1 variants using 5OHU-containing DNA substrate or shuttle plasmid. The DNA cleavage activity assay showed that the variants of NTHL1, Q90X, Y130X, R153X, and Q287X, but not R19Q, V179I, V217F, or G286S, showed defective repair activity for 5OHU and two other oxidatively damaged bases. Moreover, the supF forward mutation assay showed that the four truncated-type NTHL1 variants showed a reduced ability to suppress 5OHU-induced mutations in human cells. These results suggest that the NTHL1 variants Q90X, Y130X, R153X, and Q287X, but not R19Q, V179I, V217F, or G286S, were defective in 5OHU repair and the alleles encoding them were considered to be pathogenic for NAP.","dc:creator":"Shinmura K","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Defective repair capacity of variant proteins of the DNA glycosylase NTHL1 for 5-hydroxyuracil, an oxidation product of cytosine."},"rdfs:label":"Impaired DNA glycosylase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The authors also showed that LoF NTHL1 variants are less effective to correct 5-OH-Uracil induced mutations (C>T transitions).

Although these enzymes remove several oxidized bases from DNA, they do not remove the well-known carcinogenic oxidation product of guanine: 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-OH-Gua), which is removed by another DNA N-glycosylase, OGG1. The Nth1-/-Neil1-/- mice developed pulmonary and hepatocellular tumors in much higher incidence than either of the single knockouts, Nth1-/- and Neil1-/-. The pulmonary tumors contained, exclusively, activating GGT-->GAT transitions in codon 12 of K-ras of their DNA. Such transitions contrast sharply with the activating GGT-->GTT transversions in codon 12 of K-ras of the pathologically similar pulmonary tumors, which arose in mice lacking OGG1 and a second DNA N-glycosylase, MUTY. To characterize the biochemical phenotype of the knockout mice, the content of oxidative DNA base damage was analyzed from three tissues isolated from control, single and double knockout mice. The content of 8-OH-Gua was indistinguishable among all genotypes. In contrast, the content of 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) derived from adenine and guanine, respectively, were increased in some but not all tissues of Neil1-/- and Neil1-/-Nth1-/- mice. The high incidence of tumors in our Nth1-/-Neil1-/- mice together with the nature of the activating mutation in the K-ras gene of their pulmonary tumors, reveal for the first time, the existence of mutagenic and carcinogenic oxidative damage to DNA which is not 8-OH-Gua.","dc:creator":"Chan MK","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Targeted deletion of the genes encoding NTH1 and NEIL1 DNA N-glycosylases reveals the existence of novel carcinogenic oxidative damage to DNA."},"rdfs:label":"Mice double KO"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Not direct similarity as no lung or hepatic tumors have been reported to be directly associated with NTHL1 deficiency (i.e. no tumor mutation signature analysis).

The condition is primarily characterized by adenomatous polyposis of colon (~10-50), colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found  NTHL1-deficiency tumor predisposition syndrome (MONDO:0100502) is the only one disease entity associated with this gene. About 30 individuals carrying biallelic loss-of-function variants, most commonly NM_002528.7(NTHL1):c.244C>T (p.Gln82Ter) (formerly referred to as p.Gln90Ter) in line with its relatively high minor allele frequency (~0.1%) in the population databases, have been reported to date and 5 of them along with their affected siblings are included in this curation (PMIDs: 25938944, 30753826, 27720914, 26559593). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity has been demonstrated to be loss-of-function resulting in deficient NTHL1 activity (PMID: 25938944). A specific mutational signature due to a high percentage of somatic C>T transitions (COSMIS Signature 30) in cancer driver genes such as *KRAS, APC, TP53, PIK3CA* has been identified on tested tumor samples, and the preliminary data also suggest other primary tumors, i.e. urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, might also be linked to *NTHL1* deficiency per mutational profiling of such tumors (PMID: 30753826). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (3.85 points from human cell models, in vitro functional assays, animal models, etc.) (PMIDs: 8990169, 19346169, 30552997, 28912133). Particularly, human colonic stem cells-derived organoids devoid of NTHL1 activity phenocopied the somatic mutational signature detected in tumoral samples of individuals carrying biallelic loss-of-function *NTHL1* variants. In summary, *NTHL1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive NTHL1-deficiency tumor predisposition syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
