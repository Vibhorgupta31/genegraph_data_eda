Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Mitochondrial translation defects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes associated with PMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:be8894e0-8d48-4f4a-86cd-66bc465cde70_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.35}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6743,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":4.35,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ed179e43-b8cc-4286-9a82-42cf76bd8c95","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:7495","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-TQ* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 17, 2023. The *MT-TQ* gene encodes the mitochondrial tRNA for glutamine, which is located from m.4329 â€“ 4400 on the reverse strand of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n\n*MT-TQ* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 2000 (PMID: 10996779), in a boy with myopathy. Other associated features have been reported over time. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TQ*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TQ* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three unique variants (m.4332G>A, m.4369_4370insA, m.4381A>G) in three probands across 3 publications (PMIDs: 11171912, 10996779, 17003408). Single fiber testing further supported the pathogenicity of several of these variants (PMIDs: 11171912, 11335700, 10996779). Age of onset in affected individuals was five years old, teens, and 20 years old. Clinical features in affected individuals included stroke-like episodes, hearing loss, myopathy, and Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON).  Brain imaging was variable. Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers and COX-negative fibers. Metabolic screening labs were only reported in one individual and showed high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate with normal blood lactate. Heteroplasmy levels in affected individuals were highest in muscle when multiple tissues were assessed (61-87% in muscle).\n\nThe mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.  This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease (PMID: 33340416).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This GCEP notes that while at the time of this curation *MT-TQ* has a limited association with primary mitochondrial disease, it is plausible, and even likely, that additional cases will be reported in the future given the crucial role of *MT-TQ* in mitochondrial translation. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 17, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
