We report on 7 patients with psychomotor delay, microcephaly, strabismus and coagulation abnormalities, seizures and abnormal fat distribution. Four children had a stable clinical course, two had visual impairment, and 1 had hearing loss. Thrombotic and vascular events led to deterioration of the clinical outcome in 2 patients. Four novel ALG1 mutations were identified. Pathogenicity was determined in alg1 yeast mutants transformed with hALG1. Functional analyses showed all novel mutations representing hypomorphs associated with residual enzyme activity. We extend the phenotypic spectrum including the first description of deafness in MT1 deficiency, and report on mildly affected patients, surviving to adulthood. The dysmorphic features, including abnormal fat distribution and strabismus highly resemble CDG due to phosphomannomutase-2 deficiency (PMM2-CDG), the most common type of CDG.

ALG1 encodes a β1,4 mannosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of the first of nine mannose moieties to form a dolichol-lipid linked oligosaccharide intermediate required for proper N-linked glycosylation. ALG1 mutations cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder termed ALG1-CDG. To date 13 mutations in 18 patients from 14 families have been described with varying degrees of clinical severity. We identified and characterized 39 previously unreported cases of ALG1-CDG from 32 families and add 26 new mutations. Pathogenicity of each mutation was confirmed based on its inability to rescue impaired growth or hypoglycosylation of a standard biomarker in an alg1-deficient yeast strain. Using this approach we could not establish a rank order comparison of biomarker glycosylation and patient phenotype, but we identified mutations with a lethal outcome in the first two years of life. The recently identified protein-linked xeno-tetrasaccharide biomarker, NeuAc-Gal-GlcNAc2 , was seen in all 27 patients tested.

In recent years, several CDG types have been attributed to defects of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. The profiling of [3H]mannose-labeled lipid-linked oligosaccharides was instrumental in identifying most of these glycosylation disorders. However, this method is poorly suited for the identification of short lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis defects. To adequately resolve deficiencies affecting the first steps of lipid-linked oligosaccharide formation, we have used a non-radioactive procedure employing the fluorescence detection of 2-aminobenzamide-coupled oligosaccharides after HPLC separation. By applying this method, we have detected the accumulation of dolichylpyrophosphate-GlcNAc2 in a previously untyped CDG patient. The accumulation pattern suggested a deficiency of the ALG1 beta1,4 mannosyltransferase, which adds the first mannose residue to lipid-linked oligosaccharides. This was supported by the finding that this CDG patient was compound heterozygous for three mutations in the ALG1 gene, leading to the amino acid substitutions S150R and D429E on one allele and S258L on the other. The detrimental effect of these mutations on ALG1 protein function was demonstrated in a complementation assay using alg1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast mutants. The ALG1 mannosyltransferase defect described here represents a novel type of CDG, which should be referred to as CDG-Ik.","dc:creator":"Grubenmann CE","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Deficiency of the first mannosylation step in the N-glycosylation pathway causes congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ik."}},{"id":"cggv:0b631047-a1af-4823-82c3-0770f0d58e52_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:12cfa5d5-f5ec-4f97-8283-1fab00308265"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14709599"}],"rdfs:label":"Grubenmann Proband"},{"id":"cggv:0b631047-a1af-4823-82c3-0770f0d58e52","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b631047-a1af-4823-82c3-0770f0d58e52_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0b631047-a1af-4823-82c3-0770f0d58e52_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expressing wild type ALG1 in agl1-1 yeast restores normal growth patterns.

Multiple members of the asparagine-linked glycosylation (ALG) family of glycosyltransferases have been implicated in congenital disorders of glycosylation (PMID: 37858231).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ALG1* and autosomal recessive ALG1-congenital disorder of glycosylation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 7, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:98d42afb-c5ce-4518-83ce-aab777f202e6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
