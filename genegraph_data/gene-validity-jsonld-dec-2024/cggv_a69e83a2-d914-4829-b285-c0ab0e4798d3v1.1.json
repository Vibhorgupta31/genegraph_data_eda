SJS results from mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which encodes perlecan, a major component of basement membranes. Only eight HSPG2 mutations have been reported in six SJS families. Here, we describe the molecular findings in 23 families (35 patients) with SJS, being one-third of the SJS cases reported in the medical literature. We identified 22 new HSPG2 mutations and unreported polymorphisms. Mutations included nine deletion or insertion (41%), six splice site (27%), five missense (23%), and two nonsense mutations (9%). All but four mutations were private, and we found no evidence for a founder effect. Analyses of HSPG2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and perlecan immunostaining on patients' cells revealed a hypomorphic effect of the studied mutations. They also demonstrated distinct consequences of truncating and missense mutations on perlecan expression as truncating mutations resulted in instability of HSPG2 mRNA through nonsense mRNA-mediated decay, whereas missense mutations involving cysteine residues led to intracellular retention of perlecan, probably due to quality control pathways. Our analyses strengthen the idea that SJS results from hypomorphic mutations of the HSPG2 gene. They also propose tools for its molecular diagnosis and provide new clues for the understanding of its pathophysiology.","dc:creator":"Stum M","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Spectrum of HSPG2 (Perlecan) mutations in patients with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:b98ef738-86bb-4cb0-941d-e3c3af2bdb3d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:608b022c-91c8-4fd7-b132-06be20e1faf9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16927315"}],"rdfs:label":"F22 - Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:9d0b061d-1a7a-40a3-87f8-5f2c243e0e47","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9d0b061d-1a7a-40a3-87f8-5f2c243e0e47_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:b98ef738-86bb-4cb0-941d-e3c3af2bdb3d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b98ef738-86bb-4cb0-941d-e3c3af2bdb3d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:87427989-4e23-4dc4-a3de-fd62ca4be6c2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87427989-4e23-4dc4-a3de-fd62ca4be6c2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:4579c416-89f8-4ac8-bc32-0711acfc88ad","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005529.7(HSPG2):c.7006+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10588283"}},"detectionMethod":"All exons were amplified except exon 1","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Cone-shaped chest, genu valgum, pes planus, bowing of the legs.

Mutations in the perlecan gene (HSPG2) cause two classes of skeletal disorders: the relatively mild Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) and severe neonatal lethal dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH). SJS is an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by varying degrees of myotonia and chondrodysplasia, and patients with SJS survive. The molecular mechanism underlying the chondrodystrophic myotonia phenotype of SJS is unknown. In the present report, we identify five different mutations that resulted in various forms of perlecan in three unrelated patients with SJS. Heterozygous mutations in two patients with SJS either produced truncated perlecan that lacked domain V or significantly reduced levels of wild-type perlecan. The third patient had a homozygous 7-kb deletion that resulted in reduced amounts of nearly full-length perlecan. Unlike DDSH, the SJS mutations result in different forms of perlecan in reduced levels that are secreted to the extracellular matrix and are likely partially functional. These findings suggest that perlecan has an important role in neuromuscular function and cartilage formation, and they define the molecular basis involved in the difference in the phenotypic severity between DDSH and SJS.","dc:creator":"Arikawa-Hirasawa E","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Structural and functional mutations of the perlecan gene cause Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, with myotonic myopathy and chondrodysplasia."}},{"id":"cggv:457d97b7-0fe4-415e-8744-d05de0ea4902_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7118a40d-c89a-4bff-99b3-770e4aa408f5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11941538"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:457d97b7-0fe4-415e-8744-d05de0ea4902","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:457d97b7-0fe4-415e-8744-d05de0ea4902_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:457d97b7-0fe4-415e-8744-d05de0ea4902_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR RNA from patient 2 showed products 1,2, and 3 contained total or partial retention of intron 66.

We report a novel homozygous intronic 5' splice site mutation in this gene (c.4740 + 5G>A) in a child with clinical features of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1. The mutation was detected by exome sequencing and later confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The mother was found to be heterozygous for the mutation and an ongoing pregnancy found to be unaffected. cDNA analysis revealed skipping of exon 37 of HSPG2 gene in the patient due to the splicing error caused by this mutation. This is likely to result in loss of 38 amino acids from the domain III of the perlecan protein and presumably affects its structure and function as per protein modeling predictions. This report demonstrates the utility of exome sequencing as a routine molecular diagnostic approach of choice for this rare disorder.","dc:creator":"Das Bhowmik A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Identification of a novel splice site HSPG2 mutation and prenatal diagnosis in Schwartz Jampel Syndrome type 1 using whole exome sequencing."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 1"},{"id":"cggv:7a654460-e810-4816-babf-acd720e73e40","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a654460-e810-4816-babf-acd720e73e40_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7a654460-e810-4816-babf-acd720e73e40_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"cDNA analysis revealed absence of complete exon 37 of HSPG2 gene in the patient (Fig. 2)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:64c02d7d-7d5d-4ffe-8c5b-fdbe37336d65_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64c02d7d-7d5d-4ffe-8c5b-fdbe37336d65","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:812cb8ab-b8bb-4f4a-a685-38981988f89b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005529.7(HSPG2):c.9181C>T (p.Gln3061Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338915079"}},{"id":"cggv:6b41ec70-e447-4770-8e96-ac8eef7572e1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005529.7(HSPG2):c.3263T>C (p.Leu1088Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338961617"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"X-ray finding of mild chondrodysplasia.

We report an 11-year-old Japanese boy with SJS, who shows \"rigid\" walking with less flexion of knees/ankles and protruded mouth. His intelligence is normal. We identified by whole genome resequencing a heterozygous missense p.Leu1088Pro in domain III-2 and a heterozygous nonsense p.Gln3061Ter in domain IV of perlecan. Expression studies revealed that p.Leu1088Pro markedly reduces the cellular expression of domain III-2 and almost nullifies its secretion into the culture medium. As five of the seven missense mutations in SJS affect domain III of perlecan, domain III is likely to be essential for secretion of perlecan into the extracellular space.

It has been suggested that SJS neuromyotonia may result from endplate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) deficiency, but this hypothesis has never been investigated in vivo due to the lack of an animal model for neuromyotonia. We used homologous recombination to generate a knock-in mouse strain with one missense substitution, corresponding to a human familial SJS mutation (p.C1532Y), in the perlecan gene. We derived two lines, one with the p.C1532Y substitution alone and one with p.C1532Y and the selectable marker Neo, to down-regulate perlecan gene activity and to test for a dosage effect of perlecan in mammals. These two lines mimicked SJS neuromyotonia with spontaneous activity on electromyogramm (EMG). An inverse correlation between disease severity and perlecan secretion in the BMs was observed at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, consistent with a dosage effect. Endplate AChE levels were low in both lines, due to synaptic perlecan deficiency rather than major myofibre or neuromuscular junction disorganization. Studies of muscle contractile properties showed muscle fatigability at low frequencies of nerve stimulation and suggested that partial endplate AChE deficiency might contribute to SJS muscle stiffness by potentiating muscle force.

Moreover, C1532Yneo mice displayed transient expansion of hypertrophic cartilage in the growth plate concomitant with radial trabecular bone orientation. In contrast, C1532Y mice, harboring only the mutation associated with SJS, displayed a mild phenotype, inconsistent with SJS. These studies question the C1532Y mutation as the sole causative factor of SJS in the human family harboring this alteration and imply that transcriptional changes leading to perlecan reduction may represent the disease mechanism for SJS.","dc:creator":"Rodgers KD","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Reduced perlecan in mice results in chondrodysplasia resembling Schwartz-Jampel syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Knockdown mice with reduced Perlecan resembling SJS"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Knockdown mice without selectable marker Neo developed mild phenotype inconsistent with SJS phenotype.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism AND phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, type 1 (OMIM:255800), and Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (OMIM:224410). The split curation for autosomal recessive Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type has been curated separately. 21 variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletions, and splice variants) have been reported in 14 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 11101850; Arikawa-Hirasawa et al., 2002, PMID: 11941538; Stum et al., 2006, PMID: 16927315; Lin et al., 2021, PMID: 33767660; Iwata et al., 2015, PMID: 26031903; Das Bhowmik et al., 2016, PMID: 27521129) and are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function hypomorphic variants. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies (Bauché et al., 2013, PMID: 24011702), functional alteration (Xu et al., 2016, PMID: 27578148) and animal models (Rodgers et al., 2007, PMID: 17213231; Stum et al., 2008, PMID: 18647752). In summary, HSPG2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 04.26.2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a69e83a2-d914-4829-b285-c0ab0e4798d3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
