EYA4, one of the vertebrate genes of Eya family, is reported to be causative for late-onset mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in humans, while Eya4-deficient mice exhibited congenital profound deafness and otitis media with effusion due to the eustachian tube dysmorphology. Because of the species difference in the phenotype, the pathophysiology of EYA4 in the human cochlea has yet to be elucidated. Here, we examine the expression pattern of EYA4 in the cochlea of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate. The results indicated a distinct expression pattern of EYA4 in the adult marmoset cochleae, especially strong in all supporting cells, while in mouse their expressions were diminished. Interestingly, EYA4 expression in the hair cells, supporting cells and neurons was co-localized with sine oculis homeobox-SIX1, a transcription factor essential for the transcriptional activity of EYA4. The results revealed inter-species differences in the expression pattern of EYA4 gene in supporting cells between primates and rodents. The results also indicated a fundamental role of EYA4 in the primate auditory cells. Experiments with primate models such as marmosets or with human cochlear cells may provide cues about the unknown pathogenesis of EYA4-related hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Matsuzaki S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Expression pattern of EYA4 in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) cochlea."},"rdfs:label":"Matsuzaki Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:21c75059-bd7b-48ef-a828-28ffebe52ca0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02518e71-9540-4d22-9a1c-de77e6bf1770","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6aeed337-165b-4b09-b1ca-e80587125581","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The micro RNA miR-431 was studied for role in hearing.

These studies showed that expression of miR-431 was high in SGNs in the cochleae of newborn mice, and decreased as development progressed. To test the functional effects of miR-431, we established miR-431 overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice. Surface preparations of the cochlear basilar membrane and cochlear sections revealed no major structural differences between Tg and wild-type (Wt) mice. However, a comparison of auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) in Tg and Wt mice showed that ABR thresholds were significantly higher in Tg mice than in Wt mice. Notably, the density of SGNs was significantly lower in Tg mice than in Wt mice. We also found that the proportion of mature SGNs in cultures of primary SGNs from Tg cochleae was lower and their axons were shorter. A bioinformatics analysis predicted that the mRNA target of miR-431 was Eya4, a finding confirmed by luciferase reporter assays and western blotting. Importantly, overexpression of miR-431 in cochleae of Tg mice inhibited the translation of Eya4 mRNA, leading to a deficiency of EYA4. Thus, excessive amounts of miR-431 in cochleae of Tg mice may be the cause of sparse SGNs, which in turn could be responsible for hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Fan Y","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"miR-431 is involved in regulating cochlear function by targeting Eya4."},"rdfs:label":"Fan Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Evidence that loss of Eya4 can cause hearing loss, but other effects of miR-431 overexpression were not excluded"},{"id":"cggv:ad4125ab-9bb3-4435-baf6-b85c84ffefd6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f683d801-64f8-4696-b4c1-3607ad4d272f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Eya4-deficient mice had severe hearing loss and all developed otitis media with effusion.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 7‚Äã variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. EYA4‚Äã was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2001 (Wayne et al.‚Äã). Association is seen in at least 7‚Äã probands in 6‚Äã publications (11159937, ‚Äã17568404, 25681523, 25963406, 25242383, 26331839). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >70 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, at least one patient and a zebrafish model have been reported with a cardiac phenotype (Schonberger et al. 2005, 15735644). This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model and expression studies. In summary, EYA4‚Äã is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss‚Äã Working Group on 1/5/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:21c75059-bd7b-48ef-a828-28ffebe52ca0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
