Up to now, 39 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic RP, yet the genetic bases of >50% of the cases, particularly of the recessive forms, remain unknown. Previous linkage analysis in a Spanish consanguineous family allowed us to define a novel autosomal recessive RP (arRP) locus, RP26, within an 11-cM interval (17.4 Mb) on 2q31.2-q32.3. In the present study, we further refine the RP26 locus down to 2.5 Mb, by microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) homozygosity mapping. After unsuccessful mutational analysis of the nine genes initially reported in this region, a detailed gene search based on expressed-sequence-tag data was undertaken. We finally identified a novel gene encoding a ceramide kinase (CERKL), which encompassed 13 exons. All of the patients from the RP26 family bear a homozygous mutation in exon 5, which generates a premature termination codon. The same mutation was also characterized in another, unrelated, Spanish pedigree with arRP. Human CERKL is expressed in the retina, among other adult and fetal tissues. A more detailed analysis by in situ hybridization on adult murine retina sections shows expression of Cerkl in the ganglion cell layer. Ceramide kinases convert the sphingolipid metabolite ceramide into ceramide-1-phosphate, both key mediators of cellular apoptosis and survival. Ceramide metabolism plays an essential role in the viability of neuronal cells, the membranes of which are particularly rich in sphingolipids. Therefore, CERKL deficiency could shift the relative levels of the signaling sphingolipid metabolites and increase sensitivity of photoreceptor and other retinal cells to apoptotic stimuli. This is the first genetic report suggesting a direct link between retinal neurodegeneration in RP and sphingolipid-mediated apoptosis.","dc:creator":"Tuson M","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mutation of CERKL, a novel human ceramide kinase gene, causes autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP26)."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3003820-dc03-4eb1-921a-6eaee749fa9f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da98cdfe-a2eb-4946-bfff-db522d3a7b7c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da98cdfe-a2eb-4946-bfff-db522d3a7b7c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:109f5b7c-1fd6-4cc7-9684-49ef62dea99c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_201548.4(CERKL):c.769C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252246"}},"detectionMethod":"All genes in the 2.5 Mb RP26 locus were Sanger sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Linkage analysis","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:661a0f63-ec02-4219-b866-115ee7cac8f4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:109f5b7c-1fd6-4cc7-9684-49ef62dea99c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14681825"},"rdfs:label":"VI.1 (random pick)"},{"id":"cggv:661a0f63-ec02-4219-b866-115ee7cac8f4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:661a0f63-ec02-4219-b866-115ee7cac8f4_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:661a0f63-ec02-4219-b866-115ee7cac8f4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 15708351: Wildtype CERKL  protein localized to many cell compartments, including specific association with nucleoli.

Despite intensive efforts, the function of CERKL remains obscure and studies in animal models have failed to clarify the disease mechanism of CERKL mutations. To address this gap in knowledge, we have generated a stable CERKL knockout zebrafish model by TALEN technology and a 7bp deletion in CERKL cDNA that caused the premature termination of CERKL. These CERKL-/- animals showed progressive degeneration of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs) and increased apoptosis of retinal cells, including those in the outer and inner retinal layers. Additionally, we confirmed by immunofluorescence and western-blot that rod degeneration in CERKL-/- zebrafish occurred earlier and was more significant than that in cone cells. Accumulation of shed OSs in the interphotoreceptor matrix was observed by transmission election microscopy (TEM). This suggested that CERKL may regulate the phagocytosis of OSs by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We further found that the phagocytosis-associated protein MERTK was significantly reduced in CERKL-/- zebrafish. Additionally, in ARPE-19 cell lines, knockdown of CERKL also decreased the mRNA and protein level of MERTK, as well as the ox-POS phagocytosis. We conclude that CERKL deficiency in zebrafish may cause rod-cone dystrophy, but not cone-rod dystrophy, while interfering with the phagocytosis function of RPE associated with down-regulation of the expression of MERTK.","dc:creator":"Yu S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"CERKL gene knockout disturbs photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis and causes rod-cone dystrophy in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d7e2df4c-9a8f-4449-82a0-a8d523de8980","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89345de8-824e-4e70-8b24-c9cecf0dda36","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Physiological alterations are observed in mice at 18 months of age but not at 6–10 months, which mimics the relatively late-onset (second decade of life) but progressive degenerative disease observed in most patients bearing CERKL mutations.
