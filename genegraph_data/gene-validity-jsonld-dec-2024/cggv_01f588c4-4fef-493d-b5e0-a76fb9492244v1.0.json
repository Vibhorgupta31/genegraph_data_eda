Sialidase has been well studied in viruses and bacteria where it destroys the sialic acid-containing receptors at the surface of host cells, and mobilizes bacterial nutrients. In mammals, three types of sialidases, lysosomal, plasma membrane and cytosolic, have been described. For lysosomal sialidase in humans, the primary genetic deficiency results in an autosomal recessive disease, sialidosis, associated with tissue accumulation and urinary excretion of sialylated oligosaccharides and glycolipids. Sialidosis includes two main clinical variants: late-onset, sialidosis type I, characterized by bilateral macular cherry-red spots and myoclonus, and infantile-onset, sialidosis type II, characterized by skeletal dysplasia, mental retardation and hepatosplenomegaly. We report the identification of human lysosomal sialidase cDNA, its cloning, sequencing and expression. Examination of six sialidosis patients revealed three mutations, one frameshift insertion and two missense.

The disease is associated with progressive impaired vision, macular cherry-red spots and myoclonus (sialidosis type I) or with skeletal dysplasia, Hurler-like phenotype, dysostosis multiplex, mental retardation and hepatosplenomegaly (sialidosis type II). We have analyzed the genomic DNA from nine sialidosis patients of multiple ethnic origin in order to find mutations responsible for the enzyme deficiency. The activity of the identified variants was studied by transgenic expression. One patient had a frameshift mutation (G623delG deletion), which introduced a stop codon, truncating 113 amino acids. All others had missense mutations: G679G-->A (Gly227Arg), C893C-->T (Ala298Val), G203G-->T (Gly68Val), A544A-->G (Ser182Gly) C808C-->T (Leu270Phe) and G982G-->A (Gly328Ser). We have modeled the three-dimensional structure of sialidase based on the atomic coordinates of the homologous bacterial sialidases, located the positions of mutations and estimated their potential effect. This analysis showed that five mutations are clustered in one region on the surface of the sialidase molecule. These mutations dramatically reduce the enzyme activity and cause a rapid intralysosomal degradation of the expressed protein. We hypothesize that this region may be involved in the interface of sialidase binding with lysosomal cathepsin A and/or beta-galactosidase in their high-molecular-weight complex required for the expression of sialidase activity in the lysosome.","dc:creator":"Lukong KE","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Characterization of the sialidase molecular defects in sialidosis patients suggests the structural organization of the lysosomal multienzyme complex."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 6"},{"id":"cggv:2262019a-5603-4422-bdf6-8e8d86a7b723","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2262019a-5603-4422-bdf6-8e8d86a7b723_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2262019a-5603-4422-bdf6-8e8d86a7b723_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 10767332: in COS-7 cells transfected with the variant, resulted in <10% of wild-type sialidase enzyme activity"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"scored 0.25pts per variant to yield 0.5pts total and prevent double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e5990fce-40e2-4137-80eb-3913641ffad8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5990fce-40e2-4137-80eb-3913641ffad8","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:97624256-7cd0-4d0a-9325-b447c85e72f5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000434.4(NEU1):c.272T>G (p.Leu91Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212557"}},{"id":"cggv:4b7e2680-f7f7-4d84-98c8-fc9d77a609fa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NEU1, 1-BP DEL, 1337C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/2445"}}],"detectionMethod":"direct sequencing of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-synthesized cDNAs","firstTestingMethod":"Other","previousTesting":false,"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:58c03afe-68a1-48ce-9d3d-8b7dde898c71_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4b7e2680-f7f7-4d84-98c8-fc9d77a609fa"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8985184","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Neuraminidases (sialidases) have an essential role in the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from sialoglycoconjugates and are distributed widely in nature. The human lysosomal enzyme occurs in complex with beta-galactosidase and protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), and is deficient in two genetic disorders: sialidosis, caused by a structural defect in the neuraminidase gene, and galactosialidosis, in which the loss of neuraminidase activity is secondary to a deficiency of PPCA. We identified a full-length cDNA clone in the dbEST data base, of which the predicted amino acid sequence has extensive homology to other mammalian and bacterial neuraminidases, including the F(Y)RIP domain and \"Asp-boxes.\" In situ hybridization localized the human neuraminidase gene to chromosome band 6p21, a region known to contain the HLA locus. Transient expression of the cDNA in deficient human fibroblasts showed that the enzyme is compartmentalized in lysosomes and restored neuraminidase activity in a PPCA-dependent manner. The authenticity of the cDNA was verified by the identification of three independent mutations in the open reading frame of the mRNA from clinically distinct sialidosis patients. Coexpression of the mutant cDNAs with PPCA failed to generate neuraminidase activity, confirming the inactivating effect of the mutations.

The proband was a premature male infant that presented with hydrops, hepatomegaly, respiratory distress syndrome, and anemia and that died of respiratory insufficiency 2 months after birth despite intensive care. An abnormally increased [14C]methylamine incorporation and an isolated deficiency of lysosomal alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminidase were found in cultured skin fibroblasts. A previous pregnancy of the mother terminated in a spontaneous abortion in the 13th week of gestation. A successive pregnancy showed hydrops fetalis, and an enzymatic assay of cultured amniotic fluid cells indicated a deficiency of alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminidase. Following pregnancy termination at 20 weeks gestation, light microscopy of fetal tissues revealed classic vacuolation not only in liver, bone marrow, brain, and kidney, but also in endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland, adrenal gland, hypophysis, and testes, and in the thymus. DNA analysis of the family showed that both the proband and the third sibling had a novel homozygous nonsense point mutation at nucleotide 87 in exon 1 of the alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminidase (neu1) gene causing a substitution of tryptophan at codon 29 by a termination codon (W29X). DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products identified the parents as heterozygous carriers. To detect neu1 mRNA expression, a real-time reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction was performed, and similar rates of neu1 mRNA expression were found in the fibroblasts of the fetus, the 2nd sibling, and in controls. The very early termination codon with complete loss of neuraminidase activity is probably the molecular basis of the unusually severe vacuolation pattern in this form of congenital sialidosis.","dc:creator":"Sergi C","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Prenatal diagnosis and fetal pathology in a Turkish family harboring a novel nonsense mutation in the lysosomal alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminidase (sialidase) gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 - Sergi"},{"id":"cggv:02955066-5163-4d6b-8e97-8c2af851404b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02955066-5163-4d6b-8e97-8c2af851404b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Scored 0.75pts per variant to yield 1.5pts total and prevent double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9a41be75-8e8b-44dc-9c6f-656c5235366b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a41be75-8e8b-44dc-9c6f-656c5235366b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:00c51782-f906-4730-9375-44194f63f83a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000434.4(NEU1):c.625del (p.Glu209fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/2448"}},"detectionMethod":"Genetic testing via PCR amplification, cloning of amplified fragments into pCR2.1 vector, and Sanger sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Other","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:7ef93ad3-bcbb-46f3-9031-92ef1d6b3708_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:00c51782-f906-4730-9375-44194f63f83a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10767332"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 5"},{"id":"cggv:7ef93ad3-bcbb-46f3-9031-92ef1d6b3708","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ef93ad3-bcbb-46f3-9031-92ef1d6b3708_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Scored 0.75pts to yield 1.5pts total and prevent double-counting for homozygous variant "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:01f588c4-4fef-493d-b5e0-a76fb9492244_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:01f588c4-4fef-493d-b5e0-a76fb9492244_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c21970cd-3cf3-4934-9284-f7b850b8d268","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30afcb84-267a-4838-b6d3-ebec315b58a4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"NEU1 encodes neuraminidase I, an enzyme that is involved in degradation of sialated glyconguates via hydrolyzing terminal N-acetylated neuraminic acids (sialic acid)  in oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, colominic acid and synthetic substrates (as reviewed in PMID: 26949572).

NEU1 requires binding to its chaperone, protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), for lysosomal compartmentalization, stability and catalytic activation.

Mutant mice developed signs of lysosomal disease after 1year of age, predominantly in the kidney, albeit low residual NEU1 activity was detected in most organs and cell types.

NEU1 encodes neuraminidase 1 (PMID: 8985184), an enzyme that is involved in degradation of sialated glyconguates via hydrolyzing terminal N-acetylated neuraminic acids (sialic acids) in oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, colominic acid and synthetic substrates (as reviewed in PMID: 26949572). Patients with sialidosis show deficient neuraminidase I activity (PMID: 836321, PMID: 610423), leading to accumulation of sialylated oligosaccharides and glycoproteins and urinary excretion of sialylated oligosaccharides and glycoproteins and resulting in characteristic clinical disease manifestations including skeletal anomalies, coarse facies, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurologic impairment (as reviewed in PMID: 26949572). \n\nThe disease mechanism of sialidosis is loss of function. Sialidosis was first reported in 1968 by Spranger et al. (PMID: 4235073) and the first report of biallelic variants in NEU1 among sialidosis cases was in 1996 by Bonten et al. (PMID: 8985184). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between NEU1 and sialidosis. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 8985184, PMID: 10767332, PMID: 9054950, PMID: 11702224, PMID: 11470272, PMID: 14695530, PMID: 18343720). In total, fourteen variants from ten probands in seven publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between NEU1 and sialidosis includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (neuraminidase 1) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with sialidosis (PMID: 8985184, PMID: 836321, PMID: 610423, PMID: 26949572); the biochemical and clinical features of NEU1 knockout mice (PMID: 12023988); and rescue of enzyme function via chaperone-mediated gene therapy in NEU1 transgenic mice (PMID: 23770387). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, NEU1 is definitively associated with sialidosis. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on September 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:01f588c4-4fef-493d-b5e0-a76fb9492244"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
