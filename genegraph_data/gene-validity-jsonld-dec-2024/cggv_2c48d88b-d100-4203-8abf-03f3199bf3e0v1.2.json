A virtually identical phenotype is observed in the warfarin embryopathy, which is due to the teratogenic effects of coumarin derivatives during pregnancy. We have cloned the genomic region within Xp22.3 where the CDPX gene has been assigned and isolated three adjacent genes showing highly significant homology to the sulfatase gene family. Point mutations in one of these genes were identified in five patients with CDPX. Expression of this gene in COS cells resulted in a heat-labile arylsulfatase activity that is inhibited by warfarin. A deficiency of a heat-labile arylsulfatase activity was demonstrated in patients with deletions spanning the CDPX region. These data indicate that CDPX is caused by an inherited deficiency of a novel sulfatase and suggest that warfarin embryopathy might involve drug-induced inhibition of the same enzyme.","dc:creator":"Franco B","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"A cluster of sulfatase genes on Xp22.3: mutations in chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX) and implications for warfarin embryopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Biochemical Studies of ARSE Expressed in COS Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2c48d88b-d100-4203-8abf-03f3199bf3e0_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e76782e1-3cf3-40e3-a145-a66a466af32e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8648d5e8-c5bd-4275-b4d3-bf5c6d619f3f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblasts from patients with deletions spanning the CDPX critical region were found to have significant deficiency of heat-labile neutral arylsulfatase activity","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7720070","rdfs:label":"Arylsulfatase Activity in CDPX"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded as the possibility that ARSD and ARSF gene products may contribute to this activity cannot be excluded"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7863,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8825455b-8752-490b-9ad4-b6b457fe6e66","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010555","gene":"hgnc:719","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"ARSL was first reported in relation to X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX), a rare disorder affecting bone and cartilage, in 1976 (Sheffield et al., 1976 PMID 993917) . At least 40 unique variants (missense, nonsense, small deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 50 probands in seven publications. Variants were found to be maternally inherited in all of the cases where mothers of male probands were tested. There was also evidence of segregation in at least three families, where the variant was identified in other family members with similar features (Sheffield et al. 1998 PMID 9863597; Nino et al., 2008 PMID 18348268; Garnier et al., 2007 PMID 16937129). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for CDPX1 is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is supported by relevant experimental evidence showing that the biochemical function of ARSL deficiency resulting in CPDX is similar to the phenotype of warfarin embryopathy (Franco et al., 1995 PMID 7720070). Functional alteration resulting in deficiency of heat-labile arylsulfastase activity was shown in CPDX patient cells (Franco et al., 1995 PMID 7720070). In summary, ARSL is definitively associated with X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on 7.28.2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nFrom the Prenatal GCEP's secondary review on August 29th, 2023:   \nIn addition to the previous primary curation, there is also clear prenatal/neonatal phenotype associated with ARSL and X-Linked Chondrodysplasia Punctata, evident in many probands demonstrating the gene-disease association, and biochemical function and functional alteration of patient cells evidence. Common ultrasound findings include polyhydramnios, nasal hypoplasia, and calcification or stippling of bones, while radiograph findings include vertebral calcifications.
