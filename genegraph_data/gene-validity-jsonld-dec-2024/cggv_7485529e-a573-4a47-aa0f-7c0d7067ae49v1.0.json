Mutations in the SEPN1 gene, encoding SelN, cause a group of muscular disorders characterized by predominant affection of axial muscles. SelN has been shown to participate in calcium and redox homeostasis, but its pathophysiological role in skeletal muscle remains largely unknown. To address SelN function in vivo, we generated a Sepn1-null mouse model by gene targeting. The Sepn1(-/-) mice had normal growth and lifespan, and were macroscopically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Only minor defects were observed in muscle morphology and contractile properties in SelN-deficient mice in basal conditions. However, when subjected to challenging physical exercise and stress conditions (forced swimming test), Sepn1(-/-) mice developed an obvious phenotype, characterized by limited motility and body rigidity during the swimming session, as well as a progressive curvature of the spine and predominant alteration of paravertebral muscles. This induced phenotype recapitulates the distribution of muscle involvement in patients with SEPN1-Related Myopathy, hence positioning this new animal model as a valuable tool to dissect the role of SelN in muscle function and to characterize the pathophysiological process.","dc:creator":"Rederstorff M","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Increased muscle stress-sensitivity induced by selenoprotein N inactivation in mouse: a mammalian model for SEPN1-related myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:c4d0dd95-d4f3-4ce0-a55a-2a770e368f71","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e3a1fa1-59ba-4301-a6ea-a015897e1abe","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both mice and humans experience morphological abnormalities in muscle fibers.

As with other members of the selenoprotein family, selenoprotein N incorporates selenium in the form of selenocysteine (Sec). Most selenoproteins that have been functionally characterized are involved in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, with the Sec residue located at their catalytic site. To model SEPN1-RM, we generated a Sepn1-knockout (Sepn1(-/-)) mouse line. Homozygous Sepn1(-/-) mice are fertile, and their weight and lifespan are comparable to wild-type (WT) animals. Under baseline conditions, the muscle histology of Sepn1(-/-) mice remains normal, but subtle core lesions could be detected in skeletal muscle after inducing oxidative stress. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channels showed lower sensitivity to caffeine in SepN deficient myofibers, suggesting a possible role of SepN in RyR regulation. SepN deficiency also leads to abnormal lung development characterized by enlarged alveoli, which is associated with decreased tissue elastance and increased quasi-static compliance of Sepn1(-/-) lungs. This finding raises the possibility that the respiratory syndrome observed in patients with SEPN1 mutations may have a primary pulmonary component in addition to the weakness of respiratory muscles.","dc:creator":"Moghadaszadeh B","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Selenoprotein N deficiency in mice is associated with abnormal lung development."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Dr. Beggs, whose group published this paper, felt this evidence should be downgraded due to lack of full phenotype being seen in patients.

MmD is a clinically heterogeneous condition, in which four subgroups have been distinguished. Homozygous RYR1 mutations have been recently identified in the moderate form of MmD with hand involvement. The genes responsible for the three other forms (including the most prevalent phenotype, termed the \"classical\" phenotype) remained, so far, unknown. To further characterize the genetic basis of MmD, we analyzed a series of 62 patients through a combined positional/candidate-gene approach. On the basis of clinical and morphological data, we suspected a relationship between classical MmD and the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1), which is located on chromosome 1p36 (RSMD1 locus) and is responsible for the congenital muscular dystrophy with rigid spine syndrome (RSMD). A genomewide screening, followed by the analysis of 1p36 microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with MmD, demonstrated linkage to RSMD1 in eight families. All showed an axial myopathy with scoliosis and respiratory failure, consistent with the most severe end of the classical MmD spectrum; spinal rigidity was evident in some, but not all, patients. We excluded linkage to RSMD1 in 19 families with MmD, including 9 with classical MmD. Screening of SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with classical sporadic disease disclosed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients (12 families); 6 were novel mutations, and 3 had been described in patients with RSMD. Analysis of three deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathological variability, ranging from a dystrophic to a congenital myopathy pattern. A variable proportion of minicores was found in all the samples. The present study represents the first identification of a gene responsible for classical MmD, demonstrates its genetic heterogeneity, and reassesses the nosological boundaries between MmD and RSMD.","dc:creator":"Ferreiro A","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mutations of the selenoprotein N gene, which is implicated in rigid spine muscular dystrophy, cause the classical phenotype of multiminicore disease: reassessing the nosology of early-onset myopathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12192640","rdfs:label":"F12"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Missense variants without functional evidence of pathogenicity."},{"id":"cggv:953d6dc3-cc61-45bc-a3a3-dd5890667b04_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6afd2ece-11af-448b-87df-72d5c304d46c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"Whole-genome screening was performed using a 400-microsatellite marker set with an average spacing of 10cM.

We found two novel SEPN1 mutations in two Japanese patients with RSMD1. To clarify the pathomechanism of RSMD1, we performed immunohistochemical studies using a newly developed antibody for selenoprotein N. Selenoprotein N was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of the control muscle, but was reduced and irregularly expressed in the cytoplasm of a patient with RSMD1. The expression pattern was very similar to that of calnexin, a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Selenoprotein N seems to be an endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein, and loss of this protein leads to disturbance of muscular function. One of the families had the SEPN1 homozygous mutation in the initiation codon 1_2 ins T in exon 1 and showed truncated protein expression. The other had a homozygous 20-base duplication mutation at 80 (80_99dup, frameshift at R27) which, in theory, should generate many nonsense mutations including TGA. These nonsense mutations are premature translation termination codons and they degrade immediately by the process of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). However, truncated selenoprotein N was also expressed. A possible mechanism behind this observation is that SEPN1 mRNAs may be resistant to NMD. We report on the possible molecular mechanism behind these mutations in SEPN1. Our study clarifies molecular mechanisms of this muscular disorder.","dc:creator":"Okamoto Y","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Molecular mechanism of rigid spine with muscular dystrophy type 1 caused by novel mutations of selenoprotein N gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16779558","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Western blot indicated reduced expression of full size protein but some truncated product still made.
