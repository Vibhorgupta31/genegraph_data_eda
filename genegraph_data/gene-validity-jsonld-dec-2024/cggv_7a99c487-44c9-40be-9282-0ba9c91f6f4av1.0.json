The hallmark characteristics of this disease are intrauterine and postnatal growth restrictions, with some patients also having cerebrovascular problems such as cerebral aneurysms. The genomic basis behind most clinical features of MOPD II remains largely unclear. The aim of this work was to identify the genetic defects in a Chinese family with MOPD II associated with multiple intracranial aneurysms. The patient had typical MOPD II syndrome, with subarachnoid hemorrhage and multiple intracranial aneurysms. We identified three novel mutations in the PCNT gene, including one single base alteration (9842A>C in exon 45) and two deletions (Del-C in exon 30 and Del-16 in exon 41). The deletions were co-segregated with the affected individual in the family and were not present in the control population. Computer modeling demonstrated that the deletions may cause drastic changes on the secondary and tertiary structures, affecting the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the mutant proteins. In conclusion, we identified two novel mutations in the PCNT gene associated with MOPD II and intracranial aneurysms, and the mutations were expected to alter the stability and functioning of the protein by computer modeling.","dc:creator":"Li FF","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Identification of two novel critical mutations in PCNT gene resulting in microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II associated with multiple intracranial aneurysms."}},{"id":"cggv:be3e0b84-2925-4ae0-9941-692f0c299078_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0051076c-e016-4e20-ad49-ddd112b5732c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26231886"}],"rdfs:label":"Li III:1"},{"id":"cggv:be3e0b84-2925-4ae0-9941-692f0c299078","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be3e0b84-2925-4ae0-9941-692f0c299078_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"c.9259_9273+1del16"},{"id":"cggv:e4b89f06-56f2-4ac8-ad46-79b09fd131d0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e4b89f06-56f2-4ac8-ad46-79b09fd131d0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"c.6512delC (p.Pro2171Glnfs*74)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9169,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:547d5bc0-baea-43e8-a6b2-628406a17884","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008872","gene":"hgnc:16068","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PCNT was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type II (MOPDII) in 2008 (Rauch et al., PMID: 18174396 and Griffith et al., PMID: 18157127). Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), severe proportionate short stature, and microcephaly. Patients occasionally present with additional syndromic features, including heart defects (PMID: 29961235) and oligodontia (PMID: 31606423) in addition to the typical skeletal manifestations observed. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type II (OMIM:210720) and Seckel syndrome.\nSeven variants (nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site) that have been reported in five probands in four publications (PMIDs: 18174396, 26231886, 33460028, 35568357) are included in this curation meeting phenotypic criteria including IUGR, short stature, and microcephaly. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (if applicable). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. The curation for this gene-disease relationship did not include experimental evidence. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between PCNT and autosomal recessive microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type II. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
