Since previous reports suggest that the carboxy-truncated Kir6.2 can form a channel independent of SUR, we deleted 114 nucleotides from the carboxy terminus of the Kir6.2 open reading frame (Kir6.2deltaC37). Kir6.2deltaC37 still coimmunoprecipitated with SUR1, suggesting that the distal carboxy terminus of Kir6.2 is unnecessary for subunit association.

Sulfonylurea sensitivity is also a feature of HNF1A and HNF4A MODY, but patients referred for genetic testing with clinical features of these types of diabetes do not always have mutations in the HNF1A/4A genes.

Thirteen identified MODY variants differ from each other by the clinical course and treatment requirement. Currently, MODY subtypes 1-5 are best-studied, descriptions of the other forms are sporadic. This article reports a MODY12 clinical case, caused by a mutation in the gene of the ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family C member 8 (ABCC8), encoding sulfonylurea receptor 1. Diabetes manifested in a 27-year-old non-obese man with epilepsy in anamnesis. No evidence of ketosis was present, pancreatic antibodies were undetectable, and C-peptide remained within the reference range. During the initial investigation, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and elevated albumin excretion rate was revealed. After 4Â months, diabetes was complicated by pre-proliferative retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Recurrent hypoglycemia and an increase in body weight was observed on moderate and even small insulin doses. Taking into account the clinical features and the presence of diabetes in four generations on the maternal side, screening for all MODY subtypes was performed. A mutation in the ABCC8 gene was found in proband and in his mother. After the insulin discontinuation, gliclazide modified release combined with sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors was started. This treatment eliminated hypoglycemia and improved glycemic variability parameters. A decrease in the amplitude of glucose excursions was documented by continuous glucose monitoring. After 3Â months of treatment, glycemic control was still optimal, and no hypoglycemic episodes were observed. The case report demonstrates the clinical features of ABCC8-associated MODY and the therapeutic potential of a combination of sulfonylurea with SGLT2 inhibitor in this disease.

Isolated heterozygosity for an inactivating variant in *ABCC8* is *not* a cause of monogenic diabetes.  It is thus especially crucial to have phenotypic information when evaluating the pathogenicity of ABCC8 variants.**  \n\nWe have curated the inheritance pattern for *ABCC8* monogenic diabetes as semidominant because while most cases are autosomal dominant, there have since been reported a few cases with a recessive mode of inheritance (Ellard et al, 2007, PMID: 17668386).  The mechanism for dominant cases is activating variants resulting in a KATP channel unable to close in response to ATP, impairing insulin secretion. The occasional recessive cases are caused by either (1) homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for partially activating variants or (2) a partially activating variant that only causes diabetes when inherited in trans with an inactivating variant (PMID: 17668386). At least 40 diabetes-causing variants (primarily missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting relationship of this gene with diabetes includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Summary of case-level and segregation data: 12 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 43 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 21989597, 27538677, 31604004, 31562829, 16885549, 17668386, 32027066), with most cases presenting as either permanent or transient neonatal diabetes but a few presenting later in childhood or young adulthood, which could represent a missed transient neonatal diabetes diagnosis. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 17 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays, expression studies, and animal models. In a Sur1 knockout mouse model, mice exhibited absence of KATP channels in pancreatic beta-cells, spontaneous electrical activity, and altered response to glucose stimulation (PMID: 10734066). The *ABCC8* encoded protein, SUR1, has been reported to act as the regulatory subunit of the KATP channel and modulate ATP-sensitive potassium channels and therefore insulin release, with glucose increase causing increase in ATP levels which inhibits SUR1 and closes the KATP channel (PMID: 24768178). SUR1 and Kir6.2 were shown to physically interact through coimmunoprecipitation (PMID: 9488482), and *ABCC8* expression has been confirmed in pancreatic tissue (PMID: 24309898).  Total points for experimental evidence: 4.  Total points for genetic and experimental evidence: 16.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the curation of ABCC8 has been split into multiple disease entities, which in addition to monogenic diabetes include hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (MONDO:0018619), susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (MONDO:0005148), and pulmonary hypertension (MONDO: 0005149). These will be curated separately.\nIn summary, *ABCC8* is definitively associated with semidominant monogenic diabetes, with most cases presenting in infancy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:33c0dfa5-c6ea-42fd-8118-be6ff97beb3e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
