The common form of the syndrome is triggered by infection with Shiga toxin-producing bacteria and has a favorable outcome. The less common form of the syndrome, called atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, accounts for about 10% of cases, and patients with this form of the syndrome have a poor prognosis. Approximately half of the patients with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome have mutations in genes that regulate the complement system. Genetic factors in the remaining cases are unknown. We studied the role of thrombomodulin, an endothelial glycoprotein with anticoagulant, antiinflammatory, and cytoprotective properties, in atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome.","dc:creator":"Delvaeye M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Thrombomodulin mutations in atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Refuted","sequence":8525,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bbd9c034-4d1a-4016-9e3c-87186c57194d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016244","gene":"hgnc:11784","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"THBD was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in 2009 (Delvaeye et al., PMID: 19625716). Genetic variants in THBD, which encodes thrombomodulin, have been reported to cause aHUS (PMID: 19625716) however, analysis of large aHUS cohorts (PMIDs: 23307876, 37369098, 37567446) and enrichment analysis (PMIDs: 29500241, 30377230) have failed to reproduce these findings. Therefore, none of the genetic variants in THBD identified in patients with aHUS were included in this curation for scoring. Furthermore, the experimental evidence available (PMID: 19625716) has been excluded in light of the evidence refuting this gene-disease relationship. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between THBD and autosomal dominant aHUS has been refuted and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement-Mediated Kidney Diseases GCEP on the meeting date May 15, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\nGenetic variants in THBD, which encodes thrombomodulin, have been reported to cause aHUS (PMID: 19625716) however, analysis of large aHUS cohorts (PMIDs: 23307876, 37369098, 37567446) and enrichment analysis (PMIDs: 29500241, 30377230) have failed to reproduce these findings.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
