Constant ER turnover and modulation is needed to meet different cellular requirements and autophagy has an important role in this process. However, its underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unexplained. Here we show that members of the FAM134 reticulon protein family are ER-resident receptors that bind to autophagy modifiers LC3 and GABARAP, and facilitate ER degradation by autophagy ('ER-phagy'). Downregulation of FAM134B protein in human cells causes an expansion of the ER, while FAM134B overexpression results in ER fragmentation and lysosomal degradation. Mutant FAM134B proteins that cause sensory neuropathy in humans are unable to act as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, disruption of Fam134b in mice causes expansion of the ER, inhibits ER turnover, sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to degeneration of sensory neurons. Therefore, selective ER-phagy via FAM134 proteins is indispensable for mammalian cell homeostasis and controls ER morphology and turnover in mice and humans.","dc:creator":"Khaminets A","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Regulation of endoplasmic reticulum turnover by selective autophagy."},"rdfs:label":"Fam134b –/– mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:e0b9041f-06f2-47c8-b070-5d4cfaaeb2db_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bfe292d8-7059-49f3-a1e9-d0e2c6951393_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bfe292d8-7059-49f3-a1e9-d0e2c6951393","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:8e7fa785-6d1e-4b25-9528-78e393c46e13","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001034850.3(RETREG1):c.873+2T>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341808"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003390","obo:HP_0012332","obo:HP_0007021","obo:HP_0200042"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:785570a1-61dc-4493-8cb4-4b3f60cfa24a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8e7fa785-6d1e-4b25-9528-78e393c46e13"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19838196"},"rdfs:label":"Kurth Family D -

HSAN has been classified into five subtypes depending on clinical presentation.

This family had four affected children and a history of consanguinity; a region of interest was identified via genome-wide homozygosity mapping, then sequencing of the 7 genes in the region identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in RETREG1 which was predicted to cause nonsense mediated decay (c.926C>G; p.S309X). This condition has since been described in at least 30 individuals across 15 unrelated families (PMIDs: 19838196, 21115472, 24327336, 3064365, 31737055, 33943063, 35332675, 37448294). Symptoms are variable but tend to be early-onset with impaired nociception, ulcerations of hands and feet, chronic osteomyelitis leading to progressive acro-osteolysis, and exclusively or predominantly axonal sensory neuropathy. At least one family has been described with renal disease (PMID: 37448294). All described causative variants to date are predicted to cause loss of function. Most individuals have homozygous mutations and a history of consanguinity, but one family is compound heterozygous (PMID: 33943063) and there is one case of uniparental disomy (PMID: 31737055). Ample experimental evidence supports RETREG1’s role in disease including expression data, functional alteration of non-patient cells, and a mouse model (PMIDs: 19838196, 26040720). Data clearly shows that RETREG1 is found in small and large neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia and in N2a cells, and has significant overlap with giantin (PMID: 19838196). Knockdown of the protein leads to significantly smaller cis-Golgi apparatus, impaired cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis (PMID: 19838196). In the mouse model, knockdown mice were shown to have similar phenotypes to human patients (PMID: 26040720). Available evidence totals 15 points and has been replicated over time; therefore, RETREG1 is definitively associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN2B).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e0b9041f-06f2-47c8-b070-5d4cfaaeb2db"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
