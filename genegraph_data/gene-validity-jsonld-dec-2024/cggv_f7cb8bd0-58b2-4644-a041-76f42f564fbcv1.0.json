The patient presented normal at birth but developed in the 1st year of life a multisystemic disorder with mental retardation, seizures, coloboma of the iris, hypomyelination, hepatomegaly, and coagulation abnormalities. An accumulation of Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol was observed in skin fibroblasts of the patient. Incubation of patient fibroblast extracts with Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and GDP-mannose revealed a severely reduced activity of the mannosyltransferase elongating Man1GlcNAc2-PP dolichol. Because the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant alg2-1 was known to accumulate the same shortened dolichol-linked oligosaccharides as the patient, the yeast ALG2 sequence was used to identify the human ortholog. Genetic analysis revealed that the patient was heterozygous for a single nucleotide deletion and a single nucleotide substitution in the human ortholog of yeast ALG2. Expression of wild type but not of mutant hALG2 cDNA restored the mannosyltransferase activity and the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides both in patient fibroblasts and in the alg2-1 yeast cells. hALG2 was shown to act as an alpha1,3-mannosyltransferase. The resulting Manalpha1,3-ManGlcNAc2-PP dolichol is further elongated by a yet unknown alpha1,6-mannosyltransferase.","dc:creator":"Thiel C","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"A new type of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG-Ii) provides new insights into the early steps of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7cb8bd0-58b2-4644-a041-76f42f564fbc_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7cb8bd0-58b2-4644-a041-76f42f564fbc_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3dc25742-1015-41c1-bf2a-476fce3cabc7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c9103e2-e5cd-4831-921d-006493ef84c7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Mutations in this pathway are labeled as Congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ii.

We modelled a putative hypomorphic mutation described in an alpha-1,3/1,6-mannosyltransferase (ALG2) index patient (ALG2-CDG) to address the developmental consequences in the teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes). We observed specific, multisystemic, late-onset phenotypes, closely resembling the patient's syndrome, prominently in the facial skeleton and in neuronal tissue. Molecularly, we detected reduced levels of N-glycans in medaka and in the patient's fibroblasts. This hypo-N-glycosylation prominently affected protein abundance. Proteins of the basic glycosylation and glycoprotein-processing machinery were over-represented in a compensatory response, highlighting the regulatory topology of the network. Proteins of the retinal phototransduction machinery, conversely, were massively under-represented in the alg2 model. These deficiencies relate to a specific failure to maintain rod photoreceptors, resulting in retinitis pigmentosa characterized by the progressive loss of these photoreceptors. Our work has explored only the tip of the iceberg of N-glycosylation-sensitive proteins, the function of which specifically impacts on cells, tissues and organs. Taking advantage of the well-described human mutation has allowed the complex interplay of N-glycosylated proteins and their contribution to development and disease to be addressed.","dc:creator":"Gücüm S","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A patient-based medaka alg2 mutant as a model for hypo-N-glycosylation."},"rdfs:label":"Medaka alg2 variants "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f7cb8bd0-58b2-4644-a041-76f42f564fbc_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e108c9f0-ec74-48c9-9b15-12e0b213cf39","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d4282c4-8019-4e45-a2cb-5b2979b1f798","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Transduction of the Δ1040G mutant had no impact (Figure 9, lane 5).

They are characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. We performed linkage analysis, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to determine the underlying defect in patients with an inherited limb-girdle pattern of myasthenic weakness. We identify ALG14 and ALG2 as novel genes in which mutations cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome. Through analogy with yeast, ALG14 is thought to form a multiglycosyltransferase complex with ALG13 and DPAGT1 that catalyses the first two committed steps of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation. We show that ALG14 is concentrated at the muscle motor endplates and small interfering RNA silencing of ALG14 results in reduced cell-surface expression of muscle acetylcholine receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. ALG2 is an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase that also catalyses early steps in the asparagine-linked glycosylation pathway. Mutations were identified in two kinships, with mutation ALG2p.Val68Gly found to severely reduce ALG2 expression both in patient muscle, and in cell cultures. Identification of DPAGT1, ALG14 and ALG2 mutations as a cause of congenital myasthenic syndrome underscores the importance of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction. These syndromes form part of the wider spectrum of congenital disorders of glycosylation caused by impaired asparagine-linked glycosylation. It is likely that further genes encoding components of this pathway will be associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes or impaired neuromuscular transmission as part of a more severe multisystem disorder. Our findings suggest that treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors may improve muscle function in many of the congenital disorders of glycosylation.","dc:creator":"Cossins J","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Congenital myasthenic syndromes due to mutations in ALG2 and ALG14."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 7"},{"id":"cggv:ee92e82e-aa8c-4ee1-8f9c-8e458306796e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee92e82e-aa8c-4ee1-8f9c-8e458306796e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ee92e82e-aa8c-4ee1-8f9c-8e458306796e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transfection of HEK 293 cells with wild-type and mutant ALG2 complementary DNA showed reduction in ALG2 expression to approximately 20% of control levels in Western blot analysis of cell lysates."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"consanguineous parents"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5d1ae9e4-fdc4-4ab5-b2ce-d9a8568ffa75_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d1ae9e4-fdc4-4ab5-b2ce-d9a8568ffa75","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:19458fcc-5c0a-47b2-93cd-b23939cf755b"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Bilateral fronto-parietal atrophy, cochlear and retrocochlear hearing loss","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003642","obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0011097","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0000821","obo:HP_0012368","obo:HP_0000431","obo:HP_0003186","obo:HP_0000817","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0033725","obo:HP_0006829","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002014"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:23067995-c9b0-4284-a66b-a863bebe0b70_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:19458fcc-5c0a-47b2-93cd-b23939cf755b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33644825","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Human ALG2 encodes an α 1,3mannosyltransferase that catalyzes the first steps in the synthesis of N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum.

ALG2-CDG is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by neurological involvement, convulsive syndrome of unknown origin, axial hypotonia, and mental and motor regression. In this study, we used MALDI-TOF MS to define both total serum protein and transferrin (Tf) N-glycan phenotypes in three ALG2-CDG patients carrying a c.752G > T, p.Arg251Leu ALG2 missense variant in homozygous state, as determined by exome sequencing. Comparing it to control samples, we have observed Tf under-occupancy of glycosylation site(s) typical of a defective N-glycan assembly and the occurrence of oligomannose and hybrid type N-glycans. Moreover, we have observed a slight oligomannose accumulation in total serum glyco-profiles. The increased heterogeneity of serum N-glycome in the studied patients suggests a marginal disarrangement of the glycan processing in ALG2-CDG. Previous studies reported on slightly increased concentrations of abnormal serum N-glycans in CDG-I due to defects in the mannosylation steps of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis.

At least 6 unique variants (varied in missense,frameshift, indels) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands from publications (PMIDs: 12684507, 34980536, 23404334, 30397276, 33644825). Patient have a range of range of symptoms, such as developmental delay, seizures, poor vision, coagulopathy, and delayed myelinization. Patients may also present with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) which characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of *ALG2*, which encodes an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase that catalyzes the second and third mannosylation steps in the N-linked glycosylation pathway (PMID:  23404334). A yeast assay was done where cDNAs encoding wild type hALG2 or the Δ1040G mutant were introduced into the temperature-sensitive alg2-1 yeast strain.This showed that only the wild-type hALG2 cDNA, not the mutant Δ1040G form, restored the formation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in alg2-1 cells (PMID: 12684507) In addition, an *ALG2 *mutant medaka model was employed to explore the effects of *ALG2 *gene mutations on embryonic development. The investigation revealed that introduced mutations in the *ALG2* gene resulted in abnormalities during late-stage embryonic development, reminiscent of the multisystemic phenotypes observed in *ALG2*-CDG patients. \nIn that same model there was rescue of the phenotype with the injection of either medaka or human alg2 mRNA, the survival of homozygous mutant embryos was restored (PMID: 34106226). In summary, there is strong evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence, genetic and experimental, is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. A classification of STRONG was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on 11/15/23 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f7cb8bd0-58b2-4644-a041-76f42f564fbc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
