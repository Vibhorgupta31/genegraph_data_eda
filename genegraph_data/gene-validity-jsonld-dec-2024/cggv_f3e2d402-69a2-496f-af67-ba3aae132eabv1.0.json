Expression of these proteins is regulated developmentally, increasing with gestational age, and is critical for pulmonary surfactant function at birth. Pulmonary surfactant is a unique mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface, preventing collapse of the lung at the end of expiration. SP-B and ABCA3 are required for the normal organization and packaging of surfactant phospholipids into specialized secretory organelles, known as lamellar bodies, while both SP-B and SP-C are important for adsorption of secreted surfactant phospholipids to the alveolar surface. In general, mutations in the SP-B gene SFTPB are associated with fatal respiratory distress in the neonatal period, and mutations in the SP-C gene SFTPC are more commonly associated with interstitial lung disease in older infants, children, and adults. Mutations in the ABCA3 gene are associated with both phenotypes. Despite this general classification, there is considerable overlap in the clinical and histologic characteristics of these genetic disorders. In this review, similarities and differences in the presentation of these disorders with an emphasis on their histochemical and ultrastructural features will be described, along with a brief discussion of surfactant metabolism.

Here, we report the generation of Abca3 null mice, which became lethargic and cyanotic and died within 1 h of birth. Tissue blots found ABCA3 expression was highest in lung but was also detectable in other tissues, including the kidney. Gross development of kidney and lung was normal in neonatal Abca3(-/-) pups, but the mice failed to inflate their lungs, leading to death from atelectatic respiratory failure. Ultrastructural analysis of the Abca3(-/-) lungs revealed an absence of surfactant from the alveolar space and a profound loss of mature lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage organelle for surfactant. Mass spectrometry measurement of >300 phospholipids in lung tissue taken from Abca3(-/-) mice showed a dramatic reduction of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) levels as well as selective reductions in phosphatidylcholine species containing short acyl chains. These results establish a requirement of ABCA3 for lamellar body formation and pulmonary surfactant secretion and suggest a unique and critical role for the transporter in the metabolism of pulmonary PG.

Individuals with variants in *ABCA3* are often reported to have surfactant deficiency, respiratory distress, and failure in the neonatal period or in infancy, but variants have also been found in older children and adults with isolated chronic interstitial lung disease (PMID: 19220077). Of note, *ABCA3* has also been seen in monoallelic cases of ILD where another variant was also present (SFTPC p.I73T), but *ABCA3* was described as a modifier gene in those cases and they were not included in this curation (PMIDs: 17597647, 20371530). \n\nFourteen variants (10 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 frameshift, 1 canonical splice site) that have been reported in 10 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 15044640, 32238781) are included in this curation. c.875A>T (p.Glu292Val) has been identified as a common variant seen in numerous patients with varying phenotypes (PMID: 32238781). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function being shared with other known genes (SFTPB and SFTPC) in the disease of interest (PMID: 19220077), expression data showing high expression in lung tissue (PMID: 23715323), functional alteration assays modeling the disrupted intracellular trafficking and impaired ATPase-mediated phospholipid transport into the lamellar bodies of *ABCA3* variants in A549 cells (PMID: 32196812) mouse models that exhibit respiratory failure, neonatal death, and abnormal lamellar bodies similar to the human phenotype (PMIDs: 17142808, 17577581, 17267394), and cell culture models displaying abnormal-appearing lamellar body–like vesicles with significantly smaller vesicle diameters (P < 0.001) compared to WT (PMID: 32692933). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ABCA3* and autosomal recessive interstitial lung disease due to *ABCA3* dysfunction. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Interstitial Lung Disease GCEP on September 17, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f3e2d402-69a2-496f-af67-ba3aae132eab"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
