To date, only a few patients have been reported worldwide. Their clinical presentation has been remarkably consistent with primary features of severe psychomotor retardation, encephalopathy, hypotonia, and infantile-onset refractory epilepsy. We report a new case of ABAT deficiency that marks an important departure from previous clinical findings. The patient presented at age 6 months with global developmental delay, hypotonia, hypersomnolence and mild choreiform movements. At age 18 months, the subject's clinical presentation was still milder than all previously reported patients and, most notably, did not include seizures. Clinical whole exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous ABAT missense variants that are rare and predicted damaging, but never before reported in a patient and were reported as variants of unknown significance. To test the potential pathogenicity of the variants identified in this patient we developed a cell-based system to test both functions of the ABAT protein via GABA transaminase enzyme activity and mtDNA copy number assays. This systematic approach was validated using vigabatrin, the irreversible inhibitor of ABAT, and leveraged to test the functionality of all ABAT variants in previously reported patients plus the variants in this new case. This work confirmed the novel variants compromised ABAT function to similar levels as variants in previously characterized cases with more severe clinical presentation, thereby confirming the molecular diagnosis of this patient. Additionally, functional studies conducted in cells from both mild and severe patient fibroblasts showed similar levels of compromise in mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory capacity, ATP production and mtDNA depletion. These results illustrate how cell-based functional studies can aid in the diagnosis of a rare, neurological disorder. Importantly, this patient marks an expansion in the clinical phenotype for ABAT deficiency to a milder presentation that is more commonly seen in pediatric genetics and neurology clinics.","dc:creator":"Besse A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Personalized medicine approach confirms a milder case of ABAT deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:aeed5504-3f7d-46fb-a9de-deea0124acc0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:dcd5f202-b35f-4282-9ccf-bf87f8004d2b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27903293"}],"rdfs:label":"Proband"},{"id":"cggv:8efe90df-9173-4b67-88fb-1d28e80ffa44","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8efe90df-9173-4b67-88fb-1d28e80ffa44_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8efe90df-9173-4b67-88fb-1d28e80ffa44_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Allele c.454C > T shows decreased enzyme activity: 61% (GABA-T), 75% (mtDNA)"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:aeed5504-3f7d-46fb-a9de-deea0124acc0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aeed5504-3f7d-46fb-a9de-deea0124acc0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:aeed5504-3f7d-46fb-a9de-deea0124acc0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Allele c.1393G>C shows decreased enzyme activity: 46% (GABA-T), 65% (mtDNA)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3a5138ad-d4b8-4ea1-aa78-b5d1f07b2b82_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9.5},{"id":"cggv:cf383934-6675-46ca-b5f1-ce4a793b726c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf383934-6675-46ca-b5f1-ce4a793b726c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0f2ddaa2-3e6d-4f09-9e2d-bd9717b1410f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020686.6(ABAT):c.316G>A (p.Gly106Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA394687995"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001347","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0100704","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0000365"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:f6601877-37a6-44f4-ae6f-03a87d9cfe20_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0f2ddaa2-3e6d-4f09-9e2d-bd9717b1410f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768830","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"GABA transaminase deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset epileptic encephalopathies.

It is caused by mutations in the ABAT gene, which encodes 4-aminobutyrate transaminase, an enzyme of GABA catabolism and mitochondrial nucleoside salvage. We report the case of a boy, deceased at 12 months of age, with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, lower-limb hyporeflexia, central hypoventilation, and rapid increase in weight and, to a lesser rate, length and head circumference. He presented signs of premature pubarche, thermal instability, and water-electrolyte imbalance. Serum total testosterone was elevated (43.3 ng/dl; normal range <16), as well as serum growth hormone (7.7 ng/ml; normal range <1). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed decreased myelination and generalized brain atrophy, later confirmed by post-mortem examination. ABAT gene sequencing was performed post-mortem, identifying a homozygous variant c.888G > T (p.Gln296His),not previously described. In vitro analysis concluded that this variant is pathogenic. The clinical features of this patient are similar to those reported so far in GABA-T deficiency. However, distinct mutations may have a different effect on enzymatic activity, which potentially could lead to a variable clinical outcome. Clinical investigation aiming for a diagnosis should not end with the patient's death, as it may allow a more precise genetic counselling for the family.","dc:creator":"Louro P","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Phenotyping GABA transaminase deficiency: a case description and literature review."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband"},{"id":"cggv:7491dd84-3097-4c28-9a0b-633e296b3295","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7491dd84-3097-4c28-9a0b-633e296b3295_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Score upgraded due to evidence that missense variants in this gene and location produce a reliable epilepsy phenotype, despite lacking functional evidence."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":4611,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":9.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0480ce44-ae2e-4920-a565-d1f30075c7f1","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100062","gene":"hgnc:23","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Variants in ABAT were first reported in association with an infantile epilepsy phenotype in 1984 by Jaeken et al. (PMID:6148708). This publication described a two-year-old patient with frequent convulsions, severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, and hyperreflexia. Cerebrospinal fluid amino acid analysis revealed a GABA transaminase deficiency. A sibling with similar features died in infancy. Subsequent reports from 1984 to the present day continue to support an association between ABAT and a rare genetic epilepsy condition. In total, nine subjects have been described. In all subjects, this condition was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern (four homozygous from consanguinous parents; five heterozygous from non-consanguinous parents). \n\nSummary of Case Level Data: \nIn 1999, Medina-Kauwe et al. (PMID:10407778) reported a subject with a very similar phenotype to Jaeken et al., including seizures immediately after birth. Unfortunately, genetic information was limited (only noting a deletion in the 3’ end of ABAT), and so a minimal score of 0.1 was provided (i.e. unclear if a second variant was present in trans or not, fitting the autosomal recessive phenotype). Tsuji et al. (2010, PMID:20052547), Besse et al. (2015, PMID:27903293) and Nagappa et al. (2017, PMID:27596361) reported compound heterozygous variants in ABAT, inherited from non-consanguineous parents. Publications from Besse et al. (2015, PMID:25738457), Louro et al. (2016, PMID:27376954), Koenig et al. (2017, PMID:28411234) and Oshi et al. (2021, PMID:33768830) reported probands with homozygous missense variants. The cases from Koenig and Oshi were confirmed to be inherited from consanguineous parents. In all nine cases reported thus far, there is a clear ABAT phenotype, consisting of recurrent seizures that begin during infancy, uncontrolled limb movements, hyperreflexia, hypotonia, and accelerated linear growth with failure to thrive. Most do not survive past the first two years. \n\nCases were scored in line with the ClinGen SOP Ver. 8 guidelines for autosomal recessive variants, after consultation with its Epilepsy Expert Panel on April 19, 2022. Some adjustments were made, taking into account inheritance, genotyping methods used, and strength of the overall evidence.\n\nExperimental Evidence: \nAt this time, experimental evidence for this rare ABAT epilepsy phenotype is lacking. With time and additional case reports, experimental studies/functional analysis will clarify the impact of ABAT variants on cellular function and overall human disease seizure phenotype.\n\nIn summary, at present there is moderate case-level evidence to support a definitive classification for this gene-disease relationship. It must be noted that this is not due to insufficient strength of individual cases, but rather, an insufficient number of cases overall to reach definitive status under ClinGen scoring guidelines. As more reports and studies become available, it is likely confidence in this gene-disease association will only increase. A subsequent re-curation should be conducted in the future to incorporate any future cases into this existing curation, along with an updated score.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3a5138ad-d4b8-4ea1-aa78-b5d1f07b2b82"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
