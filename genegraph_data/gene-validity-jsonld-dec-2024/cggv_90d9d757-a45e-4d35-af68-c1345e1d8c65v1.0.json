Mutation screening revealed compound heterozygosity for SCO1 gene mutations in the patients. The mutated allele, inherited from the father, harbored a 2-bp frameshift deletion (DeltaGA; nt 363-364) resulting in both a premature stop codon and a highly unstable mRNA. The maternally inherited mutation (C520T) changed a highly conserved proline into a leucine in the protein (P174L). This proline, adjacent to the CxxxC copper-binding domain of SCO1, is likely to play a crucial role in the tridimentional structure of the domain.

Human Surf1 is a CcO assembly factor with an important but poorly characterized role in CcO biogenesis. Here, we analyzed the impact on CcO assembly and tissue copper levels of a G132S mutation in the juxtamembrane region of SCO1 metallochaperone associated with early onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy, hypotonia, and hepatopathy, assessed the total copper content of various SURF1 and SCO2-deficient tissues, and investigated the possible physical association between CcO and Sco1. The steady-state level of mutant Sco1 was severely decreased in the muscle mitochondria of the SCO1 patient, indicating compromised stability and thus loss of function of the protein. Unlike the wild-type variant, residual mutant Sco1 appeared to migrate exclusively in the monomeric form on blue native gels. Both the activity and content of CcO were reduced in the patient's muscle to approximately 10-20% of control values. SCO1-deficient mitochondria showed accumulation of two Cox2 subcomplexes, suggesting that Sco1 is very likely responsible for a different posttranslational aspect of Cox2 maturation than Sco2. Intriguingly, the various SURF1-deficient samples analyzed showed a tissue-specific copper deficiency similar to that of SCO-deficient samples, suggesting a role for Surf1 in copper homeostasis regulation. Finally, both blue native immunoblot analysis and coimmunoprecipitation revealed that a fraction of Sco1 physically associates with the CcO complex in human muscle mitochondria, suggesting a possible direct relationship between CcO and the regulation of cellular copper homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Stiburek L","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Loss of function of Sco1 and its interaction with cytochrome c oxidase."}},"rdfs:label":"Stiburek Case SCO1"},{"id":"cggv:7af363e1-ecd9-48db-83b8-4a238f70b55c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7af363e1-ecd9-48db-83b8-4a238f70b55c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7af363e1-ecd9-48db-83b8-4a238f70b55c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"While there is functional data, given that only SCO1 gene sequencing was performed, evidence cannot be scored at the variant/case level"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"While there is functional data, given that only SCO1 gene sequencing was performed, evidence cannot be scored at the variant/case level"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c1d989ec-2b74-4fe3-9e35-24b0be2bb6fa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c1d989ec-2b74-4fe3-9e35-24b0be2bb6fa","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:3b33a781-e221-4c65-9a1e-f787a6cade18","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004589.4(SCO1):c.880A>G (p.Met294Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8393453"}},{"id":"cggv:b91fa605-2d6e-4ea9-8ad7-8c5ca7f6087b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000017.11:g.10695735A>G (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2247359997"}}],"detectionMethod":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of control and patient DNA amplicons confirmed that the wild-type transcript was not detectable in the patient background (data not shown)","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002045","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002098","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001332"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:3e8717bc-c440-4fb7-ae09-0ee1ab739955_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b91fa605-2d6e-4ea9-8ad7-8c5ca7f6087b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23878101","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Isolated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is a common cause of mitochondrial disease, yet its genetic basis remains unresolved in many patients.

The patient lacked the severe hepatopathy (p.P174L) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p.G132S) observed in previously reported SCO1 cases, so we investigated whether allele-specific defects in SCO1 function might underlie the genotype-phenotype relationships. Fibroblasts expressing p.M294V had a relatively modest decrease in COX activity compared with those expressing p.P174L, whereas both SCO1 lines had marked copper deficiencies. Overexpression of known pathogenic variants in SCO1 fibroblasts showed that p.G132S exacerbated the COX deficiency, whereas COX activity was partially or fully restored by p.P174L and p.M294V, respectively.

SCO1 patients present with severe forms of early onset disease, and ultimately succumb from liver, heart or brain failure. However, the inherent susceptibility of these tissues to SCO1 mutations and the clinical heterogeneity observed across SCO1 pedigrees remain poorly understood phenomena. To further address this issue, we generated Sco1hrt/hrt and Sco1stm/stm mice in which Sco1 was specifically deleted in heart and striated muscle, respectively. Lethality was observed in both models due to a combined COX and copper deficiency that resulted in a dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular dilation and loss of heart function was preceded by a temporal decrease in COX activity and copper levels in the longer-lived Sco1stm/stm mice. Interestingly, the reduction in copper content of Sco1stm/stm cardiomyocytes was due to the mislocalisation of CTR1, the high affinity transporter that imports copper into the cell. CTR1 was similarly mislocalized to the cytosol in the heart of knockin mice carrying a homozygous G115S substitution in Sco1, which in humans causes a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our current findings in the heart are in marked contrast to our prior observations in the liver, where Sco1 deletion results in a near complete absence of CTR1 protein. These data collectively argue that mutations perturbing SCO1 function have tissue-specific consequences for the machinery that ultimately governs copper homeostasis, and further establish the importance of aberrant mitochondrial signaling to the etiology of copper handling disorders.","dc:creator":"Baker ZN","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"The mitochondrial metallochaperone SCO1 maintains CTR1 at the plasma membrane to preserve copper homeostasis in the murine heart."},"rdfs:label":"Sco1 Mouse Heart knockout studies + G115S knockin "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"0.5 (cardiomyopathy phenotype) + 0.5 (specific complex IV deficiency + Copper deficiency) x 3 (knockout muscle, knock out heart, knockin G115S)"},{"id":"cggv:cefd3878-3248-47ff-b95e-c0664502ec35","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cfbbee8d-ce53-4867-947d-61bec8af2620","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Liver-specific Sco1 knockout mice exhibited normal weight gain for roughly the first\n28 days of life, but failed to thrive thereafter, with subsequent weight loss producing a runted phenotype (Figures 1A and 1B).\n\nLiver-specific Sco1 knockout mice had a median life expectancy of 70 days (c2 analysis, p < 0.0001) (Figure 1C), which was associated with the loss of immunologically detectable SCO1 in the\nliver (Figure 1D).\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the spotty nature of Sco1-null livers was attributable to an increase in lipid droplet accumulation...

While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SCO1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SCO1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants, including two frameshift truncating variants shown to undergo nonsense mediated decay, three missense variants, and one in-frame deletion, in four probands across four publications (PMIDs: 11013136, 19295170, 23878101, 31352446). *SCO1* pathogenic variants were first described in an infant with respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, hepatic failure, and encephalopathy in the setting of profound complex IV deficiency in muscle and liver.  Subsequent publications have shown expansion of the phenotypic spectrum including cardiomyopathy in one case and one case of encephalopathy and lactic acidosis without cardiac or hepatic involvement. Many cases reported to date have been fatal in the first few months of life. Of note, one report showed segregation in four affected family members (including two fetuses with isolated complex IV deficiency by chorionic villus sampling) and non-segregation in two unaffected siblings, which reached a LOD score of 2.06, which was sufficient to count in the case estimate (0.5 points; PMID:11013136). The total score for case-level data was 8.9 points, 8.4 of which was attributed to the four probands, three of which had extensive functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of their variants, including supportive respiratory chain enzyme assays, tissue copper studies, and western blots, as well as qPCR studies on cDNA. Loss-of-function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 23878101, 19295170, 28973536, 25683716). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 17, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:90d9d757-a45e-4d35-af68-c1345e1d8c65"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
