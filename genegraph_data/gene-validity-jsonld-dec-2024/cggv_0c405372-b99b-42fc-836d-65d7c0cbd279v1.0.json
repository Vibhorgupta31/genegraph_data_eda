By assessing genetic variation across GluN2 domains, we determined that the agonist binding domain, transmembrane domain, and the linker regions between these domains were particularly intolerant to functional variation. Notably, the agonist binding domain of GluN2B exhibited significantly more variation intolerance than that of GluN2A. To understand the ramifications of missense variation in the agonist binding domain, we investigated the mechanisms by which 25 rare variants in the GluN2A and GluN2B agonist binding domains dysregulated NMDAR activity. When introduced into recombinant human NMDARs, these rare variants identified in individuals with neurologic disease had complex, and sometimes opposing, consequences on agonist binding, channel gating, receptor biogenesis, and forward trafficking. Our approach combined quantitative assessments of these effects to estimate the overall impact on synaptic and non-synaptic NMDAR function. Interestingly, similar neurologic diseases were associated with both gain- and loss-of-function variants in the same gene. Most rare variants in GluN2A were associated with epilepsy, whereas GluN2B variants were associated with intellectual disability with or without seizures. Finally, discerning the mechanisms underlying NMDAR dysregulation by these rare variants allowed investigations of pharmacologic strategies to correct NMDAR function.","dc:creator":"Swanger SA","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mechanistic Insight into NMDA Receptor Dysregulation by Rare Variants in the GluN2A and GluN2B Agonist Binding Domains."},"rdfs:label":"Synaptic charge transfer"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant level evidence.

The NMDA receptor channel is formed by at least two members of the glutamate receptor (GluR) channel subunit families, the GluR epsilon (NR2) and GluR zeta (NR1) subunit families. The four epsilon subunits are distinct in distribution, properties and regulation. On the basis of the Mg2+ sensitivity and expression patterns, we have proposed that the epsilon 1 (NR2A) and epsilon 2 (NR2B) subunits play a role in synaptic plasticity. Here we show that targeted disruption of the mouse epsilon 1 subunit gene resulted in significant reduction of the NMDA receptor channel current and long-term potentiation at the hippocampal CA1 synapses.

This disease association was made using case-level data and experimental data. At least 10 variants (missense, frameshift, truncating, deletion, and de novo) were curated from two publications (23933819, 50890276). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by non-patient cells functional alteration and non-human model systems (27839871, 7816096). Additional experimental evidence exists, but was not reviewed in this curation (31158310, 30146685 [additional mouse models], 26312887 [variant expression in cultured neurons]). A treatment paper with N=1 was also reviewed (24839611), but did not qualify as a true genetic rescue; however, it does highlight the potential to translate functional data to targeted treatment. In summary, GRIN2A is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/16/19 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0c405372-b99b-42fc-836d-65d7c0cbd279"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
