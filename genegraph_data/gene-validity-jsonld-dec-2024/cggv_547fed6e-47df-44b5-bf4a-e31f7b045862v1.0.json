Using a whole-exome sequencing approach, we identified recessive loss-of-function mutations within TTC25 in three individuals from two unrelated families affected by PCD. Mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and carrying a deletion of exons 2 and 3 in Ttc25 presented with laterality defects. Consistently, we observed immotile nodal cilia and missing leftward flow via particle image velocimetry. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in TTC25-deficient mice revealed an absence of ODAs. Consistent with our findings in mice, we were able to show loss of the ciliary ODAs in humans via TEM and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses. Additionally, IF analyses revealed an absence of the ODA docking complex (ODA-DC), along with its known components CCDC114, CCDC151, and ARMC4. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed interaction between the ODA-DC component CCDC114 and TTC25.

Focusing on genes expressed in ciliated cells, we have identified new candidate ciliogenesis factors, including several not present in the current ciliome. We find that TTC25-GFP is localized to the base of cilia and to ciliary axonemes, and disruption of TTC25 function disrupts ciliogenesis. Mig12-GFP localizes very strongly to the base of cilia and confocal imaging of this construct allows for simple visualization of the planar polarity of basal bodies that underlies polarized ciliary beating. Knockdown of Mig12 disrupts ciliogenesis. Finally, we show that ciliogenesis factors identified in the Xenopus epidermis are required in the midline to facilitate neural tube closure. These results provide further evidence of a requirement for cilia in neural tube morphogenesis and suggest that genes identified in the Xenopus epidermis play broad roles in ciliogenesis.

Clinical features among well-characterized newborn patients with disease-causing *ODAD4* variants include neonatal respiratory distress, while recurrent pneumonia is common in early childhood and later life. Chronic rhinitis, recurrent sinusitis, and nasal polyps are also reported. In addition, a subset of patients exhibit situs inversus or another form of reversed organ laterality or heterotaxy (Wallmeier et al., 2016, PMID: 27486780). Older patients can also exhibit bronchiectasis. Nasal nitric oxide levels are very low or absent in these patients. Diagnostic features of PCD associated with disease-causing *ODAD4* variants include abnormal ciliary ultrastructure with an absence or defect of outer dynein arms (ODA) and its docking complex (ODA-DC) in the ciliary axonemes.\n\nThis curation has recorded five different probands with PCD 35 harboring suspected deleterious *ODAD4* variants. Four variants were scored in these five probands, four of whom had homozygous loss-of-function variants identified. The reported variants included a homozygous splice-site G-to-T transversion in intron 1 of *ODAD4*, two homozygous frameshift variants, and a homozygous nonsense variant in exon 6 of 12, collectively reported in 4 publications (PMID: 27486780, 2016; PMID: 31765523, 2020; PMID: 33746037, 2021, PMID: 34215651, 2022). Cross-sections of respiratory cilia from patients harboring these *ODAD4* gene variants showed absence of the outer dynein arms. All probands harbored biallelic homozygous variants that were confirmed to be in trans. The molecular mechanism appears to be biallelic loss-of-function with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of a gene product.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. High levels of *ODAD4* expression in humans are specific to tissues that harbor multi-ciliated cells, particularly the testis and lung (PMID 24309898). Loss of *ODAD4* from the cilia of patients harboring other forms of PCD has been described and supports the functional role of ODAD4 in outer dynein arm docking assembly complex machinery (PMID: 27486780, PMID: 17961536). \nYeast two-hybrid and reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation showed that ODAD4 interacts with CCDC114, consistent with functional evidence indicating that ODAD4 is essential for the assembly of ODA-DC proteins. This is consistent with analysis of respiratory cells from patients exhibiting loss of ciliary ODAs and an absence of the ODA docking complex, including its components CCDC114, CCDC151, and ARMC4. Loss of ODAD4 led to failure to facilitate recruitment of these ODA-DC proteins to ciliary axonemes (PMID: 27486780, PMID: 17961536). \n\nA mouse model of *ODAD4* (*Ttc25*) deficiency with exon 2 and 3 deletion resulted in immotile nodal cilia and a lack and/or defect of the outer dynein arm docking machinery, as well as hydrocephalus and randomization of left-right body asymmetry (PMID: 27486780). In addition, the *Xenopus* *Ttc25* knockdown showed a failure of ciliary beating, laterality defects, and absent outer dynein arms in axonemes (PMID: 27486780). The mouse and *Xenopus* models of *ODAD4* loss of function both reproduce the typical ultrastructural defects in the outer dynein arms of the ciliary axoneme characteristic of human patients, as well as phenotypes such as ciliary immotility and laterality defects (PMID: 27486780). These phenotypic features are consistent with the pathogenicity of *ODAD4* loss of function variants in PCD-35 patients.\n\nIn summary, *ODAD4* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 35. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical diagnostic and research settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on December 8th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:547fed6e-47df-44b5-bf4a-e31f7b045862"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
