One group of these metabolic cutis laxa conditions is autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2 caused by defects in v-ATPase components or the mitochondrial proline cycle. Besides cutis laxa, muscular hypotonia and cardiac abnormalities are hallmarks of autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2D (ARCL2D) due to pathogenic variants in ATP6V1A encoding subunit A of the v-ATPase. Here, we report on three affected individuals from two families with ARCL2D in whom we performed whole exome and Sanger sequencing. We performed functional studies in fibroblasts from one individual, summarized all known probands' clinical, molecular, and biochemical features and compared them, also to other metabolic forms of cutis laxa. We identified novel missense and the first nonsense variant strongly affecting ATP6V1A expression. All six ARCL2D affected individuals show equally severe cutis laxa and dysmorphism at birth. While for one no information was available, two died in infancy and three are now adolescents with mild or absent intellectual disability. Muscular weakness, ptosis, contractures, and elevated muscle enzymes indicated a persistent myopathy. In cellular studies, a fragmented Golgi compartment, a delayed Brefeldin A-induced retrograde transport and glycosylation abnormalities were present in fibroblasts from two individuals. This is the second and confirmatory report on pathogenic variants in ATP6V1A as the cause of this extremely rare condition and the first to describe a nonsense allele. Our data highlight the tremendous clinical variability of ATP6V1A related phenotypes even within the same family.","dc:creator":"Vogt G","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Expanding the clinical and molecular spectrum of ATP6V1A related metabolic cutis laxa."}},"rdfs:label":"Vogt_2021: B-II-1"},{"id":"cggv:3d448ad9-b920-48ab-b207-a573f9ab3c2b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d448ad9-b920-48ab-b207-a573f9ab3c2b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c7230942-89af-466a-a14b-8d9ccd0d3a1f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7230942-89af-466a-a14b-8d9ccd0d3a1f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:07e19feb-d940-4c79-b242-9a97287ace85","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001690.4(ATP6V1A):c.1513_1514del (p.Asp505Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2586972785"}},{"id":"cggv:80db5aae-ffb0-429f-8843-ae43d4913ced","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001690.4(ATP6V1A):c.317T>C (p.Leu106Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA354007832"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Improving cutis laxa with age.\nCranial MRI showed a thinning of the corpus callosum.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001582","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0000766","obo:HP_0000621","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0000298","obo:HP_0003236","obo:HP_0001371","obo:HP_0000973"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Normal 46,XY karyotype.\nMuscle biopsy revealed degenerating fibers with vacuoles suggesting a vacuolar myopathy in single fibers.\nNormal serum transferrin isoelectric focusing. \nPulse chase with a precursor for sialic acid in fibroblasts (manNAz, converted to SiaNAz, measured incorporation of SiaNAz using a fluorophore) - significant reduction of sialylation (Fig 3C).\nDensitometric analyses of immunoblot for ATP6V1A on fibroblast protein (three independent experiments) revealed ~50% of band intensity for A-II-2 (Figure 2C).\n\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:d322705f-718c-4339-a02b-b33624fb5b53_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:80db5aae-ffb0-429f-8843-ae43d4913ced"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33320377"},{"id":"cggv:caf57e06-d771-4d05-8c4a-57f733a7c6fe_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:07e19feb-d940-4c79-b242-9a97287ace85"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33320377"}],"rdfs:label":"Vogt_2021: A-II-2"},{"id":"cggv:caf57e06-d771-4d05-8c4a-57f733a7c6fe","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:caf57e06-d771-4d05-8c4a-57f733a7c6fe_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:caf57e06-d771-4d05-8c4a-57f733a7c6fe_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR revealed ATP6V1A mRNA reduced by approximately 65% in dermal fibroblasts, shown to be due to lack of expression of the allele with the nonsense variant (see genotype)."}],"strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d322705f-718c-4339-a02b-b33624fb5b53","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d322705f-718c-4339-a02b-b33624fb5b53_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f9b7d66a-3d77-4515-aa6b-9f33e59f2f09_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5},{"id":"cggv:1b4df8f5-e831-4fdc-af51-2c6e5b8df04e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1b4df8f5-e831-4fdc-af51-2c6e5b8df04e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c72114c0-0b4e-4052-a744-81f09eb320c0"},"detectionMethod":"WES with sequence validation and segregation analysis of the candidate variants performed with Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Presented with generalized skin wrinkling and sparse subcutaneous fat.\nLarge skin folds and abnormal fat distribution, especially on the buttocks.\nNeonatal course complicated by seizures, pneumonia, sepsis, and 30 min resuscitation after a dislocated endotracheal tube.

Overall, the ECM also appeared much less compact in PIV:1.\n\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28065471","rdfs:label":"TEM of skin biopsies from ATP6V1A biallelic patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":8365,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:26df9174-5487-49cc-a996-441a743f54d0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0027451","gene":"hgnc:851","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*ATP6V1A* was first reported in relation to ATP6V1A-CDG (also known as (also known as autosomal recessive cutis laxa 2D), an autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation, in 2017 (Van Damme et al, PMID: 28065471). ATP6V1A-CDG is characterized by the features of cutis laxa (wrinkly, inelastic, droopy skin), redundant skin, typical mask-like facial appearance, muscular hypotonia, cardiac abnormalities, and glycosylation and Golgi defects.\n\nVariants in ATP6V1A have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities in OMIM: Cutis laxa, autosomal recessive, type IID (MIM# 617403) and Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 93 (MIM# 618012). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanism), phenotype, and inheritance pattern for these two disease entities. Therefore, the two disease entities have remained split. The split curation for Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 93 (MIM# 618012) may be curated by another ClinGen GCEP. The disease entity in the current curation (Cutis laxa, autosomal recessive, type IID (MIM# 617403) will be renamed as ATP6V1A-CDG based on expert opinion and current naming convention. \n\nFive variants (4 missense, 1 nonsense) that have been reported in 5 probands in 2 publications are included in this curation (Van Damme et al, 2017, PMID: 28065471; Vogt et al, 2021, PMID: 33320377) (Genetic evidence, 3.5 points).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including the biochemical function of the gene product. ![](ATP6V1A) encodes the catalytic A subunit of the V1 domain of V-ATPase. Variants in genes encoding other subunits of V-ATPase (*ATP6V0A2*,* ATP6V1E1*) have been implicated in causing similar clinical features. Specifically, the clinical validity classification for ATP6V0A2 with CDG has been classified as definitive by the ClinGen CDG GCEP. In addition, studies on skin biopsy samples and cultured fibroblasts from affected individuals show disruption of vesicular trafficking and abnormalities of elastic fibers and the extracellular matrix, consistent with the connective tissue features observed in patients (Van Damme et al, 2017, PMID: 28065471) (Experimental evidence: 2.5 points)\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between* ATP6V1A* and ATP6V1A-CDG (also known as autosomal recessive cutis laxa 2D). This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 3, 2024 (SOP version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f9b7d66a-3d77-4515-aa6b-9f33e59f2f09"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
