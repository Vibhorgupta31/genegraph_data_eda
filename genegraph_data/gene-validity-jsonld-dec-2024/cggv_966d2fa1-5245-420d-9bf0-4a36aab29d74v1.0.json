Ethnic-specific MAF filtering allowed us to re-categorize as common 203 variants otherwise annotated as rare or novel in non-Japanese ethnicities. This step minimizes false-positive results and improves the annotation of identified variants. Causative variants were identified in 27% of probands with solve rates of 35%, 35% and 19% for dominant, recessive and sporadic NSHL, respectively.

The molecular composition of this mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channel is not yet known. Transmembrane channel-like protein isoforms 1 (TMC1) and 2 (TMC2) have been proposed to form part of the MET channel, although their exact roles are still unclear. Using Beethoven (Tmc1(Bth/Bth)) mice, which have an M412K point mutation in TMC1 that adds a positive charge, we found that Ca(2+) permeability and conductance of the MET channel of outer hair cells (OHCs) were reduced. Tmc1(Bth/Bth) OHCs were also less sensitive to block by the permeant MET channel blocker dihydrostreptomycin, whether applied extracellularly or intracellularly. These findings suggest that the amino acid that is mutated in Bth is situated at or near the negatively charged binding site for dihydrostreptomycin within the permeation pore of the channel. We also found that the Ca(2+) dependence of the operating range of the MET channel was altered by the M412K mutation. Depolarization did not increase the resting open probability of the MET current of Tmc1(Bth/Bth) OHCs, whereas raising the intracellular concentration of the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA caused smaller increases in resting open probability in Bth mutant OHCs than in wild-type control cells. We propose that these observations can be explained by the reduced Ca(2+) permeability of the mutated MET channel indirectly causing the Ca(2+) sensor for adaptation, at or near the intracellular face of the MET channel, to become more sensitive to Ca(2+) influx as a compensatory mechanism.","dc:creator":"Corns LF","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Tmc1 Point Mutation Affects Ca2+ Sensitivity and Block by Dihydrostreptomycin of the Mechanoelectrical Transducer Current of Mouse Outer Hair Cells."},"rdfs:label":"TMC1 Transduction in Homozygous Beethoven mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:966d2fa1-5245-420d-9bf0-4a36aab29d74_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f621f44-5200-40df-a9fd-c8589822eaa3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a372066e-b9b4-4b34-b9ac-8c46027d2532","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Sensory transduction was measured in cochlear IHCs at P7 to P9 and it was rescued in vivo.

To investigate gene therapy as a potential biologic strategy for restoration of auditory function in patients with genetic hearing loss, we tested a gene augmentation approach in mouse models of genetic deafness. We focused on DFNB7/11 and DFNA36, which are autosomal recessive and dominant deafnesses, respectively, caused by mutations in transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1). Mice that carry targeted deletion of Tmc1 or a dominant Tmc1 point mutation, known as Beethoven, are good models for human DFNB7/11 and DFNA36. We screened several adeno-associated viral (AAV) serotypes and promoters and identified AAV2/1 and the chicken β-actin (Cba) promoter as an efficient combination for driving the expression of exogenous Tmc1 in inner hair cells in vivo. Exogenous Tmc1 or its closely related ortholog, Tmc2, were capable of restoring sensory transduction, auditory brainstem responses, and acoustic startle reflexes in otherwise deaf mice, suggesting that gene augmentation with Tmc1 or Tmc2 is well suited for further development as a strategy for restoration of auditory function in deaf patients who carry TMC1 mutations.","dc:creator":"Askew C","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Tmc gene therapy restores auditory function in deaf mice."},"rdfs:label":"Homozygous TMC1 mice rescue by AAV2/1-Cba-TMC vectors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This experiment was previously scored for AR HL and was not scored here because the alteration was homozygous."},{"id":"cggv:8dbedd2e-d5c8-44bf-88a1-40d0a6840d13","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f629e41-9227-4219-9f23-7aab0d519eae","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Progressive hearing loss characterized by ABR and distortion product otoacoustic emissions analyses.

Inner hair cells primarily function as afferent sensory cells, whereas outer hair cells are electromotile amplifiers of auditory stimuli that can be functionally assessed by distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) analysis. When C3H-Tmc1Bth/Bth is crossed with either C57BL/6J or DBA/2J wild-type mice, F1 hybrid Tmc1Bth/+ progeny have increased hearing loss associated with increased degeneration of outer hair cells and diminution of DPOAE amplitudes but no difference in degeneration of inner hair cells.

In the mouse cochlea Tmc1 is expressed in both outer (OHCs) and inner (IHCs) hair cells from early stages of development. Immature hair cells of mutant mice seem normal in appearance and biophysical properties. From around P8 for OHCs and P12 for IHCs, mutants fail to acquire (dn/dn) or show reduced expression (Bth/Bth and, to a lesser extent Bth/+) of the K+ currents which contribute to their normal functional maturation (the BK-type current IK,f in IHCs, and the delayed rectifier IK,n in both cell types). Moreover, the exocytotic machinery in mutant IHCs does not develop normally as judged by the persistence of immature features of the Ca2+ current and exocytosis into adulthood. Mutant mice exhibited progressive hair cell damage and loss. The compound action potential (CAP) thresholds of Bth/+ mice were raised and correlated with the degree of hair cell loss. Homozygous mutants (dn/dn and Bth/Bth) never showed CAP responses, even at ages where many hair cells were still present in the apex of the cochlea, suggesting their hair cells never function normally.

This association was made using case-level data and experimental data. At least 7 missense variants have been reported in humans. TMC1 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2002 (Kimura et al.). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 8 publications (26079994, 19180119, 17250663, 11850618, 26346818, 20447146, 24827932, 25560804). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >50 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is hypothesized to be that TMC1 and TMC2 are required for mechanoelectrical transmission in cochlear and vestibular hair cells. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, functional alteration of mechanoelectrical transduction in mouse OHC's, expression studies as well as a rescue in a mouse model. In summary, TMC1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss.
