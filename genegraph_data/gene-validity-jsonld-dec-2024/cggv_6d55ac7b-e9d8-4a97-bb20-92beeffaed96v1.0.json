In intact failing hearts, downregulation of beta1-receptor mRNA and protein, upregulation of atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA expression, and increased myocyte diameter indicated similar degrees of failure and hypertrophy in the IDC and PPH phenotypes. The only molecular phenotypic difference between PPH and IDC RVs was upregulation of beta2-receptor gene expression in PPH but not IDC. The major new findings were that (a) both nonfailing intact and explanted human ventricular myocardium expressed substantial amounts of alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNA (alpha-MHC, 23-34% of total), and (b) in heart failure alpha-MHC was downregulated (by 67-84%) and beta-MHC gene expression was upregulated.

In this study, we sought to determine the cellular contractile phenotype associated with these point mutations. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from 2 month male Sprague Dawley rats.

Uninfected cells (UI), human βMHC (MOI 500, 18 h), and human αMHC (MOI 500, 18 h) were used as controls. Cells were loaded with fura-2 (1 μM, 15 min) after 48 h.

However, most current approaches with this method require zygote injection, making it difficult to assess the adult, tissue-specific functions of genes that are widely expressed or which cause embryonic lethality when mutated. Here, we describe the generation of cardiac-specific Cas9 transgenic mice, which express high levels of Cas9 in the heart, but display no overt defects. In proof-of-concept experiments, we used Adeno-Associated Virus 9 (AAV9) to deliver single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that targets the Myh6 locus exclusively in cardiomyocytes. Intraperitoneal injection of postnatal cardiac-Cas9 transgenic mice with AAV9 encoding sgRNA against Myh6 resulted in robust editing of the Myh6 locus. These mice displayed severe cardiomyopathy and loss of cardiac function, with elevation of several markers of heart failure, confirming the effectiveness of this method of adult cardiac gene deletion. Mice with cardiac-specific expression of Cas9 provide a tool that will allow rapid and accurate deletion of genes following a single injection of AAV9-sgRNAs, thereby circumventing embryonic lethality. This method will be useful for disease modeling and provides a means of rapidly editing genes of interest in the heart.

Genetic mutations have long been considered to be associated with this disease. At present, mutations in over 50 genes related to DCM have been documented. This study was carried out to elucidate the characteristics of gene mutations in patients with DCM. The candidate genes that may cause DCM include MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, LMNA, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYPN, MYL3, TPM1, SCN5A, DES, ACTC1 and RBM20. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subsequent mutation confirmation with traditional capillary Sanger sequencing analysis, possible causative non-synonymous mutations were identified in ~57% (12/21) of patients with DCM. As a result, 7 novel mutations (MYPN, p.E630K; TNNT2, p.G180A; MYH6, p.R1047C; TNNC1, p.D3V; DES, p.R386H; MYBPC3, p.C1124F; and MYL3, p.D126G), 3 variants of uncertain significance (RBM20, p.R1182H; MYH6, p.T1253M; and VCL, p.M209L), and 2 known mutations (MYH7, p.A26V and MYBPC3, p.R160W) were revealed to be associated with DCM. The mutations were most frequently found in the sarcomere (MYH6, MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNC1, TNNT2 and MYL3) and cytoskeletal (MYPN, DES and VCL) genes. As genetic testing is a useful tool in the clinical management of disease, testing for pathogenic mutations is beneficial to the treatment of patients with DCM and may assist in predicting disease risk for their family members before the onset of symptoms.","dc:creator":"Zhao Y","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing of candidate genes reveals novel mutations in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26458567","rdfs:label":"DCM 30"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"2 DCM index patient;

was evaluated for autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The MYH6 gene encodes the alpha heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin (alpha-MHC), a fast ATPase primarily expressed in human atrial tissue. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. In total 30 variants were published in HGMD professional (as of March 2020) related to DCM. 29 variants were predicted to result in amino acid substitutions and NM_002471.3(MYH6): c.5566-2A>C is located in one of the two essential nucleotides of the acceptor site which very likely results in an abnormal splicing. Significant co-segregation analysis was never performed in individuals that carry one of these variants. 25 of these 30 variants have very low allele frequencies in gnomAD. Two MYH6 variants were functionally analyzed using adenovirus infected rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. The NM_002471.3(MYH6): c.2489C>T p.(Pro830Leu) variant shows near normal shortening kinetics at baseline, whereas NM_002471.3(MYH6): c.3010G>T p.Ala1004Ser shows in the presence of isoproterenol sarcomere shortening comparable to the beta-MHC shortening (28088328). Although this latter variant is functionally aberrant we do not consider it causative for DCM because of its high frequency in gnomAD (273x in 282882 reference alleles). Additional experimental evidence supports this gene-disease association, including expression studies, functional assays, and animal models. Non-failing human ventricular myocardium expresses substantial amounts of alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNA (alpha-MHC, 23–34% of total) and in heart failure alpha-MHC is downregulated (by 67–84%) and beta-MHC gene expression is upregulated (Lowes et al, 1997, PMID: 9410910). Alpha-MyHC protein was easily detectable in 12 nonfailing left ventricles. Alpha-MyHC protein represented only 7.3% of total MyHC protein (compared with ~35% of the MyHC mRNA), suggesting that translational regulation may be operative; in contrast, there was effectively no detectable alpha-MyHC protein in the left ventricles of 10 end-stage failing human hearts (Miyata et al, 2000, PMID 10700442). Homozygous Myh6 null mice die between 11 and 12 days in utero of gross heart defects, while Myh6 heterozygotes survive and show myocyte hypertrophy (Jones et al, 1996, PMID: 8878443). Whereas knockdown of Myh6 in postnatal mouse heart using Myh6 (promotor)-Cas9 mice intraperitoneally injected with AAV9 (adenovirus) encoded single guided RNA against Myh6 at postnatal day 10 quickly and efficiently induces massive cardiac dilation and heart failure, within 3 weeks of AAV delivery of sgRNA (Carroll et al, 2016, 26719419). In the adult mouse ventricle alpha-Mhc is the major isoform whereas in the human the major isoform is beta-MHC. Therefore, studying Myh6 in mouse heart may not be representative of MYH6 in human hearts. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of MYH6 with autosomal dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on March 27, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6d55ac7b-e9d8-4a97-bb20-92beeffaed96"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
