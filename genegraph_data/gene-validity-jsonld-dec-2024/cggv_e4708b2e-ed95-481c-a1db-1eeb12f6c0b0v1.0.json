For example, a patient could have bilateral downward slanting of the palpebral fissures, colobomas of the lower eyelids, hypoplasia of the facial bones, cleft palate, malformation of the external ears, and atresia of the external auditory canals. TCS3 is caused by mutations of the polr1c gene, which encodes RNA polymerase I and III subunit C (POLR1C). There have been two known missense mutations (Arg279-to-Gln [R279Q] and Arg279-to-Trp [R279W]) at the Arg-279 position. However, it remains to be clarified whether or how both or each individual mutation affects the cellular properties of POLR1C. Here we show that TCS3-associated missense mutations cause aberrant intracellular localization of POLR1C, inhibiting chondrogenic differentiation. The wild type POLR1C is normally localized in the nuclei. The R279Q or R279W mutant is primarily found to be localized in the lysosome. Expression of the R279Q or R279W mutant in mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells decreases phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and ribosomal S6 proteins, which belong to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling involved in critical roles in the lysosome. Furthermore, expression of the R279Q or R279W mutant inhibits chondrogenic differentiation in ATDC5 cells. Taken together, TCS3-associated mutation leads to the localization of POLR1C into the lysosome and inhibits chondrogenic differentiation, possibly explaining a portion of the pathological molecular basis underlying Treacher Collins syndrome.","dc:creator":"Matsumoto N","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Treacher Collins syndrome 3 (TCS3)-associated POLR1C mutants are localized in the lysosome and inhibits chondrogenic differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Matsumoto_Functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e4708b2e-ed95-481c-a1db-1eeb12f6c0b0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:badf1410-42d0-4115-840c-92255ecfb969_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:badf1410-42d0-4115-840c-92255ecfb969","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:ab0741a0-a96a-450e-91e4-1ab76449e1a9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_203290.4(POLR1C):c.916_920del (p.Tyr306LeufsTer4)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3825619"}},{"id":"cggv:6c5793db-854c-4b62-ae7b-51385ac0a766","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_203290.4(POLR1C):c.836G>A (p.Arg279Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA259909"}}],"detectionMethod":"All DNA was screened by NGS with a panel of five genes reported in TCS and differential diagnoses (EFTUD2, POLR1A, POLR1C, POLR1D, TCOF1) and variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0009118","obo:HP_0000494","obo:HP_0000272","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000405","obo:HP_0000377","obo:HP_0000007"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:2b0225d3-aeb1-4196-a47e-9067d82f0b12_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6c5793db-854c-4b62-ae7b-51385ac0a766"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30957429","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a frequent cause of mandibulofacial dysostosis.

Treacher Collins syndrome 3 is a disorder of craniofacial development characterized by a combination of bilateral downward slanting of the palpebral fissures, colobomas of the lower eyelids, hypoplasia of the facial bones, cleft palate, malformation of the external ears, atresia of the external auditory canals, and bilateral conductive hearing loss. Variants in *POLR1C* have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Treacher Collins syndrome 3 and hypomylenating leukodystrophy 11. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, Treacher Collins syndrome 3 (OMIM:248390) and hypomylenating leukodystrophy 11 (OMIM:616494). The split curation for AR hypomylenating leukodystrophy 11 will be curated separately. Two missense variants, three nonsense variants, and one intronic deletion that have been reported in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 21131976, 30957429) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration of non-patient cells (PMIDs: 29567474). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
