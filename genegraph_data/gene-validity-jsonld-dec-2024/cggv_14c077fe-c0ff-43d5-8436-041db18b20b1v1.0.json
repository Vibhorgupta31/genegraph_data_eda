Using homozygosity mapping in 12 unrelated cblF individuals and microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, we identified a candidate gene on chromosome 6q13, LMBRD1, encoding LMBD1, a lysosomal membrane protein with homology to lipocalin membrane receptor LIMR. We identified five different frameshift mutations in LMBRD1 resulting in loss of LMBD1 function, with 18 of the 24 disease chromosomes carrying the same mutation embedded in a common 1.34-Mb haplotype. Transfection of fibroblasts of individuals with cblF with wild-type LMBD1 rescued cobalamin coenzyme synthesis and function.

Consequently, cobalamin coenzyme synthesis is blocked, and cofactors for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase are deficient. We recently identified LMBRD1 as the causative gene located on chromosome 6q13 and showed that 18 out of 24 alleles in unrelated patients carried the deletion c.1056delG (p.L352fsX18) (Rutsch et al. (Nat Genet 41:234-239, 2009). LMBRD1 encodes the lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1, which presumably facilitates lysosomal cobalamin export. Our patient is the second child of consanguineous Turkish parents. He presented on the second day of life with cerebral seizures due to intraventricular hemorrhage. Plasma homocysteine and urinary methylmalonic acid levels were elevated, and serum cobalamin level was decreased. Synthesis of both cobalamin coenzymes was deficient in cultured skin fibroblasts. The cblF defect was confirmed by somatic complementation analysis. Sequencing of LMBRD1 revealed the novel deletion c.1405delG (p.D469fsX38) on both alleles. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed reduced messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in patient fibroblasts compared with controls. Transfection of patient fibroblasts with the LMBD1 wild-type complement DNA (cDNA) rescued coenzyme synthesis and function, confirming this new deletion as an additional cause of the cblF defect.

A similar phenotype is caused by mutations in LMBRD1, which encodes the lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1. These findings suggested to us that ABCD4 translocated from the ER to lysosomes in association with LMBD1. In this report, it is demonstrated that ABCD4 interacts with LMBD1 and then localizes to lysosomes, and this translocation depends on the lysosomal targeting ability of LMBD1. Furthermore, endogenous ABCD4 was localized to both lysosomes and the ER, and its lysosomal localization was disturbed by knockout of LMBRD1.
