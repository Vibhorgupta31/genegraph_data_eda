In developing embryos and young adults, the transgene is expressed in both retinal and pineal photoreceptor cells. During aging, the expression of the transgene in retinal photoreceptor cells gradually diminishes. By 8 months of age, the Gnat2 promoter-driven nitroreductase is no longer expressed in retinal photoreceptor cells, but its expression in pineal photoreceptor cells persists. This provides a tool for selective ablation of pineal photoreceptor cells, i.e., by treatments with metronidazole. In the absence of pineal photoreceptor cells, the behavioral visual sensitivity of the fish remains unchanged; however, the circadian rhythms of rod and cone sensitivity are diminished. Brief light exposures restore the circadian rhythms of behavioral visual sensitivity. Together, the data suggest that retinal photoreceptor cells respond to environmental cues and are capable of entraining the circadian rhythms of visual sensitivity; however, they are insufficient for maintaining the rhythms.

Cone b-wave amplitudes were significantly reduced compared to WT animals. Figure 3: Sections from WT and Gnatc.518A>G retinae were labeled with an antibody to cone transducin to determine whether the presence of the mutation resulted in altered retinal expression. As can be observed in Figures 3A and 3C, control animals showed transducin labeling in photoreceptor outer segments (OS). Unlike the control sections, no transducin labeling was present in the Gnat2c.518A>G animals at either 3 or 12 months of age (Figs. 3B, 3D, respectively. In order to probe whether this lack of Gnat2 expression in the tissue sections was due to an altered structural epitope, Western blots were performed on 3-month tissue samples using the same Gnat2 antibody. As can be observed in Figure 3E, two bands approximating the correct size (40 kDa) were observed in both the control and Gnat2c.518A>G samples. The presence of Gnat2 protein in the Gnat2c.518A>G retinae was supported by the qPCR data (Fig. 3F), which showed no alteration in Gnat2 copy number at 3 months, while retinae from 12 month old Gnat2c.518A>G animals exhibited a 27% reduction in expression. Thus, cone transducin immunolabeling is absent in the Gnat2c.518A>G retinae, while Gnat2 gene expression is only decreased by 12 months of age. Figure 4: In order to determine whether cone opsin localization and/or expression was altered in the Gnat2c.518A>G retina, sections were labeled with antibodies to M- and S-opsin. As observed in Figure 4A, M-opsin expression was confined to the cone OS in the WT animals while the Gnat2c.518A>G retina showed opsin mislocalized to the photoreceptor cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the terminals in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Therefore, despite normal opsin gene expression profiles, Gnat2c.518A>G retinae exhibit early M-opsin mislocalization, which increases in severity with age. Figure 5: In order to determine whether the loss of cone function resulted from cone photoreceptor degeneration in the Gnat2c.518A>G retina, cone photoreceptors were labeled with PNA.

We identified pathogenic variants (single-nucleotide variants, indels, or structural variants) for 404/722 (56%) individuals. Whole-genome sequencing gives unprecedented power to detect three categories of pathogenic variants in particular: structural variants, variants in GC-rich regions, which have significantly improved coverage compared to whole-exome sequencing, and variants in non-coding regulatory regions. In addition to previously reported pathogenic regulatory variants, we have identified a previously unreported pathogenic intronic variant in CHM in two males with choroideremia. We have also identified 19 genes not previously known to be associated with inherited retinal disease, which harbor biallelic predicted protein-truncating variants in unsolved cases. Whole-genome sequencing is an increasingly important comprehensive method with which to investigate the genetic causes of inherited retinal disease.","dc:creator":"Carss KJ","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Comprehensive Rare Variant Analysis via Whole-Genome Sequencing to Determine the Molecular Pathology of Inherited Retinal Disease."}},"rdfs:label":"G007665"},{"id":"cggv:b0b825f6-d724-4c5d-a68b-e10735d5a9af","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b0b825f6-d724-4c5d-a68b-e10735d5a9af_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Variant located in exon 9/9, NMD not expected to occur"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5673,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:acebf0c0-1682-4fd6-ad35-a670eb0c8d70","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0800392","gene":"hgnc:4394","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*GNAT2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cases of achromatopsia 4 (ACHM) in 2002 (PMID: 12077706). In the complete form of ACHM, affected individuals typically present early in life with nystagmus, photophobia, low visual acuity, and total color blindness. Electroretinographic recordings (ERG) show an absent photopic and a normal scotopic response in affected individuals. Some individuals show residual color vision and slightly better visual acuity leading to a clinical diagnosis of incomplete ACHM. Because of the broad spectrum of potential phenotypes, these cases with causal variants in *GNAT2* have been curated under the inclusive disease name *GNAT2*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800392).\n \nTen suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (four nonsense, two missense and four frameshift), which have been reported among twelve probands in seven publications (PMIDs:12077706, 12205108, 31058429, 27718025, 21107338, 32203983, 28041643). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function. Additionally, segregation data from two publications (PMIDs: 12205108, 21107338) were scored. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *GNAT2* is  expressed in retina photoreceptor cells of developing zebrafish embryos (PMID: 22815753). A mouse model with a homozygous *GNAT2* mutation was shown to have little or no light-adapted (cone-mediated) ERG response and poor visual acuity, similar to observations in the human form of complete achromatopsia. Using AAV gene therapy to inject wild-type *GNAT2* cDNA into the retina of the mutated mice, the ERG response and visual acuity phenotypes were rescued (PMID: 17515894). In a naturally occurring mouse model with a different *GNAT2* mutation, affected mice displayed no cone ERG response, showed evidence of altered transducin protein structure and M-opsin mislocalization, and developed cone degeneration by 12 months of age (PMID: 23580486). \n \nIn summary, *GNAT2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of *GNAT2*-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification according to the ClinGen template. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on November 3rd, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6888747f-55ae-4f8e-a3a8-c77bcd543689"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
