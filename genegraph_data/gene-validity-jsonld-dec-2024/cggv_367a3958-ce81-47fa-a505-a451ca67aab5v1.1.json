Loss of neurofibromin expression in NF1 patients is associated with elevated Ras activity and increased cell proliferation, predisposing to a variety of tumors of the peripheral and central nervous systems. We show here, using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique, that neurofibromin dynamically regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization, followed by enhanced cell motility and gross cell aggregation in Matrigel matrix. NF1 siRNA induces characteristic morphological changes, such as excessive actin stress fiber formation, with elevated negative phosphorylation levels of cofilin, which regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization by depolymerizing and severing actin filaments. We found that the elevated phosphorylation of cofilin in neurofibromin-depleted cells is promoted by activation of a Rho-ROCK-LIMK2 pathway, which requires Ras activation but is not transduced through three major Ras-mediated downstream pathways via Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and RalGEF. In addition, the exogenous expression of the NF1-GTPase-activating protein-related domain suppressed the NF1 siRNA-induced phenotypes. Neurofibromin was demonstrated to play a significant role in the machinery regulating cell proliferation and in actin cytoskeletal reorganization, which affects cell motility and adhesion. These findings may explain, in part, the mechanism of multiple neurofibroma formation in NF1 patients.","dc:creator":"Ozawa T","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"The neurofibromatosis type 1 gene product neurofibromin enhances cell motility by regulating actin filament dynamics via the Rho-ROCK-LIMK2-cofilin pathway."},"rdfs:label":"Ozawa 2005 FA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Re-expression of NF1-GRD rescued the morphological changes in the NF1-depleted cells and partial rescue of migration defect."},{"id":"cggv:d8c223f5-76df-4876-b4ff-081c9b2cea53","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:889ad5de-0a54-4558-8d80-d1df2b70259c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Knock down of NF1 induced a senescence-like morphology of the melanocytes compared to controls.

Through use of a conditional (cre/lox) allele, we show that loss of NF1 in the Schwann cell lineage is sufficient to generate tumors. In addition, complete NF1-mediated tumorigenicity requires both a loss of NF1 in cells destined to become neoplastic as well as heterozygosity in non-neoplastic cells.

Neurofibromin (NF1) gene mutations lead to increased risk of neurofibromas, schwannomas, low grade, pilocytic optic pathway gliomas, as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and glioblastomas. Despite the evidence for NF1 tumor suppressor function in glial cell tumors, the mechanisms underlying transformation remain poorly understood. In this report, we used morpholinos to knockdown the two nf1 orthologs in zebrafish and show that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) numbers are increased in the developing spinal cord, whereas neurons are unaffected. The increased OPC numbers in nf1 morphants resulted from increased proliferation, as detected by increased BrdU labeling, whereas TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells was unaffected. This phenotype could be rescued by the forced expression of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain of human NF1. In addition, the in vivo analysis of OPC migration following nf1 loss using time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that olig2-EGFP(+) OPCs exhibit enhanced cell migration within the developing spinal cord. OPCs pause intermittently as they migrate, and in nf1 knockdown animals, they covered greater distances due to a decrease in average pause duration, rather than an increase in velocity while in motion. Interestingly, nf1 knockdown also leads to an increase in ERK signaling, principally in the neurons of the spinal cord. Together, these results show that negative regulation of the Ras pathway through the GAP activity of NF1 limits OPC proliferation and motility during development, providing insight into the oncogenic mechanisms through which NF1 loss contributes to human glial tumors.","dc:creator":"Lee JS","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell numbers and migration are regulated by the zebrafish orthologs of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene."},"rdfs:label":"Lee 2010 Zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Tumor formation was not noted."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:367a3958-ce81-47fa-a505-a451ca67aab5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:367a3958-ce81-47fa-a505-a451ca67aab5_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:031228d0-016a-466c-8add-aae0506b5210_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae09add9-7fa2-40da-b856-77abd7495542","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"All patient samples tested for single and multiexon del/dup by MLPA.

Detecting mutation in NF1 is hindered by the gene's large size, the lack of mutation hotspots, the presence of pseudogenes, and the wide variety of possible lesions. We developed a method for detecting germline mutations by combining an original RNA-based cDNA-PCR mutation detection method and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The protocol was validated in a cohort of 56 blood samples from NF1 patients who fulfilled NIH diagnostic criteria, identifying the germline mutation in 53 cases (95% sensitivity). The efficiency and reliability of this approach facilitated detection of different types of mutations, including single-base substitutions, deletions or insertions of one to several nucleotides, microdeletions, and changes in intragenic copy number. Because mutational screening for minor lesions was performed using cDNA and the characterization of mutated alleles was performed at both the RNA and genomic DNA level, the analysis provided insight into the nature of the different mutations and their effect on NF1 mRNA splicing. After validation, we implemented the protocol as a routine test. Here we present the overall unbiased spectrum of NF1 mutations identified in 93 patients in a cohort of 105.

relationship between NF1 and Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 26th, 2019. Variants in NF1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1990 (Wallace et al., PMID 2134734). Diagnosis of Neurofibromatous Type 1 is based on criteria established by the NIH (1988; PMID 3152465). At least 3000 unique germline variants have been identified (reviewed in Gutmann et al., 2017; PMID 28230061). This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.  Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. In particular, earlier compelling evidence suggestive of the gene-disease relationship, such as linkage data, may not be reflected in the current curation. The mechanism for disease is likely loss of function as NF1 encodes neurofibromin, which regulates cell growth and survival through downstream signaling pathways and loss of nuerofibromin is predicted to lead to increased cell growth (reviewed in Gutmann et al., 2017; PMID 28230061). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in familial spinal Neurofibromatosis, Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome, Watson syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (AD). NF1 patients with features more consistent with Noonan syndrome in addition to Neurofibromatosis Type 1 have been described as having Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (Baralle et al., 2003; PMID 12707950, De Luca et al., 2005; PMID 16380919, Stevenson et al., 2006; PMID 16542390, Chen et\nal., 2014; PMID 25049390). However, after further review of the phenotypes described in these patients, the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has decided that these presentations are consistent with what would be expected in patients with NF1 Neurofibromatosis Type 1. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability for the disease entities mentioned and therefore they have been lumped into one disease entity, Neurofibromatosis Type 1. In summary, NF1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Neurofibromatosis Type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 27, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:367a3958-ce81-47fa-a505-a451ca67aab5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
