Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Å resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Numerous Complex I subunits and Assembly Factors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 complex I subunits and assembly factors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:3546f79c-056b-4087-88f0-99e97ad1bd4b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:959741f3-4f66-4bb7-b7cd-9d292906b9ca","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3acaead3-7eed-446a-87eb-3c91125f0dd1","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Decreased NDUFB8 (significant), also saw some decreased SDHB and ATP5A\ndecreased glycolytic capcacity also seen\n\nAfter four days of incubation, 62% fewer number of cells were recovered from the mutant compared to the parent (p = 0.019; Fig. 5A).

To this end, we characterized genome-wide expression profiles of C. elegans strains with mutations in nuclear-encoded subunits of respiratory chain complexes. Our goal was to detect concordant changes among clusters of genes that comprise defined metabolic pathways. Results indicate that respiratory chain mutants significantly upregulate a variety of basic cellular metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism, as well as cellular defense pathways such as the metabolism of P450 and glutathione. To further confirm and extend expression analysis findings, quantitation of whole worm free amino acid levels was performed in C. elegans mitochondrial mutants for subunits of complexes I, II, and III. Significant differences were seen for 13 of 16 amino acid levels in complex I mutants compared with controls, as well as overarching similarities among profiles of complex I, II, and III mutants compared with controls. The specific pattern of amino acid alterations observed provides novel evidence to suggest that an increase in glutamate-linked transamination reactions caused by the failure of NAD(+)-dependent ketoacid oxidation occurs in primary mitochondrial respiratory chain mutants. Recognition of consistent alterations both among patterns of nuclear gene expression for multiple biochemical pathways and in quantitative amino acid profiles in a translational genetic model of mitochondrial dysfunction allows insight into the complex pathogenesis underlying primary mitochondrial disease.

We have generated a conditional knockout model (hGFAP-NDUFS2 mice) in which expression of the NDUFS2 protein, essential for MCI function, is suppressed in cells expressing the Cre recombinase under the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, active in mouse radial glial cells (RGCs) and in neural stem cells (NSCs) that reside in adult neurogenic niches. In this model we observed that survival of central NSC population does not appear to be severely affected by MCI dysfunction.

In addition, in vitro studies of subventricular zone NSCs showed that active neural progenitors require a functional MCI to produce ATP and to proliferate.

Whilst several mitochondrial DNA mutations are recurrent, the majority of these mutations are reported in single families.

These included a novel homozygous NDUFS1 mutation in an Asian child with Leigh syndrome, a previously identified NDUFS8 mutation (c.236C>T, p.P79L) in a second Asian child with Leigh-like syndrome and six novel, compound heterozygous NDUFS2 mutations in four white Caucasian patients with Leigh or Leigh-like syndrome. Three of these children harboured an identical NDUFS2 mutation (c.875T>C, p.M292T), which was also identified in conjunction with a novel NDUFS2 splice site mutation (c.866+4A>G) in a fourth Caucasian child who presented to a different diagnostic centre, with microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses indicating that this was due to an ancient common founder event. Our results confirm that NDUFS2 is a mutational hotspot in Caucasian children with isolated complex I deficiency and recommend the routine diagnostic investigation of this gene in patients with Leigh or Leigh-like phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Tuppen HA","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"The p.M292T NDUFS2 mutation causes complex I-deficient Leigh syndrome in multiple families."}},{"id":"cggv:2039b3af-91d5-4203-bf82-3230743f37eb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d635dc0a-7f74-4fec-83d6-81ac2977dba3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20819849"}],"rdfs:label":"Tuppen et al 2010 Patient 27"},{"id":"cggv:adc322ce-4377-4ae7-ae8d-04b06201cc29","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:adc322ce-4377-4ae7-ae8d-04b06201cc29_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:adc322ce-4377-4ae7-ae8d-04b06201cc29_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (rare+complex I assessment) + 0.2 (muscle complex I deficiency 16% of control) + 0.2 (decreased in gel activity of complex I by BN PAGE - FCL)  + 0.2 (reduced intact complex I by BN PAGE - FCL) + 0.4 (<10% activity of dNADH oxidase acitivty in E.Coli with orthologous p.R270Q)"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare+complex I assessment) + 0.2 (muscle complex I deficiency 16% of control) + 0.2 (decreased in gel activity of complex I by BN PAGE - FCL)  + 0.2 (reduced intact complex I by BN PAGE - FCL) + 0.4 (<10% activity of dNADH oxidase acitivty in E.Coli with orthologous p.R270Q)"},{"id":"cggv:2039b3af-91d5-4203-bf82-3230743f37eb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2039b3af-91d5-4203-bf82-3230743f37eb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2039b3af-91d5-4203-bf82-3230743f37eb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (rare+complex I assessment) + 0.2 (muscle complex I deficiency 16% of control) + 0.2 (decreased in gel activity of complex I by BN PAGE - FCL)  + 0.2 (reduced intact complex I by BN PAGE - FCL) "}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare+complex I assessment) + 0.2 (muscle complex I deficiency 16% of control) + 0.2 (decreased in gel activity of complex I by BN PAGE - FCL)  + 0.2 (reduced intact complex I by BN PAGE - FCL) "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:feb01e34-c8d5-4d30-bd9e-a188189a6fc2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:feb01e34-c8d5-4d30-bd9e-a188189a6fc2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:db6468bb-fe8e-4f47-ad5c-6a33270a1581","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004550.4(NDUFS2):c.1336G>A (p.Asp446Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA343383203"}},"detectionMethod":"Additional studies revealed no mutations in the mtDNA and in the nuclear\ncomplex I genes NDUFS1, NDUFS4, NDUFS7, NDUFS8, and NDUFV1.\n\nParents not available for testing, however, complementation study improved complex I function\n\nVariant is absent from gnomadv 4.0.0","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0007146","obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002151","obo:HP_0001250"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:005ca887-f603-4f97-b833-9aaeffaa5027_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:db6468bb-fe8e-4f47-ad5c-6a33270a1581"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22036843","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In this study, we investigated the pathogenicity of a homozygous Asp446Asn mutation in the NDUFS2 gene of a patient with a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency. The clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of the NDUFS2 patient were compared with those of 4 patients with previously identified NDUFS2 mutations. All 5 patients presented with Leigh syndrome. In addition, 3 out of 5 showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Complex I amounts in the patient carrying the Asp446Asn mutation were normal, while the complex I activity was strongly reduced, showing that the NDUFS2 mutation affects complex I enzymatic function. By contrast, the 4 other NDUFS2 patients showed both a reduced amount and activity of complex I. The enzymatic defect in fibroblasts of the patient carrying the Asp446Asn mutation was rescued by transduction of wild type NDUFS2. A 3-D model of the catalytic core of complex I showed that the mutated amino acid residue resides near the coenzyme Q binding pocket. However, the K(M) of complex I for coenzyme Q analogs of the Asp446Asn mutated complex I was similar to the K(M) observed in other complex I defects and in controls. We propose that the mutation interferes with the reduction of coenzyme Q or with the coupling of coenzyme Q reduction with the conformational changes involved in proton pumping of complex I.","dc:creator":"Ngu LH","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A catalytic defect in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I due to a mutation in NDUFS2 in a patient with Leigh syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Ngu et al 2012, Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:005ca887-f603-4f97-b833-9aaeffaa5027","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:005ca887-f603-4f97-b833-9aaeffaa5027_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:005ca887-f603-4f97-b833-9aaeffaa5027_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 rare + complementation studies with h NDUFS2 to improve complex I function, which did not improve an NDFUS7 patients complex I function"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare + complementation studies) + 0.2 (reduced ATP production from pryuvate oxidation <30% of control) + 0.2 (complex I deficiency in fibroblasts - 14% of control) + 0.2 ( complex I deficiency in muscle - 9 % of control)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ad6a5ead-2d46-40dc-9e37-42f1f6a5c1f4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad6a5ead-2d46-40dc-9e37-42f1f6a5c1f4","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:b632a59e-313e-4a90-a4a8-790202b41bd6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001377299.1(NDUFS2):c.875T>C (p.Met292Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA323513"}},{"id":"cggv:688b0da4-8583-469c-bf33-3cfbd44f288a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004550.4(NDUFS2):c.442G>A (p.Glu148Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA343379186"}}],"detectionMethod":"The entire mitochondrial genome was amplified using 36 sets of overlapping M13-tailed primers (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\n*NDUFS2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2001 (PMID: 11220739). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFS2* was previously curated by this GCEP on April 9, 2021 (SOP Version 7) as having a Definitive association with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 12 variants (11 unique missense variants and a frameshift variant expected to result in protein truncation) in eight probands from fives publications (PMIDs: 11220739, 20819849, 22036843, 28031252, 31411514). Clinical features in affected individuals include Leigh syndrome spectrum, optic atrophy, lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy, and hepatic involvement, and there is at least one reported case with clinical features consistent with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (PMIDs: 20819849, 22036843, 28031252, 31411514).\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical functional, functional alternation in HEK293 cells with *NDUFS2* knockout, as well as model systems in *C.elegans* and mice (PMIDs: 27509854, 33744462, 18178500, 34732887, 31297047, 112788282). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFS2* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 18, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3546f79c-056b-4087-88f0-99e97ad1bd4b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
