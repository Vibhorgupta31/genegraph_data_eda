We have identified the human gene PXAAA1 based upon its similarity to PpPAS5, a gene required for peroxisome assembly in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Expression of PXAAA1 restored peroxisomal protein import in fibroblasts from 16 unrelated members of complementation group 4 (CG4) of the PBD. Consistent with this observation, CG4 patients carry mutations in PXAAA1. The product of this gene, Pxaaa1p, belongs to the AAA family of ATPases and appears to be a predominantly cytoplasmic protein. Substitution of an arginine for the conserved lysine residue in the ATPase domain of Pxaaa1p abolished its biological activity, suggesting that Pxaaa1p is an ATPase. Furthermore, Pxaaa1p is required for stability of the predominantly cytoplasmic PTS1 receptor, Pxr1p. We conclude that Pxaaa1p plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 receptor activity.","dc:creator":"Yahraus T","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"The peroxisome biogenesis disorder group 4 gene, PXAAA1, encodes a cytoplasmic ATPase required for stability of the PTS1 receptor."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8670792","rdfs:label":"PBD106"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d26d4744-76c4-4be2-876c-1cf4e8e059b0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85d8c63b-b360-47fb-909a-1fb9ab80d483","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"RNA extracted from patient fibroblast cells, followed by RT-PCR to synthesize cDNA.

Loss-of-function mutations in both genes are known causes of a spectrum of autosomal-recessive peroxisome-biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger syndrome. PBDs are characterized by leukodystrophy, hypotonia, SNHL, retinopathy, and skeletal, craniofacial, and liver abnormalities.

Although individuals with HS share some subtle clinical features found in PBDs, the diagnosis was not suggested by routine blood and skin fibroblast analyses used to detect PBDs.

Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), such as Zellweger syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, are fatal genetic diseases that are autosomal recessive. Among the PBDs of the 12 complementation groups (CGs), 11 associated PEX genes have been isolated. Accordingly, only the PBD pathogenic gene for CG8 (also called CG-A) remains unidentified. Here we have isolated human PEX26 encoding a type II peroxisomal membrane protein of relative molecular mass 34,000 (M(r) 34K) by using ZP167 cells, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell line. Expression of PEX26 restores peroxisomal protein import in the fibroblasts of an individual with PBD of CG8. This individual possesses a homozygous, inactivating pathogenic point mutation, Arg98Trp, in Pex26. Pex6 and Pex1 of the AAA ATPase family co-immunoprecipitate with Pex26. Epitope-tagged Pex6 and Pex1 are discernible as puncta in normal CHO-K1 cells, but not in PEX26-defective cells. PEX26 expression in ZP167 cells re-establishes colocalization of Pex6 and Pex1 with Pex26, in a Pex6-dependent manner. Thus, Pex26 recruits Pex6-Pex1 complexes to peroxisomes.","dc:creator":"Matsumoto N","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"The pathogenic peroxin Pex26p recruits the Pex1p-Pex6p AAA ATPase complexes to peroxisomes."},"rdfs:label":"PEX1 Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgrading due to multiple interactions."},{"id":"cggv:e9f3a0d2-70be-4d74-b880-d9208b437efc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:454746b8-9a74-4ce1-a624-028986c6acee","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"PBDs can be caused by a defect in any of at least 14 different PEX genes, which encode peroxins that are involved in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or biogenesis of peroxisomes.

PBDs are caused by defects in any of at least 14 different PEX genes, which encode proteins involved in peroxisome assembly and proliferation. Thirteen of these genes are associated with ZSS disorders. The genetic heterogeneity among PBDs and the inability to predict from the biochemical and clinical phenotype of a patient with ZSS which of the currently known 13 PEX genes is defective, has fostered the development of different strategies to identify the causative gene defects. These include PEX cDNA transfection complementation assays followed by sequencing of the thus identified PEX genes, and a PEX gene screen in which the most frequently mutated exons of the different PEX genes are analyzed. The benefits of DNA testing for PBDs include carrier testing of relatives, early prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis in families with a recurrence risk for ZSS disorders, and insight in genotype-phenotype correlations, which may eventually assist to improve patient management.

PEX6 encodes a cystolic AAA protein (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) and is required for stability of the cytoplasmic PTS1 receptor (Yahraus et al., 1996; PMID 8670792). Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by defects in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or peroxisome biogenesis. There are at least 14 PEX genes implicated in peroxisome biogenesis disorders, with PEX6 being the second most commonly affected gene in patients with a frequency of ~14.5% (Steinberg et al., 2003; PMID 20301621). Variants in PEX6 were first reported in humans with peroxisomal biogenesis disorder in 1996 (Yahraus et al., PMID 8670792).  Data from 10 patients with 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) from 4 publications were curated (Krause et al., 2006, PMID 17041890; Levesque et al., 2012, PMID 22894767; Ratbi et al., 2015, PMID 26387595; Yahraus et al., 1996, PMID 8670792). Additional cases are available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The relationship between PEX6 and peroxisome biogenesis disorder is supported by experimental evidence including a biochemical function similar to other PEX genes implicated in peroxisome biogenesis disorders (Waterham et al., 2012, PMID 22871920), in vitro assays (Levesque et al., 2012, PMID 22894767), and a protein interaction with PEX1 (Matsumoto et al., 2003, PMID 12717447), which is encoded by a known peroxisome biogensies disorder gene.  In summary, PEX6 is definitively associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 6, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:54df6fb2-b692-4ece-a525-ae0cfe243826"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
