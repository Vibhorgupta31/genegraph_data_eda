Here, we report on six patients from four families with sensorimotor polyneuropathy and FSGS. Nerve conduction velocities were moderately slowed, and amplitudes of sensory and motor potentials were decreased. One patient had internal hydrocephalus and was intellectually disabled. Molecular genetic testing revealed two known and two novel missense mutations in the second and fourth exons of the INF2 gene. Investigations of one nerve biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of intermediate-type CMT and revealed occasional abnormal in- and outfoldings of myelin sheaths and expansions of the endoplasmic reticulum in axons and Schwann cells. While earlier reports suggested that mutations causing FSGS-CMT are restricted to exons 2 and 3 of the INF2 gene, we found one CMT-FSGS causing mutation (p.Glu184Lys) in exon 4 extending the critical region of INF2 for rapid CMT-FSGS molecular genetic diagnosis. Study of a nerve biopsy showed abnormalities that might be related to the known role of the INF2-binding partner CDC42 in myelination.

The dynamin-related protein Drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enhances fission. However, the mechanism for Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. Here, we found that actin polymerization through ER-localized inverted formin 2 (INF2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. INF2 functioned upstream of Drp1. Actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and INF2-enriched ER membranes at constriction sites. Thus, INF2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows Drp1-driven secondary constriction. Because INF2 mutations can lead to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.","dc:creator":"Korobova F","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"An actin-dependent step in mitochondrial fission mediated by the ER-associated formin INF2."},"rdfs:label":"INF2-knockdown in U2OS cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a5ec261d-eae7-4cbe-b1d0-403667921c57","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c1ae874f-21e3-40c9-b34e-669fa928e7a0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"These genes are involved in microtubule stabilization as well.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27030671","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Multiple formins regulate microtubule (MT) arrays, but whether they function individually or in a common pathway is unknown. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulates the formation of stabilized detyrosinated MTs (Glu MTs) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts through RhoA and the formin mDia1. Here we show that another formin, INF2, is necessary for mDia1-mediated induction of Glu MTs and regulation of MT dynamics and that mDia1 can be bypassed by activating INF2. INF2 localized to MTs after LPA treatment in an mDia1-dependent manner, suggesting that mDia1 regulates INF2. Mutants of either formin that disrupt their interaction failed to rescue MT stability in cells depleted of the respective formin, and the mDia1-interacting protein IQGAP1 regulated INF2's localization to MTs and the induction of Glu MTs by either formin. The N-terminus of IQGAP1 associated with the C-terminus of INF2 directly, suggesting the possibility of a tripartite complex stimulated by LPA. Supporting this, the interaction of mDia1 and INF2 was induced by LPA and dependent on IQGAP1. Our data highlight a unique mechanism of formin action in which mDia1 and INF2 function in series to stabilize MTs and point to IQGAP1 as a scaffold that facilitates the activation of one formin by another.","dc:creator":"Bartolini F","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"An mDia1-INF2 formin activation cascade facilitated by IQGAP1 regulates stable microtubules in migrating cells."},"rdfs:label":"INF2 knockdown in fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Relevant function involves domain different from the one carrying all CMT-associated variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:5215f2cf-99c9-405a-b221-18f412abd1f0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9967ad95-ab2b-483c-99bd-b581773594c1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36a8eada-f29f-47f5-9107-5b78b4823653","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Normally developed zebrafish embryo","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26086034","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in Inverted Formin 2 (INF2), a diaphanous formin family protein that regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) in humans. In addition to directly remodeling actin filaments in vitro, we have shown that INF2 regulates intracellular actin dynamics and actin dependent cellular behavior by opposing Rhoa/Dia signaling. As a step towards a better understanding of the human kidney disease, we wanted to explore the relevance of these findings to the in vivo situation. We used dose dependent knockdown of INF2 to first define an in vivo model and establish an overt glomerular phenotype in zebrafish. This simple assay was validated by rescue with wild type INF2 confirming the specificity of the findings. The edema, podocyte dysfunction, and an altered glomerular filtration barrier observed in the zebrafish pronephros correlate with mistrafficking of glomerular slit diaphragm proteins, defective slit-diaphragm signaling, and disinhibited diaphanous formin (mDia) activity. In contrast to wild-type human INF2, INF2 mutants associated with kidney disease fail to rescue the zINF2 morphant phenotype. Of particular interest, this INF2 knockdown phenotype is also rescued by loss of either RhoA or Dia2. This simple assay allows the demonstration that INF2 functions, at least in part, to modulate Dia-mediated Rho signaling, and that disease causing mutations specifically impair this regulatory function. These data support a model in which disease-associated diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) mutants in INF2 interfere with its binding to and inhibition of Dia, leading to uncontrolled Rho/Dia signaling and perturbed actin dynamics. Methods to fine tune Rho signaling in the glomerulus may lead to new approaches to therapy in humans.

To date, 25 missense mutations and 3 in-frame deletions, all clustering in the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), have been associated with neuropathy (PMIDs e.g.: 24174593, 24487800, 24750328, 25676889). De-novo mutations are common, and the disease phenotype is highly specific with always including a progressive nephrotic syndrome, sometimes even preceding the neuropathy diagnosis by several years. INF2 encodes a member of the diaphanous-related formin family, which is involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, in mitochondrial dynamics, and microtubule stabilization. It is expressed in human sural nerves (PMID: 22187985) and co-localizes with the myelin protein MAL (PMID: 22187985). In mouse Schwann and HeLa cells, different mutants resulted in a disturbed actin-INF2-colocalization in the perinuclear area, and in patient sural nerve specimens, filamentous actin accumulated in the intracellular space (PMID: 22187985). A constitutive activation of the DID domain resulted in a reduction of mitochondrial length in transfected U2OS cells (PMID: 23349293). Morpholino-knockdown of INF2 in zebrafish resulted in a dorsalized and curling gross phenotype, which was partially rescued by co-injection of human wildtype INF2, but not by several mutants (PMID: 26086034). In summary, strong clinical evidence, including a highly specific phenotype, the de-novo occurrence of co-segregating variants, and the absence of such variants in healthy control collectives, is supported by experimental data on gene and variant level and has been replicated over time. We therefore classify the gene-disease relationship of INF2 and autosomal dominant, intermediate CMT with FSGS as definitive.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5215f2cf-99c9-405a-b221-18f412abd1f0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
