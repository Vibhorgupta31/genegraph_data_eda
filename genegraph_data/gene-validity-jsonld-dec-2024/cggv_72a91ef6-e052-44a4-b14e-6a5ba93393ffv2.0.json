Previous research has indicated that mutations of one of the VGSC genes, SCN9A (Nav1.7), result in febrile seizures and Dravet syndrome in humans. Despite these recent efforts, the electrophysiological basis of SCN9A mutations remains unclear. Here, we performed a genetic screen of patients with febrile seizures and identified a novel missense mutation of SCN9A (W1150R). Electrophysiological characterization of different SCN9A mutants in HEK293T cells, the previously-reported N641Y and K655R variants, as well as the newly-found W1150R variant, revealed that the current density of the W1150R and N641Y variants was significantly larger than that of the wild-type (WT) channel. The time constants of recovery from fast inactivation of the N641Y and K655R variants were markedly lower than in the WT channel. The W1150R variant caused a negative shift of the G-V curve in the voltage dependence of steady-state activation. All mutants displayed persistent currents larger than the WT channel. In addition, we found that oxcarbazepine (OXC), one of the antiepileptic drugs targeting VGSCs, caused a significant shift to more negative potential for the activation and inactivation in WT and mutant channels. OXC-induced inhibition of currents was weaker in the W1150R variant than in the WT. Furthermore, with administering OXC the time constant of the N641Y variant was longer than those of the other two SCN9A mutants. In all, our results indicated that the point mutation W1150R resulted in a novel gain-of-function variant. These findings indicated that SCN9A mutants contribute to an increase in seizure, and show distinct sensitivity to OXC.","dc:creator":"Zhang S","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"SCN9A Epileptic Encephalopathy Mutations Display a Gain-of-function Phenotype and Distinct Sensitivity to Oxcarbazepine."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31372899","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgraded as this variant has a very high minor allele frequency.

In 21 affected members, we uncovered a potential mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641Y, in the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II that was absent from 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To establish a functional role for this mutation in seizure susceptibility, we introduced the orthologous mutation into the murine Scn9a ortholog using targeted homologous recombination. Compared to wild-type mice, homozygous Scn9a(N641Y/N641Y) knockin mice exhibit significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates. Together, these data strongly support the SCN9A p.N641Y mutation as disease-causing in this family. To confirm the role of SCN9A in FS, we analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients and identified additional highly conserved Na(v)1.7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. After one of these children with FS later developed Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy), we sequenced the SCN1A gene, a gene known to be associated with Dravet syndrome, and identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients yielded nine Na(v)1.7 missense variants (8% of the patients), all in highly conserved amino acids. Six of these Dravet syndrome patients with SCN9A missense variants also harbored either missense or splice site SCN1A mutations and three had no SCN1A mutations.

Mutations in SCN1A gene have been found to be responsible for at least 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome, and 90% of these mutations arise de novo. The variable clinical phenotype is commonly observed among these patients with SCN1A mutations, suggesting that genetic modifiers may influence the phenotypic expression of Dravet syndrome. In the present study, we described the clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics of 13 Han Chinese pedigrees clinically diagnosed with Dravet syndrome. By targeted-exome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis and Sanger sequencing verification, 11 variants were identified in SCN1A gene among 11 pedigrees including 7 missense mutations, 2 splice site mutations, and 2 frameshift mutations (9 novel variants and 2 reported mutations). Particularly, 2 of these Dravet syndrome patients with SCN1A variants also harbored SCN9A, KCNQ2, or SLC6A8 variants. In addition, 2 subjects were failed to detect any pathogenic mutations in SCN1A and other epilepsy-related genes. These data suggested that SCN1A variants account for about 84.6% of Dravet syndrome in our cohort. This study expanded the mutational spectrum for the SCN1A gene, and also provided clinical and genetic evidence for the hypothesis that genetic modifiers may contribute to the variable manifestation of Dravet syndrome patients with SCN1A mutations. Thus, targeted-exome sequencing will make it possible to detect the interactions of epilepsy-related genes and reveal their modification on the severity of SCN1A mutation-related Dravet syndrome.","dc:creator":"Jiang T","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular analysis of epilepsy-related genes in patients with Dravet syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558019","rdfs:label":"Family 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgraded as there are 61 heterozygotes in gnomAD.

This study aimed at analyzing the genotype-phenotype correlations in neonates with seizures in a bid to improve the understanding of genetic diagnosis of early-onset epilepsy. Clinical features and prognosis of 15 children who underwent genetic testing having had unexplained seizures from February 2016 to May 2018 in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were analyzed retrospectively. The salient findings were: poor response to stimulus and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) in the initial period were observed in the group with concomitant genetic abnormalities. Despite the recent progress in genetic technology, molecular diagnosis for neonatal-onset epilepsy can be challenging due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneities. However, some genotypes are associated with specific clinical manifestations and EEG patterns.

Three channels, Na(v)1.7, Na(v)1.8, and Na(v)1.9, are expressed selectively in peripheral damage-sensing neurons. Because there are no selective blockers of these channels, we used gene ablation in mice to examine the function of Na(v)1.7 (PN1) in pain pathways. A global Na(v)1.7-null mutant was found to die shortly after birth. We therefore used the Cre-loxP system to generate nociceptor-specific knockouts. Na(v)1.8 is only expressed in peripheral, mainly nociceptive, sensory neurons. We knocked Cre recombinase into the Na(v)1.8 locus to generate heterozygous mice expressing Cre recombinase in Na(v)1.8-positive sensory neurons. Crossing these animals with mice where Na(v)1.7 exons 14 and 15 were flanked by loxP sites produced nociceptor-specific knockout mice that were viable and apparently normal. These animals showed increased mechanical and thermal pain thresholds. Remarkably, all inflammatory pain responses evoked by a range of stimuli, such as formalin, carrageenan, complete Freund's adjuvant, or nerve growth factor, were reduced or abolished. A congenital pain syndrome in humans recently has been mapped to the Na(v)1.7 gene, SCN9A. Dominant Na(v)1.7 mutations lead to edema, redness, warmth, and bilateral pain in human erythermalgia patients, confirming an important role for Na(v)1.7 in inflammatory pain. Nociceptor-specific gene ablation should prove useful in understanding the role of other broadly expressed genes in pain pathways.","dc:creator":"Nassar MA","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Nociceptor-specific gene deletion reveals a major role for Nav1.7 (PN1) in acute and inflammatory pain."},"rdfs:label":"Nassar Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because they examine pain behavior"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Refuted","sequence":2243,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":0.4,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bed2cdc4-da8f-4a2a-8937-f407bf718aad","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005027","gene":"hgnc:10597","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"Variants in SCN9A have been observed in individuals with a variety of primarily neuropathy phenotypes, including autosomal dominant small fiber neuropathy and erythermalgia and autosomal recessive congenital insensitivity to pain.  A relationship between SCN9A and autosomal dominant epilepsy (MONDO:0005027) has also been reported, which is the focus of this recuration.  The SCN9A gene was initially curated  by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) in relation to autosomal dominant epilepsy on 6/5/2018.  At the time, this gene-disease relationship was classified as LIMITED based on case-level data.  Since that time, a  publication providing evidence to refute this gene-disease relationship has become available.  \nIn the initial curation, the primary evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship with epilepsy was provided from Singh et al. 2009 (PMID 19763161).  This publication described a large family segregating the p.Asn641Tyr SCN9A variant in individuals with febrile or afebrile seizures, primarily limited to childhood.  Additionally, this publication provided weak experimental evidence with a homozygous p.Asn641Tyr knock-in mouse model.  A recent publication by Fasham et al. 2020 (PMID 33216760) provides evidence to refute the pathogenicity of the p.Asn641Tyr variant.  In this publication, the p.Asn641Tyr variant was identified in an Amish proband with a de novo CHD4 variant, consistent with the proband phenotype; the SCN9A variant was shown to be inherited from the proband’s unaffected father.  The p.Asn641Tyr variant was subsequently identified in another 7 Amish families where it was transmitted through an additional minimum 26 constitutive gene carriers and presumed to be transmitted to hundreds of additional offspring, only one of whom had any reported seizures. Additionally, the p.Asn641Tyr variant is present in 6 alleles in the gnomAD database. Additional variants in SCN9A have been reported in the literature in association with epilepsy and are summarized in this recuration, but the majority are unable to be scored due to lack of segregation with disease, high minor allele frequency in general population databases or an alternate molecular explanation for disease.  Case level data provides a score of 0.4 points and there is no scored experimental evidence, resulting in a total score of 0.4 points.  In summary, there is convincing evidence refuting the relationship between SCN9A and autosomal dominant epilepsy, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the relationship.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on 2/5/21 (SOP Version 8).\nA novel publication provides evidence against pathogenicity for a previously reported variant providing the primary evidence for an association with epilepsy.
