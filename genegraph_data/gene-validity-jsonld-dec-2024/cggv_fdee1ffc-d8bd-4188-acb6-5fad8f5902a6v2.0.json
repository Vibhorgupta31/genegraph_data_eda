Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern the development of hair cell-neuronal connections. We ascertained a family with autosomal recessive deafness associated with a common cavity inner ear malformation and auditory neuropathy. Via whole-exome sequencing, we identified a variant (c.2207G>C, p.R736T) in ROR1 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1), cosegregating with deafness in the family and absent in ethnicity-matched controls. ROR1 is a tyrosine kinase-like receptor localized at the plasma membrane. At the cellular level, the mutation prevents the protein from reaching the cellular membrane. In the presence of WNT5A, a known ROR1 ligand, the mutated ROR1 fails to activate NF-κB. Ror1 is expressed in the inner ear during development at embryonic and postnatal stages. We demonstrate that Ror1 mutant mice are severely deaf, with preserved otoacoustic emissions. Anatomically, mutant mice display malformed cochleae. Axons of spiral ganglion neurons show fasciculation defects. Type I neurons show impaired synapses with inner hair cells, and type II neurons display aberrant projections through the cochlear sensory epithelium. We conclude that Ror1 is crucial for spiral ganglion neurons to innervate auditory hair cells. Impairment of ROR1 function largely affects development of the inner ear and hearing in humans and mice.","dc:creator":"Diaz-Horta O","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"ROR1 is essential for proper innervation of auditory hair cells and hearing in humans and mice."}},"rdfs:label":"Diaz-Horta Proband"},{"id":"cggv:841c220e-b85d-4e55-bc40-ff1d935d5c43","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:841c220e-b85d-4e55-bc40-ff1d935d5c43_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgraded for homozygosity and consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:fdee1ffc-d8bd-4188-acb6-5fad8f5902a6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fdee1ffc-d8bd-4188-acb6-5fad8f5902a6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3cc615e-93ed-4bb2-ba6c-17e95856dc1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cabd986a-f95e-40cb-b3ed-9485321d4d63","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Ror1 was detected in mouse spiral ganglia and cochlear epithelium in embryonic day 14.5 mice.

","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34008309","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most frequent disabilities in industrialized countries. Evidence shows that hair cell loss in the auditory end organ is responsible for the majority of various ear pathological conditions. The functional roles of the receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1 have been underscored in various tumours. In this study, we evaluated the ability of ROR1 to influence cochlear hair cell loss of guinea pigs with NIHL. The NIHL model was developed in guinea pigs, with subsequent measurement of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Gain-of-function experiments were employed to explore the role of ROR1 in NIHL. The interaction between ROR1 and Wnt5a and their functions in the cochlear hair cell loss were further analysed in response to alteration of ROR1 and Wnt5a. Guinea pigs with NIHL demonstrated elevated ABR threshold and down-regulated ROR1, Wnt5a and NF-κB p65. The up-regulation of ROR1 was shown to decrease the cochlear hair cell loss and the expression of pro-apoptotic gene (Bax, p53) in guinea pig cochlea, but promoted the expression of anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl-2) and the fluorescence intensity of cleaved-caspase-3. ROR1 interacted with Wnt5a to activate the NF-κB signalling pathway through inducing phosphorylation and translocation of p65. Furthermore, Wnt5a overexpression decreased the cochlear hair cell loss. Collectively, this study suggested the protection of overexpression of ROR1 against cochlear hair cell loss in guinea pigs with NIHL via the Wnt5a-dependent NF-κB signalling pathway.","dc:creator":"Zhang J","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Ectopic expression of ROR1 prevents cochlear hair cell loss in guinea pigs with noise-induced hearing loss."},"rdfs:label":"Guinea Pig Models"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Noise-induced hearing loss is not synonymous with sensorineural hearing loss"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":7731,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":2.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:cc301d70-dd2d-4620-85cf-c749878cabb4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:10256","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"ROR1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (AR NSHL) in 2016 (Diaz-Horta O et al., PMID:27162350) Only one pathogenic missense mutation has been reported and this variant was found to segregate in one family (PMID:27162350)  This gene disease association is also supported by a mouse model and expression studies (PMID: 27162350).
