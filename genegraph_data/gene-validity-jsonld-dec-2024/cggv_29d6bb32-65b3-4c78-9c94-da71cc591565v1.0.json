Linkage analysis performed on the 3 families revealed that the patients were carrying homozygous haplotypes within the 11q23 region, in which the genes encoding the gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits of CD3 are located. Patients and affected fetuses from 2 families were homozygous for a mutation in the CD3D gene, and patients from the third family were homozygous for a mutation in the CD3E gene. The thymus from a CD3delta-deficient fetus was analyzed and revealed that T cell differentiation was blocked at entry into the double positive (CD4+CD8+) stage with the accumulation of intermediate CD4-single positive cells. This indicates that CD3delta plays an essential role in promoting progression of early thymocytes toward double-positive stage. Altogether, these findings extend the known molecular mechanisms underlying severe combined immunodeficiency to a new deficiency, i.e., CD3epsilon deficiency, and emphasize the essential roles played by the CD3epsilon and CD3delta subunits in human thymocyte development, since these subunits associate with both the pre-TCR and the TCR.","dc:creator":"de Saint Basile G","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Severe combined immunodeficiency caused by deficiency in either the delta or the epsilon subunit of CD3."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15546002","rdfs:label":"PI-3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The presumed homozygous (by consanguinity) variant, c.128_129del occurs in exon 6 of 9, leading to the frameshift Thr43AsnfsTer13 and generation of a premature stop codon, which is predicted to result in NMD."},{"id":"cggv:286cbb10-a420-4ddf-b614-2ae0676c1401_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d49c7bcf-6a13-4b49-ac81-15a604658747","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Targeted NGS panel, consisting of 433 amplicons covering the coding regions, promoters, and UTR sites of 18 SCID-related genes (IL2RG, JAK3, IL7RA, PTPRC, CD3D, CD3E, CD3Z, CORO1A, DCLRE1C, PRKCD, AK2, ADA, RAG1, RAG2, XLF/NHEJ1, LIG4, PNP, ZBTB24).

In humans two of these proteins, T3-gamma and T3-delta, are glycoproteins of relative molecular mass (Mr) 25,000 (25K) and 20,000 (20K), respectively, while the third, T3-epsilon, is a 20K non-glycosylated protein. On the surface of murine T cells, a non-glycosylated protein dimer composed of 17K subunits (T3-zeta) is found associated with the T-cell receptor alpha and beta chains and the three T3-like polypeptide chains. It is generally accepted that major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen recognition is a function of the alpha-beta heterodimer. This has led to the postulation that the proteins of the T3 complex are involved in the signal transduction that immediately follows antigen recognition via the antigen receptor. Events believed to be involved in early T-cell activation, such as rapid increases in phosphatidylinositol turnover and free intracellular calcium, can be triggered by antibodies directed against either the T3 complex or the clonotypic receptor. We have previously reported our findings on the cloning of the complementary DNA and genomic structure encoding both the human and murine 20K glycoprotein, T3-delta (refs 11-13).

The TCR/CD3 complex is assembled after a series of pairwise interactions involving the formation of dimers of CD3 epsilon with either CD3 gamma or CD3 delta. These dimers assemble with TCR alpha and TCR beta chains, and finally, the CD3 zeta homodimer is added to allow export of the full complex from the ER. A model has been proposed suggesting that during assembly the CD3 epsilon/CD3 gamma dimer interacts exclusively with TCR beta and the CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta dimer with TCR alpha to form a complex with a single TCR alpha/beta heterodimer. We show in this study, by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, that in the human T cell line Jurkat as well as in total human thymocytes, this preferential interaction does not occur and instead, the CD3 epsilon/CD3 gamma and CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta dimers associate with both TCR chains simultaneously and indistinctly. These data are confirmed by the analysis of the TCR alpha-negative T cell line MOLT-4 in which TCR beta is found separately associated with CD3 epsilon/CD3 gamma and with CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta dimers. Indirectly, our results support a model of stoichiometry in which two TCR alpha/beta heterodimers are present in a TCR/CD3 complex. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3 gamma and anti-CD3 delta antibodies from 1% NP40 and 1% Brij96 cell lysates showed that these subunits form independent partial complexes which are cross-linked through the CD3 zeta homodimer. This suggests that CD3 zeta mediates the interaction between both TCR alpha/beta heterodimers contained in the double TCR complex. Further proof for this hypothesis is obtained after analysis of a Jurkat cell transfectant containing a point mutation in the transmembrane domain of TCR beta that impairs the association of CD3 zeta. In this mutant cell line, unlike a control line with wild-type TCR beta, the CD3 gamma- and CD3 delta-containing complexes were found completely independent. Altogether, these results support a model of TCR/CD3 assembly and stoichiometry in which two TCR-alpha/beta heterodimers form two hemicomplexes containing either CD3 epsilon/gamma or CD3 epsilon/delta dimers which become associated via the CD3 zeta homodimer.","dc:creator":"San José E","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Assembly of the TCR/CD3 complex: CD3 epsilon/delta and CD3 epsilon/gamma dimers associate indistinctly with both TCR alpha and TCR beta chains.

The role of individual invariant subunits in T cell development has been investigated by generating gene-specific mutations in mice. Mutation of CD3gamma, -delta, or zeta results in an incomplete block in development, characterized by reduced numbers of mature T cells that express low levels of TCR. In contrast, mature T cells are absent from CD3epsilon-/- mice, and thymocyte development is arrested at the early CD4(-)CD8(-) stage. Although these results suggest that CD3epsilon is essential for pre-TCR and TCR expression/function, their interpretation is complicated by the fact that expression of the CD3gamma and CD3delta genes also is reduced in CD3epsilon-/- mice. Thus, it is unclear whether the phenotype of CD3epsilon-/- mice reflects the collective effects of CD3gamma, -delta, and -epsilon deficiency. By removing the selectable marker (PGK-NEO) from the targeted CD3epsilon gene via Cre/loxP-mediated recombination, we generated mice that lack CD3epsilon yet retain normal expression of the closely linked CD3gamma and CD3delta genes. These (CD3epsilonDelta/Delta) mice exhibited an early arrest in T cell development, similar to that of CD3epsilon-/- mice. Moreover, the developmental defect could be rescued by expression of a CD3epsilon transgene. These results identify an essential role for CD3epsilon in T cell development not shared by the CD3gamma, CD3delta, or zeta-family proteins and provide further evidence that PGK-NEO can influence the expression of genes in its proximity.","dc:creator":"DeJarnette JB","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Specific requirement for CD3epsilon in T cell development."},"rdfs:label":"CD3ɛΔ/Δ rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Rescue was accomplished with a CD3ɛ transgene generated with murine CD3ɛ coding sequences, not human WT which would further associate the animal model with the human disease."},{"id":"cggv:11523e45-97e6-460c-8e0a-e550ec6f95ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3fb51a7c-8bda-4935-a39a-827aebaee49d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"As in SCID patients, in the E∆P mice, T cell development is arrested at the double-negative stage.

To study whether CD3 epsilon regulates expression of CD3 gamma and delta genes, we generated a strain of CD3 epsilon-deficient mice termed CD3 epsilon(delta P/delta P) (epsilon(delta P)), in which the promoter of CD3E was disrupted, and subsequently reconstituted these mice with a CD3 epsilon transgene.

Remarkably, this rescue led to a very efficient differentiation and maturation of thymocytes, resulting in a significant T cell population in the periphery.
