Beta1 and beta2 integrin function on leukocytes is crucial for a successful immune response and the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 initiates the process of blood clotting through binding fibrinogen. Integrins on circulating cells bind poorly to their ligands but become active after 'inside-out' signaling through other membrane receptors. Subjects with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-I) do not express beta2 integrins because of mutations in the gene specifying the beta2 subunit, and they suffer recurrent bacterial infections. Mutations affecting alpha(IIb)beta3 integrin cause the bleeding disorder termed Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Subjects with LAD-III show symptoms of both LAD-I and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Their hematopoietically-derived cells express beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrins, but defective inside-out signaling causes immune deficiency and bleeding problems. The LAD-III lesion has been attributed to a C --> A mutation in the gene encoding calcium and diacylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factor (CALDAGGEF1; official symbol RASGRP2) specifying the CALDAG-GEF1 protein, but we show that this change is not responsible for the LAD-III disorder. Instead, we identify mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3) gene specifying the KINDLIN-3 protein as the cause of LAD-III in Maltese and Turkish subjects. Two independent mutations result in decreased KINDLIN3 messenger RNA levels and loss of protein expression.

Two other LAD1v patients were found to carry different stop codons in FERMT3 (p.Arg573X and p.Trp229X) and lacked the CALDAGGEF1 and NRXN2 mutations, providing convincing evidence that FERMT3 is the gene responsible for LAD1v.

In this article, we describe a patient with a new mutation of FERMT3 and lack of kindlin-3 expression in platelets and leukocytes. We assayed quantitatively the first steps of kindlin-3-defective leukocyte adhesion, namely, initial bond formation, bond strengthening, and early spreading. Initial bond formation was readily stimulated with neutrophils stimulated by fMLF, and neutrophils and lymphocytes stimulated by a phorbol ester or Mn(2+). In contrast, attachment strengthening was defective in the patient's lymphocytes treated with PMA or Mn(2+), or fMLF-stimulated neutrophils. However, attachment strengthening was normal in patient's neutrophils treated with phorbol ester or Mn(2+). In addition, the patient's T lymphocytes displayed defective integrin-mediated spreading and a moderate but significant decrease of spreading on anti-CD3-coated surfaces. Patient's neutrophils displayed a drastic alteration of integrin-mediated spreading after fMLF or PMA stimulation, whereas signaling-independent Mn(2+) allowed significant spreading. In conclusion, the consequences of kindlin-3 deficiency on β(2) integrin function depend on both cell type and the stimulus used for integrin activation.

Several proteins previously implicated in integrin activation, including Ras-associated protein-1 (RAP1) and calcium and diacylglycerol-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor-1 (CALDAG-GEF1), were present and functional in these cell lines.

The blood cell-specific FERM domain protein Kindlin-3 is required for the activation of the beta1 and beta3 integrins on platelets. Impaired activation of beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrins on platelets and leukocytes is the hallmark of a rare autosomal recessive leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome in humans called LAD-III, characterized by severe bleeding and impaired adhesion of leukocytes to inflamed endothelia. Here we show that Kindlin-3 also binds the beta2 integrin cytoplasmic domain and is essential for neutrophil binding and spreading on beta2 integrin-dependent ligands such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and the complement C3 activation product iC3b. Moreover, loss of Kindlin-3 expression abolished firm adhesion and arrest of neutrophils on activated endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas selectin-mediated rolling was unaffected. Thus, Kindlin-3 is essential to activate the beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrin classes, and loss of Kindlin-3 function is sufficient to cause a LAD-III-like phenotype in mice.","dc:creator":"Moser M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Kindlin-3 is required for beta2 integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells."},"rdfs:label":"Integrin Activation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Pull-down experiments with recombinant β1, β2 and β3 integrin cytoplasmic tails incubated with platelet lysates showed a clear Kindlin-3 interaction with all three integrin cytoplasmic tails.

To ensure that platelets aggregate only at injury sites, integrins on circulating platelets exist in a low-affinity state and shift to a high-affinity state (in a process known as integrin activation or priming) after contacting a wounded vessel. The shift is mediated through binding of the cytoskeletal protein Talin to the beta subunit cytoplasmic tail. Here we show that platelets lacking the adhesion plaque protein Kindlin-3 cannot activate integrins despite normal Talin expression. As a direct consequence, Kindlin-3 deficiency results in severe bleeding and resistance to arterial thrombosis. Mechanistically, Kindlin-3 can directly bind to regions of beta-integrin tails distinct from those of Talin and trigger integrin activation. We have therefore identified Kindlin-3 as a novel and essential element for platelet integrin activation in hemostasis and thrombosis.","dc:creator":"Moser M","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Kindlin-3 is essential for integrin activation and platelet aggregation."},"rdfs:label":"FERMT3 null mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The FERMT3 null mouse model recapitulates both cellular defects and clinical phenotypes observed in human LAD-III patients."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":16,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:adfa3690-e31f-4008-a916-83e4897b8eac","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013016","gene":"hgnc:23151","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"FERMT3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive leukocyte adhesion deficiency 3 in 2008 (Mory et al., PMID: 18779414). At least 15 unique variants (primarily nonsense, along with other LoF splicing and frameshift variants, and few inactivating missense variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 18 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 18779414, 19234463, 19234460, 19064721, 21441448, 22139635). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the enhanced expression of FERMT3 in hematopoietic tissues, its biochemical function in integrin activation which is altered in patient cells but can be rescued, and a null mouse model which recapitulates both cellular defects and clinical phenotypes observed in human LAD-III patients. In summary, FERMT3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive leukocyte adhesion deficiency 3.
