Typically, ADPKD presents in adulthood but is rarely diagnosed in utero with enlarged, echogenic kidneys. Somatic mutations are thought crucial for cyst development, but gene dosage is also important since animal models with hypomorphic alleles develop cysts, but are viable as homozygotes. We screened for mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 in two consanguineous families and found PKD1 missense variants predicted to be pathogenic. In one family, two siblings homozygous for R3277C developed end stage renal disease at ages 75 and 62 years, while six heterozygotes had few cysts. In the other family, the father and two children with moderate to severe disease were homozygous for N3188S. In both families homozygous disease was associated with small cysts of relatively uniform size while marked cyst heterogeneity is typical of ADPKD. In another family, one patient diagnosed in childhood was found to be a compound heterozygote for the PKD1 variants R3105W and R2765C. All three families had evidence of developmental defects of the collecting system. Three additional ADPKD families with in utero onset had a truncating mutation in trans with either R3277C or R2765C. These cases suggest the presence of incompletely penetrant PKD1 alleles. The alleles alone may result in mild cystic disease; two such alleles cause typical to severe disease; and, in combination with an inactivating allele, are associated with early onset disease. Our study indicates that the dosage of functional PKD1 protein may be critical for cyst initiation.","dc:creator":"Rossetti S","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Incompletely penetrant PKD1 alleles suggest a role for gene dosage in cyst initiation in polycystic kidney disease."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f5af116-f3d1-410a-bd27-0c1753703f2f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c25f7e1-72db-4081-a9a7-b0687b0d3090","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunohistological studies localized polycystin to renal tubular epithelia, hepatic bile ductules, and pancreatic ducts, all sites of cystic changes in ADPKD, as well as in tissues such as skin that are not known to be affected in ADPKD.

Most cases result from mutations of PKD1 or PKD2 encoding polycystin-1 or polycystin-2, respectively. Polycystin-1 is a large transmembrane protein containing several domains involved in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions. Polycystin-2 is transmembrane glycoprotein sharing homology with some families of cation channels. Despite a large number of reports, the tissue distribution of these two proteins, especially of polycystin-1, is still debated. We investigated the expression pattern of PKD1 and PKD2 transcripts and proteins during human embryogenesis and kidney development, using Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical methods. For each gene, the expression pattern of transcripts and protein was concordant. In human 5- to 6-week-old embryos, both genes are widely expressed, mainly in neural tissue, cardiomyocytes, endodermal derivatives, and mesonephros. At this age, PKD2 but not PKD1 expression is observed in the ureteric bud and the uninduced metanephros. Thereafter, PKD2 is diffusely expressed at all stages of nephron development, whereas high PKD1 expression first appears in differentiated proximal tubules. Proximal tubule expression of both genes decreases from weeks 20 to 24 onwards. PKD1 transcripts, later restricted to distal tubules in fetal nephrogenesis, are no longer detected in adult kidneys, which nevertheless maintain a faint expression of polycystin-1, whereas persistent expression of PKD2 transcripts and protein is observed throughout nephrogenesis. Overall, contrary to previous observations, we found profound differences in the spatiotemporal expression of PKD1 and PKD2 during nephrogenesis, PKD2 being expressed earlier and more diffusely than PKD1.

Recent patient data suggest that the disease is dosage dependent, where incompletely penetrant alleles influence disease severity. Here, we have developed a knockin mouse model matching a likely disease variant, PKD1 p.R3277C (RC), and have proved that its functionally hypomorphic nature modifies the ADPKD phenotype. While Pkd1+/null mice are normal, Pkd1RC/null mice have rapidly progressive disease, and Pkd1RC/RC animals develop gradual cystogenesis. These models effectively mimic the pathophysiological features of in utero-onset and typical ADPKD, respectively, correlating the level of functional Pkd1 product with disease severity, highlighting the dosage dependence of cystogenesis. Additionally, molecular analyses identified p.R3277C as a temperature-sensitive folding/trafficking mutant, and length defects in collecting duct primary cilia, the organelle central to PKD pathogenesis, were clearly detected for the first time to our knowledge in PKD1. Altogether, this study highlights the role that in trans variants at the disease locus can play in phenotypic modification of dominant diseases and provides a truly orthologous PKD1 model, optimal for therapeutic testing.","dc:creator":"Hopp K","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Functional polycystin-1 dosage governs autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease severity."},"rdfs:label":"Knock-in mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":4,"dc:description":"Upgraded because the model replicated a human disease causing variant and recapitulated the human phenotype"},{"id":"cggv:57af4fb0-e542-4539-8661-457a582746b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd4b55a2-4cb1-4a91-8f24-424c1b1a1ed7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Heterozygotes had no discernible phenotype, while homozygotes died during the perinatal period with massively enlarged cystic kidneys, pancreatic ductal cysts, and pulmonary hypoplasia.

Coinheritance of a hypomorphic PKD1 allele in trans with an inactivating PKD1 allele is one mechanism that can cause early onset ADPKD. Here, we describe two pedigrees without a history of cystic kidney disease that each contain two patients with onset of massive PKD in utero. The presentations were typical of autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD) but they were not linked to the known ARPKD gene, PKHD1. Mutation analysis of the ADPKD genes provided strong evidence that both families inherited, in trans, two incompletely penetrant PKD1 alleles. These patients illustrate that PKD1 mutations can manifest as a phenocopy of ARPKD with respect to renal involvement and highlight the perils of linkage-based diagnostics in ARPKD without positive PKHD1 mutation data. Furthermore, the phenotypic overlap between ARPKD and these patients resulting from incomplete penetrant PKD1 alleles support a common pathogenesis for these diseases.","dc:creator":"Vujic

was first reported in relation to biallelic polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in 2009 (Rossetti et al., PMID: 19165178). *PKD1* has been previously classified as definitive for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Biallelic disease of two fully pathogenic *PKD1* variants results in embryonic lethality and so viable biallelic cases must have at least one hypomorphic allele. This biallelic disease is a significant cause of very early onset PKD and can arise in a family with otherwise typical ADPKD (monoallelic family members). Individuals with a negative family history can have two hypomorphic alleles. At least seventeen unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in thirteen probands in four publications (PMIDs: 19165178, 23624871, 30631912, 33168999) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (PMIDs: 26139440, 20558538). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by two mouse models, biochemical function data, and expression data (PMIDs: 9326937, 23064367, 11106764, 31427367, 8981910, 11891195). In summary, *PKD1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD-*PKD1*). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy GCEP on the meeting date 1/11/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
