NS is an autosomal dominant trait and is genetically heterogeneous. Gain of function of SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that positively modulates RAS signaling, is observed in nearly 50% of affected individuals. Here, we report the identification of heterozygous KRAS gene mutations in two subjects exhibiting a severe NS phenotype with features overlapping those of cardiofaciocutaneous and Costello syndromes. Both mutations were de novo and affected exon 6, which encodes the C-terminal portion of KRAS isoform B but does not contribute to KRAS isoform A. Structural analysis indicated that both substitutions (Val152Gly and Asp153Val) perturb the conformation of the guanine ring-binding pocket of the protein, predicting an increase in the guanine diphosphate/guanine triphosphate (GTP) dissociation rate that would favor GTP binding to the KRASB isoform and bypass the requirement for a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.","dc:creator":"Carta C","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Germline missense mutations affecting KRAS Isoform B are associated with a severe Noonan syndrome phenotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16773572","rdfs:label":"Carta 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This patient is described to have overlapping features of Costello syndrome, but the study isn't making the claim that this is a Costello case."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":2255,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"cggv:46eb8531-5089-48be-9a42-04be17a7dda0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009026","gene":"hgnc:6407","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"There have been five studies to date that have identified patients with features consistent with Costello syndrome (CS) and de novo or inherited variants in KRAS (Carta et al., 2006; Nava et al., 2007; Schubbert et al., 2007; Zenker et al., 2007). However, none of the patients possessed features to definitively differentiate their diagnosis from other RASopathies as CS. Variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals may complicate the clinical diagnosis of CS versus severe forms of cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Therefore, the evidence for this association is Disputed. Furthermore, the HRAS gene is believed to be the only gene associated with CS (Aoki et al., 2005; Estep, Tidyman, Teitell, Cotter, & Rauen, 2006; Gripp et al., 2006; Kerr et al., 2006; Zampino et al., 2007). Of note, KRAS has also been classified as definitive in association with Noonan syndrome (NS) and as strong in association with CFC syndrome.
