Sequencing of patients with B cell-restricted immunodeficiency reveals autosomal dominant mutations in TOP2B. TOP2B encodes a type II topoisomerase, an essential gene required to alleviate topological stress during DNA replication and gene transcription, with no previously known role in B cell development. We use Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and knockin and knockout murine models, to demonstrate that patient mutations in TOP2B have a dominant negative effect on enzyme function, resulting in defective proliferation, survival of B-2 cells, causing a block in B cell development, and impair humoral function in response to immunization.","dc:creator":"Broderick L","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Mutations in topoisomerase IIβ result in a B cell immunodeficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.75},{"id":"cggv:677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad8c32c3-a8c5-42cd-a171-996262323dd0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ebda4e26-d048-4e94-9ac8-f6a67c026a56","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In mice, B cells have greater expression of Top2b mRNA and protein compared to T cells, which is consistent with previous reports in humans (PMID: 24053356).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31409799","rdfs:label":"B cell expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Consistent with B-cell immunodeficiency found in patients."},{"id":"cggv:8b21fbc7-d7c5-462f-b059-a1d1ce37641c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dabfda2e-9a3f-4128-96ea-a54d4b3f2b76","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"TOP2B makes transient double-stranded DNA breaks that alleviate negative supercoils.

The B' domain of topoisomerase II contains three highly conserved motifs, EGDSA, PL(R/K)GK(I/L/M)LNVR, and IMTD(Q/A)DXD. We have investigated these motifs in topoisomerase II beta by mutagenesis, and report that they play a critical role in establishing the DNA cleavage-religation equilibrium. In addition, the mutations E477Q (EGDSA) and K505E (PLRGKILNVR) increase the optimal magnesium ion concentration for strand passage, without affecting the Mg(2+) dependence of ATP hydrolysis. It is likely that the binding affinity of the magnesium ion(s) specifically required for DNA cleavage has been reduced by these mutations. The crystal structure of yeast topo II indicates that residues E477 and K505 may help to position the three aspartate residues of the IMTD(Q/A)DXD motif for magnesium ion coordination, and we propose two possible locations for the magnesium ion binding site(s). These observations are consistent with a previous model in which the B' domain is positioned such that these acidic residues lie next to the active site tyrosine residue. A magnesium ion bound by these aspartate residues could therefore mediate the DNA cleavage-religation reaction.","dc:creator":"West KL","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mutagenesis of E477 or K505 in the B' domain of human topoisomerase II beta increases the requirement for magnesium ions during strand passage."},"rdfs:label":"decatenation and relaxation activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Purified wt topo IIB was assayed\nfor decatenation and relaxation activity to characterize the\nfull catalytic cycle.

Dominant negative mutations in the TOP2B gene, encoding DNA topoisomerase 2-beta, cause Hoffman syndrome (also known as BILU syndrome) with humoral b-cell immunodeficiency, distal limb anomalies, dysmorphic facial features, and urogenital malformations. Three missense variants and one in-frame deletion in the TOPRIM domain have been reported in six probands, and three additional family members, in three publications (PMIDs: 31409799, 32128574, and 33459963). This gene-disease association is supported by its function, generating transient double-stranded DNA breaks that alleviate negative supercoils (PMID: 10684600). Failure to relax topological stress in patient cells (PMID: 32128574) can reduce the production of multiple gene products, and cause loss of function of large genes, which are most vulnerable to topologic stress. Many B-cell-specific transcription factor genes are relatively long and require TOP2B for efficient transcription, suggesting a pathogenesis mechanism for the TOP2B mutations and the role of TOP2B in B-cell development (PMID: 31409799). Additionally, there are b-cell specific knockout and knock-in mouse models that recapitulates disease (PMID: 31409799). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
