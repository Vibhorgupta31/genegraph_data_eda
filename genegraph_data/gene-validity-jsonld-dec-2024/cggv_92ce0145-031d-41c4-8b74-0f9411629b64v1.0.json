Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is characterized by overgrowth of either one of the two cerebral hemispheres. The molecular etiology of HME remains a mystery. The intractable epilepsy that is associated with HME can be relieved by the surgical treatment hemispherectomy, allowing sampling of diseased tissue. Exome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis in paired brain-blood samples from individuals with HME (n = 20 cases) identified de novo somatic mutations in 30% of affected individuals in the PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR genes. A recurrent PIK3CA c.1633G>A mutation was found in four separate cases. Identified mutations were present in 8-40% of sequenced alleles in various brain regions and were associated with increased neuronal S6 protein phosphorylation in the brains of affected individuals, indicating aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Thus HME is probably a genetically mosaic disease caused by gain of function in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT3-mTOR signaling.","dc:creator":"Lee JH","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"De novo somatic mutations in components of the PI3K-AKT3-mTOR pathway cause hemimegalencephaly."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22729223","rdfs:label":"1563"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2b6c8078-e227-45a1-a636-8fd49b1bdc1b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e320c29c-7c10-482a-be4f-5f2b64ac6b4a","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Candidate somatic variants extracted from WES data were validated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based deep sequencing using specific primers.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:2b6c8078-e227-45a1-a636-8fd49b1bdc1b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f7f58ec1-037d-434f-b0b2-3ec23110e5bd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004958.4(MTOR):c.6644C>A (p.Ser2215Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16602587"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26018084"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26018084","rdfs:label":"11683"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10},{"id":"cggv:92ce0145-031d-41c4-8b74-0f9411629b64_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92ce0145-031d-41c4-8b74-0f9411629b64_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec1c2e33-b67f-4bc0-bf5d-8285d71d7333","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d8c2232-2070-451f-8409-36f5c737c19a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"pS6K was increased as measured by Western blot","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25799227","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a sporadic developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by dysmorphic neurons, dyslamination and medically refractory epilepsy.

Here, we used deep whole-exome sequencing (read depth, 412-668×) validated by site-specific amplicon sequencing (100-347,499×) in paired brain-blood DNA from four subjects with FCDII and uncovered a de novo brain somatic mutation, mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) c.7280T>C (p.Leu2427Pro) in two subjects. Deep sequencing of the MTOR gene in an additional 73 subjects with FCDII using hybrid capture and PCR amplicon sequencing identified eight different somatic missense mutations found in multiple brain tissue samples of ten subjects. The identified mutations accounted for 15.6% of all subjects with FCDII studied (12 of 77). The identified mutations induced the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase. Focal cortical expression of mutant MTOR by in utero electroporation in mice was sufficient to disrupt neuronal migration and cause spontaneous seizures and cytomegalic neurons. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin suppressed cytomegalic neurons and epileptic seizures. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that brain somatic activating mutations in MTOR cause FCD and identifies mTOR as a treatment target for intractable epilepsy in FCD.

PMID:22729223). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Multiple recurrent variants have been identified in this gene, and functional testing in patient cell lines support a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Additional experimental studies have been done on non-patient derived cells and animal models supporting a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Focal cortical dysplasia, type II, somatic (OMIM: 607341), Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (616638). The phenotypic spectrum is largely due to what tissue(s) the variant affects.  In summary, MTOR has been definitively associated with overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 05/25/2021.
