CD31 was expressed in vascular endothelial cells in cancer lesions as well as in non-cancerous areas (30-100%) in all core tissue samples. CD105 expression was intense and restricted to capillary endothelial cells in cancer lesions (>73%). In contrast, positive expression of CD105 was seen in <20% of non-cancerous areas in the same organs. However, no significant difference in CD105 expression in vascular endothelial cells between cancer lesions and non-cancerous areas from liver and renal cancer samples was found. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flt1, and Flk1 were also expressed, but only sporadically and in few samples (<30%), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and TGF-betaRII were negative in vascular endothelial cells but generally positive in cancer cells. CD44 was strongly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver (90-100%). These results show that CD105 is expressed specifically in the tumor angiogenesis of brain, lung, breast, stomach, and colon cancers.","dc:creator":"Minhajat R","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Organ-specific endoglin (CD105) expression in the angiogenesis of human cancers."},"rdfs:label":"Histological assessment-IHC"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Endoglin expression was intense and restricted to capillary endothelial cells in cancer lesions (>73%) by IHC on resected cancer tissues from 188 patients of various cancers including colon.

The term \"juvenile\" refers to the type of polyp rather than to the age of onset of polyps.ENG was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant JPS in 2005 (Sweet et al., PMID: 16287957).  ENG (Endoglin) is a component of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) receptor complex and binds TGFB1 with a crucial role in vascular development and angiogenesis. Haploinsufficient variants account for over 85% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and have been found to have a Definitive relationship with HHT (see separate curation).  Variants in ENG genes were subsequently reported in patients with JPS without overlapped HHT phenotype. Therefore, per the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group this curation solely focuses on JPS phenotype with regard to curating the limited information available for this split curation. Seven missense variants that have been reported in eight probands in three publications (PMIDs: 16287957, 17204053, 23399955) are included in this curation. All of these JPS associated ENG variants are variants of uncertain pathogenicity (0.3 point). There were two research articles showing endoglin expression was increased in various cancer tissues including colon (1 point). Combination of genetic and experimental evidence has not demonstrated convincing definitive validity of ENG gene in inherited JPS. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:08c5b377-a2a1-44ac-9b7e-dc2141ee7a04"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
