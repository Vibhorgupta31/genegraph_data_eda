FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein which forms a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex that associates with polyribosomes. Recently, mRNA ligands associated with FMRP have been identified. However, the mechanism by which FMRP regulates the translation of its mRNA ligands remains unclear. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs involved in translational control. Here we show that in vivo mammalian FMRP interacts with microRNAs and the components of the microRNA pathways including Dicer and the mammalian ortholog of Argonaute 1 (AGO1). Using two different Drosophila melanogaster models, we show that AGO1 is critical for FMRP function in neural development and synaptogenesis. Our results suggest that FMRP may regulate neuronal translation via microRNAs and links microRNAs with human disease.","dc:creator":"Jin P","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Biochemical and genetic interaction between the fragile X mental retardation protein and the microRNA pathway."},"rdfs:label":"Biochemical function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ec86c06a-f5a3-448d-be53-277bc91d12de_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f5952e2-bec3-46ed-907d-7d93df3e5962","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:83a2f6ed-811c-4e87-9351-84a220aee7d4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"see above","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33199684","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"ARGONAUTE-2 and associated miRNAs form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which targets mRNAs for translational silencing and degradation as part of the RNA interference pathway.

We identify 13 heterozygous mutations in AGO2 in 21 patients affected by disturbances in neurological development. Each of the identified single amino acid mutations result in impaired shRNA-mediated silencing. We observe either impaired RISC formation or increased binding of AGO2 to mRNA targets as mutation specific functional consequences. The latter is supported by decreased phosphorylation of a C-terminal serine cluster involved in mRNA target release, increased formation of dendritic P-bodies in neurons and global transcriptome alterations in patient-derived primary fibroblasts.

Regulating dosage of FMR1 levels is critical for proper development and function of the nervous system and germ line, but the pathways responsible for maintaining normal expression levels are less clearly defined. Loss of Drosophila Fragile X protein (dFMR1) causes several behavioral and developmental defects in the fly, many of which are analogous to those seen in Fragile X patients. Over-expression of dFMR1 also causes specific neuronal and behavioral abnormalities. We have found that Argonaute2 (Ago2), the core component of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway, regulates dfmr1 expression. Previously, the relationship between dFMR1 and Ago2 was defined by their physical interaction and co-regulation of downstream targets. We have found that Ago2 and dFMR1 are also connected through a regulatory relationship. Ago2 mediated repression of dFMR1 prevents axon growth and branching defects of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Consequently, the neurogenesis defects in larvae mutant for both dfmr1 and Ago2 mirror those in dfmr1 null mutants. The Ago2 null phenotype at the NMJ is rescued in animals carrying an Ago2 genomic rescue construct. However, animals carrying a mutant Ago2 allele that produces Ago2 with significantly reduced endoribonuclease catalytic activity are normal with respect to the NMJ phenotypes examined. dFMR1 regulation by Ago2 is also observed in the germ line causing a multiple oocyte in a single egg chamber mutant phenotype. We have identified Ago2 as a regulator of dfmr1 expression and have clarified an important developmental role for Ago2 in the nervous system and germ line that requires dfmr1 function.","dc:creator":"Pepper AS","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Argonaute2 suppresses Drosophila fragile X expression preventing neurogenesis and oogenesis defects."},"rdfs:label":"Non-human model organism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"partial phenotypic overlap between human patients and fruit fly larvae, lower level model organism, however rescue supports the role of the Ago2 gene in the phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ec86c06a-f5a3-448d-be53-277bc91d12de_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7679,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:961ed9a8-17fa-4769-bb82-cb956dac8eb2","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0030897","gene":"hgnc:3263","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The AGO2 gene is located on chromosome 8 at 8q24.3 and encodes the argonaute RISC catalytic component 2, which is associated with RNA-mediated gene silencing as part of the RNA-inducing silencing complex (RISC). The AGO2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Lessel-Kreienkamp syndrome in 2020 (Lessel et al., PMID: 33199684). At least 12 unique variants (including 11 missense and an in-frame deletion) have been reported in over 20 individuals and included in this curation (PMID: 33199684; van der Ven et al., 2021, PMID: 34490615; Stutterd et al., 2022, PMID: 35803560). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship is primarily case level evidence. Experimental evidence includes biochemical function, a non-human model organism, and functional alteration of non-patient cells. Variants in AGO1 and deletions encompassing AGO1 and AGO3 that belong to the same Argonaute family of proteins as AGO2, have been reported in association with neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Tokita et al., 2015, PMID: 25271087; Schalk et al., 2022, PMID: 34930816). AGO2 has been functionally linked to the FMR1 gene associated with Fragile X syndrome, which displays similar phenotypes to those observed in Lessel-Kreienkamp syndrome (Jin et al., 2004, PMID: 14703574; Pepper et al,. 2009, PMID: 19888420). D. melanogaster Ago2 mutants show neurological deficits and present with defective neuronal branching and synapse formation (19888420). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between AGO2 and autosomal dominant Lessel-Kreienkamp syndrome. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 15th September 2023 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ec86c06a-f5a3-448d-be53-277bc91d12de"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
