Here, we report that Foxd3, a member of the forkhead family of transcriptional regulators, is required for maintenance of embryonic cells of the early mouse embryo. Foxd3-/- embryos die after implantation at approximately 6.5 days postcoitum with a loss of epiblast cells, expansion of proximal extraembryonic tissues, and a distal, mislocalized anterior organizing center. Moreover, it has not been possible to establish Foxd3-/- ES cell lines or to generate Foxd3-/- teratocarcinomas. Chimera analysis reveals that Foxd3 function is required in the epiblast and that Foxd3-/- embryos can be rescued by a small number of wild-type cells. Foxd3-/- mutant blastocysts appear morphologically normal and express Oct4, Sox2, and Fgf4, but when placed in vitro the inner cell mass initially proliferates and then fails to expand even when Fgf4 is added. These results establish Foxd3 as a factor required for the maintenance of progenitor cells in the mammalian embryo.","dc:creator":"Hanna LA","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Requirement for Foxd3 in maintaining pluripotent cells of the early mouse embryo."},"rdfs:label":"Hanna_Foxd3-/- mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Minimal score is awarded to show that complete loss of Foxd3 is incompatible with life.

The study reported 4 families with anterior segment dysgenesis/Peters anomaly/aniridia and identifed four variants that were predicted to be disease causing. However, the variants are not supported by functional evidence, and they are found at relatively high population frequencies in gnomAD. \n\nThere are no additional case reports; however, several studies refer to *FOXD3* in relation to aniridia based on the first report by Kloss et al (PMID: 22815627).  \n\n*FOXD3* is shown to be expressed in the periocular mesenchyme (PMID: 32528955). The function of **FOXD3** is not clearly understood, but animal studies suggest a role in neural crest specification, migration and survival (PMID: 16499899). Zebrafish studies show that **foxd3**-positive cell population that migrates into the anterior segment in the late embryonic and early larval stages (PMID: 33182738). *Foxd3* knock out in mice result in embryonic lethality (PMID: 12381664).  \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between **FOXD3** and autosomal dominant aniridia has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role **FOXD3** plays in aniridia. \nVariants in FOXD3 have been reported in individuals with aniridia/anterior segment dysgenesis/Peters anomaly in one publication; however, no functional evidence is reported. In addition, the variants are reported at high population frequencies in gnomAD. Animal models and other experimental studies do not provide additional supporting evidence for this gene-disease relationship and therefore, this relationship is disputed.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d4b3b44d-26d8-4519-9d0d-2259022e79c6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
