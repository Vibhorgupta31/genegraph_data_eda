The incidence of HSCR is 1 in 5,000 live births. Mutations in the RET gene, which codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, and in EDNRB which codes for the endothelin-B receptor, have been shown to be associated with HSCR in humans. The lethal-spotted mouse which has pigment abnormalities, but also colonic aganglionosis, carries a mutation in the gene coding for endothelin 3 (Edn3), the ligand for the receptor protein encoded by EDNRB. Here, we describe a mutation of the human gene for endothelin 3 (EDN3), homozygously present in a patient with a combined Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2) and HSCR phenotype (Shah-Waardenburg syndrome). The mutation, Cys159Phe, in exon 3 in the ET-3 like domain of EDN3, presumably affects the proteolytic processing of the preproendothelin to the mature peptide EDN3. The patient's parents were first cousins. A previous child in this family had been diagnosed with a similar combination of HSCR, depigmentation and deafness. Depigmentation and deafness were present in other relatives. Moreover, we present a further indication for the involvement of EDNRB in HSCR by reporting a novel mutation detected in one of 40 unselected HSCR patients.","dc:creator":"Hofstra RM","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"A homozygous mutation in the endothelin-3 gene associated with a combined Waardenburg type 2 and Hirschsprung phenotype (Shah-Waardenburg syndrome)."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband IV.3 "},{"id":"cggv:cb4c54f3-71a6-4482-a7bf-271df00d6e6b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb4c54f3-71a6-4482-a7bf-271df00d6e6b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:758d9f8a-ebbb-4b5a-aa29-4139ac31082a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:758d9f8a-ebbb-4b5a-aa29-4139ac31082a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":24,"allele":{"id":"cggv:324534c5-73e9-46d7-b585-4e5630b1b542","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_207034.3(EDN3):c.332G>T (p.Cys111Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16044061"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"bilateral heterochromia iridis ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002211","obo:HP_0002290","obo:HP_0007441","obo:HP_0011286","obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0000431"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c11dcd98-d84b-4f3d-97f6-990fc81a7a93_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:324534c5-73e9-46d7-b585-4e5630b1b542"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30394532","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities.

To refine the nosology of WS, we studied patients with typical WS4 (including Hirschsprung disease) or with WS and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. We found three SOX10 mutations, one EDNRB and one EDN3 mutations in patients presenting with the classical form of WS4, and two SOX10 mutations in patients displaying chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and WS features.

The etiology of the hearing loss is speculated to have a major influence of CI outcomes, particularly in cases resulting from mutations in genes preferentially expressed in the spiral ganglion region. To elucidate precise gene expression levels in each part of the cochlea, we performed laser-capture micro dissection in combination with next-generation sequencing analysis and determined the expression levels of all known deafness-associated genes in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, lateral wall, and spiral limbs. The results were generally consistent with previous reports based on immunocytochemistry or in situ hybridization. As a notable result, the genes associated with many kinds of syndromic hearing loss (such as Clpp, Hars2, Hsd17b4, Lars2 for Perrault syndrome, Polr1c and Polr1d for Treacher Collins syndrome, Ndp for Norrie Disease, Kal for Kallmann syndrome, Edn3 and Snai2 for Waardenburg Syndrome, Col4a3 for Alport syndrome, Sema3e for CHARGE syndrome, Col9a1 for Sticker syndrome, Cdh23, Cib2, Clrn1, Pcdh15, Ush1c, Ush2a, Whrn for Usher syndrome and Wfs1 for Wolfram syndrome) showed higher levels of expression in the spiral ganglion than in other parts of the cochlea.

The trait segregated as a semidominant bellyspot with reduced penetrance. Homozygous mutant mice showed preweaning lethality, and exhibited white spotting over the majority of the body surface, with pigmented patches remaining around the pinnae, eyes and tail. Linkage analysis localized 114-CH19 on mouse chromosome 2, suggesting endothelin 3 (Edn3) as a candidate gene. Sequence analysis of Edn3 identified a G > A transversion that encodes an arginine to histidine substitution (R96H). This mutation is predicted to disrupt furin-mediated proteolytic cleavage of pro-endothelin that is necessary to form biologically active EDN3. This mutation is novel among human and mouse EDN3 mutants, is the first reported EDN3 ENU mutant, and is the second reported EDN3 point mutation. This study demonstrates the power of using ENU mutagenesis screens to generate new animal models of human disease, and expands the spectrum of EDN3 mutant alleles.","dc:creator":"Matera I","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"A mouse model of Waardenburg syndrome type IV resulting from an ENU-induced mutation in endothelin 3."},"rdfs:label":"Matera Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d128e783-96ea-4128-9593-fdf580e7c5c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbeeffd8-a642-4609-ab5c-99b566af9369","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Heterozygous mice were phenotypically normal.

We report that a targeted disruption of the mouse endothelin-3 ligand (EDN3) gene produces a similar recessive phenotype of megacolon and coat color spotting. A natural recessive mutation that results in the same developmental defects in mice, lethal spotting (ls), failed to complement the targeted EDN3 allele. The ls mice carry a point mutation of the EDN3 gene, which replaces the Arg residue at the C-terminus of the inactive intermediate big EDN3 with a Trp residue. This mutation prevents the proteolytic activation of big EDN3 by ECE-1. These findings indicate that interaction of EDN3 with the endothelin-B receptor is essential in the development of neural crest-derived cell lineages.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 7 variants (missense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. EDN3 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1996 (Edery et al.). Association is seen in at least 8 probands in 8 publications (8630502, 19764030, 22876130, 20583152, 30394532, 33713422, 8630503, 12189494). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in one additional family member. This gene-disease association is supported by two mouse models with homozygous missense EDN3 variants, which display white spotting, aganglionic megacolon, and early death. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 5/8/2018. It was reevaluated on 5/17/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. However additional genetic evidence has been included and scoring adjusted to the current Gene Clinical Validity SOP Version 9. The new genetic evidence included these publications (PMID: 20583152, 30394532, 33713422, 8630503, 12189494) and an additional proband was identified in Moghadam et al 2020 and scored 1.1 (http://repozytorium.ur.edu.pl/handle/item/5791). As the paper did not have a pubmed ID the relevant information was entered under non-scorable evidence. Therefore, the actual score for genetic evidence is 3.9 (including the score from Moghadam et al 2020 (1.1) and score for consanguineous probands (-0.4)). The final total points are 8.4 (MODERATE).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7f88c34c-a093-4fc8-b84a-49c7d2dd327f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
