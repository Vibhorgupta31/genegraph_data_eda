In this study, we find that distinct expression patterns of those deafness genes in the cochlea of a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We examined 20 genes whose expression in the cochlea has already been reported. The deafness genes GJB3, CRYM, GRHL2, DFNA5, and ATP6B1 were expressed in marmoset cochleae in patterns different from those in mouse cochleae. Of note, all those genes are causative for progressive hearing loss in humans, but not in mice. The other tested genes, including the deafness gene COCH, in which mutation recapitulates deafness in mice, were expressed in a similar manner in both species. The result suggests that the discrepancy in the expression between rodents and primates may account for the phenotypic difference.

The progressive dominant hearing loss DFNA28 in human is associated with a frameshift mutation of Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) but its etiology and mechanism remain unknown. Here we report a zebrafish grhl2b(T086) mutant line in which grhl2b expression is interrupted by an insertion of a Tol2 transposon element. The mutants exhibit enlarged otocysts, smaller or eliminated otoliths, malformed semicircular canals, insensitiveness to sound stimulation and imbalanced swimming motion. Since grainyhead-like family members can regulate epithelial adhesion, we examined the expression of some genes encoding junction proteins in mutants. We show that the expression of claudin b (cldnb) and epcam is abolished or dramatically reduced and apical junctional complexes are abnormal in otic epithelial cells of mutant embryos. Co-injection of cldnb and epcam mRNA could largely rescue the mutant phenotype. Injection of human wild-type GRHL2 mRNA but not the mutant GRHL2 mRNA derived from DFNA28 patients into grhl2b(T086) mutant embryos could rescue the inner-ear defects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Grhl2b directly binds to the enhancers and promotes the expression of cldnb and epcam.
