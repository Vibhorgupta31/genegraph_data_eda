Male patients with the X-linked form of OS, caused by loss-of-function mutations in the MID1 gene, show high variability of the clinical signs. MID1 encodes a ubiquitin ligase that controls phosphatase 2A, but its role in the pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. Here, we report a mouse line carrying a nonfunctional ortholog of the human MID1 gene, Mid1. Mid1-null mice show the brain anatomical defect observed in patients (i.e., hypoplasia of the anterior portion of the medial cerebellum, the vermis). We found that the presence of this defect correlates with motor coordination and procedural and nonassociative learning impairments. The defect is limited to the most anterior lobes of the vermis, the region of the developing cerebellum adjacent to the dorsal midbrain. Analyses at midgestation reveal that lack of Mid1 causes the shortening of the posterior dorsal midbrain, the rostralization of the midbrain/cerebellum boundary, and the downregulation of a key player in the development of this region, Fgf17. Thus, lack of Mid1 causes a misspecification of the midbrain/cerebellar boundary that results in an abnormal development of the most anterior cerebellar lobes. This animal model provides a tool for additional in vivo studies of the physiological and pathological role of the Mid1 gene and a system to investigate the development and function of anterior cerebellar domains.","dc:creator":"Lancioni A","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Lack of Mid1, the mouse ortholog of the Opitz syndrome gene, causes abnormal development of the anterior cerebellar vermis."},"rdfs:label":"brain anatomical defect and impaired learning"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"I downgraded the score because the paper did not address other missing human phenotypes, including craniofacial defects, urinary tract abnormalities, and congenital heart defects."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3621,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0aa7fb1c-bc7d-4d5c-995e-a6cdd0b444f8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010222","gene":"hgnc:7095","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"MID1 was first reported in relation to X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome in 1997 (Quaderi et al. PMID: 9354791). Opitz G/BBB syndrome is a congenital midline malformation syndrome characterized by hypertelorism, hypospadias, laryngotracheoesophageal defects, cleft lip/palate, congenital heart defects, and midline defects of the brain, including agenesis of the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis agenesis or hypoplasia. Intellectual disability/developmental delay (ID/DD) are observed in about 15%-50% of affected males. A review of the clinical phenotypes of 85 affected males with MID1 variants showed that about one-third have ID/DD (PMID: 26788540). Among the 16 cases of genetic evidence curated here, 6 have ID/DD, 7 do not have ID/DD, and 3 have no information. Female patients usually present with isolated hypertelorism. The disease mechanism is loss of function. In summary, MID1 is definitively associated with X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 21, 2018 (SOP version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b2471967-d6b3-4ffb-a9fd-e3dbd089cb20"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
