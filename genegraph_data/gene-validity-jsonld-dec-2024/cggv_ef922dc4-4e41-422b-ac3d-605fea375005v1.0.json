The differences in isoform expression between normal and failing myocardium led us to examine the ontogenic expression of TnT in human striated muscle. Left ventricular samples were obtained from patients with severe heart failure undergoing cardiac transplantation and normal adult organ donors. Fetal muscle was obtained from aborted fetuses after 14-15 weeks of gestation, and adult skeletal muscle was obtained from surgical biopsies. Western blots of normal and failing adult heart proteins demonstrated that two isoforms, TnT1 and TnT2, are expressed in different amounts, with TnT2 being significantly greater in failing hearts (p less than 0.004). Western blots of two-dimensional gels of these proteins resolved two predominant spots of both TnT1 and TnT2 and several minor TnT species. Alkaline phosphatase treatment converted the two major spots of each isoform into the single more basic spots. A comparison of the ATPase activities and the TnT2 percentage of total TnT in individual failing and normal adult hearts demonstrated an inverse and negative relation (r = 0.7, p less than 0.02). In the fetal heart, four TnT isoforms were found, two of which had the same electrophoretic mobilities as the adult cardiac isoforms TnT1 and TnT2. Fetal skeletal muscle expressed two of the four fetal cardiac TnT isoforms, one of which comigrated with adult cardiac TnT1. These cardiac isoforms were expressed in low abundance in fetal skeletal muscle relative to seven fast skeletal muscle TnT isoforms. No cardiac isoforms were present in adult skeletal muscle. Because many etiologies caused heart failure in the transplant patients, we propose that the disease-associated increased expression of the TnT isoform TnT2 is an adaptation to the heart failure state and a partial recapitulation of the fetal expression of cardiac TnT isoforms.","dc:creator":"Anderson PA","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Troponin T isoform expression in humans.

We tested the hypothesis that the mutant TnT proteins would be expressed and incorporated into the cardiac sarcomere and would behave as dominant-negative proteins to directly alter calcium-activated force generation at the level of the single cardiac myocyte. Interestingly, under identical experimental conditions, the ectopic expression of the mutant TnTs was significantly less ( approximately 8% of total) than that obtained with expression of wild-type TnT ( approximately 35%) in the myocytes. Confocal imaging of immunolabeled TnT showed a regular periodic pattern of localization of ectopic mutant TnT that was not different than that in normal controls, suggesting that mutant TnT incorporation had no deleterious effects on sarcomeric architecture. Direct measurements of isometric force production in single cardiac myocytes demonstrated marked desensitization of submaximal calcium-activated tension, with unchanged maximum tension generation in mutant TnT-expressing myocytes compared with control myocytes. Collectively, these results demonstrate an impaired expression of the mutant protein and a disabling of cardiac contraction in the submaximal range of myoplasmic calcium concentrations.

The TNNT2 gene has been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. TNNT2 was first associated with the disease in humans in 1994 (Thierfelder et al, 1994, PMID 8205619; Watkins et al, 1993, PMID 7981753; Watkins et al, 1995, PMID 7898523). Many unique variants, with varying levels of evidence to support their pathogenicity, have been reported in humans, as variants in TNNT2 account for ~5% of HCM cases (Cirino and Ho, 2014, PMID 20301725). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 3 families (Thierfelder et al, 1994, PMID8205619). The mechanism for disease is likely dominant negative, as most mutations reported are missense variants. The gene-disease association is supported by the function of the gene product, animal models, and in vitro assays. In summary, TNNT2 is definitively associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 7th, 2017 using SOP version 5. This gene-disease relationship was updated and recurated on February 4, 2021.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ef922dc4-4e41-422b-ac3d-605fea375005"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
