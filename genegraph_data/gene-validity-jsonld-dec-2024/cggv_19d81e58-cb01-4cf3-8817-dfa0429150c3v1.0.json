MCPH is genetically heterogeneous with six known loci: MCPH1-MCPH6. We report mapping of a novel locus, MCPH7, to chromosome 1p32.3-p33 between markers D1S2797 and D1S417, corresponding to a physical distance of 8.39 Mb. Heterogeneity analysis of 24 families previously excluded from linkage to the six known MCPH loci suggested linkage of five families (20.83%) to the MCPH7 locus. In addition, four families were excluded from linkage to the MCPH7 locus as well as all of the six previously known loci, whereas the remaining 15 families could not be conclusively excluded or included. The combined maximum two-point LOD score for the linked families was 5.96 at marker D1S386 at theta = 0.0. The combined multipoint LOD score was 6.97 between markers D1S2797 and D1S417. Previously, mutations in four genes, MCPH1, CDK5RAP2, ASPM, and CENPJ, that code for centrosomal proteins have been shown to cause this disorder. Three different homozygous mutations in STIL, which codes for a pericentriolar and centrosomal protein, were identified in patients from three of the five families linked to the MCPH7 locus; all are predicted to truncate the STIL protein. Further, another recently ascertained family was homozygous for the same mutation as one of the original families. There was no evidence for a common haplotype. These results suggest that the centrosome and its associated structures are important in the control of neurogenesis in the developing human brain.","dc:creator":"Kumar A","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in STIL, encoding a pericentriolar and centrosomal protein, cause primary microcephaly."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:19d81e58-cb01-4cf3-8817-dfa0429150c3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:19d81e58-cb01-4cf3-8817-dfa0429150c3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fdd2bce4-9b98-491b-a9a8-217dc382a798","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:836cc62a-5b5a-4e6d-a2a2-41e82d784e34","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"None of the cells examined from E8.5 and E9.5 STIL-/- embryos contained centrioles or primary cilia; introduction of exogenous STIL induces de novo formation of centrioles and primary cilia; introduction of STIL carrying observed pathogenic mutations allowed partial rescue (fewer than those seen with WT STIL)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25486474","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Although most animal cells contain centrosomes, consisting of a pair of centrioles, their precise contribution to cell division and embryonic development is unclear. Genetic ablation of STIL, an essential component of the centriole replication machinery in mammalian cells, causes embryonic lethality in mice around mid gestation associated with defective Hedgehog signaling. Here, we describe, by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, that STIL(-/-) mouse embryos do not contain centrioles or primary cilia, suggesting that these organelles are not essential for mammalian development until mid gestation. We further show that the lack of primary cilia explains the absence of Hedgehog signaling in STIL(-/-) cells. Exogenous re-expression of STIL or STIL microcephaly mutants compatible with human survival, induced non-templated, de novo generation of centrioles in STIL(-/-) cells. Thus, while the abscence of centrioles is compatible with mammalian gastrulation, lack of centrioles and primary cilia impairs Hedgehog signaling and further embryonic development.","dc:creator":"David A","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Lack of centrioles and primary cilia in STIL(-/-) mouse embryos."},"rdfs:label":"centriole disruption in STIL -/- mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:19d81e58-cb01-4cf3-8817-dfa0429150c3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:26dfb660-57dc-4063-bde4-ba90f724b0d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2698208-6888-4325-8762-b34b587f436b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"STIL -/- mice are embryonic lethal (d11), and show axial midline defects including failure of neural-tube closure and a lack of any midline separation at the anterior end of the cranial neural folds, similar to midline defects seen in some reported STIL biallelic mutation carriers.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10385121","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The establishment of the main body axis and the determination of left-right asymmetry are fundamental aspects of vertebrate embryonic development.

Heterozygous mutations in 14 genes have been identified in HPE patients that account for only 30% of HPE cases, suggesting the existence of other HPE genes. Data from homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in a consanguineous Turkish family were combined to identify a homozygous missense mutation (c.2150G>A; p.Gly717Glu) in STIL, common to the two affected children. STIL has a role in centriole formation and has previously been described in rare cases of microcephaly. Rescue experiments in U2OS cells showed that the STIL p.Gly717Glu mutation was not able to fully restore the centriole duplication failure following depletion of endogenous STIL protein indicating the deleterious role of the mutation. In situ hybridization experiments using chick embryos demonstrated that expression of Stil was in accordance with a function during early patterning of the forebrain. It is only the second time that a STIL homozygous mutation causing a recessive form of HPE was reported. This result also supports the genetic heterogeneity of HPE and increases the panel of genes to be tested for HPE diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Mouden C","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Homozygous STIL mutation causes holoprosencephaly and microcephaly in two siblings."}},"rdfs:label":"Mouden_family II-3"},{"id":"cggv:018b4c4c-b76b-4b8d-809b-b8d985d760c3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:018b4c4c-b76b-4b8d-809b-b8d985d760c3_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:018b4c4c-b76b-4b8d-809b-b8d985d760c3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Cell culture rescue experiments in showed that this variant was not able to fully restore the centriole duplication failure following depletion of endogenous STIL protein."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:00f86f6b-28b4-4571-8061-adcb698b1a4d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00f86f6b-28b4-4571-8061-adcb698b1a4d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":19,"allele":{"id":"cggv:43f2d359-4985-4302-8278-ee1ce7e8ddb7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001048166.1(STIL):c.2829+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341243"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001256","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"karyotype","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:92f2e217-85b3-4e44-98ed-b715592f5cc9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:43f2d359-4985-4302-8278-ee1ce7e8ddb7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19215732"},"rdfs:label":"Kumar_IIS-3 IV-1"},{"id":"cggv:92f2e217-85b3-4e44-98ed-b715592f5cc9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92f2e217-85b3-4e44-98ed-b715592f5cc9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:658f424c-405f-483c-8de0-9eb202eaae7f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:658f424c-405f-483c-8de0-9eb202eaae7f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":20,"allele":{"id":"cggv:306a1545-4a3c-4d95-bdad-9d49f4184a42","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001048166.1(STIL):c.453+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA277853"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0006870","obo:HP_0011451","obo:HP_0200012"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"karyotype","secondTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:5929d030-dd9d-46f2-b2f3-de227c12b066_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:306a1545-4a3c-4d95-bdad-9d49f4184a42"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25218063","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Holoprosencephaly is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous midline brain malformation associated with neurologic manifestations including developmental delay, intellectual disability and seizures.

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly in 2009 (Kumar et al., PMID: 19215732). Thirteen variants (5 missense, 2 splice-disrupting, 2 frameshifts, and 4 premature termination codons in the last exon) that have been reported in twelve probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 19215732, 22989186, 24986681, 25218063, 25658757, 29230157, 30214071, 32677750) are included in this curation. Ten of these twelve probands were homozygous variant carriers in consanguineous families, many of which had more than one affected homozygote. Six individuals from four families in which brain imaging had been performed had a variety of brain malformations, including several cases consistent with holoprosencephaly (PMID 24986681, 25218063, 25658757, 29230157). The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown; although an AR condition, a lack of true LoF homozygotes suggest the possibility of lethality for complete absence of gene product. This gene-disease association is also supported by a STIL -/- mouse model, which shows axial midline defects and embryonic lethality (PMID 10385121). Functional studies show STIL-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts lack centrioles and primary cilia and are rescued by introduction of exogenous STIL; introduction of STIL carrying observed human mutations allowed partial rescue (PMID 25486474). In summary, STIL is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations gene curation expert panel on 28.Mar.2023.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:19d81e58-cb01-4cf3-8817-dfa0429150c3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
