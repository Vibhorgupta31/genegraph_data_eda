PMID: 34333030). At least 13 variants (e.g. missense, splice acceptor, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes only case-level data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 1 publication (PMID: 34333030). Additionally, there are families described in the literature with no segregation of RBM20 variants with HCM phenotype; these publications were not scored. There are no publications showing a clear segregation of RBM20 variants with HCM in family members. The mechanism for disease is unknown. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 26, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
