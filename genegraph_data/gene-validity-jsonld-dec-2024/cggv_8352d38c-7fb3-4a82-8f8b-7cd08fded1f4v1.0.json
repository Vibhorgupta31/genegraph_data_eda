Cells from both parents and an unaffected child exhibited normal post-ultraviolet-C survival and normal DNA repair. Sequencing the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C cDNA of XP12TA and XP25TA revealed a homozygous deletion of two bases (del AT 669-670) in exon 5 with a new termination site 10 codons downstream that is expected to encode a truncated xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C protein. Sequence analysis of the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C cDNA in cells from the parents found identical heterozygous mutations: one allele carries both the exon 5 frameshift and an exon 15 polymorphism and the other allele carries neither alteration. Cells from the unaffected brother had two normal xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C alleles.
