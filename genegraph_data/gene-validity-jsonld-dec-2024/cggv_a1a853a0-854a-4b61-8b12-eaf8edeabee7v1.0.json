Mutations in 1 of the 15 known NPHP genes explain less than half of all cases with this phenotype, however, and the recently identified genetic causes are exceedingly rare. As a result, a strategy to identify single-gene causes of NPHP-related ciliopathies in single affected families is needed. Although whole-exome resequencing facilitates the identification of disease genes, the large number of detected genetic variants hampers its use. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining homozygosity mapping with whole-exome resequencing in a sibling pair with an NPHP-related ciliopathy. Whole-exome capture revealed a homozygous splice acceptor site mutation (c.698G>T) in the renal Mg(2+) transporter SLC41A1. This mutation resulted in skipping of exon 6 of SLC41A1, resulting in an in-frame deletion of a transmembrane helix. Transfection of cells with wild-type or mutant SLC41A1 revealed that deletion of exon 6 completely blocks the Mg(2+) transport function of SLC41A1. Furthermore, in normal human kidney tissue, endogenous SLC41A1 specifically localized to renal tubules situated at the corticomedullary boundary, consistent with the region of cystogenesis observed in NPHP and related ciliopathies. Last, morpholino-mediated knockdown of slc41a1 expression in zebrafish resulted in ventral body curvature, hydrocephalus, and cystic kidneys, similar to the effects of knocking down other NPHP genes. Taken together, these data suggest that defects in the maintenance of renal Mg(2+) homeostasis may lead to tubular defects that result in a phenotype similar to NPHP.","dc:creator":"Hurd TW","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutation of the Mg2+ transporter SLC41A1 results in a nephronophthisis-like phenotype."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1a853a0-854a-4b61-8b12-eaf8edeabee7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1a853a0-854a-4b61-8b12-eaf8edeabee7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55c6ca80-93ed-4f5a-9b81-b6dfd2b04b15","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e701717-8ae6-4412-b221-5416235b7f7e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunohistochemical analysis of SLC41A1 expression on normal human kidney sections revealed expression primarily in the distal convoluted tubules (DCTs) and in the tubule adjacent to the macula densa.

In addition, respiratory symptoms and bronchiectasis have been reported in the 2 patients. At the time of this curation, there were no other single-gene disorders associated with this gene (other than ?Nephronophthisis-like nephropathy 2 (OMIM:619468)). Therefore, this assessment is based on this disease entity only and has been curated for *SLC41A1*-kidney disorder (MONDO:0005240). Only 1 single nucleotide variant that has been reported in homozygosity in 2 affected individuals from 1 consanguineous family in 1 publication (PMID: 23661805) is included in this curation. This acceptor splice site variant (c.698G>T) in *SLC41A1* has been shown to lead to skipping of exon 6 and an in-frame deletion of a transmembrane helix, with reduced protein expression and functional consequences. No other patients affected with *SLC41A1*-kidney disorder have been reported since 2013. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown as there is no described link between the function of SLC41A1 (magnesium transport) and the development of nephronophthisis. This gene-disease association is supported by limited experimental evidence including human kidney expression data and a morpholino-induced knockdown zebrafish model presenting with features compatible with a primary ciliopathy (PMID: 23661805). Of note, another study investigating morpholino-induced knockdown of *slc41a1* in zebrafish did not replicate the phenotypic features (PMID: 30417250). It is also noteworthy, that the 2 patients described with biallelic *SLC41A1* variants did not present with altered magnesium homeostasis and that a first cousin shared some clinical features (bronchiectasis) but was heterozygous for the family mutation (PMID: 23661805). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship that has not been replicated since 2013. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing human evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
