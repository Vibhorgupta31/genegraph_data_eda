In aggregate, ∼4% of ASD patients carry a DN mutation in one of just 29 autism risk genes. The most prevalent gene for recurrent DN mutations is SCN2A (1.1% of patients) followed by CHD8, DSCAM, MECP2, POGZ, WDFY3 and ASH1L. We identify novel DN LGD recurrences (GIGYF2, MYT1L, CUL3, DOCK8 and ZNF292) and DN mutations in previous ASD candidates (ARHGAP32, NCOR1, PHIP, STXBP1, CDKL5 and SHANK1).

We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function.

To identify further genetic risk factors, here we assess the role of de novo mutations in ASD by sequencing the exomes of ASD cases and their parents (n = 175 trios). Fewer than half of the cases (46.3%) carry a missense or nonsense de novo variant, and the overall rate of mutation is only modestly higher than the expected rate. In contrast, the proteins encoded by genes that harboured de novo missense or nonsense mutations showed a higher degree of connectivity among themselves and to previous ASD genes as indexed by protein-protein interaction screens. The small increase in the rate of de novo events, when taken together with the protein interaction results, are consistent with an important but limited role for de novo point mutations in ASD, similar to that documented for de novo copy number variants. Genetic models incorporating these data indicate that most of the observed de novo events are unconnected to ASD; those that do confer risk are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant (that is, not necessarily sufficient for disease). Our results support polygenic models in which spontaneous coding mutations in any of a large number of genes increases risk by 5- to 20-fold. Despite the challenge posed by such models, results from de novo events and a large parallel case-control study provide strong evidence in favour of CHD8 and KATNAL2 as genuine autism risk factors.","dc:creator":"Neale BM","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Patterns and rates of exonic de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorders."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22495311","rdfs:label":"Case 09C98975"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:66bfc099-5dfd-4273-9c00-5cc3cd2c559d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b532f54d-451d-40ce-be27-a2e5f69dc713","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":17,"detectionMethod":"Trio-WES and Quad-NGS which detected a variant in ZNF292.

At 3 1/2 he was capable of only simple single word requests or scripted phrases such as \"I want …\". He could occasionally produce sentences as complex as \"Daddy, I want more cat cookies please.\" From 3 1/2 on he started losing language and is now completely nonverbal. He is able to use an AAC device for a limited range of mostly food items requests. We've also seen his fine motor control decline though his gross motor abilities are continuing to show some progress. He is very sensory oriented and extremely hyperactive with a substantial loss of executive function. He has significant sleep problems waking in the middle of the night with out returning to sleep on as many as 5 nights per week. He has GERD which may play a role in sleep issues, but we have not been able to correlate night waking with an particular food. Feeding is not a problem and after early struggles with frequent loose stools he is now fairly regular. He was early on diagnosed with strabismus, but that has resolved.

Over 20 unique de novo truncating variants have been reported in over 30 probands (PMIDs 23033978, 22495311, 28135719, 31723249). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship is derived from case-level data. Individuals with ZNF292 truncating variants present with neurodevelopmental phenotypes (including intellectual disability/developmental delay, speech delays and autism spectrum disorder) and minor dysmorphic features. Although most reported variants are de novo, one ZNF292 truncating variant was inherited from an affected mother with mild ID (PMID 31723249). In addition, three affected siblings inherited a ZNF292 truncating variant from a reportedly unaffected father, suggesting reduced penetrance (PMID 31723249). ZNF292 is highly intolerant to truncating variants (pLI = 1 in gnomAD). Currently, there are no experimental data delineating the disease mechanism. Most reported variants are located in the last exon, which encodes for a DNA binding domain; these variants are predicted to escape nonsense-mediated decay, leading to the expression of a truncated protein with potential dominant-negative or gain-of function effects (PMID 31723249). However, the possibility of loss of function cannot be ruled out, and functional studies will be necessary to determine the molecular mechanism of pathogenicity. Reports of a large number of independent probands ascertained from various geographic locations with de novo truncating ZNF292 variants and consistent neurodevelopmental phenotypes provided convincing evidence of the gene-disease relationship. In summary, there is sufficient evidence to support a definitive gene-disease relationship between ZNF292 and complex neurodevelopmental disorders. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 05/06/20 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dba438b7-23f9-4c15-a8aa-f70431a193e2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
