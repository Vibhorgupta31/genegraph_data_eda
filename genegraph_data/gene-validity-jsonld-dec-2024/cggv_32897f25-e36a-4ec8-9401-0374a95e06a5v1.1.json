The smallest region of overlap for deletions at 2p25.3 contains PXDN and MYT1L. MYT1L is expressed only within the brain in humans. We hypothesized that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in MYT1L would cause a phenotype resembling deletion at 2p25.3. To examine this we sought MYT1L SNVs in exome sequencing data from 4, 296 parent-child trios. Further variants were identified through a genematcher-facilitated collaboration. We report 9 patients with MYT1L SNVs (4 loss of function and 5 missense). The phenotype of SNV carriers overlapped with that of 2p25.3 deletion carriers. To identify the transcriptomic consequences of MYT1L loss of function we used CRISPR-Cas9 to create a knockout cell line. Gene Ontology analysis in knockout cells demonstrated altered expression of genes that regulate gene expression and that are localized to the nucleus. These differentially expressed genes were enriched for OMIM disease ontology terms \"mental retardation\". To study the developmental effects of MYT1L loss of function we created a zebrafish knockdown using morpholinos. Knockdown zebrafish manifested loss of oxytocin expression in the preoptic neuroendocrine area. This study demonstrates that MYT1L variants are associated with syndromic obesity in humans. The mechanism is related to dysregulated expression of neurodevelopmental genes and altered development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus.","dc:creator":"Blanchet P","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"MYT1L mutations cause intellectual disability and variable obesity by dysregulating gene expression and development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28859103","rdfs:label":"Patient 7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"CGH demonstrated a 20p12 duplication, inherited from her phenotypically normal father.

In reprogramming, the same factors are often used to reprogram many different donor cell types. As most developmental repressors, such as RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and Groucho (also known as TLE), are considered lineage-specific repressors, it remains unclear how identical combinations of transcription factors can silence so many different donor programs. Distinct lineage repressors would have to be induced in different donor cell types. Here, by studying the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to neurons, we found that the pan neuron-specific transcription factor Myt1-like (Myt1l) exerts its pro-neuronal function by direct repression of many different somatic lineage programs except the neuronal program. The repressive function of Myt1l is mediated via recruitment of a complex containing Sin3b by binding to a previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain. In agreement with its repressive function, the genomic binding sites of Myt1l are similar in neurons and fibroblasts and are preferentially in an open chromatin configuration. The Notch signalling pathway is repressed by Myt1l through silencing of several members, including Hes1. Acute knockdown of Myt1l in the developing mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting that Myt1l allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal development. Depletion of Myt1l in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function, indicating that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. It is now tempting to speculate that similar 'many-but-one' lineage repressors exist for other cell fates; such repressors, in combination with lineage-specific activators, would be prime candidates for use in reprogramming additional cell types.","dc:creator":"Mall M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Myt1l safeguards neuronal identity by actively repressing many non-neuronal fates."},"rdfs:label":"Myt1l safeguards neuronal identity by actively repressing ma"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2939,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4be69cb8-99ca-4793-9774-32e7b1d1c19c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0000508","gene":"hgnc:7623","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"Variants in the MYT1L gene were first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Intellectual disability in 2007 (de Ligt et al., PMID: 23033978), and the authors reported one de novo splice site variant.

Individuals showed variable clinical features such as hyperphagia, facial dysmorphism, and hypotonia. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nCase level data: \nMYT1L variants have been reported in at least ten probands in four publications (PMIDs: 23033978, 25232846, 28859103, 30055078).

Mall et al. 2017 (PMID: 28379941) showed that acute knockdown of Myt1l in the mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, predicting that the gene allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal development. Also, Myt1l depletion in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function. This indicated that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. Shi et al. 2018 (PMID: 29397565) investigated Myt1l expression in rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Overexpression of Myt1L promoted, while Myt1l knockdown inhibited OPC differentiation. Moreover, Myt1L was potently involved in promoting remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination in vivo. ChIP assays showed that Myt1L bound to the promoter of Olig1 and transcriptionally regulated its expression. \n\nIn summary, MYT1L is definitively associated with autosomal dominant intellectual disability, and there is an abundance of evidence to support this association.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:32897f25-e36a-4ec8-9401-0374a95e06a5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
