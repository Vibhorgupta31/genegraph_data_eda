Using whole-exome and candidate-gene Sanger resequencing in PCD-affected families afflicted with combined IDA and ODA defects, we found that 6/38 (16%) carried biallelic mutations in the conserved zinc-finger gene BLU (ZMYND10). ZMYND10 mutations conferred dynein-arm loss seen at the ultrastructural and immunofluorescence level and complete cilia immotility, except in hypomorphic p.Val16Gly (c.47T>G) homozygote individuals, whose cilia retained a stiff and slowed beat. In mice, Zmynd10 mRNA is restricted to regions containing motile cilia. In a Drosophila model of PCD, Zmynd10 is exclusively expressed in cells with motile cilia: chordotonal sensory neurons and sperm. In these cells, P-element-mediated gene silencing caused IDA and ODA defects, proprioception deficits, and sterility due to immotile sperm. Drosophila Zmynd10 with an equivalent c.47T>G (p.Val16Gly) missense change rescued mutant male sterility less than the wild-type did. Tagged Drosophila ZMYND10 is localized primarily to the cytoplasm, and human ZMYND10 interacts with LRRC6, another cytoplasmically localized protein altered in PCD. Using a fly model of PCD, we conclude that ZMYND10 is a cytoplasmic protein required for IDA and ODA assembly and that its variants cause ciliary dysmotility and PCD with laterality defects.","dc:creator":"Moore DJ","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in ZMYND10, a gene essential for proper axonemal assembly of inner and outer dynein arms in humans and flies, cause primary ciliary dyskinesia."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23891469","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Defects of motile cilia cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), characterized by recurrent respiratory infections and male infertility.

We show that ZMYND10 and LRRC6 interact and that certain ZMYND10 and LRRC6 mutations abrogate the interaction between the LRRC6 CS domain and the ZMYND10 C-terminal domain. Additionally, ZMYND10 and LRRC6 colocalize with the centriole markers SAS6 and PCM1. Mutations in ZMYND10 result in the absence of the axonemal protein components DNAH5 and DNALI1 from respiratory cilia. Animal models support the association between ZMYND10 and human PCD, given that zmynd10 knockdown in zebrafish caused ciliary paralysis leading to cystic kidneys and otolith defects and that knockdown in Xenopus interfered with ciliogenesis.

Motility defects in cilia and flagella lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare human disease. Recently zinc finger MYND-type containing 10 (ZMYND10) was identified in humans as a PCD-associated gene. In this study, we use medaka fish as a model to characterize the precise functions of zmynd10. In medaka, zmynd10 is exclusively expressed in cells with motile cilia. Embryos with zmynd10 Morpholino knockdown exhibited a left-right (LR) defect associated with loss of motility in Kupffer's vesicle (KV) cilia. This immotility was caused by loss of the outer dynein arms, which is a characteristic ultrastructural phenotype in PCD. In addition, KV cilia in zmynd10 knockdown embryos had a swollen and wavy morphology. Together, these results suggest that zmynd10 is a multi-functional protein that has independent roles in axonemal localization of dynein arms and in formation and/or maintenance of cilia. The C-terminal region of zmynd10 has a MYND-type zinc finger domain (zf-MYND) that is important for its function. Our rescue experiment showed that the zmynd10-ΔC truncated protein, which lacks zf-MYND, was still partially functional, suggesting that zmynd10 has another functional domain besides zf-MYND. To analyze the later stages of development, we generated a zmynd10 knockout mutant using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology.

The diagnosis can be confirmed with ciliary ultrastructure analysis and/or molecular genetic testing of 32 PCD-associated genes.

The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 22 (MONDO:0014192, OMIM #615444), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias (PCD) distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Affected patients can have onset of symptoms at birth and reported cases have been diagnosed with PCD either in infancy or in childhood. Frequent features among reported patients are chronic wet cough from early childhood, neonatal respiratory distress, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchiectasis, and decreased nasal nitric oxide. Approximately 50% of cases exhibit situs inversus or heterotaxy. Cilia are largely or completely immotile. Adult patients can exhibit decreased fertility. Biopsies of the airway epithelium show ciliary ultrastructure with absent or abnormal outer and inner dynein arms, although one reported case with a PCD-associated phenotype and homozygous missense variant has been found to exhibit normal ciliary ultrastructure (PMID: 23891469, and personal communication with the authors). This finding emphasizes the clear need for additional case reports to establish the full extent of outer and inner dynein arm defects in *ZMYND10*-related disease.\n\nThis curation has scored eleven suspected deleterious *ZMYND10* variants (two missense, six frameshift, and three nonsense), which were collectively reported in twelve probands in three publications (PMID: 23891471, PMID: 23891469, PMID: 26139845). All of the probands harbored biallelic variants confirmed to be present in trans. Nine probands harbored variants in the homozygous state, four of whom were reported to be from consanguineous parents. Three others probands harbored *ZMYND10* variants in the compound heterozygous state. The molecular mechanism appears to be biallelic loss-of-function with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of a gene product. More genetic evidence was available (PMID: 26824761) but was not included as the maximum for this category of evidence had already been reached. Large families with segregation data were not found for inclusion in this gene curation. Please note that the genetic evidence scored in this curation has relied heavily on the best-characterized *ZMYND10* variants from the literature, while an urgent need remains for additional published data to evaluate the pathogenicity of many other emerging variants.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence that high levels of *ZMYND10* expression in humans (PMID: 23715323) and mice (PMID: 23891471) are specific to tissues known to harbor multi-ciliated cells. *ZMYND10* expression also increases dramatically when cultured human bronchial epithelial cells are subjected to conditions that stimulate ciliogenesis (PMID: 17413031). Biochemical studies indicate that the ZMYND10 protein interacts with the chaperone molecules FKBP8 and HSP90, functioning as a required chaperone during cytoplasmic pre-assembly of dyneins (PMID: 29916806). Animal models lacking Zmynd10 exhibit destabilization of dynein arm components (PMID: 29916806). ZMYND10 also physically interacts with the protein product of the LRRC6 / DNAAF11 gene, which harbors variants known to cause another form of PCD (PMID: 23891471). *Drosophila*, zebrafish, and medaka models with biallelic silencing or deletion of the respective genes orthologous to *ZMYND10* recapitulate cellular and organ-level features of the human disease state (PMID: 23891469, PMID: 23891471, PMID: 28823919). Mouse models in particular exhibit absent outer and inner dynein arms, situs inversus totalis, mucopurulent nasal plugs, and reduced motility of cilia and sperm (PMID: 29916806). Rescue experiments have demonstrated the potential of a wild-type transgene from *Drosophila*, medaka, or mouse to rescue phenotypes of endogenous *Zmynd10* disruption in various model organisms (PMID: 28823919, PMID: 23891471). \n\nIn summary, *ZMYND10* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 22. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on February 7th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9549c727-fece-494c-9892-83c0ac05f3b4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
