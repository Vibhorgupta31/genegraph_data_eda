To date, all reported variants have been copy number changes; no individuals with presumed protein-altering single nucleotide variants in *CNTN6* and demonstrable phenotypes have been reported.\n\nThe observed copy number changes include both multigenic events (deletions and duplications involving *CNTN6* in addition to other genes), as well as deletions involving *CNTN6* alone. The multigenic events are not counted as evidence in this evaluation as the role of the other genes in the presenting phenotype cannot be excluded. Single gene and intragenic deletions reported to date have been inherited from both affected and reportedly unaffected parents. In some cases, additional copy number variants were also observed. Additionally, *CNTN6* is not constrained for loss-of-function variants (pLI = 0, gnomAD v2.1.1) and *CNTN6* variants are seen at high enough frequencies in the non-affected population that it is difficult to assess the potential pathogenicity of these variants. For these reasons, all cases have been scored at 0. Although some authors have suggested that variants in *CNTN6* could be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders with reduced penetrance, more information is needed to determine the role of *CNTN6* in disease.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between *CNTN6* and complex neurodevelopmental disorder and the final classification is disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 20, 2022 (SOP9).\n\nSingle gene and intragenic deletions reported to date have been inherited from both affected and reportedly unaffected parents. Additionally, CNTN6 variants are seen at high enough frequencies in the non-affected population that it is difficult to assess the potential pathogenicity of them.
