In this paper, we describe a family with close consanguinity for at least four generations, suffering from a slowly progressive form of ALS. Spastic walking is observed since teenage years, while bulbar symptoms start much later, at the fifth or sixth decade of life. Patients usually die because of respiratory failure. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous p.(Val94Ala) (c.281T>C) (NG_052910.1) (NM_006459) variation in the endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft associated protein 1 (ERLIN1) gene, which segregates with the disease in the family. Here we suggest that ERLIN1 variants, previously shown in juvenile hereditary spastic paraplegia cases, may also be the cause of a slowly progressive early-onset ALS, starting with upper motor neuron features and developing into classical ALS with the addition of lower motor neuron dysfunction. We also demonstrate that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) gene, responsible for hyperbilirubinemia, is linked to ERLIN1.","dc:creator":"Tunca C","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"ERLIN1 mutations cause teenage-onset slowly progressive ALS in a large Turkish pedigree."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29453415","rdfs:label":"V.12"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant, Val94Ala was identified in four affected family members.

ERLIN1 binds cholesterol and regulates the SREBP signaling pathway, which promotes cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Biallelic mutations in ERLIN1 are a known cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia 62 (HSP62) (PMID:24482476). In 2018, a homozygous mutation in ERLIN1 was reported to be responsible for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a large, consanguineous Turkish family. The homozygous mutation identified in this family, p.Val94Ala, was reported to cause slowly progressive, early-onset ALS, starting with upper motor neuron features that developed into classical ALS with the addition of lower motor neuron dysfunction. p.Val94Ala is a missense variant that is absent from population databases and is predicted to be disease-causing by MutationTaster, SIFT, and PolyPhen2. Four affected individuals in the family were confirmed to have the disease-causing genotype, while 22 unaffected individuals were negative for the genotype, amounting to a calculated LOD score of 4.55 (PMID: 29453415). While three unique variants in ERLIN1 have been reported to cause complicated HSP (24482476), p.Val94Ala is the only variant in ERLIN1 that has been reported with an ALS phenotype (PMID: 29453415). There is currently no experimental evidence for the p.Val94Ala variant in ERLIN1. Due to the lack of experimental evidence for this variant, and there being fewer than three observations of variants with sufficient evidence supporting disease causality, ERLIN1 is classified as a limited-evidence gene for ALS.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d668c62f-b002-4015-a629-ecbebed40e59"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
