It is reported here that the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of patients bearing mutations in RAGs are more diverse than previously thought and that this variability is related, in part, to the specific type of RAG mutation. By analyzing 44 such patients from 41 families, the following conclusions were reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID phenotype; (2) patients manifesting classic Omenn syndrome (OS) have missense mutations on at least one allele and maintain partial V(D)J recombination activity, which accounts for the generation of residual, oligoclonal T-lymphocytes; (3) in a third group of patients, findings were only partially compatible with OS, and these patients, who also carried at least one missense mutation, may be considered to have atypical SCID/OS; (4) patients with engraftment of maternal T cells as a complication of a transplacental transfusion represented a fourth group, and these patients, who often presented with a clinical phenotype mimicking OS, may be observed regardless of the type of RAG gene mutation. Analysis of the RAG genes by direct sequencing is an effective way to provide accurate diagnosis of RAG-deficient as opposed to RAG-independent V(D)J recombination defects, a distinction that cannot be made based on clinical and immunologic phenotype alone.","dc:creator":"Villa A","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"V(D)J recombination defects in lymphocytes due to RAG mutations: severe immunodeficiency with a spectrum of clinical presentations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11133745","rdfs:label":"P32"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The compound heterozygous variants Clu669Gly and Cys900Ter were identified in one Omenn syndrome patient.

In vitro biochemical and cellular transfection studies suggest that RAG1/2 may also play postcleavage roles by forming complexes with the recombining ends to facilitate DNA end processing and ligation. In the current study, we examine the in vivo consequences of a mutant form of RAG1, RAG1-S723C, that is proficient for DNA cleavage, yet exhibits defects in postcleavage complex formation and end joining in vitro. We generated a knockin mouse model harboring the RAG1-S723C hypomorphic mutation and examined the immune system in this fully in vivo setting. RAG1-S723C homozygous mice exhibit impaired lymphocyte development and decreased V(D)J rearrangements. Distinct from RAG nullizygosity, the RAG1-S723C hypomorph results in aberrant DNA double-strand breaks within rearranging loci. RAG1-S723C also predisposes to thymic lymphomas associated with chromosomal translocations in a p53 mutant background, and heterozygosity for the mutant allele accelerates age-associated immune system dysfunction.

RAG1 encodes recombination-activating gene 1, a recombinase involved in V(D)J recombination by introducing double-stranded breaks between recombination signal sequences and coding segments. In RAG1-deficient individuals, V(D)J recombination is blocked such that mature B or T cells are not produced, leading to T-B- SCID which typically presents in infancy with recurrent, persistent infections by opportunistic organisms. Biallelic loss of function variants as associated with a SCID presentation, while hypomorphic alleles may lead to Leaky SCID with the presence of some mature T-cells. Omenn Syndrome -- characterized by SCID associated with erythrodermia, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and alopecia -- is one presentation of Leaky SCID. SCID, Leaky SCID and Omenn Syndrome are considered a spectrum of a single disease, and per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern.  Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, RAG1 deficiency. Generally, heterozygous parents/carriers are clinically unaffected. However, the acquisition of post-zygotic, somatic events on the other allele in specific cells may cause manifestations of the recessive condition in carriers (PMID: 31503426), and at least one case of a late clinical presentation of an idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia secondary to a heterozygous hypomorphic RAG1 mutation has been reported (PMID: 23122631). Over 200 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, and large deletion) have been reported in humans with autosomal recessive RAG1 deficiency. Curated evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship includes 15 probands with RAG1 variants who have been reported in 2 publications (PMIDs: 8810255 and 11133745). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including its biochemical function in V(D)J recombination (PMID: 8521468), which is altered in both patient and non-patient cells (PMID: 24290284) expressing RAG1 variants. Additionally, RAG1 interacts with RAG2 (PMID: 8777717) which causes a similar phenotype and RAG1 expression is generally restricted in lymphocytes (PMID: 25613900). Furthermore, animal models recapitulate the spectrum of disease with Leaky SCID (PMID: 19126872) and T-B- SCID (PMID: 1547488) phenotypes. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. In summary, RAG1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RAG1 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
