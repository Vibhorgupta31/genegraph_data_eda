Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"ICIMD classification"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"shared biochemical function with 10+ gene products"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:048cc8f0-7d27-4108-ada2-5454791c0bc5_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd7a92bf-abb4-48c2-bc86-c9221c7d02f8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7062779a-8e51-48ac-9dd7-d810b7de44ac","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"To study the effect of the mutations on the expression and\nactivity complex I, we performed BN–PAGE analysis followed by\nWestern blotting with an anti-NDUFA9 antibody and in-gel activity\nmeasurement with mitochondria-enriched fractions of cultured\nfibroblasts of the 3 patients.

Consideration of clinical variability needs to be taken into account in patient management and family counseling.","dc:creator":"Kashani A","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"A homozygous mutation in the NDUFS1 gene presents with a mild cavitating leukoencephalopathy."}},"rdfs:label":"Kashani 2014 male"},{"id":"cggv:087f76b4-3bd4-416e-8c70-ffd33b3a5d1c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:087f76b4-3bd4-416e-8c70-ffd33b3a5d1c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:087f76b4-3bd4-416e-8c70-ffd33b3a5d1c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"complex I deficiency"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"0.1 (other) + 0.15 (complex I deficiency)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:40104333-0dd3-4e94-85ac-0ec6875d3577_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40104333-0dd3-4e94-85ac-0ec6875d3577","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":5,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:9dd3cbc9-f383-47ab-8051-67b83a23eef1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005006.7(NDUFS1):c.1390C>T (p.Gln464Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2070476"}},{"id":"cggv:006fd3cf-86ee-4544-af0e-b265d5901aca","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005006.7(NDUFS1):c.530T>C (p.Ile177Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA350060958"}}],"detectionMethod":"sequencing of mtDNA, 6 nuclear-encoded complex I subunits","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Elevated blood, CSF lactate\nHypotonia, feeding difficulties, respiratory insufficiency, multiple organ failure, left ventricular hypertrophy\nIsolated complex I deficiency in skeletal muscle\n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002490","obo:HP_0011923","obo:HP_0001712","obo:HP_0008872","obo:HP_0002151","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002093"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:0184c435-4561-46ef-97c5-38db2070d5d6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:006fd3cf-86ee-4544-af0e-b265d5901aca"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25615419"},{"id":"cggv:6a9be2a7-71cf-4f94-b505-f9fc3f0600bb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9dd3cbc9-f383-47ab-8051-67b83a23eef1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25615419"}],"rdfs:label":"Bjorkman 2015 patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:6a9be2a7-71cf-4f94-b505-f9fc3f0600bb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a9be2a7-71cf-4f94-b505-f9fc3f0600bb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6a9be2a7-71cf-4f94-b505-f9fc3f0600bb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Not detected at RNA level, indicating NMD\n"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"do not add for experimental demonstration of null if scoring as predicted null"},{"id":"cggv:0184c435-4561-46ef-97c5-38db2070d5d6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0184c435-4561-46ef-97c5-38db2070d5d6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0184c435-4561-46ef-97c5-38db2070d5d6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"located between the iron–sulfur cluster binding Cys176 and Cys179\n"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3e5e2607-5979-4d5e-858a-023ed6ebf8e6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e5e2607-5979-4d5e-858a-023ed6ebf8e6","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:9aa00cfd-662f-42d1-b1fe-f6ac19e7e568","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005006.7(NDUFS1):c.384T>A (p.Cys128Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA350062396"}},{"id":"cggv:0513a65e-f2e1-4be6-bbec-1187080e4f10","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005006.7(NDUFS1):c.212T>A (p.Val71Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA350064128"}}],"detectionMethod":"exons of the 45 subunits of complex I, the mtDNA-encoded\ntRNAs and eight accessory factors including NDUFAF1,\nNDUFAF2, NDUFAF4, NDUFAB1, ECSIT, ACAD9, FOXRED1 and NUBPL.","phenotypeFreeText":"elevated blood and CSF lactate;

The *NDUFS1* gene encodes the mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*NDUFS1* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2001 (PMID: 11349233), in three probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFS1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFS1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFS1* was previously curated by this GCEP on June 10, 2019 (SOP Version 6) as having a definitive association with autosomal recessive LSS. The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.   \n\nEvidence supporting the relationship between *NDUFS1* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 18 variants identified in 13 unrelated probands from six publications (PMIDs: 11349233, 24952175, 25615419, 21458341, 22200994, 20382551). Variant types included missense, stop-gained, frameshift, and an in-frame deletion. Affected individuals present with complex I deficiency and variable other features with a typically progressive disease course. Age of onset is typically in infancy. Clinical features may include developmental delay and regression, movement disorder, seizures, leukodystrophy, atrophy and cystic lesions in the brain, hypotonia, optic atrophy, failure to thrive, and elevated serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate. The mechanism of disease involves loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by a biochemical function in mitochondrial complex I shared by more than 10 other genes also associated with primary mitochondrial disease as well as evidence of disrupted mitochondrial function in patient cells that could be rescued by expression of the wildtype protein (PMIDs: 21458341, 20382551, 33340416).\n\n In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFS1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 6, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:048cc8f0-7d27-4108-ada2-5454791c0bc5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
