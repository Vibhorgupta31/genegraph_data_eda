We identified a total of 15 independent mutations; no truncating events were identified in 8,792 controls, including 2,289 unaffected siblings. In addition to a high likelihood of an ASD diagnosis among patients bearing CHD8 mutations, characteristics enriched in this group included macrocephaly, distinct faces, and gastrointestinal complaints. chd8 disruption in zebrafish recapitulates features of the human phenotype, including increased head size as a result of expansion of the forebrain/midbrain and impairment of gastrointestinal motility due to a reduction in postmitotic enteric neurons. Our findings indicate that CHD8 disruptions define a distinct ASD subtype and reveal unexpected comorbidities between brain development and enteric innervation.","dc:creator":"Bernier R","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Disruptive CHD8 mutations define a subtype of autism early in development."},"rdfs:label":"Bernier Zebrafish Model 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded because of model type and because it does not provide much more information about the phenotype or disease mechanism."},{"id":"cggv:b794746a-a4f7-46d6-b051-2352db4805c6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d09e62e-4fb3-4737-9edf-490a9dc70584","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Chd8-/- mice die early during embryogenesis due to widespread apoptosis.

Among mammalian CHD proteins, CHD8 was originally isolated as a negative regulator of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway that binds directly to β-catenin and suppresses its transactivation activity. The mechanism by which CHD8 inhibits β-catenin-dependent transcription has been unclear, however. Here we show that CHD8 promotes the association of β-catenin and histone H1, with formation of the trimeric complex on chromatin being required for inhibition of β-catenin-dependent transactivation. A CHD8 mutant that lacks the histone H1 binding domain did not show such inhibitory activity, indicating that histone H1 recruitment is essential for the inhibitory effect of CHD8. Furthermore, either depletion of histone H1 or expression of a dominant negative mutant of this protein resulted in enhancement of the response to Wnt signaling. These observations reveal a new mode of regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by CHD8, which counteracts β-catenin function through recruitment of histone H1 to Wnt target genes. Given that CHD8 is expressed predominantly during embryogenesis, it may thus contribute to setting a threshold for responsiveness to Wnt signaling that operates in a development-dependent manner.","dc:creator":"Nishiyama M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Histone H1 recruitment by CHD8 is essential for suppression of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway."},"rdfs:label":"Nishiyama Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because the heterozygous model is not well phenotyped, but is said to be normal and fertile."},{"id":"cggv:e79e02d9-daf3-4019-9bfc-61dd84d731e5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca18caec-c400-4dbb-ab1a-adf28bc128a5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Injection of 4 ng of MO1 or MO2 lead to significant increase in mean value of eye distances of 50 morphants - suggests overgrowth of the head.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998929","rdfs:label":"Bernier Zebrafish Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for model type."},{"id":"cggv:dad370f7-87ae-42f0-a0be-c574bbcdb4c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:684eff6d-e652-42ac-9acf-ca1b8fdc56b6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Brain weight at E18.5 and in adulthood as well as adult brain volume were greater for heterozygous mutant mice than for wild-type mice - consistent with macrocephaly.

ASD has a strong genetic component with high heritability. Exome sequencing analysis has recently identified many de novo mutations in a variety of genes in individuals with ASD, with CHD8, a gene encoding a chromatin remodeller, being most frequently affected. Whether CHD8 mutations are causative for ASD and how they might establish ASD traits have remained unknown. Here we show that mice heterozygous for Chd8 mutations manifest ASD-like behavioural characteristics including increased anxiety, repetitive behaviour, and altered social behaviour. CHD8 haploinsufficiency did not result in prominent changes in the expression of a few specific genes but instead gave rise to small but global changes in gene expression in the mouse brain, reminiscent of those in the brains of patients with ASD. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that neurodevelopment was delayed in the mutant mouse embryos. Furthermore, reduced expression of CHD8 was associated with abnormal activation of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which suppresses the transcription of many neuronal genes. REST activation was also observed in the brains of humans with ASD, and CHD8 was found to interact physically with REST in the mouse brain. Our results are thus consistent with the notion that CHD8 haploinsufficiency is a highly penetrant risk factor for ASD, with disease pathogenesis probably resulting from a delay in neurodevelopment.","dc:creator":"Katayama Y","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"CHD8 haploinsufficiency results in autistic-like phenotypes in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Katayama Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Default points scored for consistent phenotypes with patients."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3831,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5d4784ce-8f46-4e52-8a76-56fc2b22741b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100038","gene":"hgnc:20153","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.3","dc:description":"The CHD8 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant autism spectrum disorder in 2012 (O'Roak et al., PMID: 22495309). At least 8 truncating variants have been reported in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22495309, 24998929, 26789910, 27824329). Most variants are de novo; one individual inherited a CHD8 variant from a heterozygous mother who has some autistic features but has not been clinically diagnosed. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. In addition to an increased likelihood of a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, individuals with pathogenic variants in CHD8 have variable degrees of intellectual disability, an overgrowth phenotype with macrocephaly and increased height, and dysmorphic facial features (PMID: 24998929). We therefore decided to curate for the generic term complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This gene-disease association is supported by a zebrafish model and a mouse model. In summary, CHD8 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
