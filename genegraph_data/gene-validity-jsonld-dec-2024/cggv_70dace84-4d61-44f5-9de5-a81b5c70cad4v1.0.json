These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype.

Targeted sequencing identified a homozygous E234X mutation, only the third mutation to be described in CDK5RAP2, the first in an individual of non-Pakistani descent. Sensorineural hearing loss is not generally considered to be consistent with autosomal recessive microcephaly and therefore it seems likely that the deafness in this individual is caused by the co-occurrence of a further gene mutation, independent of CDK5RAP2. Nevertheless, further detailed clinical descriptions of rare CDK5RAP2 patients, including hearing assessments will be needed to resolve fully the phenotypic range associated with mutations in this gene.

MCPH leads to reduced cerebral cortical volume and hence, reduced head circumference associated with mental retardation of variable degree. Genetic heterogeneity is well documented in patients with MCPH with six loci known, while pathogenic sequence variants in four respective genes have been identified so far. Mutations in CDK5RAP2 gene at MCPH3 locus have been least involved in causing MCPH phenotype.","dc:creator":"Hassan MJ","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Previously described sequence variant in CDK5RAP2 gene in a Pakistani family with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly."}},"rdfs:label":"V-2"},{"id":"cggv:57218cfe-a910-4f0b-8e36-a8ddf93c7933","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57218cfe-a910-4f0b-8e36-a8ddf93c7933_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4207,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5d2e837d-de2f-4f4c-ba38-76f191effeca","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016660","gene":"hgnc:18672","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Homozygous variants in CDK5RAP2 were first reported individuals with microcephaly in consanguineous family in 2005 (Bond J, et al., PMID: 15793586). Primary microcephaly (OMIM:604804) characterized by a disproportionately small brain and cerebral cortex further characterized by other significant neurological deficits (delayed psychomotor development, moderate learning difficulties, and significant speech delay). Other clinical manifestation as variation were reported: severe sensorineural hearing loss (Pagnamenta et al. (2012), short stature (-6.7 SD), prominent eyes, conical-shaped and widely spaced teeth (Lancaster et al. (2013)). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be autosomal recessive loss-of-function. At least nine loss-of-function variants, 3 homozygous and 6 compound heterozygous, have been reported in 6 probands with primary microcephaly, 3 across six publications (PMIDs: 17764569, 15793586, 22887808, 27761245, 23726037, 23995685). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by patient-derived cerebral organoid (PMID: 23995685) and phenotypically compatible mouse model (PMIDs: 20460369). Inducing wildtype CDK5RAP2 expression rescued the developmental abnormality in patient-derived cerebral organoid, which is genetically knock-out for CDK5RAP2 (PMID: 23995685). In summary, CDK5RAP2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, 3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This was discussed and approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 01/25/2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:70dace84-4d61-44f5-9de5-a81b5c70cad4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
