Six variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in thirteen probands in four publications (PMIDs: 30578397, 32934261, 33007923, 35281600) are included in this curation. However, only two variants (nonsense, frameshift) were scored (PMIDs: 32934261, 35281600) as the other variants were only seen in isolated idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension cases and/or were too frequent in population databases. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (NCBI fetal expression data). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 5/13/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:44a6fa0b-b6e7-422e-9d01-b74aad2a8b29"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
