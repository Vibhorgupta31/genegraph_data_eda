The MFF gene encodes mitochondrial fission factor, which plays an important role in mitochondrial fission. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly moving along the cell cytoskeleton and form functional networks in many cells. Mitochondria undergo frequent fusion and fission events, which allow formation of these networks. Defects in MFF lead to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and dynamics.\n\nThe MFF gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2016 (PMID: 26783368). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants identified in four cases in three publications (PMIDs: 26783368, 30581454, 32181496). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 26783368).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 21, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4484881f-277f-47a2-b1dd-70072ec941e0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
