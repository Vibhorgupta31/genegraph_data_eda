Although total brain ATP levels were decreased, histological analysis did not reveal any signs of neurodegeneration except for photoreceptors of the retina. Interestingly, ND23 deficiency-associated phenotypes were rescued by overexpressing the glucose transporter hGluT3 demonstrating that boosting glucose metabolism in neurons was sufficient to bypass altered mitochondrial functions and to confer neuroprotection. We then analyzed the consequences of ND23 knockdown in glial cells. In contrast to neuronal knockdown, loss of ND23 in glia did not lead to significant behavioral defects nor to reduced lifespan, but induced brain degeneration, as visualized by numerous vacuoles found all over the nervous tissue. This phenotype was accompanied by the massive accumulation of lipid droplets at the cortex-neuropile boundaries, suggesting an alteration of lipid metabolism in glia.

The extensive conservation of complex I composition between humans and Caenorhabditis elegans permits analysis of individual subunit contribution to mitochondrial functions at both the whole animal and mitochondrial levels. We provide the first experimentally-verified compilation of complex I composition in C. elegans, demonstrating 84% conservation with human complex I. Individual subunit contribution to mitochondrial respiratory capacity, holocomplex I assembly, and animal anesthetic behavior was studied in C. elegans by RNA interference-generated knockdown of nuclear genes encoding 28 complex I structural subunits and 2 assembly factors. Not all complex I subunits directly impact respiratory capacity. Subcomplex Ilambda subunits along the electron transfer pathway specifically control whole animal anesthetic sensitivity and complex II upregulation, proportionate to their relative impairment of complex I-dependent oxidative capacity. Translational analysis of complex I dysfunction facilitates mechanistic understanding of individual gene contribution to mitochondrial disease. We demonstrate that functional consequences of complex I deficiency vary with the particular subunit that is defective.","dc:creator":"Falk MJ","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Subcomplex Ilambda specifically controls integrated mitochondrial functions in Caenorhabditis elegans."},"rdfs:label":"C.elegans model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Biochemical recapitulation of disease (reduced complex I activity and reduced respiratory capacity)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":588,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":8.25,"subject":{"id":"cggv:59fed3ff-91fc-4859-8bde-4006fe52b564","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:7715","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between NDUFS8 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 20, 2019. The NDUFS8 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit S8. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\nThe NDUFS8 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1998 (PMID: 9837812). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included seven unique variants identified in five cases from five publications (PMIDs: 9837812, 22200994, 15159508, 23430795, 20818383). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions and animal models (PMIDs: 21924235, 19672299, 29285794, 27509854). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel November 20, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:01a27520-f92a-4b81-b63b-c15132c873be"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
