Energy flux must be rigorously monitored and adjusted to ensure that fuel intake and expenditure remain within acceptable limits. The central nervous system (CNS) is, in large part, responsible for conducting this energy-monitoring function and for integrating the numerous inputs. It has become evident that neurons of the CNS monitor and respond to levels of metabolic intermediates that reflect peripheral energy status. Intermediates in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway have been implicated as hypothalamic signaling mediators that sense and respond to changes in circulating fuels. Genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of the enzymes of fatty acid metabolism have led to the hypothesis that neuronal metabolic intermediates affect neural outputs that modify both feeding behavior and energy expenditure. This review focuses on the regulatory roles of these enzymes and intermediates in the regulation of food intake and energy balance.","dc:creator":"Wolfgang MJ","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Control of energy homeostasis: role of enzymes and intermediates of fatty acid metabolism in the central nervous system."},"rdfs:label":"Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Well-known disease mechanism."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:1a57ea10-6ca0-4311-94f1-0ad036a38ca6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f963dcc-7a3a-4ff1-9151-aca9a0ba0c7f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:afe2f877-8114-488b-91da-bba70e5efd7a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fatty acid oxidation was measured in lymphocytes and/or fibroblasts as the production of 3H20 from both palmitic and myristic acids (Brivet et al, 1995).

In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the difference in severity between these phenotypes, we analyzed a cohort of 20 CPT2-deficient patients being affected either with the infantile (seven patients) or the adult onset form of the disease (13 patients). Using a combination of direct sequencing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, 13 CPT2 mutations were identified, including five novel ones, namely: 371G>A (R124Q), 437A>C (N146T), 481C>T (R161W), 983A>G (D328G), and 1823G>C (D608H). After updating the spectrum of CPT2 mutations (n=39) and genotypes (n=38) as well as their consequences on CPT2 activity and LCFA oxidation, it appears that both the type and location of CPT2 mutations and one or several additional genetic factors to be identified would modulate the LCFA flux and therefore the severity of the disease.","dc:creator":"Thuillier L","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Correlation between genotype, metabolic data, and clinical presentation in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Correlation between genotype and biochemical activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:1a57ea10-6ca0-4311-94f1-0ad036a38ca6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6894f1a1-c0c6-4838-bffa-dc1cc4f4f374","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c088cbe1-fa72-430b-a9ce-943e8e6e864c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Heart and muscle rely on fatty acids as substrates.

Here, we investigated the loss of an obligate enzyme in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), on muscle and heart structure, function, and molecular signatures in a muscle- and heart-specific CPT2-deficient mouse (Cpt2M-/-) model. CPT2 loss in heart and muscle reduced complete oxidation of long-chain fatty acids by 87 and 69%, respectively, without altering body weight, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, or adiposity. Cpt2M-/-mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, evidenced by a 5-fold greater heart mass, 60-90% reduction in blood ejection fraction relative to control mice, and eventual lethality in the absence of cardiac fibrosis. The hypertrophy-inducing mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway was activated in Cpt2M-/-hearts; however, daily rapamycin exposure failed to attenuate hypertrophy in Cpt2M-/-mice. Lysine acetylation was reduced by âˆ¼50% in Cpt2M-/-hearts, but trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that improves cardiac remodeling, failed to attenuate Cpt2M-/-hypertrophy. Strikingly, a ketogenic diet increased lysine acetylation in Cpt2M-/-hearts 2.3-fold compared with littermate control mice fed a ketogenic diet, yet it did not improve cardiac hypertrophy. Together, these results suggest that a shift away from mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation initiates deleterious hypertrophic cardiac remodeling independent of fibrosis. The data also indicate that CPT2-deficient hearts are impervious to hypertrophy attenuators, that mitochondrial metabolism regulates cardiac acetylation, and that signals derived from alterations in mitochondrial metabolism are the key mediators of cardiac hypertrophic growth.","dc:creator":"Pereyra AS","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Loss of cardiac carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 results in rapamycin-resistant, acetylation-independent hypertrophy."},"rdfs:label":"Loss of CPT2 in heart and muscle"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:1a57ea10-6ca0-4311-94f1-0ad036a38ca6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a57ea10-6ca0-4311-94f1-0ad036a38ca6_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7db5ba7c-57a7-43d5-9de2-012e88d322c0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:054aec31-9f02-4268-a91e-5579c6ead55d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"Entire gene sequenced","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Precipitating factors were at the beginning of infection diseases, fasting, and exercise.

We studied the molecular basis of CPTase II deficiency in an early-onset patient presenting with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and cardiomyopathy. cDNA and genomic DNA analysis demonstrated that the patient was homozygous for a mutant CPTase II allele (termed ICV), which carried three missense mutations: a G-1203----A transition, predicting a Val-368----Ile substitution (V368I); a C-1992----T transition, predicting an Arg-631----Cys substitution (R631C); and an A-2040----G transition, predicting a Met-647----Val substitution (M647V). Genomic DNA analysis of family members showed that the mutations cosegregated with the disease in the family. However, screening of 59 healthy controls demonstrated that both the V368I and M647V mutations are sequence polymorphisms with allele frequencies of 0.5 and 0.25, respectively. By contrast, the R631C substitution was not detected in 22 normal individuals or in 12 of 14 CPTase II-deficient patients with the adult muscular form. Notably, 2 adult CPTase II-deficient patients were heterozygous for the ICV allele, thus suggesting compound heterozygosity for this and a different mutant allele. The consequences of the three mutations on enzyme activity were investigated by expressing normal and mutated CPTase II cDNAs in COS cells. The R631C substitution drastically depressed the catalytic activity of CPTase II, thus confirming that this is the crucial mutation. Interestingly, the V368I and M647V substitutions, which did not affect enzyme activity alone, exacerbated the effects of the R631C substitution. Biochemical characterization of mutant CPTase II in patient's cells showed that the mutations are associated with (i) severe reduction of Vmax (approximately 90%), (ii) normal apparent Km values, and (iii) decreased protein stability.","dc:creator":"Taroni F","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Molecular characterization of inherited carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1528846","rdfs:label":"DM"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:835adcb8-f821-46d5-ac7e-259fbd2465f3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b2906b8a-6b41-4d23-86c3-670ad8598ee6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":14,"detectionMethod":"Entire gene sequenced.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Blood sugar: 15 mg/dL; plasma CK: 1769 U/L; plasma carnitine profile: elevated C16 (39.68 nmol/mL), C18:2 (2.11), C18:1 (19.02) and C18 (6.80).
