However, we recently identified mutations in the 5'-untranslated region of the ANKRD26 gene in 9 THC2 families. Here we report on 12 additional pedigrees with ANKRD26 mutations, 6 of which are new. Because THC2 affected 21 of the 210 families in our database, it has to be considered one of the less rare forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. Analysis of all 21 families with ANKRD26 mutations identified to date revealed that thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendency were usually mild. Nearly all patients had no platelet macrocytosis, and this characteristic distinguishes THC2 from most other forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. In the majority of cases, platelets were deficient in glycoprotein Ia and α-granules, whereas in vitro platelet aggregation was normal. Bone marrow examination and serum thrombopoietin levels suggested that thrombocytopenia was derived from dysmegakaryopoiesis. Unexplained high values of hemoglobin and leukocytes were observed in a few cases. An unexpected finding that warrants further investigation was a high incidence of acute leukemia. Given the scarcity of distinctive characteristics, the ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia has to be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of isolated thrombocytopenias.","dc:creator":"Noris P","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations in ANKRD26 are responsible for a frequent form of inherited thrombocytopenia: analysis of 78 patients from 21 families."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21467542","rdfs:label":"Individual 6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The effect of the 5'UTR regulatory variant, c.-119C>A, was experimentally determined in PMID 24430186; in K562 cells a luciferase construct with the variant 5'UTR of ANKRD26 led to a significant increase in luciferase activity compared to WT during overexpression of RUNX1 and FLI1."},{"id":"cggv:de82d225-ea93-4b9d-8b64-bd22479316b7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8112c2c1-f8c0-4a01-9496-e64b673f4ea0","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sequenced, by unspecified methods, all 32 genes in the linkage region over the entire coding sequences and UTRs.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"All known forms of autosomal-dominant thrombocytopenia were excluded.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:de82d225-ea93-4b9d-8b64-bd22479316b7_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:7232d12f-fa6f-4f7f-be2c-e73dee772235","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.11:g.27100451A>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913185909"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211618","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"THC2, an autosomal-dominant thrombocytopenia described so far in only two families, has been ascribed to mutations in MASTL or ACBD5. Here, we show that ANKRD26, another gene within the THC2 locus, and neither MASTL nor ACBD5, is mutated in eight unrelated families. ANKRD26 was also found to be mutated in the family previously reported to have an ACBD5 mutation. We identified six different ANKRD26 mutations, which were clustered in a highly conserved 19 bp sequence located in the 5' untranslated region. Mutations were not detected in 500 controls and are absent from the 1000 Genomes database. Available data from an animal model and Dr. Watson's genome give evidence against haploinsufficiency as the pathogenetic mechanism for ANKRD26-mediated thrombocytopenia. The luciferase reporter assay suggests that these 5' UTR mutations might enhance ANKRD26 expression. ANKRD26 is the ancestor of a family of primate-specific genes termed POTE, which have been recently identified as a family of proapoptotic proteins. Dysregulation of apoptosis might therefore be the pathogenetic mechanism, as demonstrated for another thrombocytopenia, THC4. Further investigation is needed to provide evidence supporting this hypothesis.","dc:creator":"Pippucci T","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations in the 5' UTR of ANKRD26, the ankirin repeat domain 26 gene, cause an autosomal-dominant form of inherited thrombocytopenia, THC2."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211618","rdfs:label":"9-II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The effect of the 5'UTR regulatory variant, c.-125T>G, was not experimentally determined."},{"id":"cggv:7b858c2b-aa8d-47e3-b1d8-8b3d601c9f78_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d91c223-6dfb-4956-b2c5-a835d8c32430","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":32,"detectionMethod":"","phenotypeFreeText":"platelet counts ranging from 39 to 50 × 10^9/L, Bone marrow biopsy was normocellular at 70%, with myeloid:erythroid ratio at 3:1, and normal megakaryocyte number and morphology.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001873","obo:HP_0000978"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:7b858c2b-aa8d-47e3-b1d8-8b3d601c9f78_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:24fc95db-2e52-476d-ac1f-3d50b9aca1a9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.11:g.27100444G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913185920"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747248","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Diep RT","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A novel nucleotide substitution in the 5' untranslated region of ANKRD26 gene is associated with inherited thrombocytopenia: a report of two new families."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747248","rdfs:label":"Case 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The effect of the 5'UTR regulatory variant, c.-118C>G, was not experimentally determined."},{"id":"cggv:fb60ca06-5e48-4fdb-976f-d11b9fafe8b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57a08b02-f29f-43b3-b37f-cf87d7f91bae","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sequenced, by unspecified methods, all 32 genes in the linkage region over the entire coding sequences and UTRs.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"All known forms of autosomal-dominant thrombocytopenia were excluded.","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:fb60ca06-5e48-4fdb-976f-d11b9fafe8b6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6ca08c89-ae68-449a-978c-65f8d951d6e2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.11:g.27100442G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913185908"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211618"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211618","rdfs:label":"5-III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The effect of the 5'UTR regulatory variant, c.-116C>T, was not experimentally determined."},{"id":"cggv:a3637305-7e3a-4628-8cee-9283a249f945_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb2e5517-ee7f-4c7d-aea4-895892f76f53","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, PCR amplified over the 5'UTR and bidirectionally sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"WHO bleeding score: 1","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"105 unrelated patients with inherited thrombocytopenias;

Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 18 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 26175287, 23677566, 30747248, 28109976, 24030261, 21467542, 21211618). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 38 additional family members. The mechanism of disease is proposed to be gain of function, not haploinsufficiency (PMIDs: 21211618, 24430186). This gene-disease relationship is supported by altered expression and function in patient cells during megakaryopoeisis and proplatelet formation, as well as the rescue of proplatelet formation in patient cells by shRNA knockdown (PMID 24430186). In summary ANKRD26 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
