CHL is a common feature of TCS but the causes of the hearing defect have not been studied. In this study, we have utilized Tcof1 mutant mice to dissect the developmental mechanisms underlying CHL. Our results demonstrate that effective cavitation of the middle ear is intimately linked to growth of the auditory bulla, the neural crest cell-derived structure that encapsulates all middle ear components, and that defects in these processes have a profoundly detrimental effect on hearing.

The Ion AmpliSeq Panel was customized to cover the coding sequences of 52 genes. Twenty-four patients were recruited: 17 patients with a clinical diagnosis of a known syndrome, and seven whose clinical signs did not allow identification of a syndrome. Of 24 patients sequenced, potentially causative mutations were found in nine, all of which belonged to the group with a previous clinical diagnostic and none in the group not clinically diagnosed. We were able to provide conclusive molecular diagnosis to six patients, constituting a diagnostic rate of 25% (6/24). In the group of patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis, the diagnostic rate was 35% (6/17). Of the nine different mutations identified, three are novel, and were found in patients with Waardenburg, Treacher Collins and CHARGE syndromes. Since all patients with a conclusive molecular diagnosis through this panel had a previous suspected clinical diagnosis, our results suggest that this panel was more effective in diagnosing this group of patients.

In this study, we conducted mutational analysis on Chinese TCS patients to reveal a mutational spectrum of known causative genes and show phenotype-genotype data to provide more information for gene counselling and future studies on the pathogenesis of TCS. Twenty-two TCS patients were recruited from two tertiary referral centres, and Sanger sequencing for the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of TCOF1, POLR1D and POLR1C was performed. For patients without small variants, further copy number variations (CNVs) analysis was conducted using high-density SNP array platforms. The Sanger sequencing overall mutation detection rate was as high as 86.3% (19/22) for our cohort. Fifteen TCOF1 pathogenic variants, including ten novel mutations, were identified in nineteen patients. No causative mutations in POLR1D and POLR1C genes and no CNVs mutations were detected. A suspected autosomal dominant inheritance case that implies germinal mosaicism was described. Our study confirmed that TCOF1 was the main disease-causing gene for the Chinese TCS population and revealed its mutation spectrum. We also addressed the need for more studies of mosaicism in TCS cases, which could explain the mechanism of autosomal dominant inheritance in TCS cases and benefit the prevention of TCS.","dc:creator":"Chen Y","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mutation screening of Chinese Treacher Collins syndrome patients identified novel TCOF1 mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29230583","rdfs:label":"Patient S29P"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a8fda063-cb61-4742-88ff-8b351c6f21a6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2d4ffac-0cc9-4964-8119-308c24174396","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Patients with Treacher Collins Syndrome were screened successively for TCOF1, POLR1D, POLR1C, and EFTUD2 using Sanger, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, array-comparative genomic hybridization, and denaturing high-pressure liquir chromatography.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Downward-slating palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, conductive deafness, mandibular hypoplasia, microtia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0008551","obo:HP_0000272","obo:HP_0000494","obo:HP_0000405"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a8fda063-cb61-4742-88ff-8b351c6f21a6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:64c9d96b-7583-4f2d-b896-81090b9ca11d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001135243.1(TCOF1):c.390_391del (p.Lys131SerfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913203543"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25790162"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25790162","rdfs:label":"Patient 9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Father is somatic mosaic for the variant but paternity/maternity confirmation unclear."},{"id":"cggv:67b81d9e-9307-4b75-8b63-fd540e6691b7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cfbfef5a-a3e0-4dec-a778-3c04bf25d9d6","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"The 27 coding exons were amplified in 28 fragments and sequenced using BigDye 3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems).

At least 12 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 6 publications (22317976, 29230583, 31307516, 8894686, 25790162, 30390570). Variants in this gene segregated in 9 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies.
