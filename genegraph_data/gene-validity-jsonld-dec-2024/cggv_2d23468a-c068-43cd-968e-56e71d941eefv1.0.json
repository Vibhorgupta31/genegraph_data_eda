However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which p73 stability is regulated are unclear. During the search for interacting molecules with the COOH-terminal proline-rich region of p73, we identified a novel NEDD4-related protein (termed as NEDL2) which contains a C2 domain at its NH(2)-terminus, two WW domains, and a HECT domain at its COOH-terminus. As expected, NEDL2 catalyzed the ubiquitination of bacterial cellular proteins in vitro. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro pull-down assays revealed that NEDL2 bound to p73, which carries two putative PY motifs. p73 was efficiently ubiquitinated but stabilized in a NEDL2-dependent manner. Accordingly, p73 decayed at faster rates in the absence of NEDL2 than in its presence. Consistent with the NEDL2-mediated stabilization of p73, NEDL2 enhanced the p73-dependent transcriptional activation. Thus, our results suggest that NEDL2 activates the function of p73 by increasing its stability.","dc:creator":"Miyazaki K","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"A novel HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDL2, stabilizes p73 and enhances its transcriptional activity."},"rdfs:label":"Interaction with TP73"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2d23468a-c068-43cd-968e-56e71d941eef_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eeccb640-defe-45da-a18d-3cf04745cd57","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d7956cf-6ee3-4189-a327-67c89ac810ad","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Co-injection of HECW2 RNA significantly ameliorated the opaque tissues in the brain region leading to a notable decline of onset frequency compared to corresponding morpholino oligo injection alone.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33205896","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is a severe encephalopathy in infants and early childhood.

Heterozygous missense variants in *HECW2*  cause autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. In addition, there have been two reports of biallelic truncating variants in *HECW2* in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. This curation concerns the relationship between *HECW2*  and autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder. In 2022, Krami et al. reported a homozygous nonsense *HECW2* variant in a 5 year old proband from a Moroccan consanguineous family with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech, hypotonia, inability to sit or walk, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures starting at 1 month of age (PMID: 35487419). In addition, Rodriguez-Garcia et al. reported a homozygous intronic *HECW2* variant in a  girl with severe developmental delay, early-onset drug‐resistant epilepsy and hypotonia; she never achieved any neurodevelopmental milestones and died suddenly at age 4 years (PMID: 35753050). This variant disrupted the splice donor site of intron 22 and caused the elimination of exon 22, leading to an in‐frame deletion of 51 amino acids in the HECW2 protein. Functional studies showed a twofold increase in RNA expression, while the protein expression level was reduced by 60%, suggesting a partial loss‐of‐function mechanism of pathogenesis (PMID: 35753050).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is further supported by experimental evidence. Transcriptional knockdown of zebrafish hecw2a led to early brain development abnormalities (PMID: 33205896). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and *in vitro* pull-down assays revealed that HECW2 bound to TP73 and activated its function by increasing its stability (PMID: 12890487). Null variants of *TP73* are associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia-47 and lissencephaly.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence at this time to support the relationship between *HECW2* and autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship.
