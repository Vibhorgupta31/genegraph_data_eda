Mutations in dystroglycanopathy genes affect a specific glycoepitope on α-dystroglycan; of the 14 genes implicated to date, LARGE encodes the glycosyltransferase that adds the final xylose and glucuronic acid, allowing α-dystroglycan to bind ligands, including laminin 211 and neurexin. Only 11 patients with LARGE mutations have been reported. We report the clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic features of 4 additional patients. We confirm that gross deletions and rearrangements are important mutational mechanisms for LARGE. The brain abnormalities overshadowed the initially mild muscle phenotype in all 4 patients. We present the first comprehensive postnatal neuropathology of the brain, spinal cord, and eyes of a patient with a homozygous LARGE mutation at Cys443. In this patient, polymicrogyria was the predominant cortical malformation; densely festooned polymicrogyria were overlaid by a continuous agyric surface. In view of the severity of these abnormalities, Cys443 may be a functionally important residue in the LARGE protein, whereas the mutation p.Glu509Lys of Patient 1 in this study may confer a milder phenotype.

The most severe phenotypes are Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS) and muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) presenting with lissencephaly type II (LIS II) and in which muscular dystrophy is associated with mental retardation and eye abnormalities. To date, six distinct genes, POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, FKTN, FKRP, LARGE and recently in one case DPM3, have been shown to be involved in dystroglycanopathies. Genomic sequencing alone is still frequently used for diagnosis purpose, not allowing detection of intragenic rearrangements at the heterozygous state contrarily to RNA analysis, quantitative PCR and CGH array analysis. These latter methods enabled us to identify four new intragenic rearrangements in the LARGE gene in three fetuses with WWS, born to two unrelated families: deletion of exons 9-10 and duplication of introns 1-4 for the first family and deletion of exons 4 and 7 for the second one; and a deletion of the last six exons of the POMGNT1 gene in two unrelated MEB patients. Genomic dosage studies using emerging tools such as CGH array should be included in routine molecular analysis of dystroglycanopathies, not only for the screening of the LARGE gene in which this kind of mutation seems to be more frequent than point mutations, but also for the other involved genes, especially in severe clinical cases.","dc:creator":"Vuillaumier-Barrot

congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders. A new pathomechanism has recently been identified in a group of these disorders in which known or putative glycosyltransferases are defective. Common to all these conditions is the hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Fukuyama CMD, muscle-eye-brain disease and Walker-Warburg syndrome, each associated with eye abnormalities and neuronal migration defects, result from mutations in fukutin, POMGnT1 and POMT1, respectively, while mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene cause congenital muscular dystrophy 1C, typically lacking brain involvement. Another putative glycosyltransferase, Large, is mutated in the myodystrophy mouse. The human homologue of this gene is therefore a strong candidate for involvement in novel forms of muscular dystrophy. We studied 36 patients with muscular dystrophy and either mental retardation, structural brain changes or abnormal alpha-dystroglycan immunolabelling, unlinked to any reported CMD loci. Linkage analysis in seven informative families excluded involvement of LARGE but sequencing of this gene in the remaining 29 families identified one patient with a G1525A (Glu509Lys) missense mutation and a 1 bp insertion, 1999insT. This 17-year-old girl presented with congenital muscular dystrophy, profound mental retardation, white matter changes and subtle structural abnormalities on brain MRI. Her skeletal muscle biopsy showed reduced immunolabelling of alpha-dystroglycan. Immunoblotting with an antibody to a glycosylated epitope demonstrated a reduced molecular weight form of alpha-dystroglycan that retained some laminin binding activity. This is the first description of mutations in the human LARGE gene and we propose to name this new disorder MDC1D.","dc:creator":"Longman C","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in the human LARGE

A common feature of these diseases is loss of glycosylation and consequent dystroglycan function that is correlated with severe pathology in muscle, brain and other tissues. Although glycosylation of dystroglycan is essential for function in skeletal muscle, whether glycosylation-dependent function of dystroglycan is sufficient to explain all complex pathological features associated with these diseases is less clear. Dystroglycan glycosylation is defective in LARGE(myd) (myd) mice as a result of a mutation in like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE), a glycosyltransferase known to cause muscle disease in humans. We generated animals with restored dystroglycan function exclusively in skeletal muscle by crossing myd animals to a recently created transgenic line that expresses LARGE selectively in differentiated muscle. Transgenic myd mice were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates and demonstrated an amelioration of muscle disease as evidenced by an absence of muscle pathology, restored contractile function and a reduction in serum creatine kinase activity. Moreover, although deficits in nerve conduction and neuromuscular transmission were observed in myd animals, these deficits were fully rescued by muscle-specific expression of LARGE, which resulted in restored structure of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). These data demonstrate that, in addition to muscle degeneration and dystrophy, impaired neuromuscular transmission contributes to muscle weakness in dystrophic myd mice and that the noted defects are primarily due to the effects of LARGE and glycosylated dystroglycan in stabilizing the endplate of the NMJ.","dc:creator":"Gumerson JD","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Muscle-specific expression of LARGE restores neuromuscular transmission deficits in dystrophic LARGE(myd) mice."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue in model system"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Maxed out in the experiment category points with evidence from other papers, also scored."},{"id":"cggv:7648f72f-b59a-4082-a8f7-925d42f47c1e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e62118c-76f8-4b48-94db-4a28d8b196b9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"All phenotypic features observed in human are also present in the mouse including brain malformations, elevated creatine kinase and muscular dystrophy.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12354792","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have recently shown that a deletion in the Large gene, encoding a putative glycosyltransferase, is the molecular defect underlying the myodystrophy (previously myd; now Large(myd)) mouse. Here we show that the muscular dystrophy phenotype is not confined to skeletal muscle, but is also present in the heart and tongue. Immunohistochemistry indicates disruption of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC) in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Quantitative western blotting shows a general increase in the expression of DGC proteins and of dysferlin and caveolin-3 in mutant skeletal muscle. In contrast, the expression of DGC proteins is reduced in cardiac muscle. Overlay assays show loss of laminin binding by alpha-dystroglycan in Large(myd) skeletal and cardiac muscle and in brain. We also show that the phenotype of Large(myd) mice is not restricted to muscular dystrophy, but also includes ophthalmic and central nervous system (CNS) defects. Electroretinograms of homozygous mutant mice show gross abnormalities of b-wave characteristics, indicative of a complex defect in retinal transmission. The laminar architecture of the cortices of the cerebrum and the cerebellum is disturbed, indicating defective neuronal migration. Thus, the phenotype of the Large(myd) mouse shows similarities to the heterogeneous group of human muscle eye brain diseases characterized by severe congenital muscular dystrophy, eye abnormalities and CNS neuronal migration defects.

(PMID: 12966029). The proband was reported to have global developmental delay, hypotonia, mobility deterioration, calf and arm muscle hypertrophy, horizontal nystagmus, increased muscle tone, elevated creatine kinase. Additionally the proband had myopathic changes in the EMG and brain malformations that included cobblestone malformation, white matter changes, abnormal neuronal migration, mild pachygyria with moderately thick and dysplastic cortex in the frontal lobes and mildly simplified gyri with shallow sulci in the posterior frontal, temporal and parietal regions. All affected individuals described thus far carry compound heterozygous or homozygous variants in *LARGE1 *. One single report (PMID:17878207) of a patient with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the gene was not included for the purposes of this curation. Additionally, the family described in PMID: 21248746, carried a homozygous loss of function variant but they were also excluded due to the complex genetic rearrangement that was identified in the affected probands.\n\nLARGE1 protein is a putative glycosyltranferase required for the addition of glycans onto the α-DG protein. Dystroglycan is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in the muscle and comprises two subunits the extracellular α-DG and the transmembrane β-DG. α-DG in the muscle acts as bridge between the extracellular matrix laminin and the actin cytoskeleton through the transmembranal β-dystroglycan; and in the brain binds to laminin and neurexin which are important for neuronal migration in the neocortex and the integrity of the glia limitants (PMID: 17436019).\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic inherited loss-of-function variants. Five missense, 2 frameshift, 8 single or multiple exon deletions and 1 multiple exon duplication were reported in 9 patients and 3 affected fetuses from 10 families across 6 publications (PMIDs: 12966029, 17436019, 19067344, 19299310, 24709677, 21727005). Not all variants from the aforementioned PMIDs were scored because maximum genetic evidence points were reached. \nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence that include the natural mouse model Largemyd exhibiting same phenotypic features as the affected individuals (PMID: 12354792) and the rescue of the phenotype that was observed in cells from affected individuals when adenovirus expressing *LARGE1 *was used (PMID: 15184894) and in transgenic myd mice with overexpression of human *LARGE1 *in muscle (PMID: 23222475).\nIn summary, *LARGE1 *is definitively associated with autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and has been upheld over time. This was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformation GCEP on 9/4/2024.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:98beb148-70ee-4448-8d53-12c26fddf855"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
