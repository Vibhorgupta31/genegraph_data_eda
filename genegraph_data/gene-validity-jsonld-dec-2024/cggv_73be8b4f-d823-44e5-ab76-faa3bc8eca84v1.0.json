Postnatal assessment showed digital abnormalities, including brachydactyly, camptodactyly, partial syndactyly and absent distal phalanges. With the lack of fibrillin-1 microfibril deposition as well as impaired and inadequate elastic fiber assembly in our patient's fibroblasts, we speculate that the skeletal abnormalities seen in this patient with LDS are the result of lack of these components in embryonal perichondrium and in blood vessels. We suggest that LDS should be included in the differential diagnosis of joint contractures seen pre and postnatally.

It is characterized by aggressive vascular pathology, aneurysms, arterial tortuosity, bifid uvula, hypertelorism, and cleft palate. Here we present a 42-year-old female patient with LDS. The patient underwent rapidly progressing artery aneurysms and life-threatening aortic dissection. Spontaneous fracture of the first metatarsal bone was noted in her medical record. Physical examination revealed a delayed wound healing on her left abdomen. Considering these clinical manifestations, we speculated that there was a genetic defect in the connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, skins, ligaments, and blood vessels. Thus, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the proband and revealed a heterozygous missense pathogenic variant (c.1613T > C/p.Val538Ala) in TGFBR2, which was a de novo variant in the proband as confirmed by the segregation analysis in parental samples. Although this variant was discovered and associated with the phenotype of LDS previously, the pathogenicity of the variant had not been confirmed by cellular functional assay yet. To further validate the effects of the variant in vitro, we assessed the canonical TGF-Î² signaling pathway in mutant cells. Our results showed that the p.Val538Ala variant significantly decreased TGF-Î²-induced gene transcription and the phosphorylation of Smad2, which were consistent with other pathogenic variants of TGFBR2. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the p.Val538Ala pathogenic variant in TGFBR2 leads to aberrant TGF-Î² signaling and LDS in this patient.","dc:creator":"Luo X","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Identification of a Pathogenic TGFBR2 Variant in a Patient With Loeys-Dietz Syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32528524","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Supported by functional evidence and parental confirmation of de novo occurrence"},{"id":"cggv:3e17f5fe-a38f-4575-96ce-f23fefb11941_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7c10225-9d83-4ff0-8f46-269adef574cd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0004942","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3e17f5fe-a38f-4575-96ce-f23fefb11941_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:da1b34aa-7135-45ba-8e77-35ffcd8ffc42"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18781618","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 gene mutations have been associated with Marfan syndrome types 1 and 2, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and isolated familial thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissection.

While heterozygous mutant cells had diminished signaling in response to exogenous TGF-Î² in vitro, they maintained normal levels of Smad2 phosphorylation under steady-state culture conditions, suggesting a chronic compensation. Analysis of TGF-Î² signaling in the aortic wall in vivo revealed progressive upregulation of Smad2 phosphorylation and TGF-Î² target gene output, which paralleled worsening of aneurysm pathology and coincided with upregulation of TGF-Î²1 ligand expression. Importantly, suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and TGF-Î²1 expression correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan. Together, these data suggest that increased TGF-Î² signaling contributes to postnatal aneurysm progression in LDS.","dc:creator":"Gallo EM","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Angiotensin II-dependent TGF-Î² signaling contributes to Loeys-Dietz syndrome vascular pathogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Knockin G357W mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:3e80c4d5-9562-43f7-b579-5bb5069a002b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c806bcd4-e363-4e31-93ef-30fa51d70724","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The phenotype observed more closely resembles LDS1 and therefore was not scored.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12975342","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cleft palate and skull malformations represent some of the most frequent congenital birth defects in the human population. Previous studies have shown that TGFbeta signaling regulates the fate of the medial edge epithelium during palatal fusion and postnatal cranial suture closure during skull development. It is not understood, however, what the functional significance of TGFbeta signaling is in regulating the fate of cranial neural crest (CNC) cells during craniofacial development. We show that mice with Tgfbr2 conditional gene ablation in the CNC have complete cleft secondary palate, calvaria agenesis, and other skull defects with complete phenotype penetrance. Significantly, disruption of the TGFbeta signaling does not adversely affect CNC migration. Cleft palate in Tgfbr2 mutant mice results from a cell proliferation defect within the CNC-derived palatal mesenchyme. The midline epithelium of the mutant palatal shelf remains functionally competent to mediate palatal fusion once the palatal shelves are placed in close contact in vitro. Our data suggests that TGFbeta IIR plays a crucial, cell-autonomous role in regulating the fate of CNC cells during palatogenesis. During skull development, disruption of TGFbeta signaling in the CNC severely impairs cell proliferation in the dura mater, consequently resulting in calvaria agenesis. We provide in vivo evidence that TGFbeta signaling within the CNC-derived dura mater provides essential inductive instruction for both the CNC- and mesoderm-derived calvarial bone development. This study demonstrates that TGFbeta IIR plays an essential role in the development of the CNC and provides a model for the study of abnormal CNC development.","dc:creator":"Ito Y","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 in cranial neural crest causes cleft palate and calvaria defects."},"rdfs:label":"Cranial neuro crest cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Phenotype closer to LDS-I"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1539,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5b874a9d-078f-445e-8b36-af2ba8fb542b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012427","gene":"hgnc:11773","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"TGFBR2 has been described in relation to autosomal dominant Loeys-Dietz syndrome type II as early as 2005 by Loeys et al. (PMID: 15731757). Loeys âDietz syndrome type II is characterized by âthe triad of arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palateâ (PMID: 16928994). At least 17 unique variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, TGFBR2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Loeys-Dietz syndrome type II. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on 11/25/2020.
