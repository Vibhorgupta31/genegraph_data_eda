This allows a partial rescue of mature thymocyte/T cell differentiation and thus the functional characterization of peripheral T cells lacking Itpkb. We show here that Itpkb(-)(/)(-) CD4(+) and CD8(+) peripheral T cells present important functional alterations. Indeed, an increased activated/memory phenotype as well as a decreased proliferative capacity and survival were detected in these T cells. These Itpkb-deficient peripheral T cells have also an increased capacity to secrete cytokines upon stimulation. Together, our present results define the important role of Itpkb in peripheral mature T cell fate and function in mouse, suggesting a potential role for Itpkb in autoimmunity.","dc:creator":"Pouillon V","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (Itpkb) controls survival, proliferation and cytokine production in mouse peripheral T cells."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:bd0ec4c7-3507-4123-aa85-8d4e047f4f0e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95f7323e-3fdf-4bde-ba4d-a778d99f9a69","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both have T cell lymphopenia, failure to thrive, and recurrent infections.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14517551","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P(3)) is phosphorylated by Ins(1,4,5)P(3) 3-kinase, generating inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4)).

Disruption of the gene encoding the ubiquitously expressed Ins(1,4,5)P(3) 3-kinase isoform B (Itpkb) in mice caused a severe T cell deficiency due to major alterations in thymocyte responsiveness and selection.

One frameshift variant has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMIDs: 31987846). The proband was born to consanguineous parents and presented with failure to thrive, oral thrush, recurrent pneumonia, skin abscesses, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and profound CD3+ CD4+ and CD8+ cell lymphopenia, consistent with T-B+NK+ severe combined immunodeficiency. The parents and unaffected sibling were heterozygous for the same variant and none had a history of recurrent infections. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ B-cell numbers were normal in the parents. To date, the only reported variant is a frameshift at the 3’ end of the gene that may escape nonsense mediated decay. In vitro functional studies showed that this variant caused reduced expression and absent kinase activity. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, rescue studies, and functional assays (PMIDs: 31987846, 22981169, 14517551). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
