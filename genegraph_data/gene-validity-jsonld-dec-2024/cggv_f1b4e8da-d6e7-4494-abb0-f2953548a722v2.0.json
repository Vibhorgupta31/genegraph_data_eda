We describe the prenatal and postnatal findings in a fetus with one of the most severe NLS phenotypes described so far, caused by a homozygous nonsense mutation of PHGDH. Serial ultrasound (US) and pre- and postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations were performed. Prenatally, serial US evaluations suggested symmetric growth restriction, microcephaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, micrognathia, hydrops, shortened limbs, arthrogryposis, and talipes equinovarus. The prenatal MRI confirmed these findings prompting a diagnosis of NLS. After birth, radiological imaging did not detect any gross bone abnormalities. DNA was extracted from fetal and parental peripheral blood, all coding exons of PHGDH were PCR-amplified and subjected to Sanger sequencing. Sequencing of PHGDH identified a homozygous premature stop codon mutation (c.1297C>T; p.Gln433*) in fetal DNA, both parents (first-cousins) being heterozygotes. Based on previous associations of mutations in this gene with a milder NLS phenotype, as well as cases of serine deficiency, these observations lend further support to a genotype-phenotype correlation between the degree of PHGDH inactivation and disease severity.","dc:creator":"Mattos EP","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Identification of a premature stop codon mutation in the PHGDH gene in severe Neu-Laxova syndrome-evidence for phenotypic variability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25913727","rdfs:label":"Mattos_Case"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The homozygous nonsense variant, Gln433Ter, is predicted to be null due to NMD."},{"id":"cggv:5c3ba957-989e-4ad7-b381-d0a1d9531d62_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a37f889d-d050-4523-af0f-4ce261a34542","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Genetic sequencing for PHGDH by unspecified methods.","phenotypeFreeText":"Plasma amino acids showed low serine (19 μmol/L, reference range: 127-211 μmol/L) and glycine (63 μmol/L, reference range: 184-356 μmol/L).

The biochemical abnormalities associated with this disorder are low concentrations of L-serine, D-serine, and glycine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Only two missense mutations (p.V425M and p.V490M) have been identified in PHGDH, the gene encoding 3-PGDH, but it is currently unclear how these mutations in the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain of the protein affect enzyme function. We now describe five novel mutations in five patients with 3-PGDH deficiency; one frameshift mutation (p.G238fsX), and four missense mutations (p.R135W, p.V261M, p.A373T, and p.G377S). The missense mutations were located in the nucleotide binding and regulatory domains of 3-PGDH and did not affect steady-state expression, protein stability, and protein degradation rates. Patients' fibroblasts displayed a significant, but incomplete, reduction in maximal enzyme activities associated with all missense mutations. In transient overexpression studies in HEK293T cells, the p.A373T, p.V425M, and p.V490M mutations resulted in almost undetectable enzyme activities. Molecular modeling of the p.R135W and p.V261M mutations onto the partial crystal structure of 3-PGDH predicted that these mutations affect substrate and cofactor binding. This prediction was confirmed by the results of kinetic measurements in fibroblasts and transiently transfected HEK293T cells, which revealed a markedly decreased V(max) and an increase in K(m) values, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that missense mutations associated with 3-PGDH deficiency either primarily affect substrate binding or result in very low residual enzymatic activity.","dc:creator":"Tabatabaie L","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Novel mutations in 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are distributed throughout the protein and result in altered enzyme kinetics."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19235232","rdfs:label":"Patient 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant Gly377Ser was supported by functional evidence in HEK293T cells transfected with constructs encoding wild-type or mutant 3-PGDH (generated by site-directed mutagenesis), Gly377Ser resulted in a moderate decrease in Vmax (76 nmol/min.mg protein, compared to 168 for WT)."},{"id":"cggv:4bcbd3f0-ae0b-47d5-b97f-e81e05492cf1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a919cf04-ab05-4a9a-aa27-cbeab2357fd9","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was prepared from fibroblasts, PCR amplified over each exon, including the intron boundaries, and sequenced by dye termination cycle sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"severely reduced L-serine concentration in CSF","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001250"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4bcbd3f0-ae0b-47d5-b97f-e81e05492cf1_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:3596e277-aa3a-4264-a2a9-7c49c94e757a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006623.3(PHGDH):c.1117G>A (p.Ala373Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341852909"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19235232"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19235232","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant Ala373Thr was supported by functional evidence in HEK293T cells transfected with constructs encoding wild-type or mutant 3-PGDH (generated by site-directed mutagenesis), Ala373Thr resulted in a significant decrease in Vmax (22.3 nmol/min.mg protein, compared to 168 for WT)."},{"id":"cggv:57bc7cc3-ba5a-4810-98c2-551aa4b0a0d9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:462176e0-231d-4f85-bcad-3fbcd0b5db52","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Autozygome analysis was performed and was followed by AutoSNPa genome-wide determination of runs of homozygosity which identified overlap between all families at a single locus on chromosome 1.

In order to identify the cause of NLS, we conducted a positional-mapping study combining autozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in three consanguineous families affected by NLS. Surprisingly, the NLS-associated locus identified in this study was solved at the gene level to reveal mutations in PHGDH, which is known to be mutated in individuals with microcephaly and developmental delay. PHGDH encodes the first enzyme in the phosphorylated pathway of de novo serine synthesis, and complete deficiency of its mouse ortholog recapitulates many of the key features of NLS.

Homozygous mutations in PHGDH, a gene involved in the first and limiting step in L-serine biosynthesis, were recently identified as the cause of the disease in three families. By studying a cohort of 12 unrelated families affected by NLS, we provide evidence that NLS is genetically heterogeneous and can be caused by mutations in all three genes encoding enzymes of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway. Consistent with recently reported findings, we could identify PHGDH missense mutations in three unrelated families of our cohort. Furthermore, we mapped an overlapping homozygous chromosome 9 region containing PSAT1 in four consanguineous families. This gene encodes phosphoserine aminotransferase, the enzyme for the second step in L-serine biosynthesis. We identified six families with three different missense and frameshift PSAT1 mutations fully segregating with the disease. In another family, we discovered a homozygous frameshift mutation in PSPH, the gene encoding phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step of L-serine biosynthesis. Interestingly, all three identified genes have been previously implicated in serine-deficiency disorders, characterized by variable neurological manifestations. Our findings expand our understanding of NLS as a disorder of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway and suggest that NLS represents the severe end of serine-deficiency disorders, demonstrating that certain complex syndromes characterized by early lethality could indeed be the extreme end of the phenotypic spectrum of already known disorders.

At least 20 unique variants (missense and small indels) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 19235232, 24836451, 28440900, 22393170, 25913727, 11055895, 28135894, 25152457). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of PHGDH as the 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and a knockout mouse model. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in two neurometabolic disorders due to serine deficiency, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency and Neu-Laxova syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no reported difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern and current assertions in the field suggest one broad phenotypic spectrum associated with serine biosynthesis defects encompassing both disorders (PMIDs: 28653176, 27161889, 26960553, 25152457). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency. In summary, PHGDH is definitively associated with autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency.
