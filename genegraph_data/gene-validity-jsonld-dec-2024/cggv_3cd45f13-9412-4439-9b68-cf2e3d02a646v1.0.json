DHPR deficiency, caused by mutations in the QDPR gene, results in hyperphenylalaninemia and deficiency of various neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, with severe neurological symptoms as a consequence. We have studied, at the clinical and molecular levels, 17 patients belonging to 16 Turkish families with DHPR deficiency. The patients were detected at neonatal screening for hyperphenylalaninemia or upon the development of neurological symptoms. To identify the disease causing molecular defects, we developed a sensitive screening method that rapidly scans the entire open reading frame and all splice sites of the QDPR gene. This method combines PCR amplification and \"GC-clamping\" of each of the seven exonic regions of QDPR, resolution of mutations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and identification of mutations by direct sequence analysis. A total of ten different mutations were identified, of which three are known (G23D, Y150C, R221X) and the remaining are novel (G17R, G18D, W35fs, Q66R, W90X, S97fs and G149R). Six of these mutations are missense variants, two are nonsense mutations, and two are frameshift mutations. All patients had homoallelic genotypes, which allowed the establishment of genotype-phenotype associations. Our findings suggest that DGGE is a fast and efficient method for detection of mutations in the QDPR gene, which may be useful for confirmatory DNA-based diagnosis, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis in DHPR deficiency.","dc:creator":"Romstad A","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Molecular analysis of 16 Turkish families with DHPR deficiency using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153907","rdfs:label":"Patient 17"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Additional informaiton: gnomAD MAF is 0.00002978 (Latino)."},{"id":"cggv:37ebbf91-6ec9-495a-8d61-e6a38b906ee6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bfbfbda-c61e-4800-b478-01d697cc7975","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"DGGE of each of the seven exons and intron/exon junctions of the QDPR gene followed by followed by PCR and sequencing of abnormal products.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Phe level 732 μmol/l (normal <180 μmol/l).

Amplification of a small region around this mutation by using genomic DNA as the PCR target indicates that the mutation is completely within an exon. Unequal crossing-over at the second base in the preceding alanine codon and duplication of the bases CTA may be the mechanism of mutagenesis. The cleavage site 147 bases from the end of the probe corresponded to the conversion of guanine to adenine at base 420 (CTG to CTA) and does not alter the code for leucine. This change, which was also seen in another dihydropteridine reductase-deficient child and in a control subject probably represents a common neutral polymorphism.","dc:creator":"Howells DW","dc:date":"1990","dc:title":"Insertion of an extra codon for threonine is a cause of dihydropteridine reductase deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2116088","rdfs:label":"KA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This patients is homozygous for a single amino acid insertion in QDPR, (p.Thr123_Lys124insThr.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in QDPR were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1998 (Furukawa et al, PMID 9667588). Fifteen unique variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, intronic, and in frame duplication) were curated in 15 probands from 5 publications (Howells et al, 1990, PMID 2116088; Smooker et al, 1995, PMID 7783174; Ikeda et al, 1997, PMID 9341885; Romstad et al, 2000, PMID 11153907; Ye et al, 2008, PMID 19099731). More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points ) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the function of DHPR, which is consistent with the disease process (PMIDs 14114862, 3033643), as well as the finding of hyperphenylalaninemia in a null mouse model (Xu et al, 2014, PMID 24240194).
