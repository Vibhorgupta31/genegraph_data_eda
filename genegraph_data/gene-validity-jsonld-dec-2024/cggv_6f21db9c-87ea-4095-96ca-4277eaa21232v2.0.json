Known causative genes account for 70-80% of clinically diagnosed NS patients, but the genetic basis for the remaining 20-30% of cases is unknown. We performed next-generation sequencing on germ-line DNA from 27 NS patients lacking a mutation in the known NS genes. We identified gain-of-function alleles in Ras-like without CAAX 1 (RIT1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1) and previously unseen loss-of-function variants in RAS p21 protein activator 2 (RASA2) that are likely to cause NS in these patients. Expression of the mutant RASA2, MAP2K1, or RIT1 alleles in heterologous cells increased RAS-ERK pathway activation, supporting a causative role in NS pathogenesis. Two patients had more than one disease-associated variant. Moreover, the diagnosis of an individual initially thought to have NS was revised to neurofibromatosis type 1 based on an NF1 nonsense mutation detected in this patient. Another patient harbored a missense mutation in NF1 that resulted in decreased protein stability and impaired ability to suppress RAS-ERK activation; however, this patient continues to exhibit a NS-like phenotype. In addition, a nonsense mutation in RPS6KA3 was found in one patient initially diagnosed with NS whose diagnosis was later revised to Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Finally, we identified other potential candidates for new NS genes, as well as potential carrier alleles for unrelated syndromes. Taken together, our data suggest that next-generation sequencing can provide a useful adjunct to RASopathy diagnosis and emphasize that the standard clinical categories for RASopathies might not be adequate to describe all patients.

However, information on the phenotypes of LZTR1 mutation-positive patients and functional properties of the mutations are limited. To identify variants of LZTR1, PPP1CB, and MRAS, we performed a targeted next-generation sequencing and reexamined previously analyzed exome data in 166 patients with suspected RASopathies. We identified eight LZTR1 variants, including a de novo variant, in seven probands who were suspicious for NS and one known de novo PPP1CB variant in a patient with NS. One of the seven probands had two compound heterozygous LZTR1 variants, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. All probands with LZTR1 variants had cardiac defects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrial septal defect. Five of the seven probands had short stature or intellectual disabilities. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous LZTR1 followed by western blotting showed that LZTR1 bound to the RAF1-PPP1CB complex.

Although the mode of inheritance is typically dominant, recent studies indicate LZTR1 may be associated with both dominant and recessive forms. Seeking to describe the phenotypic characteristics of LZTR1-associated NS, we searched for likely pathogenic variants using two approaches. First, scrutiny of exomes from 9624 patients recruited by the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDDs) study uncovered six dominantly-acting mutations (p.R97L; p.Y136C; p.Y136H, p.N145I, p.S244C; p.G248R) of which five arose de novo, and three patients with compound-heterozygous variants (p.R210*/p.V579M; p.R210*/p.D531N; c.1149+1G>T/p.R688C). One patient also had biallelic loss-of-function mutations in NEB, consistent with a composite phenotype. After removing this complex case, analysis of human phenotype ontology terms indicated significant phenotypic similarities (P = 0.0005), supporting a causal role for LZTR1. Second, targeted sequencing of eight unsolved NS-like cases identified biallelic LZTR1 variants in three further subjects (p.W469*/p.Y749C, p.W437*/c.-38T>A and p.A461D/p.I462T). Our study strengthens the association of LZTR1 with NS, with de novo mutations clustering around the KT1-4 domains.

By trapping LZTR1 complexes from intact mammalian cells, we identified the guanosine triphosphatase RAS as a substrate for the LZTR1-CUL3 complex. Ubiquitome analysis showed that loss of Lztr1 abrogated Ras ubiquitination at lysine-170. LZTR1-mediated ubiquitination inhibited RAS signaling by attenuating its association with the membrane. Disease-associated LZTR1 mutations disrupted either LZTR1-CUL3 complex formation or its interaction with RAS proteins. RAS regulation by LZTR1-mediated ubiquitination provides an explanation for the role of LZTR1 in human disease.","dc:creator":"Steklov M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mutations in LZTR1 drive human disease by dysregulating RAS ubiquitination."},"rdfs:label":"Lztr1 KO model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"downgraded because distinguishing RASopathy phenotypes in a mouse model is difficult.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and an animal model. At least 10 unique variants have been reported in humans with Noonan syndrome. In addition to those described in the literature, six variants with confirmed de novo inheritance and one variant with unconfirmed de novo inheritance have been identified at GeneDx in individuals with features consistent with a RASopathy (SCV000330730, SCV000491887, SCV000619636, SCV000778848, SCV000778849, SCV000778850, SCV000568857). Several missense and other non-LOF variants have been identified to segregate in a dominant manner, while heterozygous LOF variants have been found in unaffected carriers in families with recessive Noonan syndrome, therefore, the suspected mechanism of disease in LZTR1 is dominant-negative. Further functional evidence is required to solidify this mechanism (Johnston et al., 2018). In summary, LZTR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Of note, LZTR1 has also been classified as strong in relation to autosomal recessive Noonan syndrome. Additionally, the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has assessed LZTR1 for associations with both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Costello syndrome, and Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, but no evidence was reported. This classification was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel on 4/23/2020.\nSee Evidence Summary","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6f21db9c-87ea-4095-96ca-4277eaa21232"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
