The disorder is also associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and congenital heart disease. Six distinct BBS loci map to 11q13 (BBS1), 16q21 (BBS2), 3p13-p12 (BBS3), 15q22.3-q23 (BBS4), 2q31 (BBS5), and 20p12 (BBS6). Although BBS is rare in the general population (<1/100,000), there is considerable interest in identifying the genes causing BBS because components of the phenotype, such as obesity and diabetes, are common. We and others have demonstrated that BBS6 is caused by mutations in the gene MKKS (refs. 12,13), mutation of which also causes McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (hydrometrocolpos, post-axial polydactyly, and congenital heart defects). MKKS has sequence homology to the alpha subunit of a prokaryotic chaperonin in the thermosome Thermoplasma acidophilum. We recently identified a novel gene that causes BBS2. The BBS2 protein has no significant similarity to other chaperonins or known proteins.

This complex, the BBSome, localizes to nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm but also to the membrane of the cilium. Interestingly, the BBSome is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Strikingly, Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane.

To date, mutations in 21 different genes have been described as being responsible for BBS. Recently sequential gene sequencing has been replaced by next generation sequencing (NGS) applications. In this study, 15 patients with clinically diagnosed BBS were investigated using a next generation sequencing panel which included 17 known BBS causing genes (BBS1, BBS2, ARL6, BBS4, BBS5, MKKS, BBS7, TTC8, BBS9, BBS10, TRIM32, BBS12, MKS1, NPHP6, WDPCP, SDCCAG8, NPHP1). A genetic diagnosis was achieved in 13 patients (86.6%) and involved 9 novel and 3 previously described pathogenic variants in 6 of 17 BBS causing genes. BBS10 and BBS1 were the most commonly involved genes with frequencies of 31% and 23% respectively. Three of the 13 patients had an affected sibling. All affected siblings were found to be homozygous for the mutation detected in the proband. No evidence of triallelic inheritance was detected. Although limited association between certain genes and phenotypic features has been observed in this study, it is considered that additional studies are needed to better characterize the genotype-phenotype correlation of BBS. Our results demonstrate that NGS panels are feasible and effective method for providing high diagnostic yields in the diseases caused by multiple genes such as BBS.","dc:creator":"Ece Solmaz A","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted multi-gene panel testing for the diagnosis of Bardet Biedl syndrome: Identification of nine novel mutations across BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS7, BBS9, BBS10 genes."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 6"},{"id":"cggv:81f1eaf1-dd45-46a3-9803-c7264f139a43","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81f1eaf1-dd45-46a3-9803-c7264f139a43_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downscore homozygous null per Retina GCEP"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2e1c0227-2a94-4c3c-a094-779039c4384e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e1c0227-2a94-4c3c-a094-779039c4384e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2259a5ec-163d-41be-973b-ebf32046e56c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033028.5(BBS4):c.77-216del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254670"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of coding regions of BBS1, BBS2, BBS10.

This study was performed to characterize responsible genes and mutation spectrum in a cohort of 14 Iranian families with BBS. Sanger sequencing of the most commonly mutated genes (BBS1, BBS2 and BBS10) accounting for ∼50% of BBS patients determined mutations only in BBS2, including three novel mutations. Next, three of the remaining patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing with 96% at 20 × depth of coverage that revealed novel BBS4 mutation. Observation of no mutation in the other patients represents the possible presence of novel genes. Screening of the remaining patients for six other genes (BBS3, BBS4, BBS6, BBS7, BBS9 and BBS12) revealed five novel mutations. This result represents another indication for the genetic heterogeneity of BBS and extends the mutational spectrum of the disease by introducing nine novel mutations in five BBS genes. In conclusion, although BBS1 and BBS10 are among the most commonly mutated genes in other populations like Caucasian, these two seem not to have an important role in Iranian patients. This suggests that a different strategy in molecular genetics diagnostic approaches in Middle Eastern countries such as Iran should be considered.","dc:creator":"Fattahi Z","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mutation profile of BBS genes in Iranian patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome: genetic characterization and report of nine novel mutations in five BBS genes."}},"rdfs:label":"40568"},{"id":"cggv:03fceb24-7cd3-40c3-b822-b4111a9ca05a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:03fceb24-7cd3-40c3-b822-b4111a9ca05a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:988d537d-5595-4b8f-bbc4-8e3aefc025fa_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:587584ed-306c-44d7-b0e8-f320b7093db7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:587584ed-306c-44d7-b0e8-f320b7093db7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":30,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c67065b6-4ab5-48ff-bec1-744ce98ebf5a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033028.5(BBS4):c.220+1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342422"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"polydactyly both hands;

BBS has been modeled historically as an autosomal recessive trait, under which premise six independent BBS loci (BBS1-BBS6) have been mapped in the human genome. However, extended mutational analyses of BBS2 and BBS6, the first two BBS genes cloned, suggest that BBS exhibits a more complex pattern of inheritance, in which three mutations at two loci simultaneously are necessary and sufficient in some families to manifest the phenotype. We evaluated the spectrum of mutations in the recently identified BBS4 gene with a combination of haplotype analysis and mutation screening on a multiethnic cohort of 177 families. Consistent with predictions from previous genetic analyses, our data suggest that mutations in BBS4 contribute to BBS in <3% of affected families. Furthermore, integrated mutational data from all three currently cloned BBS genes raise the possibility that BBS4 may participate in triallelic inheritance with BBS2 and BBS1, but not the other known loci. Establishment of the loci pairing in triallelism is likely to be important for the elucidation of the functional relationships among the different BBS proteins.","dc:creator":"Katsanis N","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"BBS4 is a minor contributor to Bardet-Biedl syndrome and may also participate in triallelic inheritance."}},"rdfs:label":"KK021-10"},{"id":"cggv:ab246800-0516-475f-87c9-3faaf0f8011c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab246800-0516-475f-87c9-3faaf0f8011c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downscore homozygous null per Retina GCEP"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:988d537d-5595-4b8f-bbc4-8e3aefc025fa_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:7442473f-a25e-43bc-9dcc-448a307de56e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7442473f-a25e-43bc-9dcc-448a307de56e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:b9926f4c-3a53-4688-8930-a2cfafa85719","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033028.5(BBS4):c.1091C>A (p.Ala364Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254672"}},{"id":"cggv:624794d4-a0f0-4e30-9934-dd74a25221f7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033028.5(BBS4):c.332+2_332+3insTT","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7646578"}}],"detectionMethod":"18 genes related to BBS were sequenced ","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"retinitis pigmentosa; intellectual disability affecting cognitive skills, language skills, and motor skills","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001829","obo:HP_0025502","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001397","obo:HP_0000026","obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0001161"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:592daa85-593a-4bcc-84c6-c066878fa671_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:624794d4-a0f0-4e30-9934-dd74a25221f7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31196119","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare inherited multisystemic disorder with autosomal recessive or complex digenic triallelic inheritance.

To date, 14 BBS genes have been identified, 3 of which have been found mutated only in a single BBS family each (BBS11/TRIM32, BBS13/MKS1 and BBS14/MKS4/NPHP6). Previous reports of systematic mutation detection in large cohorts of BBS families (n > 90) have dealt only with a single gene, or at most small subsets of the known BBS genes. Here we report extensive analysis of a cohort of 174 BBS families for 12/14 genes, leading to the identification of 28 novel mutations. Two pathogenic mutations in a single gene have been found in 117 families, and a single heterozygous mutation in 17 families (of which 8 involve the BBS1 recurrent mutation, M390R). We confirm that BBS1 and BBS10 are the most frequently mutated genes, followed by BBS12. No mutations have been found in BBS11/TRIM32, the identification of which as a BBS gene only relies on a single missense mutation in a single consanguineous family. While a third variant allele has been observed in a few families, they are in most cases missenses of uncertain pathogenicity, contrasting with the type of mutations observed as two alleles in a single gene. We discuss the various strategies for diagnostic mutation detection, including homozygosity mapping and targeted arrays for the detection of previously reported mutations.","dc:creator":"Muller J","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Identification of 28 novel mutations in the Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes: the burden of private mutations in an extensively heterogeneous disease."}},"rdfs:label":"III.2"},{"id":"cggv:8fa17206-13fe-42bd-951e-9a63d946f924","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8fa17206-13fe-42bd-951e-9a63d946f924_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4e3eb2d1-be71-4ee9-ba44-447bb5b5f99c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e3eb2d1-be71-4ee9-ba44-447bb5b5f99c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a128a9cd-a242-49e6-b32c-aeef41fc729b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033028.5(BBS4):c.829G>A (p.Gly277Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA393078625"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0002370","obo:HP_0002463","obo:HP_0001513","obo:HP_0001328","obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0002251","obo:HP_0000486"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:76275a38-963e-4c9d-bf4c-184f85c8489b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a128a9cd-a242-49e6-b32c-aeef41fc729b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24849935"},"rdfs:label":"34881"},{"id":"cggv:76275a38-963e-4c9d-bf4c-184f85c8489b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76275a38-963e-4c9d-bf4c-184f85c8489b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f0163aae-0595-4f43-8642-12d5674209a9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0163aae-0595-4f43-8642-12d5674209a9","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2259a5ec-163d-41be-973b-ebf32046e56c"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:f33fe16c-5bbe-4f8c-bcac-aad45d922234_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2259a5ec-163d-41be-973b-ebf32046e56c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11381270"},"rdfs:label":"Israeli Arab_male proband"},{"id":"cggv:f33fe16c-5bbe-4f8c-bcac-aad45d922234","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f33fe16c-5bbe-4f8c-bcac-aad45d922234_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3f6443ac-ab7d-46e6-a8a8-143e2bbc5ea3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f6443ac-ab7d-46e6-a8a8-143e2bbc5ea3","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:96681523-5ad1-4b4e-94e9-49a4dece04e2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033028.5(BBS4):c.1180C>T (p.Gln394Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA393080103"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0001513","obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0010442"],"secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:605e78e6-0c58-47d7-9e1d-84f1b0258b34_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:96681523-5ad1-4b4e-94e9-49a4dece04e2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27894351","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Ciliopathies are clinically diverse disorders of the primary cilium.

Initial reports and subsequent publications describe Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4 (MIM# 615982) as characterized by retinal degeneration (typically described as rod-cone dystrophy) plus a range of extraocular features, most commonly obesity, intellectual disability, developmental delay, polydactyly, and/or male hypogonadism. Other reported features of BBS4-related cases include additional ocular findings (myopia, strabismus), hearing anomalies, additional skeletal differences (syndactyly, brachydactyly, clinodactyly, club foot), dental anomalies, atypical behavior, poor coordination, kidney disease, abnormal renal morphology, liver abnormalities, cardiac anomalies, cryptorchidism, gastrointestinal concerns, hypertension, metabolic dysfunction, anosmia, and sleep apnea. Most affected individuals are reported to meet clinical criteria for BBS as described by Beales et al., 1999 (PMID: 10874630). Both intra- and inter-familial variability is observed. To our knowledge, there have not been any reports of non-syndromic retinal degeneration due to *BBS4* as has been described with other BBS genes, most notably *BBS1* (PMID: 23143442). However, there is one report of a consanguineous family with three affected siblings reported to have Leber congenital amaurosis (with classic signs of extinguished electroretinogram, infantile nystagmus, and pigmentary retinopathy) with only mild extraocular features reported (delayed walking, delayed speech, mild facial dysmorphism, and enophthalmos) (PMID: 22219648). Per the Retina GCEP, to remain consistent with the disease entities of other *BBS* genes and to reflect the phenotypic variability observed, cases caused by inherited biallelic *BBS4* variants have been referred to as BBS4-related ciliopathy.\n\nThirteen variants (missense, splice site, nonsense, deletion, insertion) that have been reported in fourteen probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 11381270, 12016587, 20177705, 22219648, 24849935, 26518167, 27894351, 31196119) are included in this curation. Most reported individuals have a homozygous *BBS4* variant as the likely disease-causing variant, and consanguinity is commonly reported in these affected individuals. Of note, while oligogenic inheritance has been suggested for BBS, including BBS4-related BBS (PMID: 12016587), probands with other disease-causing *BBS* variants or biallelic variants (regardless of classification) in other BBS genes were excluded from the curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal and cell culture models, expression studies, and *in vitro* functional assays (PMIDs: 11381270,  15107855, 15173597, 15322545, 16794820, 17574030, 22219648, 23716571, 24500759, 30665891, 32759308). *BBS4* is ubiquitously expressed, and studies show expression in disease-associated tissues including retina, kidney, and adipose tissue, with the highest expression in kidney (PMID: 11381270). This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that *BBS4* encodes a component of the BBSome, a protein complex that functions in ciliogenesis (PMID: 32759308). BBS4 localizes to the primary cilia, and BBS4 immunoprecipitation results in co-purification of BBS1 and 6 other proteins encoded by genes implicated in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS1, BBS2, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9) (PMIDs: 17574030, 32759308). Bbs4-deficient renal cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells show abnormal ciliogenesis (PMID: 23716571, 32759308). In addition, *BBS4* silenced preadipocytes have increased fat accumulation and increased triglycerides (PMID: 24500759). *Bbs4* knockdown in zebrafish results in shortened body axis, broadened somites, kinked notochord, and mislocalization of rhodopsin in the retina. The abnormal phenotypes in morphant zebrafish are rescued by wild-type *BBS4* mRNA (PMID: 22219648). Phenotypes observed in *Bbs4* null mice reflect both retinal and syndromic features from the human disease. Retinal degeneration, obesity, metabolic disturbances, liver dysfunction, decreased olfactory responses, and atypical behaviors have been observed in *Bbs4* null mice  in addition to ciliary defects (PMIDs: 15173597, 15322545, 16794820).\n\nIn summary, *BBS4* is definitively associated with BBS4-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:988d537d-5595-4b8f-bbc4-8e3aefc025fa"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
