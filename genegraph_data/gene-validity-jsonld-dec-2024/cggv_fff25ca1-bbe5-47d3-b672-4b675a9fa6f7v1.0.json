Genomic sequencing of the patient's DNA showed a 1-bp insertion (IVS16+1510insA) 700 bp upstream of the intron 16 splice site, but it was unclear whether or not this change caused the in-frame skipping of exon 16. Immortalized patient cells showed decreased but detectable PRKDC protein, but no detectable kinase activity; the mother's cells had about 50% residual PRKDC kinase activity. Patient cells showed a defect in DNA DSB repair following irradiation, which was rescued with expression of wildtype PRKDC. The A3574V substitution occurred at a highly conserved residue within the FAT domain, which lies outside the kinase domain. Cells transfected with the mutation showed impaired PRKDC function in response to irradiation and a less severe defect in V(D)J end-joining, suggesting that the missense mutation retained some functional capacity. Functional studies of cells lacking exon 16 suggested that it represented a null allele. The overall findings were consistent with a loss of function. In addition to SCID, the patient had microcephaly, brain malformations, hearing loss, visual impairment, and little developmental progress; he died at age 31 months with intractable seizures.

We conclude that as is the case in C.B-17 SCID mice and in Arabian SCID foals, the defective factor in these SCID puppies is DNA-PKcs. In mice, it has been clearly established that DNA-PKcs deficiency produces an incomplete block in V(D)J recombination, resulting in \"leaky\" coding joint formation and only a modest defect in signal end ligation. In contrast, DNA-PKcs deficiency in horses profoundly blocks both coding and signal end joining. Here, we show that although DNA-PKcs deficiency in canine lymphocytes results in a block in both coding and signal end joining, the deficit in both is intermediate between that seen in SCID mice and SCID foals. These data demonstrate significant species variation in the absolute necessity for DNA-PKcs during V(D)J recombination.

The phenotype of patients with DNA-PKcs deficiency can be variable but may include: a spectrum of combined immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, progressive pulmonary disease, growth retardation, dysmorphic facies, neurologic abnormalities, and autoimmunity. \nPRKDC encodes the catalytic subunit of a nuclear DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (DNA-PK) which is involved in NHEJ during DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and for V(D)J recombination during immune development. Patients with hypomorphic mutations, with partially preserved T and B cell development, can present with signs of autoimmunity owing to the role of DNA-PKcs in regulating expression of AutoImmune-Regulator (AIRE)-dependent peripheral tissue antigens during thymocyte selection. It is a rare inborn error of immunity. Thus far, pathogenic missense variations and splicing abnormalities have been reported in several publications (PMIDs: 19075392, 23722905, 30121298, 25842288, 26546606, 26122175, 30778343, 29921932) and many are included in this curation. Nonsense or frameshift variants have not yet been described in humans.\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be hypomorphic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers have not been shown to have a clinical phenotype. This gene-disease association is also supported by accompanying experimental evidence in both PRKDC-deficient patients (PMIDs 19075392, 23722905, 26546606). and animal models (PMIDs 8524788, 11489998, 22981234, 27566103). \nIn summary, PRKDC is definitively associated with autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency due to DNA-PKcs deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
