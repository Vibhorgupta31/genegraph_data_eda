However, the cellular function of the C9ORF72 protein remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 regulates endosomal trafficking. C9ORF72 colocalized with Rab proteins implicated in autophagy and endocytic transport: Rab1, Rab5, Rab7 and Rab11 in neuronal cell lines, primary cortical neurons and human spinal cord motor neurons, consistent with previous predictions that C9ORF72 bears Rab guanine exchange factor activity. Consistent with this notion, C9ORF72 was present in the extracellular space and as cytoplasmic vesicles. Depletion of C9ORF72 using siRNA inhibited transport of Shiga toxin from the plasma membrane to Golgi apparatus, internalization of TrkB receptor and altered the ratio of autophagosome marker light chain 3 (LC3) II:LC3I, indicating that C9ORF72 regulates endocytosis and autophagy. C9ORF72 also colocalized with ubiquilin-2 and LC3-positive vesicles, and co-migrated with lysosome-stained vesicles in neuronal cell lines, providing further evidence that C9ORF72 regulates autophagy. Investigation of proteins interacting with C9ORF72 using mass spectrometry identified other proteins implicated in ALS; ubiquilin-2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1, and actin. Treatment of cells overexpressing C9ORF72 with proteasome inhibitors induced the formation of stress granules positive for hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2/B1. Immunohistochemistry of C9ORF72 ALS patient motor neurons revealed increased colocalization between C9ORF72 and Rab7 and Rab11 compared with controls, suggesting possible dysregulation of trafficking in patients bearing the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. Hence, this study identifies a role for C9ORF72 in Rab-mediated cellular trafficking.","dc:creator":"Farg MA","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"C9ORF72, implicated in amytrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, regulates endosomal trafficking."},"rdfs:label":"Endogenous C9ORF72 interacts with hnRNPA1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"ALS GCEP chose to apply a gene-specific attenuation to downgrade protein interaction scores due to the high number of protein interactions observed for hnRNPA1 with proteins of interest.

Mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma/Translocated in Liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) gene cause a subset of familial ALS cases and are also implicated in sporadic ALS. FUS is typically localized to the nucleus. The ALS-related FUS mutations cause cytoplasmic mis-localization and the formation of stress granule-like structures. Abnormal cytoplasmic FUS localization was also found in a subset of frontotemporal dementia (FTLD) cases without FUS mutations. To better understand the function of FUS, we performed wild-type and mutant FUS pull-downs followed by proteomic identification of the interacting proteins. The FUS interacting partners we identified are involved in multiple pathways, including chromosomal organization, transcription, RNA splicing, RNA transport, localized translation, and stress response. FUS interacted with hnRNPA1 and Matrin-3, RNA binding proteins whose mutations were also reported to cause familial ALS, suggesting that hnRNPA1 and Matrin-3 may play common pathogenic roles with FUS. The FUS interactions displayed varied RNA dependence. Numerous FUS interacting partners that we identified are components of exosomes. We found that FUS itself was present in exosomes, suggesting that the secretion of FUS might contribute to the cell-to-cell spreading of FUS pathology. FUS interacting proteins were sequestered into the cytoplasmic mutant FUS inclusions that could lead to their mis-regulation or loss of function, contributing to ALS pathogenesis.

Also repeated GST-pull-down assays, but this time used purified bacterially expressed His-hnRNPA1 as ligand, and revealed preferential binding of His-hnRNPA1 with GST-ubiquilin-2 (Fig. 3C and D).\n\nConfirmed interaction by immunoprecipitating ubiquilin from HeLa cells using a pan-ubiquilin-specific antibody (Figure 4A). Because multiple ubiquilin proteins are expressed in HeLa cells (ubiquilin-1, 2 and 4 proteins), they next investigated whether hnRNPA1 binds ubiquilin-2. HeLa cells were either mock transfected or transfected with expression plasmids encoding either full-length HA-tagged ubiquilin-2 by itself or together with full-length Myc-tagged hnRNPA1.

Most mutations in UBQLN2 are missense mutations that occur in and around a PXX repeat motif located in the central domain of the encoded protein. However, neither the function of the PXX motif nor the mechanism by which mutations in UBQLN2 cause ALS is known. We screened a yeast two-hybrid library using the central domain of ubiquilin-2 hoping to identify proteins whose binding is affected by the UBQLN2 mutations. Three such interactors were identified-hnRNPA1, hnRNPA3 and hnRNPU-all members of the hnRNP family. The interacting region in each of these proteins was their glycine-rich domain, the domain most frequently mutated in hnRNP-related proteins that cause ALS. We focused on hnRNPA1, because a mutation in the protein causes ALS. We confirmed the interaction between wild-type (WT) ubiquilin-2 and hnRNPA1 proteins in vitro and in cells. In contrast, all five ALS mutations in ubiquilin-2 that we examined had reduced binding with WT hnRNPA1. In addition, hnRNPA1 carrying the D262V missense mutation that causes ALS failed to bind WT ubiquilin-2. Overexpression of ubiquilin-2 containing the ALS mutations increased cell death and, for several of the mutants, this correlated with increased translocation of hnRNPA1 to the cytoplasm. Knockdown of ubiquilin-2 led to increased turnover of hnRNPA1, indicating ubiquilin-2 functions to stabilize hnRNPA1.
