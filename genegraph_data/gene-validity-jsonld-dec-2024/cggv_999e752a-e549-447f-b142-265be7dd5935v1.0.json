Here, we identify loss-of-function mutations in CCDC114 causing PCD with laterality malformations involving complex heart defects. CCDC114 is homologous to DCC2, an ODA microtubule-docking complex component of the biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas. We show that CCDC114 localizes along the entire length of human cilia and that its deficiency causes a complete absence of ciliary ODAs, resulting in immotile cilia. Thus, CCDC114 is an essential ciliary protein required for microtubular attachment of ODAs in the axoneme. Fertility is apparently not greatly affected by CCDC114 deficiency, and qPCR shows that this may explained by low transcript expression in testis compared to ciliated respiratory epithelium. One CCDC114 mutation, c.742G>A, dating back to at least the 1400s, presents an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in the isolated Dutch Volendam population.","dc:creator":"Onoufriadis A","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Splice-site mutations in the axonemal outer dynein arm docking complex gene CCDC114 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23261302","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal-recessive disorder, characterized by oto-sino-pulmonary disease and situs abnormalities. PCD-causing mutations have been identified in 14 genes, but they collectively account for only ~60% of all PCD. To identify mutations that cause PCD, we performed exome sequencing on six unrelated probands with ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) defects. Mutations in CCDC114, an ortholog of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii motility gene DCC2, were identified in a family with two affected siblings. Sanger sequencing of 67 additional individuals with PCD with ODA defects from 58 families revealed CCDC114 mutations in 4 individuals in 3 families. All 6 individuals with CCDC114 mutations had characteristic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, but none had situs abnormalities. In the remaining 5 individuals with PCD who underwent exome sequencing, we identified mutations in two genes (DNAI2, DNAH5) known to cause PCD, including an Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation in DNAI2. These results revealed that mutations in CCDC114 are a cause of ciliary dysmotility and PCD and further demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing to identify genetic causes in heterogeneous recessive disorders.","dc:creator":"Knowles MR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Exome sequencing identifies mutations in CCDC114 as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia."}],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:999e752a-e549-447f-b142-265be7dd5935_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:999e752a-e549-447f-b142-265be7dd5935_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d3031bce-ffab-4528-9804-e673d412efa4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36897af7-a7a3-4ff2-af1e-7b3d8079cec9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In controls, CCDC114 antisera decorates the full length of the cilia (Figure 3B), suggesting that its putative role in tethering of outer dynein arms is required along the entire axoneme.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23261303","rdfs:label":"Protein localization of ODAD1 by IF in ciliated epithelium"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f85f8029-97fc-4d5f-bd68-7e0edc6f4ca5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ff65f51-2b0b-42a1-85e0-7f89d6a67769","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Expression analysis via RT-PCR reveals that CCDC114 shows a similar pattern of expression (e.g., high in lung and testis) as DNAI1, mutations in which cause PCD with ciliary ODA defects","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23261302","rdfs:label":"Expression Analysis of ODAD1 via Reverse-Transcriptase PCR"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:cb0245f6-bc81-4413-8f32-070cb17b99c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e53f6eaf-524f-492f-b396-e66c45fc631c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The experiment indicates a crucial role of ODAD1 during ciliogenesis in human airway cells.

We have cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the M(r) approximately 70,000 protein; the sequence predicts a 62.5-kDa protein with potential homologs in higher ciliated organisms, including humans. Sequencing of corresponding cDNA from strain oda1 revealed it has a mutation resulting in a stop codon just downstream of the initiator ATG; thus, it is unable to make the full-length M(r) approximately 70,000 protein. These results demonstrate that the ODA1 gene encodes the M(r) approximately 70,000 protein, and that the protein is essential for assembly of the ODA-DC and the outer dynein arm onto the doublet microtubule.","dc:creator":"Takada S","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The outer dynein arm-docking complex: composition and characterization of a subunit (oda1) necessary for outer arm assembly."},"rdfs:label":"Characterization of ODAD1 ortholog in Chlamydomonas"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The model organism can not fully recapitulate human phenotype.

It encodes a coiled-coil domain-containing protein that is an essential component of the outer dynein arm-docking complex required for the correct attachment of the ODA to the microtubule doublet (PMID: 35163670). Reported PCD phenotype in patients with *ODAD1* mutations includes decreased nasal nitric oxide, recurrent respiratory tract infections, neonatal respiratory distress, bronchiectasis, and/or situs abnormalities along with ultrastructural ODA defect (PMIDs 23261302 and 23261303). Milder phenotype has been linked to a partially functioning mutant protein which allowed for assembly of some ODAs and a significant level of ciliary activity (PMID: 35163670).\n5 (frameshift and splice site) variants that have been reported in 6 probands carrying biallelic *ODAD1* mutations are included in this curation (PMIDs: 23261302, 23261303 and 35163670). A conserved haplotype is detected to lie in cis with the 853G>A variant, compatible with being a founder mutation (PMID: 23261303). Segregation analysis in multiple Volendam family members confirmed a consistent recessive pattern of inheritance (PMID: 23261303). Lack of infertility among affected family members is suggested to arise from genetic redundancy as CCDC63 could potentially replace CCDC114 function in sperm (PMID: 23261303).\nExperimental evidence also supports this gene disease relationship. Expression analysis via RT-PCR reveals that *ODAD1* shows high expression in lung and testis (PMID: 23261302). Subcellular localization of ODAD1 protein confirmed its expression along the entire length of human cilia (PMID: 23261303). *ODAD1* mutant cilia showed abnormal ciliary motility comprising large areas of static cilia, with occasionally stiff cilia having a twitching or flickering movement that is slow, and ineffective for mucus transport across the epithelial surface (PMID: 23261303). ODAD1 expression in cultured human bronchial cells paralleled the time course of ciliary differentiation and DNAI1 expression which indicates a crucial role in ciliogenesis (PMID: 23261302). The Chlamydomonas orthologue of *ODAD1* (Oda1; Dcc2) has been shown to be a component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC) that is essential for the assembly of the ODA (PMID: 11907279). \n\nIn summary, *ODAD1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 20. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld overtime.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on August 17, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:999e752a-e549-447f-b142-265be7dd5935"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
