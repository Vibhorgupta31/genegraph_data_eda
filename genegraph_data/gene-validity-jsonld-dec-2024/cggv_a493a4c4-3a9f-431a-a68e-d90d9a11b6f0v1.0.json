The OSBPL2-disrupted pigs displayed progressive hearing loss (HL) with degeneration/apoptosis of cochlea hair cells (HCs) and morphological abnormalities in HC stereocilia, as well as hypercholesterolaemia. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding aggravated the development of HL and led to more severe hypercholesterolaemia.
