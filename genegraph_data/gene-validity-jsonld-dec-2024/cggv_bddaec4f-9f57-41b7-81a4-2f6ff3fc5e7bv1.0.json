Like factor H it inhibits complement activation by regulating C3b deposition on targets. Factor H mutations occur in 10-20% of patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). We hypothesized that MCP mutations could predispose to HUS, and we sequenced MCP coding exons in affected individuals from 30 families. MCP mutations were detected in affected individuals of three families: a deletion of two amino acids (D237/S238) in family 1 (heterozygous) and a substitution, S206P, in families 2 (heterozygous) and 3 (homozygous). We evaluated protein expression and function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these individuals. An individual with the D237/S238 deletion had reduced MCP levels and approximately 50% C3b binding compared with normal controls. Individuals with the S206P change expressed normal quantities of protein, but demonstrated approximately 50% reduction in C3b binding in heterozygotes and complete lack of C3b binding in homozygotes. MCP expression and function was evaluated in transfectants reproducing these mutations. The deletion mutant was retained intracellularly. S206P protein was expressed on the cell surface but had a reduced ability to prevent complement activation, consistent with its reduced C3b binding and cofactor activity. This study presents further evidence that complement dysregulation predisposes to development of thrombotic microangiopathy and that screening patients for such defects could provide informed treatment strategies.","dc:creator":"Richards A","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in human complement regulator, membrane cofactor protein (CD46), predispose to development of familial hemolytic uremic syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bddaec4f-9f57-41b7-81a4-2f6ff3fc5e7b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bddaec4f-9f57-41b7-81a4-2f6ff3fc5e7b_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7},{"id":"cggv:47a9fc06-6457-4c05-862e-72ef263ac749_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47a9fc06-6457-4c05-862e-72ef263ac749","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:03e25428-47b0-4b7d-95ad-e473a99820ca","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_172351.3(CD46):c.286+2T>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1371568"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e83ecc2c-0e5d-4e09-9195-aee5a0024ada_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:03e25428-47b0-4b7d-95ad-e473a99820ca"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29644059","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the ","dc:creator":"Khandelwal P","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mutations in "}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Pt 2 "},{"id":"cggv:e83ecc2c-0e5d-4e09-9195-aee5a0024ada","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e83ecc2c-0e5d-4e09-9195-aee5a0024ada_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:de1bcd94-637f-430a-ba4b-8659f2fd8712_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de1bcd94-637f-430a-ba4b-8659f2fd8712","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":22,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f52508bc-7fc1-4aef-a7dd-582b21426aac","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_172351.3(CD46):c.175C>T (p.Arg59Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA257686"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypeFreeText":"Hematuria, hemolytic uremic syndrome, fever","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0005575","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:630256d3-c9c6-432e-b1ee-a30049fadf54_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f52508bc-7fc1-4aef-a7dd-582b21426aac"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23780777","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We describe a case of a 22-year-old man who presented with clinical features of atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome and in whom genetic analysis of complement regulatory proteins demonstrated a CD46 mutation.

This study looked for MCP mutations in a panel of 120 patients with aHUS. In this cohort, approximately 10% of patients with aHUS (11 patients; nine pedigrees) have mutations in MCP.

The majority of patients have a mutation that causes reduced MCP surface expression. A small proportion expressed normal levels of a dysfunctional protein. As in other studies, incomplete penetrance is shown, suggesting that MCP is a predisposing factor rather than a direct causal factor. The low level of recurrence of aHUS in transplantation in patients with MCP mutations is confirmed, and the first MCP null individuals are described.

As a widely distributed membrane protein, MCP may protect host cells from inadvertent C activation. Human MCP has recently been shown to protect transfected rodent cells from human C-mediated lysis. In this report the relationship of MCP expression to C3b deposition and cytoprotection was examined using NIH/3T3 cells transfected with human MCP and exposed to human serum as a source of C and naturally occurring anti-mouse antibody. MCP inhibited C3b deposition in a dose-dependent fashion and inhibited lysis of the mouse cells expressing it. MCP did not inhibit lysis on bystander cells. These results demonstrate the protective role of MCP, at the cellular level, by an intrinsic mechanism.","dc:creator":"Oglesby TJ","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Membrane cofactor protein (CD46) protects cells from complement-mediated attack by an intrinsic mechanism."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse NIH/3T3 cells transfected with human CD46 (MCP)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:bddaec4f-9f57-41b7-81a4-2f6ff3fc5e7b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8f8cb44-8678-44d0-b2d3-8b1daceac639","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87a72cd6-77cb-4618-b4b7-c4d9c4f2d7ec","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"CD46 is localized to glomeruli, but especially also to proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs).\nHowever, human cell culture models to assess CD46 function on RPTECs are still missing. \nGene editing of RPTEC/TERT1 cells generating a monoclonal CD46-/- cell line that did not show changes of the primary cell like characteristics. \nFactor I and CD46-mediated cleavage of C4b into soluble C4c and membrane deposited C4d was clearly reduced in the knock-out cell line as compared to the maternal cells. \nHuman CD46-/- PTECs will be of interest to dissect the roles of the epithelium and the kidney in various complement activation mediated tubulointerstitial pathologies or in studying CD46 mediated uropathogenic internalization of bacteria. \nTelomerized cells can be used in the generation of knock-out, knock-in or any kind of reporter cell lines without losing the primary cell characteristics of the maternal cells. \n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30958843","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The kidney is especially sensitive to diseases associated with overactivation of the complement system. While most of these diseases affect kidney glomeruli and the microvasculature, there is also evidence for tubulointerstitial deposition of complement factors. Complement inactivating factors on cell membranes comprise CD55, CD59 and CD46, which is also termed membrane cofactor protein (MCP). CD46 has been described as localized to glomeruli, but especially also to proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). However, human cell culture models to assess CD46 function on RPTECs are still missing. Therefore, we here performed gene editing of RPTEC/TERT1 cells generating a monoclonal CD46-/- cell line that did not show changes of the primary cell like characteristics. In addition, factor I and CD46-mediated cleavage of C4b into soluble C4c and membrane deposited C4d was clearly reduced in the knock-out cell line as compared to the maternal cells. Thus, human CD46-/- proximal tubular epithelial cells will be of interest to dissect the roles of the epithelium and the kidney in various complement activation mediated tubulointerstitial pathologies or in studying CD46 mediated uropathogenic internalization of bacteria. In addition, this gives proof-of-principle, that telomerized cells can be used in the generation of knock-out, knock-in or any kind of reporter cell lines without losing the primary cell characteristics of the maternal cells.","dc:creator":"Wieser M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"CD46 knock-out using CRISPR/Cas9 editing of hTERT immortalized human cells modulates complement activation."},"rdfs:label":"Human Cell Culture model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:31b93a36-c255-42be-881a-f433b152bdf6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02e6e1cf-a206-4407-8b1c-86dc521ee6a0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Reduced expression of wild-type MCP, as seen in aHUS patients, decreased protection against C3b deposition by the alternative pathway.

Approximately 50% of patients bear a mutation in one of three complement control proteins, factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46). Another membrane regulator that is closely related to MCP, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) thus far has shown no association with aHUS and continues to be investigated. The goal of this study was to compare the regulatory profile of MCP and DAF and to assess how alterations in MCP predispose to complement dysregulation. We employed a model system of complement activation on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants. The four regularly expressed isoforms of MCP and DAF inhibited C3b deposition by the alternative pathway. DAF, but not MCP, inhibited the classical pathway. Most patients with MCP-aHUS are heterozygous and express only 25-50% of the wild-type protein. We, therefore, analyzed the effect of reduced levels of wild-type MCP and found that cells with lowered expression levels were less efficient in inhibiting alternative pathway activation. Further, a dysfunctional MCP mutant, expressed at normal levels and identified in five patients with aHUS (S206P), failed to protect against C3b amplification on CHO cells, even if expression levels were increased 10-fold. Our results add new information relative to the necessity for appropriate expression levels of MCP and further implicate the alternative pathway in disease processes such as aHUS.","dc:creator":"Liszewski MK","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Modeling how CD46 deficiency predisposes to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8511,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:fafe9369-755e-4f66-97e5-4971faf67f02","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016244","gene":"hgnc:6953","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CD46 was first reported in relation to semidominant atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in 2003 (Richards et al., PMID:14566051). Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury. C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G) is characterized by hematuria, proteinuria and histopathologically by accumulation of the C3 component of complement in kidney tissue. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into separate entities, aHUS (OMIM: 612925) and C3G (OMIM: 613779). The split curation for semidominant C3G has been curated separately.\n\nThe relationship between CD46 and aHUS was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework. Seven variants (two missense, three nonsense, two splice site) that have been reported in seven probands in six publications (PMIDs: 14566051, 14615110, 16762990, 23780777, 20513133, 33238263) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including expression studies (PMID:14615110), functional alteration (PMID:1588280), protein interaction (PMID:16762990) and Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) cell model (PMID:17027083) and Human cell culture model (PMID: 30958843). The effect of reduced levels of wild-type CD46 showed that cells with lowered expression levels were less efficient in inhibiting alternative pathway activation (PMID:1588280). Further, a dysfunctional CD46 mutant, expressed at normal levels and identified in five patients with aHUS (S206P), failed to protect against C3b amplification on CHO cells, even if expression levels were increased 10-fold (PMID:1588280). Cell lysates were used to analyze the functional profile of the mutated proteins (PMID:16762990). CD46 E145Q, variant has approximately 50% of expected C4b cofactor activity, whereas G162R has no detectable C4b cofactor activity. Because G162R binds C4b normally, this is a mutation that selectively alters protease cleavage of C4b by factor I (PMID:1588280). In Chinese Hamster ovary cell model, reduced expression of wild-type CD46, as seen in aHUS patients, decreased protection against C3b deposition by the alternative pathway (PMID:17027083). A dysfunctional, but normally expressed form of CD46 (S206P) found in the two unrelated families with aHUS, was ~10% as effective as wild type against C3b amplification mediated by the alternative pathway or its feedback loop (PMID:17027083). In a human cell culture model, CD46 is localized to glomeruli, but especially also to proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). Factor I and CD46-mediated cleavage of C4b into soluble C4c and membrane deposited C4d was clearly reduced in the knock-out cell line as compared to the maternal cells (PMID:30958843). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CD46 and semidominant aHUS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement Mediated Kidney Disease GCEP on the meeting date July 6, 2023.
