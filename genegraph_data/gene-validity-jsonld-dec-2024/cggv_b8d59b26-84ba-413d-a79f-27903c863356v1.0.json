While mutations in POLG1, the gene encoding the gamma subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, have been associated with Alpers syndrome with liver failure (Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome), the genetic cause of Alpers syndrome in most patients remains unidentified. With whole exome sequencing we have identified mutations in NARS2 and PARS2, the genes encoding the mitochondrial asparaginyl-and prolyl-tRNA synthetases, in two patients with Alpers syndrome. One of the patients was homozygous for a missense mutation (c.641C>T, p.P214L) in NARS2. The affected residue is predicted to be located in the stem of a loop that participates in dimer interaction. The other patient was compound heterozygous for a one base insertion (c.1130dupC, p.K378 fs*1) that creates a premature stop codon and a missense mutation (c.836C>T, p.S279L) located in a conserved motif of unknown function in PARS2.

tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are highly conserved enzymes that link amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Thirty-seven ARSs are known and their deficiencies cause various genetic disorders. Variants in some ARSs are associated with the autosomal dominant inherited form of axonal neuropathy, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Variants of genes encoding ARSs often cause disorders in an autosomal recessive fashion. The clinical features of cytosolic ARS deficiencies are more variable, including systemic features. Deficiencies of ARSs localized in the mitochondria are often associated with neurological disorders including Leigh and early-onset epileptic syndromes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is an efficient way to identify the genes causing various symptoms in patients. We identified 4 pedigrees with novel compound heterozygous variants in ARS genes (WARS1, MARS1, AARS2, and PARS2) by WES. Some unique manifestations were noted. The number of patients with ARSs has been increasing since the application of WES. Our findings broaden the known genetic and clinical spectrum associated with ARS variants.","dc:creator":"Okamoto N","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Four pedigrees with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase abnormalities."}},{"id":"cggv:b50fa3c0-1305-4d94-8684-897b43262580_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2dff1e2d-b324-443b-9471-847d60bc38d9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34585293"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 5"},{"id":"cggv:d9243fb2-fca2-4994-95c3-45de2f65d5fb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9243fb2-fca2-4994-95c3-45de2f65d5fb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:b50fa3c0-1305-4d94-8684-897b43262580","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b50fa3c0-1305-4d94-8684-897b43262580_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Occurs in exon 2/2 but 373/476 aa's truncated (78%)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.15},{"id":"cggv:b8d59b26-84ba-413d-a79f-27903c863356_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b8d59b26-84ba-413d-a79f-27903c863356_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:18f78574-2482-4fd4-a72d-7b428db99181","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b550667-b8db-4d23-93bc-9c8605b69552","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"PMID: 27536729 see MT-TP 5 adults with abnormal muscle biopsy including complex I and IV deficiency consistent with mtDNA translation\n\nAlso see: C12ORF65, MT-TP, MT-TI, MT-TK, MT-TL1, MT-TL2, MT-TV, MT-TW ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29980628","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Diagnosing primary mitochondrial diseases is challenging in clinical practice. Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.","dc:creator":"Boczonadi V","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial DNA transcription and translation: clinical syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Review of mitochondrial translation disorders "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10+ genes with mitochondrial disease association implicated in mitochondrial translation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5241,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":6.15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:37e8ea80-9927-489c-836b-90c127af9e46","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:30563","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *PARS2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of June 16, 2022. The *PARS2* gene encodes mitochondrial prolyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe *PARS2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2015 (PMID: 25629079). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *PARS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *PARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one nonsense variant, one frameshift variant, and six unique missense variants from eight publications (PMIDs: 25629079, 27290639, 29410512, 28077841, 29915213, 32514400, 32071833, 30237576, 34585293). Affected individuals have been reported to have infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy, microcephaly, brain MRI showing progressive volume loss of the frontal lobes, and cardiomyopathy. While reported cases showed a markedly consistent clinical phenotype, mitochondrial respiratory chain testing is often normal in various tissues. Family segregation data were reviewed and summarized (PMIDs: 27290639, 29410512), however the summed LOD score did not meet criteria to be considered evidence in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease.\n\nThe final score for this gene-disease curation was 6.2, which falls between limited and moderate.  This expert panel agreed to move this classification to moderate given the markedly consistent phenotype across multiple patients in the literature. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June,16 2022 (SOP Version 9). \nGCI error gives only 0.2 points for homozygous missense variants without functional evidence. Score should be 0.25 per Gene Clinical Validity Curation Process Standard Operating Procedure v9, reaching total score of 6.2\n\nOf note, the GCI does contain a mechanism to score the homozygous case from PMID: 30237576 at 0.25 points (options are 0, 0.2, 0.5) per SOPv9. This accounts explains the discrepancy in summary (6.2) from GCI (6.15).\n\nGiven consistency of clinical phenotype and borderline limited/moderate score, Mitochondrial Disease GCEP voted to score PARS2 at Moderate ","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b8d59b26-84ba-413d-a79f-27903c863356"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
