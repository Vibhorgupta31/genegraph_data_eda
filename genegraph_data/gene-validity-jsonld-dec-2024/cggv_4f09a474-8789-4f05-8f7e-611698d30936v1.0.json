Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel Rab18-mutant mouse model of WARBM. Rab18-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, Rab18-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in Rab18-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of Rab18 is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in Rab18-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the Rab18-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.","dc:creator":"Carpanini SM","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton."},"rdfs:label":"Rab18 knockout mice (genetrap)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ffe566e4-fbc0-45e0-80c9-2e9fd1d317cf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7081c9ca-8538-4f4a-8a18-b427bc1d65d9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Microphthalmia was observed in this zebrafish model.

Previously, identification of mutations in RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2 in both these syndromes implicated dysregulation of the RAB3 cycle (which controls calcium-mediated exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones) in disease pathogenesis. RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2 encode the catalytic and noncatalytic subunits of the hetrodimeric enzyme RAB3GAP (RAB3GTPase-activating protein), a key regulator of the RAB3 cycle. We performed autozygosity mapping in five consanguineous families without RAB3GAP1/2 mutations and identified loss-of-function mutations in RAB18. A c.71T > A (p.Leu24Gln) founder mutation was identified in four Pakistani families, and a homozygous exon 2 deletion (predicted to result in a frameshift) was found in the fifth family. A single family whose members were compound heterozygotes for an anti-termination mutation of the stop codon c.619T > C (p.X207QextX20) and an inframe arginine deletion c.277_279 del (p.Arg93 del) were identified after direct gene sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of a further 58 families. Nucleotide binding assays for RAB18(Leu24Gln) and RAB18(Arg93del) showed that these mutant proteins were functionally null in that they were unable to bind guanine. The clinical features of Warburg Micro syndrome patients with RAB3GAP1 or RAB3GAP2 mutations and RAB18 mutations are indistinguishable, although the role of RAB18 in trafficking is still emerging, and it has not been linked previously to the RAB3 pathway. Knockdown of rab18 in zebrafish suggests that it might have a conserved developmental role. Our findings imply that RAB18 has a critical role in human brain and eye development and neurodegeneration.","dc:creator":"Bem D","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Loss-of-function mutations in RAB18 cause Warburg micro syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish rab18b morpholino"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Zebrafish has two RAB18 homologs, rab18a and rab18b.

Despite loss of Rab18 had been reported to induce disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum structure and neuronal cytoskeleton organization, parts of the pathogenic mechanism caused by RAB18 mutation remain unclear. From the N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutagenesis library, we identified a mouse line whose Rab18 was knocked out. This Rab18(-/-) mouse exhibited stomping gait, smaller testis and eyes, mimicking several features of WARBM. Rab18(-/-) mice were obviously less sensitive to pain and touch than WT mice. Histological examinations on Rab18(-/-) mice revealed progressive axonal degeneration in the optic nerves, dorsal column of the spinal cord and sensory roots of the spinal nerves while the motor roots were spared. All the behavioral and pathological changes that resulted from abnormalities in the sensory axons were prevented by introducing an extra copy of Rab18 transgene in Rab18(-/-) mice. Our results reveal that sensory axonal degeneration is the primary cause of stomping gait and progressive weakness of the hind limbs in Rab18(-/-) mice, and optic nerve degeneration should be the major pathology of progressive optic atrophy in children with WARBM. Our results indicate that the sensory nervous system is more vulnerable to Rab18 deficiency and WARBM is not only a neurodevelopmental but also neurodegenerative disease.

This report provides an up to date overview of all known disease variants identified in 29 previously published families and 52 new families. One-hundred and forty-four Micro and nine Martsolf families were investigated, identifying mutations in RAB3GAP1 in 41% of cases, mutations in RAB3GAP2 in 7% of cases, and mutations in RAB18 in 5% of cases. These are listed in Leiden Open source Variation Databases, which was created by us for all three genes. Genotype-phenotype correlations for these genes have now established that the clinical phenotypes in Micro syndrome and MS represent a phenotypic continuum related to the nature and severity of the mutations present in the disease genes, with more deleterious mutations causing Micro syndrome and milder mutations causing MS. RAB18 has not yet been linked to the RAB3 pathways, but mutations in all three genes cause an indistinguishable phenotype, making it likely that there is some overlap. There is considerable genetic heterogeneity for these disorders and further gene identification will help delineate these pathways.","dc:creator":"Handley MT","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutation spectrum in RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2, and RAB18 and genotype-phenotype correlations in warburg micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"K52"},{"id":"cggv:8daff13a-74ed-4d36-839f-b02dbfc89cbd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8daff13a-74ed-4d36-839f-b02dbfc89cbd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Specificity of the phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e3b54888-891f-4c5e-b97e-8927d53aea4b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3b54888-891f-4c5e-b97e-8927d53aea4b","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:e0dfddca-17f4-4a0c-bbea-07ac87bccc4f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021252.5(RAB18):c.619T>C (p.Ter207Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129065"}},{"id":"cggv:e6e7350a-a858-4304-8983-59d480498562","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021252.5(RAB18):c.274AGA[1] (p.Arg93del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129063"}}],"detectionMethod":"MLPA","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:d4855d5e-8a1f-4b18-af1e-0002cd48bf89_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e6e7350a-a858-4304-8983-59d480498562"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21473985"},{"id":"cggv:308c86c0-4270-425f-900e-6d45042ec4ef_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e0dfddca-17f4-4a0c-bbea-07ac87bccc4f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21473985"}],"rdfs:label":"6.1"},{"id":"cggv:308c86c0-4270-425f-900e-6d45042ec4ef","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:308c86c0-4270-425f-900e-6d45042ec4ef_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Specificity of clinical phenotype"},{"id":"cggv:d4855d5e-8a1f-4b18-af1e-0002cd48bf89","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d4855d5e-8a1f-4b18-af1e-0002cd48bf89_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d4855d5e-8a1f-4b18-af1e-0002cd48bf89_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Mutant RAB18 protein loses the ability to bind GDP and GTP."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":7019,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":9.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8a75b203-7553-4b03-8ff1-ee2e16ca6e16","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016649","gene":"hgnc:14244","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"RAB18 was originally reported in cases of Warburg Micro syndrome in 2011 (PMID: 21473985).
