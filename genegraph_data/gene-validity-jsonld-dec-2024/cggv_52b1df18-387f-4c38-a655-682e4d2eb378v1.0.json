Mutations of the AKT3 gene have been reported in a few individuals with brain malformations, to date. Therefore, our understanding regarding the clinical and molecular spectrum associated with mutations of this critical gene is limited, with no clear genotype-phenotype correlations. We sought to further delineate this spectrum, study levels of mosaicism and identify genotype-phenotype correlations of AKT3-related disorders. We performed targeted sequencing of AKT3 on individuals with these phenotypes by molecular inversion probes and/or Sanger sequencing to determine the type and level of mosaicism of mutations. We analysed all clinical and brain imaging data of mutation-positive individuals including neuropathological analysis in one instance. We performed ex vivo kinase assays on AKT3 engineered with the patient mutations and examined the phospholipid binding profile of pleckstrin homology domain localizing mutations. We identified 14 new individuals with AKT3 mutations with several phenotypes dependent on the type of mutation and level of mosaicism. Our comprehensive clinical characterization, and review of all previously published patients, broadly segregates individuals with AKT3 mutations into two groups: patients with highly asymmetric cortical dysplasia caused by the common p.E17K mutation, and patients with constitutional AKT3 mutations exhibiting more variable phenotypes including bilateral cortical malformations, polymicrogyria, periventricular nodular heterotopia and diffuse megalencephaly without cortical dysplasia. All mutations increased kinase activity, and pleckstrin homology domain mutants exhibited enhanced phospholipid binding. Overall, our study shows that activating mutations of the critical AKT3 gene are associated with a wide spectrum of brain involvement ranging from focal or segmental brain malformations (such as hemimegalencephaly and polymicrogyria) predominantly due to mosaic AKT3 mutations, to diffuse bilateral cortical malformations, megalencephaly and heterotopia due to constitutional AKT3 mutations. We also provide the first detailed neuropathological examination of a child with extreme megalencephaly due to a constitutional AKT3 mutation. This child has one of the largest documented paediatric brain sizes, to our knowledge. Finally, our data show that constitutional AKT3 mutations are associated with megalencephaly, with or without autism, similar to PTEN-related disorders. Recognition of this broad clinical and molecular spectrum of AKT3 mutations is important for providing early diagnosis and appropriate management of affected individuals, and will facilitate targeted design of future human clinical trials using PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors.","dc:creator":"Alcantara D","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations of AKT3 are associated with a wide spectrum of developmental disorders including extreme megalencephaly."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969385","rdfs:label":"LR14-271"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Parents were not confirmed and the variant was germline in the proband"},{"id":"cggv:402deae3-7771-4a0a-9914-5037b4ae7944_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:80cc12b2-46b7-42bc-8c1e-ce3a37932a94","type":"Proband","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:402deae3-7771-4a0a-9914-5037b4ae7944_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:2800925b-e793-40f6-86b8-f2736cd2de2c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969385"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969385","rdfs:label":"LR14-254"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The variant is germline in this proband but paternity was not confirmed "},{"id":"cggv:6510301c-f721-42e7-8858-cab34cf43c55_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aee84916-3b97-4bf7-9832-153d517df992","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6510301c-f721-42e7-8858-cab34cf43c55_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:fe6808c4-0605-4c8e-8d48-746c594fa9db","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005465.7(AKT3):c.49G>A (p.Glu17Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130584"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969385"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969385","rdfs:label":"LR15-262"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:af78bf94-28c2-4174-bfb0-8636f6e89b34_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:52832713-fab5-4183-9b48-6c5d344b0f27","type":"Proband","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:af78bf94-28c2-4174-bfb0-8636f6e89b34_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:2f800df9-191b-4a48-96eb-86aaa8122509","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005465.7(AKT3):c.1393C>T (p.Arg465Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130580"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969385"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969385","rdfs:label":"LR14- 112"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Paternity was not confirmed "},{"id":"cggv:4fcabd06-87c5-49f2-b27b-d128d79983ce_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3b876490-fa3c-4df6-9aa7-b8fd9775b5fc","type":"Proband","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:4fcabd06-87c5-49f2-b27b-d128d79983ce_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:fe6808c4-0605-4c8e-8d48-746c594fa9db"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25722288","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Malformations of cortical development containing dysplastic neuronal and glial elements, including hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia, are common causes of intractable paediatric epilepsy. In this study we performed multiplex targeted sequencing of 10 genes in the PI3K/AKT pathway on brain tissue from 33 children who underwent surgical resection of dysplastic cortex for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Sequencing results were correlated with clinical, imaging, pathological and immunohistological phenotypes. We identified mosaic activating mutations in PIK3CA and AKT3 in this cohort, including cancer-associated hotspot PIK3CA mutations in dysplastic megalencephaly, hemimegalencephaly, and focal cortical dysplasia type IIa. In addition, a germline PTEN mutation was identified in a male with hemimegalencephaly but no peripheral manifestations of the PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome. A spectrum of clinical, imaging and pathological abnormalities was found in this cohort. While patients with more severe brain imaging abnormalities and systemic manifestations were more likely to have detected mutations, routine histopathological studies did not predict mutation status. In addition, elevated levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein were identified in both neurons and astrocytes of all hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia type II specimens, regardless of the presence or absence of detected PI3K/AKT pathway mutations. In contrast, expression patterns of the T308 and S473 phosphorylated forms of AKT and in vitro AKT kinase activities discriminated between mutation-positive dysplasia cortex, mutation-negative dysplasia cortex, and non-dysplasia epilepsy cortex. Our findings identify PI3K/AKT pathway mutations as an important cause of epileptogenic brain malformations and establish megalencephaly, hemimegalencephaly, and focal cortical dysplasia as part of a single pathogenic spectrum.

A third case showed a known activating mutation in AKT3 (c.49G→A, creating p.E17K) that was not present in the patient's blood cells. Remarkably, the E17K mutation in AKT3 is exactly paralogous to E17K mutations in AKT1 and AKT2 recently discovered in somatic overgrowth syndromes.

Several recurrent missense variants have been reported in humans (e.g. E17K) and also copy number gains have been associated with this phenotype, suggestive of a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Experimental studies have been done on patient cell lines and non-patient derived cells that support this gain of function disease mechanism. In summary, AKT3 has been definitively associated with overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes, and has been upheld over time. Of note this gene is part of a known 1q43q44 deletion syndrome and at least one AKT3 specific deletion has been reported in association with non-overgrowth disease. Therefore, loss-of-function variants in this gene may be associated with a different syndrome as well.
