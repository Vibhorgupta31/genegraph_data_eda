In MPS IIIB, there is a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) and early clinical symptoms include aggressive behaviour and hyperactivity followed by progressive mental retardation. The disease is autosomal recessive and the gene for NAGLU, which is situated on chromosome 17q21, is approximately 8.5 kb in length and contains six exons. Primers were designed to amplify the entire coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the NAGLU gene in 10 fragments. The PCR products were analysed for sequence changes using SSCP analysis and fluorescent DNA sequencing technology. Sixteen different putative mutations were detected in DNA from 14 MPS IIIB patients, 12 of which have not been found previously. The mutations include four deletions (219-237del19, 334-358del25, 1335delC, 2099delA), two insertions (1447-1448insT, 1932-1933insGCTAC), two nonsense mutations (R297X, R626X), and eight missense mutations (F48C, Y140C, R234C, W268R, P521L, R565W, L591P, E705K).

To rapidly identify most NAGLU mutations, an automated sequencing procedure was developed for analysis of the entire coding region, including exon-intron borders. By this method, eight affected families were studied, and the mutations in all 16 alleles were identified, more than doubling the number of published mutations for this gene. Eight mutations were described for the first time: five missense mutations (Y140C, Y455C, P521L, S612G, and R674C), two nonsense mutations (W675X and Q706X), and one 24-nucleotide insertion. Currently, 36% of all point mutations (8 of 22 alleles) involve R674, a codon having a CpG dinucleotide in the critical initial position. Other mutations were found in more than one family, raising the possibility that some may be relatively common and, possibly, ancient mutations. Six new nonpathological mutations were also identified and likely represent polymorphic variants of the NAGLU gene, two of which might alter enzyme level. Establishing genotype-phenotype relationships will be vital in the evaluation of experimental treatments such as gene therapy.","dc:creator":"Zhao HG","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Genotype-phenotype correspondence in Sanfilippo syndrome type B."}},{"id":"cggv:8b8e2118-d801-41ef-b8e0-4f6e44313678_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7db42c61-f72e-46f6-8eca-a4b558f701ce"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9443875"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient F"},{"id":"cggv:8b8e2118-d801-41ef-b8e0-4f6e44313678","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b8e2118-d801-41ef-b8e0-4f6e44313678_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8b8e2118-d801-41ef-b8e0-4f6e44313678_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional data (PMID: 9443878): in transfected chinese hamster ovary cells, resulted in 3% of WT enzyme activity"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:621fedae-0b86-420c-861a-507128a9ea7a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:621fedae-0b86-420c-861a-507128a9ea7a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7ee5629a-f6c2-4187-a802-d570f7180478_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:5cff49b3-6581-4f8d-91b2-e4b7e6744bd7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5cff49b3-6581-4f8d-91b2-e4b7e6744bd7","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:30f224a0-ed94-4306-ac61-d947d0c29e7d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000263.4(NAGLU):c.507_516del (p.Ser169fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115047"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c667fff4-072e-4d00-bc4d-2bbafd782281_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:30f224a0-ed94-4306-ac61-d947d0c29e7d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9443875"},"rdfs:label":"Patient B"},{"id":"cggv:c667fff4-072e-4d00-bc4d-2bbafd782281","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c667fff4-072e-4d00-bc4d-2bbafd782281_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"scored 0.75pts to yield 1.5pt total and thereby avoid double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5b71ba38-642d-484a-95ed-d7272fc9f9ee_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b71ba38-642d-484a-95ed-d7272fc9f9ee","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c24b6b19-9808-465f-a2ed-d5ec44a77d57","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000263.4(NAGLU):c.678+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1683236"}},"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a0c9b4ba-8c04-470b-b66d-b9329efd313f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c24b6b19-9808-465f-a2ed-d5ec44a77d57"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153910","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sanfilippo syndrome type B (mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the inability to degrade heparan sulfate because of a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU).

Transient transfection of COS cells, by DNA mutagenized with NAGLU mutations, produced enzymatic molecules without activity, demonstrating the deleterious nature of the defects.

This paper describes the expression and characterisation of wild-type recombinant NAG and the molecular characterisation of a previously identified R297X/F48L compound heterozygous MPS-IIIB patient with attenuated Sanfilippo syndrome. We have previously shown R297X to be the most common mutation in a cohort of Dutch and Australian patients, occurring at a frequency of approximately 12.5%. To date F48L has only been described in the proband. To determine the contribution of each mutation to the overall clinical phenotype of the patient, both mutant alleles were engineered into the wild-type NAG cDNA and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The wild-type NAG and F48L mutant alleles were also retrovirally expressed in MPS-IIIB skin fibroblasts. Residual NAG activity and the stability and maturation of immunoprecipitated NAG were determined for wild-type NAG and mutant NAG. The combined biochemical phenotypes of the two NAG mutant alleles demonstrated a good correspondence with the observed attenuated Sanfilippo phenotype of the patient.","dc:creator":"Yogalingam G","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB: characterisation and expression of wild-type and mutant recombinant alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase and relationship with sanfilippo phenotype in an attenuated patient."}},{"id":"cggv:fb5a9140-9627-4ba2-9198-81c84252acf8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a42224de-f7c9-4110-afc3-280dd0e21c10"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11068184"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:ca7270b3-95b0-42dc-bb8a-4c6738d6c779","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca7270b3-95b0-42dc-bb8a-4c6738d6c779_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ca7270b3-95b0-42dc-bb8a-4c6738d6c779_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 11068184: Supporting functional data - transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells showed <5% of WT NAGLU enzyme activity"}],"strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:fb5a9140-9627-4ba2-9198-81c84252acf8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb5a9140-9627-4ba2-9198-81c84252acf8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:fb5a9140-9627-4ba2-9198-81c84252acf8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 11068184: Supporting functional data - transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells showed <5% of WT NAGLU enzyme activity"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9b7b0a18-2663-4aba-a07e-2e3d5e771814_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b7b0a18-2663-4aba-a07e-2e3d5e771814","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2f34be51-6aa2-43b9-8716-aacc63db5ba9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000263.4(NAGLU):c.1006G>T (p.Glu336Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8576915"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:9c4063fc-db4c-4463-abf4-b42a798a8ce2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2f34be51-6aa2-43b9-8716-aacc63db5ba9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153910"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 9"},{"id":"cggv:9c4063fc-db4c-4463-abf4-b42a798a8ce2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c4063fc-db4c-4463-abf4-b42a798a8ce2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9c4063fc-db4c-4463-abf4-b42a798a8ce2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional data: in transfected COS cells, resulted in 29% of WT enzyme activity (PMID: 11153910)\n"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"adjusted to 1pt for 2pts total to avoid double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:db913885-a8a1-4b13-8c86-6fd8a94f32fb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db913885-a8a1-4b13-8c86-6fd8a94f32fb","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:0437f2f4-7e30-4019-99c3-df9e981369c4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000263.4(NAGLU):c.334_358del (p.Arg112SerfsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573130377"}},{"id":"cggv:a0fe6da5-a6c4-4b13-a423-30759025e4eb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000263.4(NAGLU):c.419A>G (p.Tyr140Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8576764"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:03373846-d3c3-4b6a-a6b9-bd632973b6a1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0437f2f4-7e30-4019-99c3-df9e981369c4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14984474","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sanfilippo syndrome type B [mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPS IIIB] is the most prevalent type of MPS III in Greece, accounting for 81% of all MPS III cases diagnosed at the Institute of Child Health (Athens) over the last 20 years. The majority of the patients originated from East Central/Central Greece, Thessaly, and Macedonia. We present the results of mutation analysis in 21 Greek patients from 18 different families, all of whom had the severe form of the disorder. Patients were initially screened for five previously known mutations by restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction products. Unknown mutations were identified by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing and were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. Seven previously described mutations (Y140C, R626X, 503-512del, H414R, G292R, 334del25, and E452K) and four novel mutations (P516L, L242P, E446K, and R482Q) were identified. Expression of the latter and H414R showed that they were all null activity mutations. Considerable genetic heterogeneity has been described in MPS IIIB patients of different origins. In our population, Y140C, H414R, and R626X account for approximately 70% of the studied alleles. Our findings, especially in combination with the origin of individual patients, can improve carrier detection and genetic counseling in affected families.","dc:creator":"Beesley C","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Sanfilippo B syndrome: molecular defects in Greek patients."}},{"id":"cggv:285760e2-3f84-433b-8947-5e1fb7c791e8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a0fe6da5-a6c4-4b13-a423-30759025e4eb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14984474"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 18"},{"id":"cggv:03373846-d3c3-4b6a-a6b9-bd632973b6a1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:03373846-d3c3-4b6a-a6b9-bd632973b6a1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:285760e2-3f84-433b-8947-5e1fb7c791e8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:285760e2-3f84-433b-8947-5e1fb7c791e8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:285760e2-3f84-433b-8947-5e1fb7c791e8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional data (PMID: 9443878): in transfected chinese hamster ovary cells, led to <5% of wild-type enzyme activity"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:7ee5629a-f6c2-4187-a802-d570f7180478_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ee5629a-f6c2-4187-a802-d570f7180478_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:822e728c-89b8-4c67-a5f8-21a1295f05ad","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f1811b6-6fe9-4bf4-8fe8-0960805ccf1c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"NAGLU encodes the alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase enzyme (PMID: 8650226), which is deficient among individuals with MPS type IIIB (as reviewed in PMID: 11668611) \nAlpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), via catalyzing the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues (as reviewed in PMID: 18392742) \nNAGLU deficiency leads to accumulation of incompletely degraded oligosaccharides in lysosomes in the brain and other tissues, resulting in neurodegeneration with variable extra-neurologic manifestations (as reviewed in PMID: 18392742) ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8650226","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The Sanfilippo syndrome type B is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase; it is characterized by profound mental deterioration in childhood and death in the second decade.

The most serious manifestations are profound mental retardation, intractable behavior problems, and death in the second decade. To generate a model for studies of pathophysiology and of potential therapy, we disrupted exon 6 of Naglu, the homologous mouse gene. Naglu-/- mice were healthy and fertile while young and could survive for 8-12 mo. They were totally deficient in alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase and had massive accumulation of heparan sulfate in liver and kidney as well as secondary changes in activity of several other lysosomal enzymes in liver and brain and elevation of gangliosides G(M2) and G(M3) in brain. Vacuolation was seen in many cells, including macrophages, epithelial cells, and neurons, and became more prominent with age. Although most vacuoles contained finely granular material characteristic of glycosaminoglycan accumulation, large pleiomorphic inclusions were seen in some neurons and pericytes in the brain. Abnormal hypoactive behavior was manifested by 4.5-mo-old Naglu-/- mice in an open field test; the hyperactivity that is characteristic of affected children was not observed even in younger mice. In a Pavlovian fear conditioning test, the 4.5-mo-old mutant mice showed normal response to context, indicating intact hippocampal-dependent learning, but reduced response to a conditioning tone, perhaps attributable to hearing impairment. The phenotype of the alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase-deficient mice is sufficiently similar to that of patients with the Sanfilippo syndrome type B to make these mice a good model for study of pathophysiology and for development of therapy.","dc:creator":"Li HH","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mouse model of Sanfilippo syndrome type B produced by targeted disruption of the gene encoding alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase."},"rdfs:label":"NAGLU knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7851,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:695026c7-c470-4cb4-8f64-c4c9cbc54d2b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009656","gene":"hgnc:7632","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The relationship between the NAGLU gene and mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of June 29, 2022. NAGLU encodes alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase, a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (PMID: 8650226). Among individuals with MPS IIIB, alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase deficiency results in accumulation of incompletely degraded oligosaccharides in lysosomes in the brain and other tissues, resulting in neurodegeneration with variable extra-neurologic manifestations (as reviewed in PMID: 18392742, PMID: 11668611). \n\nThe disease mechanism of MPS IIIB is loss of function. MPS IIIB was first reported in 1973 (Neufeld, Personal Communication. Bethesda, Md. 1973) and the first report of biallelic variants in NAGLU among patients with MPS IIIB was published in 1996 (PMID: 8650226). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between MPS IIIB and NAGLU. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants, as well as larger intragenic deletions (PMID: 11668611). In total, 10 variants from six probands in five publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between NAGLU and MPS IIIB includes the biochemical function of the gene product (the alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase enzyme) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with MPS IIIB (PMID: 8650226, PMID:18392742, PMID:11668611), the biochemical and clinical features of a NAGLU knockout mouse animal (PMID: 10588735), and the impact of gene therapy among human MPS IIIB patients (PMID: 28713035). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, NAGLU is definitively associated with MPS IIIB. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on August 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7ee5629a-f6c2-4187-a802-d570f7180478"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
