Cntnap2(-/-) mice show deficits in the three core ASD behavioral domains, as well as hyperactivity and epileptic seizures, as have been reported in humans with CNTNAP2 mutations. Neuropathological and physiological analyses of these mice before the onset of seizures reveal neuronal migration abnormalities, reduced number of interneurons, and abnormal neuronal network activity. In addition, treatment with the FDA-approved drug risperidone ameliorates the targeted repetitive behaviors in the mutant mice. These data demonstrate a functional role for CNTNAP2 in brain development and provide a new tool for mechanistic and therapeutic research in ASD.","dc:creator":"PeÃ±agarikano O","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Absence of CNTNAP2 leads to epilepsy, neuronal migration abnormalities, and core autism-related deficits."},"rdfs:label":"CNTNAP2 knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:3af732e2-062d-4bb3-a3cd-2045e460dc8f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3af732e2-062d-4bb3-a3cd-2045e460dc8f_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3af732e2-062d-4bb3-a3cd-2045e460dc8f_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bd73994-d0ef-451d-b8f0-7ce526ea651c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd2c89b7-0dde-40af-9dd8-37d8d27df391","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Targeted sequencing performed after a region of homozygosity was identified by microarray.

We now identified homozygous and compound-heterozygous deletions and mutations via molecular karyotyping and mutational screening in CNTNAP2 and NRXN1 in four patients with severe mental retardation (MR) and variable features, such as autistic behavior, epilepsy, and breathing anomalies, phenotypically overlapping with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. With a frequency of at least 1% in our cohort of 179 patients, recessive defects in CNTNAP2 appear to significantly contribute to severe MR. Whereas the established synaptic role of NRXN1 suggests that synaptic defects contribute to the associated neuropsychiatric disorders and to severe MR as reported here, evidence for a synaptic role of the CNTNAP2-encoded protein CASPR2 has so far been lacking. Using Drosophila as a model, we now show that, as known for fly Nrx-I, the CASPR2 ortholog Nrx-IV might also localize to synapses. Overexpression of either protein can reorganize synaptic morphology and induce increased density of active zones, the synaptic domains of neurotransmitter release. Moreover, both Nrx-I and Nrx-IV determine the level of the presynaptic active-zone protein bruchpilot, indicating a possible common molecular mechanism in Nrx-I and Nrx-IV mutant conditions. We therefore propose that an analogous shared synaptic mechanism contributes to the similar clinical phenotypes resulting from defects in human NRXN1 and CNTNAP2.","dc:creator":"Zweier C","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"CNTNAP2 and NRXN1 are mutated in autosomal-recessive Pitt-Hopkins-like mental retardation and determine the level of a common synaptic protein in Drosophila."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19896112","rdfs:label":"P2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:cc697877-5108-46de-8b1b-f9a5b750a054_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38956fa6-c943-4c90-92ae-60188983e920","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":20,"detectionMethod":"Microarray + Sanger sequencing of CNTNAP2 and NRXN1","firstTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000280","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0002883","obo:HP_0007360","obo:HP_0010864"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"TCF4 genetic testing for Pitt Hopkins syndrome","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:cc697877-5108-46de-8b1b-f9a5b750a054_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8bbcee18-f870-4a22-99b1-f21e3fdd8881","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014141.5(CNTNAP2):c.(?_97)+117643_(1670_?)+6605del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/5494"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19896112"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19896112","rdfs:label":"Proband P1a"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:604135f3-aa34-44ae-9776-a93c3bd17915_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46408260-3717-4c86-8e0a-2db097aadf77","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"gene panel of 150 encephalopathy-related genes sequenced on an Ion Proton platform (Life Technologies).

These disorders share one phenotype number in OMIM (610042).  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s), inheritance pattern, or phenotypic\nvariability. Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder.  Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which has been assessed separately.\n\nCNTNAP2 was first reported in relation to an autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2006 (PMID 16571880).  The mechanism for disease is homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function variants.  \n\nAt least 15 unique variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and exon-level deletions have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.  Variants in this gene have been reported in at least seven probands in four publications (PMIDs: 16571880, 19896112, 27439707, and 30762603). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in a similarly affected sibling in three of these families.  Additionally, the c.3709delG founder variant was identified in six additional family members over multiple generations and in nine additional individuals from seven other Old Order Amish families (PMID 16571880).  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.  This gene-disease association is supported by an animal model (PMID 21962519).  \n\nIn summary, CNTNAP2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic\nsettings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel Working Group on June 15, 2021\n(SOP Version 8).\nThe association between CNTNAP2 and autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic\nsettings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3af732e2-062d-4bb3-a3cd-2045e460dc8f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
