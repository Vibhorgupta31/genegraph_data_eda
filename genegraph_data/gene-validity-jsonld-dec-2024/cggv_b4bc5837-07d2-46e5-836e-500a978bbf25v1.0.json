This is exemplified by the short rib-polydactyly syndromes, Jeune, Sensenbrenner, and Mainzer-Saldino chondrodysplasia syndromes. These three syndromes are frequently caused by mutations in intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes affecting the primary cilia, which play a crucial role in skeletal and chondral development. Here, we identified mutations in IFT140, an IFT complex A gene, in five Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and two Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MSS) families, by screening a cohort of 66 JATD/MSS patients using whole exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of a customized ciliopathy gene panel. We also found an enrichment of rare IFT140 alleles in JATD compared with nonciliopathy diseases, implying putative modifier effects for certain alleles. IFT140 patients presented with mild chest narrowing, but all had end-stage renal failure under 13 years of age and retinal dystrophy when examined for ocular dysfunction. This is consistent with the severe cystic phenotype of Ift140 conditional knockout mice, and the higher level of Ift140 expression in kidney and retina compared with the skeleton at E15.5 in the mouse. IFT140 is therefore a major cause of cono-renal syndromes (JATD and MSS). The present study strengthens the rationale for IFT140 screening in skeletal ciliopathy spectrum patients that have kidney disease and/or retinal dystrophy.","dc:creator":"Schmidts M","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Combined NGS approaches identify mutations in the intraflagellar transport gene IFT140 in skeletal ciliopathies with early progressive kidney Disease."}},{"id":"cggv:5b473512-a743-47bc-93f5-72c513b2ba1f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a1d26802-668c-497f-8c50-a9842f418a7e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23418020"}],"rdfs:label":"Schmidts_2013_Patient_JATD1"},{"id":"cggv:7bc73e61-0a88-4720-8455-6505585fd784","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7bc73e61-0a88-4720-8455-6505585fd784_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"NM_014714.4(IFT140):c.1380del (p.Asn460fs) is a frameshift variant that introduces a premature stop codon in exon 12/31 and is predicted to trigger NMD or at least to truncate ~69% of the protein product."},{"id":"cggv:5b473512-a743-47bc-93f5-72c513b2ba1f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b473512-a743-47bc-93f5-72c513b2ba1f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"NM_014714.4(IFT140):c.874G>A (p.Val292Met) is a missense variant that does not have functional evidence of gene impact.

Despite the identification of a number of genes involved in LCA and RP, the genetic etiology remains unknown in many patients. In this study, we aimed to identify novel disease-causing genes of LCA and RP. Retinal capture sequencing was initially performed to screen mutations in known disease-causing genes in different cohorts of LCA and RP patients. For patients with negative results, we performed whole exome sequencing and applied a series of variant filtering strategies. Sanger sequencing was done to validate candidate causative IFT140 variants. Exome sequencing data analysis led to the identification of IFT140 variants in multiple unrelated non-syndromic LCA and RP cases. All the variants are extremely rare and predicted to be damaging.

The tubby mouse, which presents with adult-onset obesity, arises from mutation in the Tub gene. The tubby-like proteins comprise a related family of poorly understood proteins with roles in neural development and function. We find that specific Tubby family proteins, notably Tubby-like protein 3 (TULP3), bind to the IFT-A complex. IFT-A is linked to retrograde ciliary transport, but, surprisingly, we find that the IFT-A complex has a second role directing ciliary entry of TULP3.

Both IFT-A and membrane phosphoinositide-binding properties of TULP3 are required for ciliary GPCR localization.

In this study, trio whole-exome sequencing of a prospectively identified nephronophthisis (NPHP) proband and her parents identified compound-heterozygous variants in IFT140, a gene previously associated with NPHP-related ciliopathies. IFT140 plays a key role in retrograde intraflagellar transport, but the precise downstream cellular mechanisms responsible for disease presentation remain unknown. A one-step reprogramming and gene-editing protocol was used to derive both uncorrected proband iPSCs and isogenic gene-corrected iPSCs, which were differentiated to kidney organoids. Proband organoid tubules demonstrated shortened, club-shaped primary cilia, whereas gene correction rescued this phenotype. Differential expression analysis of epithelial cells isolated from organoids suggested downregulation of genes associated with apicobasal polarity, cell-cell junctions, and dynein motor assembly in proband epithelial cells.

While the model was generated using a mutagen, it is important to note that the targeted homozygous null mutant in *Ift140* recapitulates the features of the model, albeit with enhanced severity. This confirms that the model's mechanism of pathogenicity is incomplete loss of *Ift140* function.

There are two broad categories of cilia; motile and non-motile, or primary, cilia. The central role of primary cilia in health and disease has become prominent in the past decade with the recognition of a number of human syndromes that result from defects in the formation or function of primary cilia. This rapidly growing class of conditions, now known as ciliopathies, impact the development of a diverse range of tissues including the neural axis, craniofacial structures, skeleton, kidneys, eyes and lungs. The broad impact of cilia dysfunction on development reflects the pivotal position of the primary cilia within a signalling nexus involving a growing number of growth factor systems including Hedgehog, Pdgf, Fgf, Hippo, Notch and both canonical Wnt and planar cell polarity. We have identified a novel ENU mutant allele of Ift140, which causes a mid-gestation embryonic lethal phenotype in homozygous mutant mice. Mutant embryos exhibit a range of phenotypes including exencephaly and spina bifida, craniofacial dysmorphism, digit anomalies, cardiac anomalies and somite patterning defects. A number of these phenotypes can be attributed to alterations in Hedgehog signalling, although additional signalling systems are also likely to be involved. We also report the identification of a homozygous recessive mutation in IFT140 in a Jeune syndrome patient. This ENU-induced Jeune syndrome model will be useful in delineating the origins of dysmorphology in human ciliopathies.

Affected individuals with causal biallelic variants in IFT140 have since been identified in a number of other publications, with syndromic cases most often referred to as short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly (PMID: 23418020), and non-syndromic cases typically diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa 80 (PMID: 26216056). Both groups of patients generally present in infancy or childhood with retinal dystrophy phenotypes such as night blindness, central vision loss, peripheral visual field loss, retinal arteriolar constriction, undetectable electroretinogram, pigmentary retinopathy, and loss of photoreceptors in the inner and outer segments. The subset of patients with syndromic presentations additionally exhibit skeletal abnormalities that can include cone-shaped epiphyses of the hands and feet, Type A brachydactyly, short stature, and narrow thorax with short, thickened ribs that can lead to respiratory insufficiency. These cases can also exhibit morphological abnormalities of the kidney such as renal cysts and reduced renal corticomedullary differentiation that can progress to renal insufficiency, as well as functional abnormalities of the liver such as cholestasis. Some of the causal *IFT140* variants overlap between cases with different diagnoses, and a single affected family can include both ocular and syndromic cases (PMID: 26359340). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the IFT140 gene product) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients diagnosed with either short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without polydactyly (MIM#: 266920), Leber congenital amaurosis, or retinitis pigmentosa 80 (MIM#: 617781). The phenotypic variability between them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, these cases have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *IFT140*-related recessive ciliopathy (MONDO:0100509). An additional disease entity, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), has been asserted in relation to monoallelic variants in *IFT140* (PMID: 34890546). While this phenotype is characterized by some similar clinical characteristics and overlapping variants, its different mode of inheritance, incomplete penetrance, and absence of a consistent ocular phenotype raised the possibility of a different mechanism of pathogenesis. Thus, *IFT140* has been separately curated for its relationship to this disease entity, referred to as ADPKD-*IFT140*.\n\nFourteen suspected pathogenic variants in *IFT140* were scored as part of this curation (seven missense, five frameshift, and two affecting splicing), which have been collectively reported in eight probands in three publications (PMID: 22503633, PMID: 23418020, PMID: 26216056). One proband was homozygous for the missense variant of interest and was reported to have consanguineous parents (PMID: 22503633). The other seven probands were compound heterozygotes within the *IFT140* locus (PMID: 22503633, PMID: 23418020, PMID: 26216056). One family with segregation evidence was available in these publications (PMID: 22503633), but it included too few affected individuals to contribute to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. More case-level data was available (PMID: 26359340, PMID: 23418020), but was not scored as part of this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by frameshift or splicing variants predicted to trigger a decrease in the amount of the gene product (PMID: 22503633, PMID: 23418020, PMID: 26216056). All probands found for this curation harbored two variant alleles within the *IFT140* locus, with many harboring a missense variant in trans with a predicted loss-of-function variant, and none harboring a predicted loss-of-function variant in the homozygous state.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *IFT140* encodes one of the components of intraflagellar transport sub-complex A, which functions in retrograde transport in the cilia (PMID: 20889716), a process that is required for axonemal growth. This role implies that the disease entity caused by *IFT140* loss-of-function variants is a ciliopathy, and matches the finding that *IFT140* expression reaches its highest levels within human tissues that contain multiciliated cells, including thyroid, testis, fallopian tube, pituitary gland, ovary, and lung tissues (PMID: 23715323). This function is consistent with the cellular characteristics of patient tissues, which can include a reduced proportion of ciliated cells (PMID: 22503633) and shortened cilia with swollen tips (PMID: 29706353). These cellular features are recapitulated by both *Chlamydomonas* (PMID: 28207750) and mouse (PMID: 30479745) cellular models of IFT140 loss of function. Rescue experiments indicate that these cellular phenotypes can be reversed in patient cells subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-based correction of an endogenous *IFT140* variant (PMID: 29706353). While homozygous *Ift140* knockout mice show embryonic lethality, mice harboring homozygous missense mutants with incomplete loss of *Ift140* function recapitulate human patient phenotypes such as rib cage and digit anomalies, disruption of eye development, and severe morphological anomalies of primary cilia in the limb buds (PMID: 24009529).\n\nIn summary, *IFT140* is definitively associated with *IFT140*-related recessive ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on July 7th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b4bc5837-07d2-46e5-836e-500a978bbf25"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
