Somatic IKZF2 mutations are frequently found in lymphoid malignancies. Although germline mutations in IKZF1 and IKZF3 encoding Ikaros and Aiolos have recently been identified in patients with phenotypically similar immunodeficiency syndromes, the effect of germline mutations in IKZF2 on human hematopoiesis and immunity remains enigmatic. We identified germline IKZF2 mutations (one nonsense (p.R291X)- and 4 distinct missense variants) in six patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, immune thrombocytopenia or EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia, decreased number of T-follicular helper and NK cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs from the patient carrying the R291X variant revealed upregulation of proinflammatory genes associated with T-cell receptor activation and T-cell exhaustion. Functional assays revealed the inability of HeliosR291X to homodimerize and bind target DNA as dimers. Moreover, proteomic analysis by proximity-dependent Biotin Identification revealed aberrant interaction of 3/5 Helios mutants with core components of the NuRD complex conveying HELIOS-mediated epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation.","dc:creator":"Shahin T","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Identification of germline monoallelic mutations in IKZF2 in patients with immune dysregulation."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Patient E"},{"id":"cggv:beca9e7c-e632-4cc1-b10f-41a14bdb801d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:beca9e7c-e632-4cc1-b10f-41a14bdb801d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:beca9e7c-e632-4cc1-b10f-41a14bdb801d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The variant p.N220S showed decreased interaction with different components of the NuRD complex.

Using Single RNA sequencing in the patient samples carrying the variant p.R291X, it was shown that there is a decrease of clusters corresponding to the NK cells and central memory T cells. Moreover, there is an upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, indicating an activated and effector state in both monocytes and T cells. In addition, the total numbers of NK cells and Tregs (FOXP3+ cells) were reduced in the patient sample compared to the healthy control.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920454","rdfs:label":"DNA binding capacity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3c007dec-2ef6-49a6-ba07-5f495c7794ae_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0eb80e96-097c-451b-8e41-766a7b57d601","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:475998f7-f4e6-4753-a66d-5efce5f32c00","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The reduced expression of IKZF2 causes an exhausted phenotype in T cells from P1 and P2 with reduced naive T cells and abundant effector memory in CD8 and CD4 cells; in addition, RNAseq on T CD8 cells demonstrates an increase in the proinflammatory transcriptional signature compared to healthy controls.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34826260","rdfs:label":"IKZF1 expression in T CD4 and CD8 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3c007dec-2ef6-49a6-ba07-5f495c7794ae_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dce12ed8-4974-4e64-b889-559af8149e89","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c483e2f-8f26-4091-a656-cee17a6dac96","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Reconstitution of the patient mutation to WT rescued the defect in IL-2 production, directly implicating the mutation in Helios (p.I325V) in the downstream control of the IL2 locus in conventional T cells.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34826259","rdfs:label":"Rescue in T CD8 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a03c6054-618a-4c1e-9faf-2229b35b85b3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:65d0e1f8-c8d2-48ac-b2ee-4e8ab66435b3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In T cells from the patients carrying the heterozygous variant p.Y200X, the percentage of cells expressing IL2+ and IFNg+ is higher than the controls.

We report that impaired expression of the transcription factor (TF) Helios by FoxP3(+) CD4 and Qa-1-restricted CD8 T(regs) results in defective regulatory activity and autoimmunity in mice. Helios-deficient T(regs) develop an unstable phenotype during inflammatory responses characterized by reduced FoxP3 expression and increased effector cytokine expression secondary to diminished activation of the STAT5 pathway. CD8 T(regs) also require Helios-dependent STAT5 activation for survival and to prevent terminal T cell differentiation. The definition of Helios as a key transcription factor that stabilizes T(regs) in the face of inflammatory responses provides a genetic explanation for a core property of T(regs).","dc:creator":"Kim HJ","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Stable inhibitory activity of regulatory T cells requires the transcription factor Helios."},"rdfs:label":"HELIOS -/- mice model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":6659,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":9.95,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e7463c7a-a7a1-453f-84a1-65e623bd3297","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0800139","gene":"hgnc:13177","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The IKZF2 gene encodes the transcription factor HELIOS. Helios is a member of the Ikaros family; as a transcription factor, it can bind DNA in essential regions to control hematopoiesis, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell function of immune cells. HELIOS deficiency (MONDO:0800139) has a wide range of phenotypes: lymphadenopathy, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and immune dysregulation with incomplete penetrance. A total of seven variants, including nonsense and missense, have been reported in 10 patients in 3 publications only (PMID: 34826260, 34826259, 34920454). All variants except for one were found in an autosomal dominant trait, for that reason the model of inheritance used for this curation was autosomal dominant. Experimental evidence includes a reduction of HELIOS expression in the patient´s cells (Lymphocytes, NK cells), loss of the dimerization ability and DNA binding activity, and disruption of the protein-protein interaction and transcriptional activity. Additionally, the HELIOS knockout mouse recapitulates most of the cellular phenotypes and the development of autoimmunity seen in patients with HELIOS deficiency. \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
