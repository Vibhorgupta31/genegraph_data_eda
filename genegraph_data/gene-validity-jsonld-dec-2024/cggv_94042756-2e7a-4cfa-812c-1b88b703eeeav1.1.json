Dysferlin, the protein product of the gene, is a novel molecule without homology to any known mammalian protein. We have now raised a monoclonal antibody to dysferlin and report on the expression of this new protein: immunolabelling with the antibody (designated NCL-hamlet) demonstrated a polypeptide of approximately 230 kDa on western blots of skeletal muscle, with localization to the muscle fibre membrane by microscopy at both the light and electron microscopic level. A specific loss of dysferlin labelling was observed in patients with mutations in the LGMD2B/MM gene. Furthermore, patients with two different frameshifting mutations demonstrated very low levels of immunoreactive protein in a manner reminiscent of the dystrophin expressed in many Duchenne patients. Analysis of human fetal tissue showed that dysferlin was expressed at the earliest stages of development examined, at Carnegie stage 15 or 16 (embryonic age 5-6 weeks). Dysferlin is present, therefore, at a time when the limbs start to show regional differentiation.

Here, we report two novel lines of dysferlin-deficient mice obtained by (a) gene targeting and (b) identification of an inbred strain, A/J, bearing a retrotransposon insertion in the dysferlin gene. The mutations in these mice were located at the 3' and 5' ends of the dysferlin gene. Both lines of mice lacked dysferlin and developed a progressive muscular dystrophy with histopathological and ultrastructural features that closely resemble the human disease. Vital staining with Evans blue dye revealed loss of sarcolemmal integrity in both lines of mice, similar to that seen in mdx and caveolin-3 deficient mice. However, in contrast to the latter group of animals, the dysferlin-deficient mice have an intact dystrophin glycoprotein complex and normal levels of caveolin-3. Our findings indicate that muscle membrane disruption and myofiber degeneration in dysferlinopathy were directly mediated by the loss of dysferlin via a new pathogenic mechanism in muscular dystrophies. We also show that the mutation in the A/J mice arose between the late 1970s and the early 1980s, and had become fixed in the production breeding stocks. Therefore, all studies involving the A/J mice or mice derived from A/J, including recombinant inbred, recombinant congenic and chromosome substitution strains, should take into account the dysferlin defect in these strains. These new dysferlin-deficient mice should be useful for elucidating the pathogenic pathway in dysferlinopathy and for developing therapeutic strategies.","dc:creator":"Ho M","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Disruption of muscle membrane and phenotype divergence in two novel mouse models of dysferlin deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Ho_DYSFko_A/J"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"The evidence is scored increased points since the human phenotype is recapitulated by two distinct dysferlin-deficient mouse models."},{"id":"cggv:93fb59f5-bbf6-450d-85d9-c05ee7e17131","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89928beb-dfec-400f-b9d3-963dbba81756","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The dysferlin-null mice develop a slowly progressive muscular dystrophy.

As for other muscular dystrophies, gene therapy approaches based on recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors are promising options. However, because dysferlin messenger RNA is far above the natural packaging size of rAAV, full-length dysferlin gene transfer would be problematic. In a patient presenting with a late-onset moderate dysferlinopathy, we identified a large homozygous deletion, leading to the production of a natural \"minidysferlin\" protein. Using rAAV-mediated gene transfer into muscle, we demonstrated targeting of the minidysferlin to the muscle membrane and efficient repair of sarcolemmal lesions in a mouse model of dysferlinopathy. Thus, as previously demonstrated in the case of dystrophin, a deletion mutant of the dysferlin gene is also functional, suggesting that dysferlin's structure is modular.

Two large pedigrees have been described which have both types of patient in the same families. Moreover, in both pedigrees LGMD2B and MM patients are homozygous for haplotypes of the critical region. This suggested that the same mutation in the same gene would lead to both LGMD2B or MM in these families and that additional factors were needed to explain the development of the different clinical phenotypes. In the present paper we show that in one of these families Pro791 of dysferlin is changed to an Arg residue. Both the LGMD2B and MM patients in this kindred are homozygous for this mutation, as are four additional patients from two previously unpublished families. Haplotype analyses suggest a common origin of the mutation in all the patients. On western blots of muscle, LGMD2B and MM patients show a similar abundance in dysferlin staining of 15 and 11%, respectively. Normal tissue sections show that dysferlin localizes to the sarcolemma while tissue sections from MM and LGMD patients show minimal staining which is indistinguishable between the two types. These findings emphasize the role for the dysferlin gene as being responsible for both LGMD2B and MM, but that the distinction between these two clinical phenotypes requires the identification of additional factor(s), such as modifier gene(s).","dc:creator":"Weiler T","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Identical mutation in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B or Miyoshi myopathy suggests a role for modifier gene(s)."}},"rdfs:label":"Weiler_probandA8"},{"id":"cggv:a572a419-e369-4309-ae39-c9622bd1a090","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a572a419-e369-4309-ae39-c9622bd1a090_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"homozygous missense without functional data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2200f272-57d4-4087-9939-dbb8554dde87_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2200f272-57d4-4087-9939-dbb8554dde87","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:f43d3f88-1339-4cbf-9041-162a07ab7533"},"detectionMethod":"SSCP was performed to identify abnormal conformers, which were subsequently sequenced to detect the variants.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. The DYSF gene is located on chromosome 2p13.2 and encodes multiple transcript variants. The most commonly used transcript is 6.7 kb long with 55 exons encoding a 2080-amino acid protein. More than 200 pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive LGMD are recorded in ClinVar, ranging from small deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing to missense variants. In addition to ClinVar and LOVD, the UMD-DYSF database hosts an extensive list of DYSF variants (http://www.umd.be/DYSF/W_DYSF/mutation.html). Limb girdle muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive weakness in muscles including but not limited to the proximal muscles, and affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdle which can lead to difficulty walking or complete loss of ambulation requiring wheelchair use. It is also accompanied by an elevated serum creatine kinase. DYSF has been reported in association with autosomal recessive LGMD as early as 1998 by Liu et al and Bashir et al (PMIDs: 9731526, 9731527). Summary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 16 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 9731526, 16010686, 21522182, 14678801, 17825554, 16087766, 10196377). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for disease has been reported to be biallelic loss of function. Summary of Experimental Data (6 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, functional assays and rescue evidence. Dysferlin has a role in sarcolemmal repair and T-tubule organization (PMID: 12736685, 24302765, 28104817). It is strongly expressed in skeletal muscles and localizes to the membrane (PMID: 10196375). Dysferlin has multiple protein interaction partners (PMID: 11532985, 21079765). A number of mouse models (PMID: 23473732, 15254015, 12736685) and rescue in mouse models and patient cells (PMID: 27858744, 20861509, 19834057, 28707952, 31890729, 31019989) are also reported. In summary, the DYSF-autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on 4/14/20 (SOP Version 7). \n\nThis gene curation was re-approved and published on 11/14/24 by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP to reflect the change in the panel's name from LGMD GCEP to MDM GCEP. As part of this process, the genetic evidence was re-scored in accordance with SOP version 11.\n\nLumping & Splitting Consideration: OMIM disease entities: Miyoshi muscular dystrophy 1 (254130); Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 2 (253601); Myopathy, distal, with anterior tibial onset (606768). Variants in DYSF have been described in individuals with additional phenotypes including scapulo-peroneal myopathy, pseudo-metabolic myopathy, asymptomatic hyperCKemia,, and even congenital onset  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability in the above mentioned disease entities. Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (MONDO:0015152).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:94042756-2e7a-4cfa-812c-1b88b703eeea"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
