Key features of T(FH) cells are the expressions of CXCR5, ICOS, interleukin (IL)-21 and BCL-6. The requirements for human T(FH) cell development are unknown. Here we show that IL-6, IL-12, IL-21 and IL-23 are capable of inducing IL-21 expression in naïve CD4(+) T cells isolated from human tonsils, peripheral blood and cord blood. However, only IL-12 induced sustained expressions of CXCR5 and ICOS on these activated naïve CD4(+) T cells, and endowed them with the ability to provide increased help to B cells for their differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. The effects of IL-12 were independent of interferon-gamma and T-bet, and associated with upregulation of BCL-6 expression. Thus, these cytokines, particularly IL-12, are likely to act at an early stage during dendritic cell-mediated priming of naïve CD4(+) T cells into a T(FH) cell fate, and thus underpin antibody-mediated immunity.","dc:creator":"Ma CS","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Early commitment of naïve human CD4(+) T cells to the T follicular helper (T(FH)) cell lineage is induced by IL-12."},"rdfs:label":"Expression of IL-21 by CXCR5hi CD4+ T cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a5faa447-bc45-461d-8618-c746fc626ef8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:29431d10-2693-41dc-86ff-3d7e1a9f4467","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The reported proband showed low IgG levels, almost no CD19+CD27+IgD+ marginal zone–like and CD19+CD27+IgD- class-switched memory B cells and recurrent severe respiratory infections. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19721453","rdfs:label":"IL-21 production support the differentiation of B cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:82664dca-783a-4ed9-abe5-c77b082a0684_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:51cfa1ad-98c1-471e-b9b0-78c5aa536ec7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47ed08c6-68dc-411b-8765-2b993c878058","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"A Jurkat T-cell line was used to test STAT3 phosphorylation to exclude donor-dependent differences in T-cell responses.

However, the role of IL-21/IL-21 receptor signaling plays in the pathogenesis of IBD is not very clear. In this study, using IL-21R.KO mice, we tested the role of IL-21/IL-21R signaling in the regulation of T helper cell responses during intestinal inflammation. Here we found that IL-21R.KO mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis as compared with C57BL/6 mice. The spontaneous inflammatory cytokines released by macrophages in LP of colon were significantly increased, and Th2, Th17 and Treg responses were down-regulated markedly. However, Th1 responses were significantly up-regulated in IL-21R.KO mice. Meanwhile, the population of CD8(+)CD44(+)IFN-γ(+) T cells was markedly elevated in LP of inflammatory intestine of IL-21RKO mice. In vivo, after disease onset, DSS-induced intestinal inflammation was ameliorated in C57BL/6 mice treated with rIL-21. Our results demonstrate that IL-21/IL-21R signaling contributes to protection against DSS-induced acute colitis through suppression of Th1 and activation of Th2, Th17 and Treg responses in mice. Therefore, therapeutic manipulation of IL-21/IL-21R activity may allow improved immunotherapy for IBD and other inflammatory diseases associated with Th cell responses.","dc:creator":"Wang Y","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"IL-21/IL-21R signaling suppresses intestinal inflammation induced by DSS through regulation of Th responses in lamina propria in mice."},"rdfs:label":"DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in IL-21RKO Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The experiment demonstrated that IL-21/IL-21R signaling plays a protective role in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced acute colitis in mice mainly through regulation of Th cell responses.
