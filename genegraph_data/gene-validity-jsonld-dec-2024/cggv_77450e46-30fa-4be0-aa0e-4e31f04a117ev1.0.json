As is typical for many other multifactorial disorders, much of the heritability of SLE remains unknown. We identified a rare autosomal recessive form of SLE, in which autozygome analysis revealed a null mutation in the DNASE1L3 gene. The DNASE1L3-related SLE we describe was always pediatric in onset and correlated with a high frequency of lupus nephritis.

Herein we present a pediatric patient with DNASE1L3 deficiency, suffering from both urticarial skin lesions, recurrent hemoptysis, and renal involvement, eventually diagnosed as this rare monogenic lupus. The patient suffered from recurrent urticarial rash and hemoptysis since the age of 15 months of age.

Renal biopsy yielded immunocomplex glomerulonephritis. Due to early-onset, similar sibling history and consanguineous parents, we suspected monogenic lupus and performed whole-exome sequencing, which further revealed a homozygous T97Ifs*2 mutation (NM_004944.4: c.290_291delCA/p.Thr97Ilefs*2) in DNASE1L3 gene.

Sixty-eight patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM, n = 30), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 20) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 18), as well as 26 healthy blood donors were enrolled in the present study. Serum levels of DNase1l3 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DNASE1L3 activity in serum was estimated by the capability of serum to digest nucleosomal DNA. Clinical, biochemical, serological and other markers of disease activity (CRP, ESR, C3, C4, anti-Jo-1 and anti-dsDNA, etc.) were measured by standard laboratory procedure. We found a decrease in DNase1l3 level in the DM/PM and SLE patients, resulting in the reduction in serum activity to digest nucleosome DNA. In contrast, the level and activity of DNase1l3 remained unchanged in the RA patients. The DNase1l3 level was relatively lower in the DM/PM patients with anti-Jo-1 antibody and interstitial lung disease, and in the SLE patients with SLE disease activity index higher than 6, renal involvement and anti-dsDNA antibody. DNase1l3 level negatively correlated with CRP and IgG in the PM/DM patients and correlated with ESR in the SLE patients.

In murine models, it has been shown that the extracellular DNase, DNASE1L3, plays a role in the fragmentation of plasma DNA. In humans, DNASE1L3 deficiency causes familial monogenic systemic lupus erythematosus with childhood onset and anti-dsDNA reactivity. In this study, we found that human patients with DNASE1L3 disease-associated gene variations showed aberrations in size and a reduction of a \"CC\" end motif of plasma DNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DNA from DNASE1L3-digested cell nuclei showed a median length of 153 bp with CC motif frequencies resembling plasma DNA from healthy individuals. Adeno-associated virus-based transduction of Dnase1l3 into Dnase1l3-deficient mice restored the end motif profiles to those seen in the plasma DNA of wild-type mice. Our findings demonstrate that DNASE1L3 is an important player in the fragmentation of plasma DNA, which appears to act in a cell-extrinsic manner to regulate plasma DNA size and motif frequency.","dc:creator":"Chan RWY","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Plasma DNA Profile Associated with DNASE1L3 Gene Mutations: Clinical Observations, Relationships to Nuclease Substrate Preference, and In Vivo Correction."},"rdfs:label":"Plasma DNA Profile Associated with DNASE1L3 Gene Mutations:"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:77450e46-30fa-4be0-aa0e-4e31f04a117e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c3f2659-ad5b-483d-8c05-57a11a0ce950","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad066351-296e-466f-9a65-5a2136a0c18b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33022220","rdfs:label":"Plasma DNA Profile Associated with DNASE1L3 Gene Mutations:"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"It is not the clinical disease phenotype that is rescued.

Null mutations and hypomorphic variants of the secreted deoxyribonuclease DNASE1L3 are linked to familial and sporadic SLE, respectively. We report that DNASE1L3-deficient mice rapidly develop autoantibodies to DNA and chromatin, followed by an SLE-like disease. Circulating DNASE1L3 is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, and its levels inversely correlate with anti-DNA antibody response. DNASE1L3 is uniquely capable of digesting chromatin in microparticles released from apoptotic cells. Accordingly, DNASE1L3-deficient mice and human patients have elevated DNA levels in plasma, particularly in circulating microparticles. Murine and human autoantibody clones and serum antibodies from human SLE patients bind to DNASE1L3-sensitive chromatin on the surface of microparticles. Thus, extracellular microparticle-associated chromatin is a potential self-antigen normally digested by circulating DNASE1L3. The loss of this tolerance mechanism can contribute to SLE, and its restoration may represent a therapeutic opportunity in the disease.","dc:creator":"Sisirak V","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Digestion of Chromatin in Apoptotic Cell Microparticles Prevents Autoimmunity."},"rdfs:label":"DNASE1L3-deficient mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8445,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:65c128de-2e37-4596-8687-4c783a2f34bb","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013743","gene":"hgnc:2959","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"DNASE1L3 is encoded on chromosome 3. It is one of several human homologs of DNase I. The family of enzymes includes DNASE1, DNASE1L1, DNASE1L2 and DNASE1L3. These function as endonucleases capable of cleaving DNA. DNASE1L3, predominantly expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells (unlike the other DNase homologs, which are expressed at much lower levels in hematopoietic cells), is secreted into the circulation and is thought to have a role in the fragmentation of free plasma DNA, clearing it from circulation and reducing risk of cell-free DNA antigenicity. \n\nDNASE1L3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive monogenic Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in 2011 (PMID: 22019780). At least 5 loss-of-function genetic variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion) have been reported in humans, commonly in children from consanguineous marriages. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes multiple reports of case-level data. The initial 2011 report (PMID: 22019780) described a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.289_290 del) in DNASE1L3 in six individuals diagnosed with childhood-onset SLE, based on clinical and serological criteria. Additional cases of childhood-onset SLE with the same base-pair deletions were reported in 2017 (PMID: 27821515), 2018 (PMID: 30008451) and 2020 (PMID: 34161863). Additional variants in the DNASE1L3 gene with manifestations of SLE and/or lupus nephritis were reported in a case series in 2021 (PMID: 35670985). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies showing that the c.289_290 deletion mutation is associated with decreased expression of *DNASE1L3* RNA levels (PMID: 23666765). A SNP in *DNASE1L3* that is associated with increased SLE risk was also shown to be associated with decreased protein secretion of DNASE1L3 (PMID: 33455918). Decreased serum levels of DNASE1L3 are observed in the general SLE (and inflammatory myositis) population as compared to healthy controls; in SLE, lower DNASE1L3 levels are associated with higher clinical disease scores (PMID: 28039554). Animal models show that mice with DNASE1L3 deletion develop anti-DNA autoantibodies and lupus nephritis (PMID: 28039554). Deletion of *DNASE1L3* resulted in aberrations in the fragmentation of plasma DNA (PMID: 30593563); these aberrant DNA fragments were also present in the circulation of patients with the *DNASE1L3* disease-associated variants, but not in healthy controls (PMID: 33022220). In mice with the *DNASE1L3* deletion, the phenotype of aberrant DNA fragments in the peripheral circulation could be rescued by restoring DNASE1L3 production using viral vectors (PMID: 33022220).\n\nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence (18 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\n  \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DNASE1L3* and autosomal recessive monogenic Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:77450e46-30fa-4be0-aa0e-4e31f04a117e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
