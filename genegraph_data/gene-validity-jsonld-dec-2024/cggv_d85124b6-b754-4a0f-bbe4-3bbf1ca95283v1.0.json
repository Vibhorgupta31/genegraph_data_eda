NPPA encodes ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) a cardiac hormone produced in the atria and released in pathological conditions (e.g. heart failure, hypertrophy) associated with increased atrial wall stress (Lekanne Deprez et al, 1998, PMID: 9769242). There is no supporting human genetic evidence demonstrating this gene-disease relationship in the literature at the time of curation.  Variants in this gene have been found to be associated with autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation and autosomal recessive Atrial Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Standstill Evolution (OMIM 108780; Disertori et al, 2013, PMID: 23275345). The 13 patients with autosomal recessive Atrial Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Standstill Evolution were followed up to 37 years and showed normal left ventricular function and stable New York Heart Association functional class during the long-term course of the disease. No signs of a dilated (ventricular) cardiomyopathy. So far no disease association with DCM has been published. However, this gene-disease association is supported by expression studies. In the embryonic heart, ANP is a marker of differentiating working myocardium in the atria and ventricles. After birth, levels of ANP are downregulated in the ventricle, whereas levels in the atria remain high (Sizarov et al, 2011, PMID: 21403123). ANP-deficient mice exhibit (salt-sensitive) hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and exaggerated hypertrophic responses to thoracic aortic constriction and have abnormal ventricular histopathology with marked ventricular fibrosis. Heterozygous Nppa+/âˆ’ mice show normal phenotype, identical to that observed in Nppa+/+ mice, transgenic mice with homozygous disruption of either Nppa or Natriuretic Peptide Receptor A genes show significantly increased weight of each cardiac chamber, particularly the atrial chambers (John et al, 1995, PMID: 7839143; Oliver et al, 1997, PMID: 9405681; PMID Wang et al, 2003, PMID: 12756220). ANP has been shown to modulate cardiac electrophysiology in several ways, including inhibition of sympathetic nervous system activity and stimulation of parasympathetic nervous system activity. In addition, ANP has direct effects on calcium and potassium currents, as well as indirect effects on these channels by altering their autonomic regulation (Perrin et al, 2012, PMID: 22083030). ANP is a target of numerous cardiac transcription factors and plays an important role in cardiac development. No convincing evidence for a casual role for NPPA and autosomal dominant DCM has been reported. Although this gene-disease assertion is supported by expression studies, no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on October 25, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\nNo known disease association with DCM only with atrial fibrillation and atrial standstill with atrial dilation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d85124b6-b754-4a0f-bbe4-3bbf1ca95283"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
