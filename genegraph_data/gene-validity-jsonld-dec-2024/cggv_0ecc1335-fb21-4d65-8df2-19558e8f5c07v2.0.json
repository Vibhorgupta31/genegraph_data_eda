It shows phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding molecules in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in SHOC2, p.S2G, has been identified as causative for a type of Noonan-like syndrome characterized by the presence of loose anagen hair. In order to understand the contribution of SHOC2 mutations to the clinical manifestations of Noonan syndrome and related disorders, we analyzed SHOC2 in 92 patients with Noonan syndrome and related disorders who did not exhibit PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/2, SOS1 or RAF1 mutations. We found the previously identified p.S2G mutation in eight of our patients. We developed a rapid detection system to identify the p.S2G mutation using melting curve analysis, which will be a useful tool to screen for the apparently common mutation. All the patients with the p.S2G mutation showed short stature, sparse hair and atopic skin. Six of the mutation-positive patients showed severe mental retardation and easily pluckable hair, and one showed leukocytosis. No SHOC2 mutations were identified in leukemia cells from 82 leukemia patients. These results suggest that clinical manifestations in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients partially overlap with those in patients with typical Noonan or CFC syndrome and show that easily pluckable/loose anagen hair is distinctive in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients.","dc:creator":"Komatsuzaki S","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutation analysis of the SHOC2 gene in Noonan-like syndrome and in hematologic malignancies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20882035","rdfs:label":"NS232"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This study screened 92 patients with Noonan syndrome with mutations in other known Noonan genes.

It is associated with variable clinical expression including short stature, congenital heart defect, unusual pectus deformity, and typical facial features and the inheritance is autosomal dominant. Here, we present a clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair phenotype and additional features including mild psychomotor developmental delay, osteoporosis, gingival hyperplasia, spinal neuroblastoma, intrathoracic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and liver hemangioma. Mutation analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, NRAS, and SHOC2 was conducted, revealing a co-occurrence of two heterozygous previously identified mutations in the index patient. The mutation SHOC2 c.4A > G; p.Ser2Gly represents a de novo mutation, whereas, PTPN11 c.1226G > C; p.Gly409Ala was inherited from the mother and also identified in the brother. The mother and the brother present with some NS manifestations, such as short stature, delayed puberty, keratosis pilaris, caf√©-au-lait spots, refraction error (mother), and undescended testis (brother), but no NS facial features, supporting the notion that the PTPN11 p.Gly409Ala mutation leads to a relatively mild phenotype. We propose that, the atypical phenotype of the young woman with NS reported here is an additive effect, where the PTPN11 mutation acts as a modifier. Interestingly, co-occurrence of RAS-MAPK mutations has been previously identified in a few patients with variable NS or neurofibromatosis-NS phenotypes.

We previously reported that the p.Ser2Gly substitution in SHOC2 underlies Mazzanti syndrome, a RASopathy clinically overlapping Noonan syndrome, promoting N-myristoylation and constitutive targeting of the mutant to the plasma membrane. We also documented transient nuclear translocation of wild-type SHOC2 upon EGF stimulation, suggesting a more complex function in signal transduction.Here, we characterized the domains controlling SHOC2 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and those contributing to SHOC2S2G mistargeting to the plasma membrane, analysed the structural organization of SHOC2's LRR motifs, and determined the impact of SHOC2 mislocalization on ERK signalling. We show that LRRs 1 to 13 constitute a structurally recognizable domain required for SHOC2 import into the nucleus and constitutive targeting of SHOC2S2G to the plasma membrane, while the KEKE motif-rich region is necessary to achieve efficient SHOC2 export from the nucleus. We also document that SHOC2S2G localizes both in raft and non-raft domains, and that it translocates to the non-raft domains following stimulation.

Upon EGFR activation, endogenous Shoc2 and red fluorescent protein tagged Shoc2 were translocated from the cytosol to a subset of late endosomes containing Rab7. The endosomal recruitment of Shoc2 was blocked by overexpression of a GDP-bound H-RAS (N17S) mutant and RNAi knockdown of clathrin, suggesting the requirement of RAS activity and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. RNAi depletion of Shoc2 strongly inhibited activation of ERK1/2 by low, physiological EGF concentrations, which was rescued by expression of wild-type recombinant Shoc2. In contrast, the Shoc2 (S2G) mutant, that is myristoylated and found in patients with the Noonan-like syndrome, did not rescue ERK1/2 activation in Shoc2-depleted cells. Shoc2 (S2G) was not located in late endosomes but was present on the plasma membrane and early endosomes.
