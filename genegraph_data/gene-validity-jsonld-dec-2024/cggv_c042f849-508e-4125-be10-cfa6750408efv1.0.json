She has a history of childhood-onset antibody defects, cytopenias, and T lymphocytic pneumonitis and colitis, with reduced peripheral blood memory B, memory CD8+ T, and regulatory T cells and increased CXCR3+ tissue-homing CD4 T cells. PI3Kγ-deficient macrophages and monocytes produce elevated inflammatory IL-12 and IL-23 in a GSK3α/β-dependent manner upon TLR stimulation. Pik3cg-deficient mice recapitulate major features of human disease after exposure to natural microbiota through co-housing with pet-store mice.

Each patient is compound heterozygous for partial to full loss of function variants, for a total of four variants (3 missense and one frameshift). *PIK3CG* encodes the p110γ catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ, which phosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 to produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a versatile second messenger that potently activates diverse signaling cascades to coordinate the cellular response to growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and antigen receptor stimulation, among other inputs.  Data are consistent with a mechanistic model in which deficiency in PI3Kγ results in GSK3-dependent overproduction of IL-12 and IL-23 by myeloid cells, leading to increased T cell accumulation in tissues that, together with defective immunoglobulin production and reduced regulatory T cells, underlies disease pathophysiology. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its increased expression in tissues involved in immune responses (PMID: 24014027) and function as a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PMID: 24014027) which participates in T cell receptor–induced T cell activation (PMID: 17998387) which was observed in both patient and knock out cells (PMID: 33054089).
