The authors adressed this by analysing EVC and EVC2 in Wdr35−/− fibroblasts by immunoblotting\nand immunofluorescence.

To understand why WDR35 variants result in EvC, we analysed EVC, EVC2 and Smoothened (SMO) in IFT-A deficient cells. We found that the three proteins failed to localize to Wdr35(-/-) cilia, but not to the cilium of the IFT retrograde motor mutant Dync2h1(-/-), indicating that IFT121 is specifically required for their entry into the ciliary compartment. Furthermore expression of Wdr35 disease cDNAs in Wdr35(-/-) fibroblasts revealed that the newly identified variants lead to Hedgehog signalling defects resembling those of Evc(-/-) and Evc2(-/-) mutants.

The characterization of ciliopathy-associated proteins and phenotypes has improved our knowledge of ciliary functions. In particular, investigating ciliopathies has helped us to understand the molecular mechanisms by which the cilium-associated basal body functions in early ciliogenesis, as well as how the transition zone functions in ciliary gating, and how intraflagellar transport enables cargo trafficking and signalling. Both basic biological and clinical studies are uncovering novel ciliopathies and the ciliary proteins involved. The assignment of these proteins to different ciliary structures, processes and ciliopathy subclasses (first order and second order) provides insights into how this versatile organelle is built, compartmentalized and functions in diverse ways that are essential for human health.","dc:creator":"Reiter JF","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Genes and molecular pathways underpinning ciliopathies."},"rdfs:label":"WDR35 role in ciliogenesis & Mammalian Hedgehog signalling"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9e3f8578-6df2-4503-9e38-c110a9f00924_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73809d62-a4f1-4a53-a7f2-01293662135d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:22d59c96-c1ec-4724-b3d1-a2e9b01af9b0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The authors analyzed the primary fibroblast from human (patient) (Figures 3A–3D) and mouse (Figures 3E–3K) controls and WDR35 mutants in order to better characterize the cellular function of WDR35 in primary cilia,.

The short-rib polydactyly (SRP) group of disorders are among the most severe human phenotypes caused by cilia dysfunction. We mapped the disease locus from two siblings affected by a severe form of SRP to 2p24, where we identified an in-frame homozygous deletion of exon 5 in WDR35. We subsequently found compound heterozygous missense and nonsense mutations in WDR35 in an independent second case with a similar, severe SRP phenotype. In a mouse mutation screen for developmental phenotypes, we identified a mutation in Wdr35 as the cause of midgestation lethality, with abnormalities characteristic of defects in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. We show that endogenous WDR35 localizes to cilia and centrosomes throughout the developing embryo and that human and mouse fibroblasts lacking the protein fail to produce cilia. Through structural modeling, we show that WDR35 has strong homology to the COPI coatamers involved in vesicular trafficking and that human SRP mutations affect key structural elements in WDR35.

On structure predictive algorithm used.\nA similar configuration of N-terminal WD40 repeats and C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like motifs observed in WDR35 (Figure 1E) is found in other IFT complex A and B proteins. The WD40/WD40-like repeats are involved in intracellular trafficking, cargo recognition, and binding. A similar protein structure is also shared with the coat complexes COPI, COPII and clathrin, which are involved in vesicle trafficking, and it was recently shown that in coat proteins, the N-terminal WD40-like b-propeller is essential for vesicular cage formation. Taking advantage of the high secondary-structure homology of WDR35 to the structure of yeast B'-COP, structure-prediction algorithms and homology were used to model the structure of WDR35 (Figure S6). WDR35 is predicted to fold into two seven-bladed b-propellers, each with an offset WD40-like repeat, followed by an extended TPR-containing a-solenoid domain (Figures 4B and 4C). SRP-3-1 missense mutation (p.Trp261Arg) changes one of seven highly conserved tryptophan residues at the inner face of the same propeller. (Figures 4C and 4D). That both SRP deletion and missense mutations impact the N-terminal b-propeller, which has been implicated in higher-order organization of COPI complexes, suggests that these mutations interrupt key interaction motifs required for IFT-A train assembly or stability, resulting in abrogated retrograde transport."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Predicted null as exon 5 deletion\nHomozygous variants\nReduced to total score of 2\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9d9b8df8-ade8-4852-a650-fca12077e2e8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9d9b8df8-ade8-4852-a650-fca12077e2e8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":23,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d4186c9a-0136-4362-bd9d-74cdad387243","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020779.4(WDR35):c.143-18T>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658683176"}},"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing performed in proband case 1 detected a T>A nucleotide\ntransversion in intron 2 of WDR35 at position −18 with respect to exon 3 (c.143−18T>A; Chr2:20182313 A>T.

A subset of these disorders is distinguished by profound abnormalities of the skeleton that include a long narrow chest with markedly short ribs, extremely short limbs, and polydactyly. These include the perinatal lethal short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) and the less severe asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD), Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome, and cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) phenotypes. To identify new genes and define the spectrum of mutations in the skeletal ciliopathies, we analyzed 152 unrelated families with SRPS, ATD, and EVC. Causal variants were discovered in 14 genes in 120 families, including one newly associated gene and two genes previously associated with other ciliopathies. These three genes encode components of three different ciliary complexes; FUZ, which encodes a planar cell polarity complex molecule; TRAF3IP1, which encodes an anterograde ciliary transport protein; and LBR, which encodes a nuclear membrane protein with sterol reductase activity.

The WD40/WD40-like repeats are involved in intracellular trafficking, cargo recognition, and binding. A similar protein structure is also shared with the coat complexes COPI, COPII and clathrin, which are involved in vesicle trafficking, and it was recently shown that in coat\nproteins, the N-terminal WD40-like b-propeller is essential for vesicular cage formation.

WDR35 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) type 2, also known as Sensenbrenner syndrome (Gilissen et al., 2010, PMID: 20817137). Mill et al., 2011 (PMID: 21473986) subsequently identified that variants in WDR35 also caused short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRP), which is an autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathy characterized by narrow thorax, short ribs, shortened tubular bones, and a trident appearance of the acetabular roof (PMID: 21473986). WDR35-related short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD) encompasses short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRPS), Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC) and the disorders previously designated as Jeune syndrome or asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) which have overlapping features with cranioectodermal dysplasias. These conditions have overlapping phenotypes, which differ by the presence of specific craniofacial features, ectodermal dysplasia, visceral malformation, metaphyseal appearance. Polydactyly is variably present. Non-skeletal involvement can include cleft lip/palate as well as anomalies of major organs including the brain, eye, heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, intestines, and genitalia. The lumping of these terms is consistent with lumping the Skeletal Disorders GCEP has done with other SRTDs.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Biallelic variants in WDR35 (including nonsense, frameshift, splice, and missense variants, small and large deletions) were identified in at least 10 patients with clinical features suggestive of short-rib polydactyly syndrome or Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (PMID: 21473986; Duran et al., 2017, PMID: 28400947; Caparrós-Martín et al., 2015, PMID: 25908617; Zhang et al., 2018, PMID: 29068549). At least 13 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice, and missense variants, small and gross deletions) have been reported in humans. This gene-disease association is supported by non-human model organism studies, protein interaction studies and functional alteration analysis (PMIDs: 21473986; 28400947; 25908617; Reiter et al., 2017, PMID: 28698599). In summary, the WDR35 gene is definitively associated with short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD) that encompasses short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRPS), Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC) and the disorders previously designated as Jeune syndrome or asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) (autosomal recessive inheritance). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 02.23.2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9e3f8578-6df2-4503-9e38-c110a9f00924"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
