We report three new cases of FOXP1-related disorder identified through clinical whole-exome sequencing. Detailed phenotypic assessment confirmed that global developmental delay, autistic features, speech/language deficits, hypotonia and mild dysmorphic features are core features of the disorder. We expand the phenotypic spectrum to include sensory integration disorder and hypertelorism. Notably, the etiological variants in these cases include two missense variants within the DNA-binding domain of FOXP1. Only one such variant has been reported previously. The third patient carries a stop-gain variant. We performed functional characterization of the three missense variants alongside our stop-gain and two previously described truncating/frameshift variants. All variants severely disrupted multiple aspects of protein function. Strikingly, the missense variants had similarly severe effects on protein function as the truncating/frameshift variants. Our findings indicate that a loss of transcriptional repression activity of FOXP1 underlies the neurodevelopmental phenotype in FOXP1-related disorder. Interestingly, the three novel variants retained the ability to interact with wild-type FOXP1, suggesting these variants could exert a dominant-negative effect by interfering with the normal FOXP1 protein. These variants also retained the ability to interact with FOXP2, a paralogous transcription factor disrupted in rare cases of speech and language disorder. Thus, speech/language deficits in these individuals might be worsened through deleterious effects on FOXP2 function. Our findings highlight that de novo FOXP1 variants are a cause of sporadic ID and emphasize the importance of this transcription factor in neurodevelopment.","dc:creator":"Sollis E","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Identification and functional characterization of de novo FOXP1 variants provides novel insights into the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorder."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647308","rdfs:label":"Patient 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:aea34c74-7f07-45e3-a1cd-a64633e83718_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be4d3add-d3fa-41b4-ba45-6a8d14d469a8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"detectionMethod":"Clinical exome sequencing of the proband and her unaffected parents was\nperformed in the UCLA Clinical Genomics Center.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0009906","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0002500","obo:HP_0030223","obo:HP_0010529","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0000687","obo:HP_0000718","obo:HP_0000508","obo:HP_0000297","obo:HP_0002194","obo:HP_0010863","obo:HP_0002474","obo:HP_0007018","obo:HP_0000729","obo:HP_0000722","obo:HP_0012482"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Investigations with normal results included genetic testing for\nmuscular dystrophy, mitochondrial disorders, fragile X syndrome\nand SNP microarray.

FOXP2 and its closest homolog, FOXP1, are coexpressed in brain regions that are important for language and cooperatively regulate developmental processes, raising the possibility that FOXP1 may also be involved in developmental conditions that are associated with language impairment. In order to explore this possibility, we searched for mutations in FOXP1 in patients with intellectual disability (ID; mental retardation) and/or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We first performed array-based genomic hybridization on sporadic nonsyndromic ID (NSID) (n = 30) or ASD (n = 80) cases.

Luciferase reporter assays showed that the p.R525X alteration disrupts the activity of the protein. Formal assessments revealed that both patients with de novo mutations in FOXP1 also show severe language impairment, mood lability with physical aggressiveness, and specific obsessions and compulsions. In conclusion, both FOXP1 and FOXP2 are associated with language impairment, but decrease of the former has a more global impact on brain development than that of the latter.","dc:creator":"Hamdan FF","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"De novo mutations in FOXP1 in cases with intellectual disability, autism, and language impairment."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20950788","rdfs:label":"R0024121-patient B"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Although maternity and paternity confirmed, downgraded due to patient having no mention of dysmorphic features."},{"id":"cggv:3eab3b75-7410-4441-93d7-4a525136cc99_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2a3be73c-6a9a-402e-8f74-232feeda3fa2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"detectionMethod":"CGH microarray using 60k Oligo ISCA design (BlueGnome), analyzed\nwith BlueMulti v2.3.","firstTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011220","obo:HP_0011918","obo:HP_0000455","obo:HP_0002307","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000272","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0000494","obo:HP_0011298","obo:HP_0003196"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Investigations with normal results included fragile X testing (19\nCGGrepeats in FMR1) and urine metabolic screen (including urine\namino acid, organic acid, and glycosaminoglycan screen).

Mutations in FOXP2, located at 7q31, are well known to cause developmental speech and language disorders, particularly developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD). FOXP2 has been shown to work co-operatively with FOXP1 in mouse development. An overlap in FOXP1 and FOXP2 expression, both in the songbird and human fetal brain, has suggested that FOXP1 may also have a role in speech and language disorders. We report on a male child with a 0.19 MB intragenic deletion that is predicted to result in haploinsufficiency of FOXP1. Review of our patient and others reported in the literature reveals an emerging phenotype of GDD/ID with moderate to severe speech delay where expressive speech is most severely affected. DVD appears not to be a distinct feature in this group. Facial features include a broad forehead, downslanting palpebral fissures, a short nose with broad tip, relative or true macrocephaly, a frontal hair upsweep and prominent digit pads. Autistic traits and other behavioral problems are likely to be associated with haploinsufficiency of FOXP1.

Thus, unbiased genomic approaches are needed to discover genetic alterations leading to DD and/or ID. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate genetic causes in 35 Korean patients with unexplained DD/ID. Methods: Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the TruSight One Panel was analyzed in 35 patients with unexplained DD/ID. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm candidate variants, and to define genetic inheritance mode of candidate variant as familial segregation testing. Results: Of 35 patients with DD and/or ID, 10 were found to have underlying genetic etiology and carried X-linked recessive inheritance of ZDHHC9 or autosomal dominant inheritance of SMARCB1, CHD8, LAMA5, NSD1, PAX6, CACNA1H, MBD5, FOXP1, or KCNK18 mutations. No autosomal recessive inherited mutation was identified in this study. As a result, the diagnostic yield of DD/ID by targeted NGS was 29% (10/35), mostly involving may be de novo mutation present in the proband only. A total of seven may be de novo mutations, one paternally inherited, and one maternally inherited mutations that had been reported previously to concede the genetic pathogenesis as known DD and/or ID genes were found in nine patients with available inheritance pattern except LAMA5. Mutations in nine causative genes were detected in patients with similar DD/ID phenotypes in the OMIM database, providing support for genetic evidence as the cause of DD and/or ID. Conclusion: Targeted NGS through singleton analysis with phenotype-first approaches was able to explain 10 out of 35 DD/ID cases. However, the excavation of plausible genetic causes may be de novo, and X-linked disease-causative variants in DD/ID-associated genes requires further genetic analysis.","dc:creator":"Han JY","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing of Korean Patients With Developmental Delay and/or Intellectual Disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30631761","rdfs:label":"38_S2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Did not score as too common in gnomAD, see in 2/19932 East Asians:\nhttps://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/3-71247378-G-A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:808a5497-704a-4690-9a5f-e7fe8e87db6c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:12e8c022-bfcc-4a4b-8eb5-c3124445d792","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Foxp1 is found in various structures throughout the developing mouse brain as well as in mature adult brain and most highly expressed throughout the striatum, ventral striatum, and  substantia nigra.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12687690","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Foxp2 and Foxp1 are recently identified members of the Fox family of winged-helix/forkhead transcription factor genes. A recent study has found that mutations in human FOXP2 produce a severe language disorder. Since Foxp2 appears to be important in language, we wanted to explore the expression of this gene and a homologous gene, Foxp1, in the developing brain. In the present study, we investigated the time course and localization of Foxp2 and Foxp1 mRNA and protein expression in the developing and adult mouse using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Foxp2 and Foxp1 are expressed as early as E12.5 and persist into adulthood. Foxp2 and Foxp1 were most highly expressed in the developing and mature basal ganglia. Expression of Foxp2 was also observed in the cerebral cortex (layer 6), cerebellum (Purkinje neurons), and thalamus. Foxp1 expression was observed in the cerebral cortex (layers 3-5), hippocampus (CA1), and thalamus. Very little ventricular zone expression was observed for Foxp2 and Foxp1 and the expression of both of these genes occurred following neuronal migration, suggesting a role for these genes in postmigratory neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated the expression of FOXP2 in human fetal brain by RT-PCR, in the perisylvian area of the left and right cerebral hemispheres, as well as in the frontal and occipital cortices. Overall, the widespread expression of Foxp2 in the developing brain makes it difficult to draw specific conclusions about which areas of Foxp2 expression are critical to human language function.","dc:creator":"Ferland RJ","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Characterization of Foxp2 and Foxp1 mRNA and protein in the developing and mature brain."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse brain"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c178b199-e8c4-4678-a755-46c397fa961c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c72f913-0800-4236-88ae-4ef85cab5bbe","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"All six FOXP1 variants showed significant (P < 0.001) loss of repressive activity,","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647308","rdfs:label":"Luciferase assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1e243297-f5d9-4669-80b4-a445deb022b5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da8b9fb8-7bb9-402b-89b9-7ebcf2c683a3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Wild-type FOXP1 and FOXP1-Thr390Ile significantly inhibited pGL3-promoter (SV40) transcriptional activity (p<0.001) as compared with empty vector\n(pcDNA4)-transfected cells only (comparisons for each pair using Student’s t-test).

Mice with Foxp1 knockdown exhibited ectopic neurons in deep layers of the cortex postnatally. The neuronal differentiation of Foxp1-downregulated cells was normal. However, morphological analysis showed that the neurons with Foxp1 deficiency had an inhibited axonal growth in vitro and a weakened transition from multipolar to bipolar in vivo. Moreover, we found that the expression of Foxp1 modulated the dendritic maturation of neurons at a late postnatal date. Our results demonstrate critical roles of Foxp1 in the radial migration and morphogenesis of cortical neurons during development.

Previous studies have implicated the transcription factor FOXP1 in both brain development and ASD pathophysiology. However, the specific molecular pathways both upstream of and downstream from FOXP1 are not fully understood. To elucidate the contribution of FOXP1-mediated signaling to brain development and, in particular, neocortical development, we generated forebrain-specific Foxp1 conditional knockout mice. We show that deletion of Foxp1 in the developing forebrain leads to impairments in neonatal vocalizations as well as neocortical cytoarchitectonic alterations via neuronal positioning and migration. Using a genomics approach, we identified the transcriptional networks regulated by Foxp1 in the developing neocortex and found that such networks are enriched for downstream targets involved in neurogenesis and neuronal migration. We also uncovered mechanistic insight into Foxp1 function by demonstrating that sumoylation of Foxp1 during embryonic brain development is necessary for mediating proper interactions between Foxp1 and the NuRD complex. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sumoylation of Foxp1 affects neuronal differentiation and migration in the developing neocortex. Together, these data provide critical mechanistic insights into the function of FOXP1 in the developing neocortex and may reveal molecular pathways at risk in ASD.","dc:creator":"Usui N","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Foxp1 regulation of neonatal vocalizations via cortical development."},"rdfs:label":"Foxp1 conditional knockout mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded as impairments in neonatal mouse USVs are not a direct equivalent to human expressive language delay."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":428,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7cd098d4-36db-4ef3-888c-1fda0711f3dc","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013352","gene":"hgnc:3823","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"FOXP1 alone was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant intellectual disability-severe speech delay-mild dysmorphism syndrome in 2010 (Carr et al., 20571508; Hamdan et al., 20950788; Horn et al., 20848658).
