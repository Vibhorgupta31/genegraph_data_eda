The complex is known to contain the coiled-coil-forming proteins, Pallidin, Muted, Cappuccino, and Dysbindin. The genes encoding these proteins are defective in inbred mouse strains that serve as models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a genetic disorder characterized by hypopigmentation and platelet storage pool deficiency. In addition, mutation of human Dysbindin causes HPS type 7. Here, we report the identification of another four subunits of the complex. One is Snapin, a coiled-coil-forming protein previously characterized as a binding partner of synaptosomal-associated proteins 25 and 23 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events. The other three are previously uncharacterized proteins, which we named BLOC subunits 1, 2, and 3 (BLOS1, -2, and -3). Using specific antibodies to detect endogenous proteins from human and mouse cells, we found that Snapin, BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3 co-immunoprecipitate, and co-fractionate upon size exclusion chromatography, with previously known BLOC-1 subunits. Furthermore, steady-state levels of the four proteins are significantly reduced in cells from pallid mice, which carry a mutation in Pallidin and display secondary loss of other BLOC-1 subunits. Yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest a network of binary interactions involving all of the previously known and newly identified subunits. Interestingly, the HPS mouse model strain, reduced pigmentation, carries a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding BLOS3. As judged from size exclusion chromatographic analyses, the reduced pigmentation mutation affects BLOC-1 assembly less severely than the pallid mutation. Mutations in the human genes encoding Snapin and the BLOS proteins could underlie novel forms of HPS.","dc:creator":"Starcevic M","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Identification of snapin and three novel proteins (BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3/reduced pigmentation) as subunits of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1)."},"rdfs:label":"Starcevic_PI"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"BLOC1S3 and Dysbindin (DTNBP1) are also implicated in HPS subtype 8 and 7, respectively."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:984682a2-afb9-48b3-afe8-20e0f633022d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:861b3a79-c3db-470b-a3b5-29ba878f6b73","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc40be23-9a91-4548-8e9a-00037f258c49","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The \"pallid\" mouse was suggested as a model for HPS due to the phenotype similarity with the human disease, as early as the 1980s.

Here we describe the physical mapping, positional cloning, and mutational and functional analysis of the gene that is defective in pa mice. It encodes a ubiquitously expressed, highly charged 172-amino-acid protein (termed pallidin) with no homology to known proteins. We detected a nonsense mutation at codon 69 of this gene in the pallid mutant. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we discovered that pallidin interacts with syntaxin 13, a t-SNARE protein that mediates vesicle-docking and fusion. We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Immunofluorescence studies corroborate that the cellular distribution of pallidin overlaps that of syntaxin 13.

Absence of platelet dense granules was found by whole-mount platelet electron microscopy and Western blotting assays showed the destabilized BLOC-1 subunits. He had recurrent bruising and was found to have abnormal brain waves by electroencephalogram, but did not develop thrombopenia, immunodeficiency or other symptoms reported in other HPS-9 patients. This is the first case report of BLOC-1 mutation in a Chinese population and our findings expand the mutational spectrum of HPS genes.","dc:creator":"Liu T","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"The first Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 9 patient with two novel variants in Chinese population."}},{"id":"cggv:0f9076fa-677a-4e2a-976c-78d532223368_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d9dea3b2-a5d3-4bbb-a490-a3c6e8ff30da"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33543539"}],"rdfs:label":"Chinese Patient"},{"id":"cggv:0f9076fa-677a-4e2a-976c-78d532223368","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f9076fa-677a-4e2a-976c-78d532223368_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"scored in accordance with SOPv7\n\nPaternally inherited Glu50Ter nonsense variant occurs in exon 2 of 5 and is expected to result in NMD."},{"id":"cggv:93f1b38f-dba2-4866-a363-0dbddf60fdde","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93f1b38f-dba2-4866-a363-0dbddf60fdde_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"scored in accordance with SOPv7\n\nMaternally inherited c.351dup frameshift variant occurs in exon 4 and creates a premature stop codon in the final exon 5 so is not expected to result in NMD but Western blotting of the patient showed absent protein and decreased dysbindin."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4489,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e2eb35d1-3e6b-4f07-86d1-cfc57e732482","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013606","gene":"hgnc:8549","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"*BLOC1S6* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 9 in 2012 (Badolato et al., PMID: 22461475). Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 9 is a subtype of HPS, characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and platelet dysfunction. *BLOC1S6* encodes the coiled-coil-forming protein, Pallidin, a subunit of the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex 1, BLOC-1, which is required for normal biogenesis of specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules (PMID: 15102850). Of the 8 subunits of BLOC-1, mutations in three, including BLOC1S6, are reported in association with HPS subtypes in humans (Huizing et al., Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, GeneReviews). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (9 points):\nSix variants (nonsense, frameshift, and missense) in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 22461475, 29054114, 26575419, 32245340, 33543539).  \n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.  \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (3 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by studies of protein interaction with other subunits of BLOC-1 and by the spontaneously occurring mouse mutation, “pallid” that recapitulates the HPS phenotype. \n\nIn summary, *BLOC1S6* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 9. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 09/23/2020. It was reevaluated on 05/25/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Moderate to Definitive due to a new case report (PMID: 33543539).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:984682a2-afb9-48b3-afe8-20e0f633022d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
