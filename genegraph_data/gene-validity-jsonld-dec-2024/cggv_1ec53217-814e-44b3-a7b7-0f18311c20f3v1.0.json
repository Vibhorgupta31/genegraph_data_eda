CHF due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a familial disease in 20-30% of cases and is associated with mutations in genes encoding cytoskeletal, contractile or inner-nuclear membrane proteins. We show that mutations in the gene encoding giant-muscle filament titin (TTN) cause autosomal dominant DCM linked to chromosome 2q31 (CMD1G; MIM 604145). Titin molecules extend from sarcomeric Z-discs to M-lines, provide an extensible scaffold for the contractile machinery and are crucial for myofibrillar elasticity and integrity. In a large DCM kindred, a segregating 2-bp insertion mutation in TTN exon 326 causes a frameshift, truncating A-band titin. The truncated protein of approximately 2 mD is expressed in skeletal muscle, but western blot studies with epitope-specific anti-titin antibodies suggest that the mutant protein is truncated to a 1.14-mD subfragment by site-specific cleavage. In another large family with DCM linked to CMD1G, a TTN missense mutation (Trp930Arg) is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved hydrophobic core sequence of an immunoglobulin fold located in the Z-disc-I-band transition zone. The identification of TTN mutations in individuals with CMD1G should provide further insights into the pathogenesis of familial forms of CHF and myofibrillar titin turnover.","dc:creator":"Gerull B","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mutations of TTN, encoding the giant muscle filament titin, cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"WESTERN BLOTTING"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:154715fb-00a3-4310-8345-58717e1f95b8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1fffb3a5-ef55-46d8-8a3b-36d86a43f9b5","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Human cardiac microtissue (CMTs) expressing either A-band TTNtv or W976R+/− variants exhibited less than half the contractile force or the stress (force normalized to tissue area) generated by pWTs, and function did not improve over time.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26315439","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Human mutations that truncate the massive sarcomere protein titin [TTN-truncating variants (TTNtvs)] are the most common genetic cause for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a major cause of heart failure and premature death.

Mutant cells transplanted to wildtype hearts remain thin and bulge outwards as individual cell aneurysms without affecting nearby wildtype cardiomyocytes, indicating that the contractile deficiency is cell-autonomous.

Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a genetically heterogeneous disease with >30 known genes. TTN truncating variants were recently implicated in a candidate gene study to cause 25% of familial and 18% of sporadic DCM cases. METHODS AND RESULTS- We used an unbiased genome-wide approach using both linkage analysis and variant filtering across the exome sequences of 48 individuals affected with DCM from 17 families to identify genetic cause. Linkage analysis ranked the TTN region as falling under the second highest genome-wide multipoint linkage peak, multipoint logarithm of odds, 1.59. We identified 6 TTN truncating variants carried by individuals affected with DCM in 7 of 17 DCM families (logarithm of odds, 2.99); 2 of these 7 families also had novel missense variants that segregated with disease. Two additional novel truncating TTN variants did not segregate with DCM. Nucleotide diversity at the TTN locus, including missense variants, was comparable with 5 other known DCM genes. The average number of missense variants in the exome sequences from the DCM cases or the ≈5400 cases from the Exome Sequencing Project was ≈23 per individual. The average number of TTN truncating variants in the Exome Sequencing Project was 0.014 per individual. We also identified a region (chr9q21.11-q22.31) with no known DCM genes with a maximum heterogeneity logarithm of odds score of 1.74. CONCLUSIONS- These data suggest that TTN truncating variants contribute to DCM cause. However, the lack of segregation of all identified TTN truncating variants illustrates the challenge of determining variant pathogenicity even with full exome sequencing.","dc:creator":"Norton N","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Exome sequencing and genome-wide linkage analysis in 17 families illustrate the complex contribution of TTN truncating variants to dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23418287","rdfs:label":"III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:633d3c3f-413d-419f-93bf-fe13767d61ff_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4d98e2c-e908-4411-97c4-12792e38bf72","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":52,"detectionMethod":"WES FOLLOWED BY LINKAGE ANALYSIS AND COPY NUMBER VARIATION ANALYSIS","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:633d3c3f-413d-419f-93bf-fe13767d61ff_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f294e41b-f953-4bf6-ac41-8c084e13da41","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.101227C>T (p.Arg33743Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA309376"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23418287"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23418287","rdfs:label":"II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:b679b209-85de-43c8-b255-67c58999637d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:35233d2d-5757-4b59-b8dd-8c9741d428ea","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":32,"detectionMethod":"The gene panel (Pan Cardiomyopathy Panel, Blueprint Genetics v.1.0) was designed to screen 2515 consensus coding sequence (CCDS) regions and splice junctions of 51 known\ngenes and 50 candidate genes associated with DCM and implicated in other inherited cardiomyopathies based on Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database annotations and literature.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b679b209-85de-43c8-b255-67c58999637d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ccaf3914-be60-4e36-a8cf-7146742a5c4a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.88422G>A (p.Trp29474Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA349527671"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26084686","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Despite our increased understanding of the genetic basis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the clinical utility and yield of clinically meaningful findings of comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic diagnostics in DCM has been poorly described.

We sought to examine the frequency of truncating variants in TTN in patients with DCM, including familial DCM (FDCM), and to look for genotype-phenotype correlations. Clinical cardiovascular data, family histories and blood samples were collected from 72 DCM probands, mean age of 34 years, 45.8% FDCM. DNA samples were examined by next generation sequencing (NGS) with a focus on the TTN gene. Truncating mutations were followed up by segregation study among family members. We identified 16 TTN truncating variants (TTN trunc) in 17 probands (23.6% of all cases, 30.3% of FDCM, 17.9% of sporadic DCM). During mean 63 months from diagnosis, there was no difference in adverse cardiac events between probands with and without TTN truncating mutations. Among relatives 29 mutation carriers were identified, nine were definitely affected (31%), eight probably affected (27.6%) one possibly affected (3.4%) and eleven were not affected (37.9%). When relatives with all affected statuses were combined, disease penetrance was still incomplete (62.1%) even after exclusion of unaffected relatives under 40 (82%) and was higher in males versus females. In all mutation carriers, during follow-up, 17.4% had major adverse cardiac events, and prognosis was significantly worse in men than in women. In conclusion, TTN truncating variants were observed in nearly one fourth of young DCM patient population, in vast majority without conduction system disease. Incomplete penetrance suggests possible influence of other genetic and/or environmental factors on the course of cardiotitinopathy. Counseling should take into account sex and incomplete penetrance.","dc:creator":"Franaszczyk M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Titin Truncating Variants in Dilated Cardiomyopathy - Prevalence and Genotype-Phenotype Correlations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28045975","rdfs:label":"II-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:2984d006-6459-4246-94d1-6f0ac44daaab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f853d865-7786-4135-a9e8-a0706e8eccb4","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":23,"detectionMethod":"The TTN sequence was assessed in group C by means of traditional Sanger\ndideoxy sequencing performed at the Department of Genome Sciences, University of\nWashington.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2984d006-6459-4246-94d1-6f0ac44daaab_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:05280030-6efc-4ccd-b550-8922fa85c6a9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.61876C>T (p.Arg20626Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA261891"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22335739"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22335739","rdfs:label":"DNFDC142-05-0569"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:670fb58c-d1da-40c9-b867-7843f22c1531_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:df894295-5e09-4e40-8fc1-cb699ed4a6b2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":43,"detectionMethod":"From genomic DNA isolated from subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy, we determined TTN sequences by means of traditional dideoxy sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:670fb58c-d1da-40c9-b867-7843f22c1531_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5442935d-23da-40fe-9cd2-94ba326a95b6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.98506C>T (p.Arg32836Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353281"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22335739"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22335739","rdfs:label":"UK-G9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:2a2b8e7e-a073-4991-aebd-525f4e1da4d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:01fdb6d4-6195-40e2-8cb1-52a2eeec65f7","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Genetic testing in probands was performed using next generation sequencing (NGS). 44 patients were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES), in 22 TruSight One (TSO) sequencing panel and in 6 sequencing of a custom panel of 35 genes involved in cardiomyopathies (ABCC9, ACTC1, ACTN2, ANKRD1, BAG3, CRYAB, CSRP3, DES, EMD, ILK, LAMA4, LDB3, LMNA, MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, MYPN, PDLIM3, PLN, PSEN1, PSEN2, RBM20, SCN5A, SGCD, TAZ, TCAP, TMPO, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, TTN, VCL) were performed.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2a2b8e7e-a073-4991-aebd-525f4e1da4d6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5063665e-1157-44f3-8647-1e68022cc9b3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.63025C>T (p.Arg21009Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA309491"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28045975"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28045975","rdfs:label":"III-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:7ad8b96f-6e4e-454a-8e7e-23a34774ba26_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b64908b-edb9-4d9c-a418-88940bd73dac","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":23,"detectionMethod":"Blood samples were collected for DNA analysis and studied for rare variants in MYH6 (GenBank accession no.

(TTN) was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2002 (Gerull et al, 2002, PMID: 22335739). Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, case-control data and segregation data. Over 100 truncating TTN variants (TTNtv) have been reported in humans with DCM (Gerull et al, 2006, PMID: 16733766; Herman et al, 2012 PMID: 22335739; Norton et al, 2013, PMID: 23418287; Akinrinade et al, 2015, PMID: 26084686; Franaszczyk et al, 2017, PMID: 28045875). Strong case-control data has been reported in a study comparing the frequency of TTNtv in large populations of healthy volunteers and DCM patients (Roberts et al, 2015, PMID: 25589632). In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental data including animal models (zebrafish – Xu et al, 2002, PMID: 11788825; mouse – Gramlich et al, 2009, PMID: 19406126 and rat – Schafer et al, 2017, PMID: 27869827); human induced pluripotent stem cell studies (Hinson et al, 2015, #26315439) and phenotype rescue experiments in animal models and human induced pluripotent stem cells from DCM patients (Gramlich et al, 2015, PMID: 25759365).  Additional evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence has been reached. In summary, truncating variants TTN are definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on September 29, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
