We identified three distinct heterozygous missense SMAD4 mutations affecting the codon for Ile500 in 11 individuals with Myhre syndrome. All three mutations are located in the region of SMAD4 encoding the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain near the site of monoubiquitination at Lys519, and we found a defect in SMAD4 ubiquitination in fibroblasts from affected individuals. We also observed decreased expression of downstream TGF-β target genes, supporting the idea of impaired TGF-β-mediated transcriptional control in individuals with Myhre syndrome.","dc:creator":"Le Goff C","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations at a single codon in Mad homology 2 domain of SMAD4 cause Myhre syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Increased SMAD4 expression in patient's fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:193a2ffd-2672-4ed0-94ac-00eef74ed7c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06b23346-9830-4139-98f7-0f03e4570cca","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Pathogenic variants in genes that cause abnormal TGF-B and BMP target genes expression are implicated in NDD.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22158539","rdfs:label":"Abnormal transcriptional regulation of TGFb and BMP targets"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a5a082cc-c214-4bfa-8cb8-caead239d129_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:82123db4-5478-469e-ad70-d07cf4d70e8b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c5779ee5-19cf-4be2-8c65-7c240b7f85db","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Overexpression of Smad4 in hippocampal neurons\nsuppressed total dendritic length, branch numbers, complexity and axonal growth compared with control.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines play pivotal roles in development, but little is known about their contribution to morphological development of neurons. Here we show that the Smad-dependent canonical signaling of TGF-β family cytokines negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis during brain development. Mechanistically, activated Smads form a complex with transcriptional repressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF), and downregulate the expression of a neuronal polarity regulator, collapsin response mediator protein 2. We also demonstrate that TGF-β family signaling inhibits neurite elongation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Furthermore, the expression of TGF-β receptor 1, Smad4, or TGIF, which have mutations found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, disrupted neuronal morphogenesis in both mouse (male and female) and human (female) neurons. Together, these findings suggest that the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis by an evolutionarily conserved function of TGF-β signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases.","dc:creator":"Nakashima H","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Canonical TGF-β Signaling Negatively Regulates Neuronal Morphogenesis through TGIF/Smad Complex-Mediated CRMP2 Suppression."},"rdfs:label":"SMAD4 regulates neuronal morphogenesis "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3839,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c348360d-f5b3-4f5c-92ea-5e4e6e9ecbbe","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007688","gene":"hgnc:6770","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*SMAD4* has been implicated in autosomal dominant Myhre syndrome (MONDO:0007688), generalized juvenile polyposis/juvenile polyposis coli (MONDO:0008276), and juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (MONDO:0008278). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms and phenotypic variability among these disorders. Therefore, each of the disease entities listed above was curated separately. The current curation is for Myhre syndrome. \n\n*SMAD4* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Myhre syndrome in 2011 (Le Goff et al., PMID: 22158539). Individuals with Myhre syndrome present with short stature, typical facial appearance, hearing loss, laryngotracheal stenosis, skeletal abnormalities, cardiovascular abnormalities, developmental delay, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and autistic behavior in a minority of patients (PMIDs: 22158539, 27302097). Myhre syndrome is caused by one of four *SMAD4* missense variants [c.1498A>G (p.Ile500Val); c.1499T>C (p.Ile500Thr); c.1500A>G (p.Ile500Met), and c.1486C>T (p.Arg496Cys)] (PMIDs: 22158539, 27302097, 28406602). Over 55 Myhre syndrome patients with a de novo SMAD4 pathogenic variant have been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 22158539, 26636501, 27302097, 31654632); only 9 probands were scored in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. Only one inherited variant has been reported in a patient with Myhre syndrome (PMID: 31595668). *SMAD4* encodes a transcription factor that regulates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling. The mechanism of pathogenicity is gain-of-function (PMID: 22158539). Experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes functional assays in patient fibroblasts and cell culture models, expression studies, and model organisms (PMIDs: 16023633, 22158539, 29695415). \n\nIn summary, *SMAD4* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Myhre syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/01/2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a5a082cc-c214-4bfa-8cb8-caead239d129"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
