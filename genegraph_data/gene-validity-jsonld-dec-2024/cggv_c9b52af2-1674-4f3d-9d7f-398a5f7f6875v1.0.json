Clinical manifestations include vision problems and a high susceptibility to skin cancer. In its non-syndromic form, OCA is associated with six genes and one chromosomal region. Because OCA subtypes are not always clinically distinguishable, molecular analysis has become an important tool for classifying types of OCA, which facilitates genetic counseling and can guide the development of new therapies. We studied eight Brazilian individuals aged 1.5-18 years old with clinical diagnosis of OCA. Assessment of ophthalmologic characteristics showed results consistent with albinism, including reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and loss of stereoscopic vision. We also observed the appearance of the strabismus and changes in static refraction over a 2-year period. Dermatologic evaluation showed that no participants had preneoplastic skin lesions, despite half of the participants reporting insufficient knowledge about skin care in albinism. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing revealed eight different mutations: six in the TYR gene and two in the SLC45A2 gene, of which one was novel and two were described in a population study but were not previously associated with the OCA phenotype. We performed two ophthalmological evaluations, 2 years apart; and one dermatological evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform clinical follow-up and genetic analysis of a Brazilian cohort with albinism.

Raper elucidated the role of tyrosinase in melanin production. In this study, the author shows that dihydroxyphenylalanine is produced when tyrosine is oxidised by tyrosinase. Dihydroxyphenylalanine was isolated as one of the products of the reaction. In a later study (Raper, 1927, PMID 16743827) it was shown that dihydroxyphenylalanine is the first intermediate product in the tyrosinase-tyrosine reaction. A review (Raper, Physiological Reviews, 8:245-282, 1928) provides great detail on the early experimental work to elucidate the mechanism by which tyrosinase converts tyrosine to melanin. Since that time, there have been extensive studies of the role of tyrosinase in the melanin synthesis pathway. Tyrosinase is known to be a monophenol monooxygenase with two copper ions in the active site. It catalyzes a two-step process involving the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), followed by conversion of dopa to dopaquinone, which is then converted via a series of steps to melanin (see Fig 4, Lai et al, 2018, PMID 29052256).\nMelanin is made, stored and transported in pigment granules called melanosomes. Melanosomes are synthesized in mammalian skin melanocytes, in choroidal melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the eye (see Wasmeier et al, 2008, PMID 19056669 for review). The role of tyrosinase in melanin synthesis is, therefore, consistent with the findings in individuals with albinism e.g. lack of pigment in skin and RPE due to lack of melanin.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16743714","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Raper HS","dc:date":"1926","dc:title":"The Tyrosinase-Tyrosine Reaction: Production of l-3.4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine from Tyrosine."},"rdfs:label":"Role of tyrosinase in melanin production"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The score is increased due to the wealth of information available on the role of tyrosinase in melanin production, including almost a century of work on mammalian tyrosinase, and the finding that tyrosinases are responsible for production of melanins across the plant and animal kingdoms.

Substitution of H367 by alanine resulted in only a 50% decrease in copper binding. All three of these substitutions abolished tyrosinase catalytic activity.

We show that in human tyrosinase, copper binding by the CuB site is most likely coordinated by residues His363, His367, and His389, and that copper binding may be cooperative, with copper binding at one site facilitating copper binding by the other site. Furthermore, correct folding of the tyrosinase polypeptide appears to be necessary for copper binding, and a number of human OCA1 mutations disrupt copper binding and thus catalytic function of tyrosinase.","dc:creator":"Spritz RA","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutational analysis of copper binding by human tyrosinase."},"rdfs:label":"Copper-binding of tyrosine variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f8b33d5a-b860-479c-b488-2ff105b5a383","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6bb206ea-a331-4c65-99ed-e46dc574d9f4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In this study, tyrosinase variants previously identified in individuals with oculocutaneous albinism were expressed in COS7 cells.

Calnexin-staining patterns in those same cells, had a similar reticular pattern of staining, which co-localized with tyrosinase in the ER.

When expressed in COS7 cells, all mutant tyrosinases were sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, and immunostaining showed their localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their failure to be sorted further to their target organelles. Pulse-chase experiments showed that all mutant tyrosinases were retained by calnexin in the ER and that they were degraded at similarly rapid rates, which coincided with their dissociation from calnexin. Temperature-sensitive mutant enzymes were sorted more efficiently at 31 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, and their degradation was accelerated at 37 degrees C compared with 31 degrees C. Thus in contrast to the current concept that mutant tyrosinases are transported to melanosomes but are functionally inactive there, our results suggest that mutant tyrosinases may not be transported to melanosomes in the first place. We conclude that a significant component of mutant tyrosinase malfunction in OCA1 results from their retention and degradation in the ER compartment.

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin synthesis associated with a reduction of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. Reduction of melanin in the eyes is associated with foveal hypoplasia and decreased visual acuity, misrouting of the optic nerve fibres from the retina to the visual cortex, nystagmus, strabismus and iris translucency (Oetting et al, 2003, PMID 12753405; Lewis, 2013, PMID 20301345). Notably, several genes have been implicated in OCA, and syndromic and non-syndromic forms of albinism have been described (Federico and Krishnamurthy, 2020, PMID 30085560). \nTYR, which has been implicated in OCA1, encodes tyrosinase, a copper-containing monooxygenase with a key role melanin synthesis. Melanin is made, stored and transported in pigment granules (melanosomes) in mammalian skin melanocytes, choroidal melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the eye (Wasmeier et al, 2008, PMID 19056669). Two types of OCA1 are described in the literature. OCA1A (historically known as “tyrosinase-negative OCA”), is the most severe form of the disorder. Tyrosinase activity is completely absent, and melanin pigment cannot be detected in the skin, hair or eyes of individuals with OCA1. There is low tyrosinase activity in individuals with OCA1B but some residual activity is present allowing some melanin to be produced, albeit at a reduced amount. \nBiallelic variants in TYR were first reported in 1989 (Tomita et al, PMID 2511845). Since then, more than 300 variants have been reported in TYR (PMID 30868138). Data from 9 probands who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for TYR variants were curated, including 12 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site) (Tomita et al, 1989, PMID 2511845; Monfermé et al, 2019, PMID 30472657; Shakil et al, 2019, PMID 30996339; Lin et al, 2019, PMID 31199599; Schidlowski et al, 2020, PMID 32411182).\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical role of TYR in the synthesis of melanin, which is consistent with the lack of pigmentation observed in individuals with OCA1 (Raper, 1926, PMID 16743714; Lai etal, 2018, PMID  29052256), functional alteration studies (Spritz et al, 1997, PMID  9242509; Totofuku et al, 2001, PMID  11284711), numerous natural and laboratory animal models including a spontaneous variant in mice (Le Fur et al, 1996, PMID  8921397), CRISPR-generated albino mice (Mizuno et al, 2014, OMID  24879364), and rescue of the phenotype by expression of tyrosinase in transgenic albino mice and medaka fish (Jeffery et al, 1994, PMID 7813769; Fu et al, 2000, PMID 10675031). \nIn summary, TYR is definitively associated with OCA1.
