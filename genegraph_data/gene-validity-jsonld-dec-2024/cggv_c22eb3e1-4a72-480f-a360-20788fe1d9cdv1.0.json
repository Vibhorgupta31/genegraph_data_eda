Here we report the discovery of multiple pathogenic missense mutations in TUBG1, DYNC1H1 and KIF2A, as well as a single germline mosaic mutation in KIF5C, in subjects with MCD. We found a frequent recurrence of mutations in DYNC1H1, implying that this gene is a major locus for unexplained MCD. We further show that the mutations in KIF5C, KIF2A and DYNC1H1 affect ATP hydrolysis, productive protein folding and microtubule binding, respectively. In addition, we show that suppression of mouse Tubg1 expression in vivo interferes with proper neuronal migration, whereas expression of altered Î³-tubulin proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupts normal microtubule behavior. Our data reinforce the importance of centrosomal and microtubule-related proteins in cortical development and strongly suggest that microtubule-dependent mitotic and postmitotic processes are major contributors to the pathogenesis of MCD.","dc:creator":"Poirier K","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in TUBG1, DYNC1H1, KIF5C and KIF2A cause malformations of cortical development and microcephaly."},"rdfs:label":"Microtubule-dependent ATP hydrolysis kinetics assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":4211,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":3.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:923df3ae-93e8-44eb-b52b-e88b6d71c6c7","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014116","gene":"hgnc:6325","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"KIF5C was originally reported in cases of microcephaly and polymicrogyria in 2013 (PMID: 23603762). Reported variants of KIF5C are mostly on the Glu237 residue, which localizes to the microtubule binding domain. These include the p.Glu237Val variant initially reported in four siblings (presumed maternal germline mosaicism) and five independent cases with the de novo p.Glu237Lys variant (PMID: 24812067, 26384676, 29048727, 32562872). These individuals all have malformations of cortical development variably characterized as polymicrogyria and pachygyria, which are frontally predominant in distribution. Microcephaly may or may not be present. The p.Glu237Val change was shown to disrupt microtubule-dependent ATP hydrolysis of the KIF5C protein in vitro (PMID: 23603762).  \nTotal score was in the Limited range; however, in light of the mutation hotspot (Glu237), with the recurrent de novo p.Glu237 variant, it was interpreted that there is moderate level of evidence to suggest that KIF5C is associated with complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations 2. This has been approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 01/25/2022 (SOP Version 8).\nThough the relatively small number of cases limits the score for genetic evidence, the reported variants are mostly on the same residue, Glu237, with the recurrent de novo p.Glu237Lys variant reported in at least five independent individuals with similar phenotypes. Therefore, an upgrade to Moderate has been made.
