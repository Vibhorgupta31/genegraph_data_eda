These dominantly acting mutations prevent normal folding of proinsulin, which leads to beta-cell death through endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. We now report 10 different recessive INS mutations in 15 probands with neonatal diabetes. Functional studies showed that recessive mutations resulted in diabetes because of decreased insulin biosynthesis through distinct mechanisms, including gene deletion, lack of the translation initiation signal, and altered mRNA stability because of the disruption of a polyadenylation signal. A subset of recessive mutations caused abnormal INS transcription, including the deletion of the C1 and E1 cis regulatory elements, or three different single base-pair substitutions in a CC dinucleotide sequence located between E1 and A1 elements. In keeping with an earlier and more severe beta-cell defect, patients with recessive INS mutations had a lower birth weight (-3.2 SD score vs. -2.0 SD score) and were diagnosed earlier (median 1 week vs. 10 weeks) compared to those with dominant INS mutations. Mutations in the insulin gene can therefore result in neonatal diabetes as a result of two contrasting pathogenic mechanisms. Moreover, the recessively inherited mutations provide a genetic demonstration of the essential role of multiple sequence elements that regulate the biosynthesis of insulin in man.","dc:creator":"Garin I","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Recessive mutations in the INS gene result in neonatal diabetes through reduced insulin biosynthesis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20133622","rdfs:label":"ISPAD185"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variant Absent from gnomAD\n\nVariantEvidence: \nPMID:17479246 -

All the grandparents have a diagnosis of diabetes, one of them requiring insulin treatment and the parents currently deny personal histories of diabetes. Although this mutation has not previously been described, given the segregation of the mutation, absence of heterozygosity (AOH) in the genomic region encompassing the INS locus, documented insulinopenia, and high neonatal insulin requirements, we suspect that this variant is pathogenic.

The phenotype is usually permanent neonatal diabetes with intrauterine growth retardation requiring insulin treatment, but some individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for INS regulatory variants were reported to have transient neonatal diabetes (diagnosed in early infancy but diabetes was in clinical remission at the time of publication after limited follow-up period) or diabetes diagnosed outside the neonatal period rather than permanent neonatal diabetes (Garin et al., PMID:20133622).  At least 11 unique variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 16 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 6 publications (PMIDS: 31441606, 26101329, 27487489, 25755231, 23245869, 20133622). The mechanism for disease is expected to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, animal models, and cell culture models. In summary, INS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive permanent neonatal diabetes. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \n\n \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting working group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability underlying the disease entities associated with INS. Therefore, we have split curations for these disease entities. The present curation refers to the entity of autosomal recessive permanent neonatal diabetes (MIM: 606176) with some rare transient neonatal of older onset cases.  Other entities being curated separately include (1) autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes, which comprises OMIM entries autosomal dominant neonatal diabetes (MIM:  606176) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young 10 (MODY10; MIM:613370) and (2) hyperproinsulinemia (MIM: 616214). Type 1 diabetes (polygenic; MIM: 125852) will not be curated at this time since the contribution of INS is in the form of common variants with a small effect.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9c21ba4d-785f-486f-84f8-511b9c89c137"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
