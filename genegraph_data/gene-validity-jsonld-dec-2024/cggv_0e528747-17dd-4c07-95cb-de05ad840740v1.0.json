In human cells, the SKI complex functions mainly in co-translational surveillance-decay pathways, and its malfunction is linked to a severe congenital disorder, the trichohepatoenteric syndrome. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the human SKI (hSKI) complex, we structurally characterized several of its functional states in the context of 80S ribosomes and substrate RNA. In a prehydrolytic ATP form, the hSKI complex exhibits a closed conformation with an inherent gating system that effectively traps the 80S-bound RNA into the hSKI2 helicase subunit. When active, hSKI switches to an open conformation in which the gating is released and the RNA 3' end exits the helicase. The emerging picture is that the gatekeeping mechanism and architectural remodeling of hSKI underpin a regulated RNA channeling system that is mechanistically conserved among the cytoplasmic and nuclear helicase-exosome complexes.","dc:creator":"Kögel A","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"The human SKI complex regulates channeling of ribosome-bound RNA to the exosome via an intrinsic gatekeeping mechanism."},"rdfs:label":"Cryo-EM of human SKI complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3f6be491-8e47-4e95-8ab5-4bc009e28fdc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4061a07e-dae4-4354-a623-39344216c36b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"SKIC2 encodes for human SKI2W helicase, that forms SKI complex (SKIc) with Ski3/TTC37 that serves as a platform and two copies of Ski8/WDR61.

A key factor shaping eukaryotic transcriptomes, mainly via 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic trimming or degradation of diverse transcripts in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, is the RNA exosome. Precise exosome targeting to various RNA molecules requires strict collaboration with specialized auxiliary factors, which facilitate interactions with its substrates. The predominant class of cytoplasmic RNA targeted by the exosome are protein-coding transcripts, which are carefully scrutinized for errors during translation. Normal, functional mRNAs are turned over following protein synthesis by the exosome or by Xrn1 5'-3'-exonuclease, acting in concert with Dcp1/2 decapping complex. In turn, aberrant transcripts are eliminated by dedicated surveillance pathways, triggered whenever ribosome translocation is impaired. Cytoplasmic 3'-5' mRNA decay and surveillance are dependent on the tight cooperation between the exosome and its evolutionary conserved co-factor-the SKI (superkiller) complex (SKIc). Here, we summarize recent findings from structural, biochemical, and functional studies of SKIc roles in controlling cytoplasmic RNA metabolism, including links to various cellular processes. Mechanism of SKIc action is illuminated by presentation of its spatial structure and details of its interactions with exosome and ribosome. Furthermore, contribution of SKIc and exosome to various mRNA decay pathways, usually converging on recycling of ribosomal subunits, is delineated. A crucial physiological role of SKIc is emphasized by describing association between its dysfunction and devastating human disease-a trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES). Eventually, we discuss SKIc functions in the regulation of antiviral defense systems, cell signaling and developmental transitions, emerging from interdisciplinary investigations.

*SKIC3* gene is located on chromosome 5 at 5q15 and encodes for Superkiller complex protein 3 (SKIC3) protein. SKIC3 protein, which is the main and largest scaffolding subunit, forms a SKI complex with SKIC2 helicase protein and two SKIC8 protein subunits. SKI complex assists the RNA-degrading exosome during the mRNA decay and quality-control pathways.\n\n*SKIC3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES) 1 in 2010 (Hartley et al., PMID: 20176027). THES is characterized by intractable diarrhea (usually during neonatal period, seen in almost all affected children), wooly hair (seen in most children), intrauterine growth restriction, facial dysmorphism, short stature, immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, skin abnormalities, and liver disease. Mild intellectual disability (ID) is seen in about 50% of affected individuals. Less common findings include congenital heart defects and platelet anomalies (Fabre et al 2018, PMID: 29334452). Nine different variants (nonsense, frameshift, missense) in *SKIC3* (previously known as TTC37) that were found in 12 children from 11 unrelated families are included in this curation (Hartley et al., 2010 PMID: 20176027; Chong et al., 2015 PMID: 25976726; Bourgeois et al., 2018 PMID: 29527791). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function, gene expression, protein interaction studies (Tomecki et al., 2023 PMID:37384835; Fabre et al., 2010 PMID: 21120949; Kögel et al., 2022 PMID: 35120588). In summary, the *SKIC3* gene is definitively associated with autosomal recessive trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES) 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic GCEP on the meeting date April 23rd, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0e528747-17dd-4c07-95cb-de05ad840740"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
