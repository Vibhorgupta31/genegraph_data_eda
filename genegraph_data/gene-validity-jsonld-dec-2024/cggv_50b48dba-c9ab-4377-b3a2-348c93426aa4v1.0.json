The EDS-like findings comprise hyperelastic, thin, and bruisable skin, hypermobility of the small joints with a tendency to contractures, protuberant eyes with bluish sclerae, hands with finely wrinkled palms, atrophy of the thenar muscles, and tapering fingers. The skeletal dysplasia comprises platyspondyly with moderate short stature, osteopenia, and widened metaphyses. Patients have an increased ratio of total urinary pyridinolines, lysyl pyridinoline/hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (LP/HP), of approximately 1 as opposed to approximately 6 in EDS VI or approximately 0.2 in controls. Lysyl and prolyl residues of collagens were underhydroxylated despite normal lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activities; underhydroxylation was a generalized process as shown by mass spectrometry of the alpha1(I)- and alpha2(I)-chain-derived peptides of collagen type I and involved at least collagen types I and II. A genome-wide SNP scan and sequence analyses identified in all patients a homozygous c.483_491 del9 SLC39A13 mutation that encodes for a membrane-bound zinc transporter SLC39A13. We hypothesize that an increased Zn(2+) content inside the endoplasmic reticulum competes with Fe(2+), a cofactor that is necessary for hydroxylation of lysyl and prolyl residues, and thus explains the biochemical findings. These data suggest an entity that we have designated \"spondylocheiro dysplastic form of EDS (SCD-EDS)\" to indicate a generalized skeletal dysplasia involving mainly the spine (spondylo) and striking clinical abnormalities of the hands (cheiro) in addition to the EDS-like features.","dc:creator":"Giunta C","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Spondylocheiro dysplastic form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome--an autosomal-recessive entity caused by mutations in the zinc transporter gene SLC39A13."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50b48dba-c9ab-4377-b3a2-348c93426aa4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf7b0ff8-44b9-44dd-9027-06c8b6244ac7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf7b0ff8-44b9-44dd-9027-06c8b6244ac7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f8fad4d2-be67-4a72-ac90-4f8947d168fc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001128225.3(SLC39A13):c.483_491del (p.Phe162_Ala164del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA599374690"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"protruding eyes, reddish eyes, reduced hydroxylysine metabolites\n\n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010049","obo:HP_0001073","obo:HP_0000592","obo:HP_0100864","obo:HP_0006094","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0006429","obo:HP_0001763","obo:HP_0000963","obo:HP_0003051","obo:HP_0003393","obo:HP_0009803","obo:HP_0000926","obo:HP_0030839","obo:HP_0003071","obo:HP_0002619","obo:HP_0020152","obo:HP_0030838","obo:HP_0003301","obo:HP_0000684","obo:HP_0008897","obo:HP_0000978","obo:HP_0001182","obo:HP_0000494","obo:HP_0001382","obo:HP_0000977","obo:HP_0007392","obo:HP_0003370","obo:HP_0003016","obo:HP_0006172","obo:HP_0005879","obo:HP_0002515","obo:HP_0000938","obo:HP_0001238"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Normal karyotype","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:84e4b98e-cf9e-4561-b8bd-39f115e1d980_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f8fad4d2-be67-4a72-ac90-4f8947d168fc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18513683"},"rdfs:label":"F1-P1"},{"id":"cggv:84e4b98e-cf9e-4561-b8bd-39f115e1d980","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84e4b98e-cf9e-4561-b8bd-39f115e1d980_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f9cb8249-d9fa-45fd-8ef8-8f51c19400bd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9cb8249-d9fa-45fd-8ef8-8f51c19400bd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f8fad4d2-be67-4a72-ac90-4f8947d168fc"},"detectionMethod":"No details.

A key strategy used by many organisms to buffer cytosolic zinc is to store it within vesicles and organelles.It is yet unknown whether vesicular or organellar sites perform this function in mammals. Human ZIP13, a member of the Zrt/Irt-like protein (ZIP) metal transporter family, might provide an answer to this question. Mutations in the ZIP13 gene, SLC39A13, previously were found to cause the spondylocheiro dysplastic form of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (SCD-EDS), a heritable connective tissue disorder.Those previous studies suggested that ZIP13 transports excess zinc out of the early secretory pathway and that zinc overload in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) occurs in SCD-EDS patients. In contrast,this study indicates that ZIP13’s role is to release labile zinc from vesicular stores for use in the ER and other compartments.

The gene was first linked to rare early-onset autosomal recessive spondylocheirodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (SCD-EDS) in 2008 by two separate groups (Giunta et al., PMID: 18513683 and Fukada et al., PMID: 18985159). In addition to common EDS symptoms such as thin, soft, velvety skin and hypermobile joints, affected individuals exhibit short stature, platyspondyly, tapering fingers, clubfoot, osteopenia, and abnormal radiological findings, including irregular vertebral endplates, flattened epiphyses, enlarged metaphysis, and short, broad femoral necks. Common craniofacial dysmorphic features are protruding eyes, blue sclera, and downslanting palpebral fissures. Other phenotypes are delayed eruption of permanent teeth or oligodontia, wrinkled palm skin, and thenar atrophy. Some patients were also reported muscle weakness, gait disturbances, and corneal abnormalities, with variability between and within families. Six unique homozygous variants, including three missense, one nonsense, one recurrent small deletion, and one splicing variant, have been identified in fourteen patients from eight families across five publications (PMIDs: 18513683, 18985159, 29593477, 32295219, 36727144). The case-level data from these eight probands provide 7.7 points for genetic evidence. The pathogenic mechanism is loss-of-function, supported by experimental evidence. Phenotypes observed in null knockout (KO) mouse model align with symptoms in affected individuals (PMID: 18985159). Studies on osteoblasts, odontoblasts, and dermal fibroblasts from wildtype and KO mice indicate that ZIP13 is crucial for zinc homeostasis and connective tissue development via the BMP/TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway (PMID: 18985159). The amount of endogenous ZIP13 protein in patient dermal fibroblasts was significantly reduced compared to cells derived from a heterozygous parent, and zinc failed to be transported into the cytosolic region (PMID: 23213233). In vitro overexpression of the p.Gly74Asp or p.Phe162_Ala164del variants in 239T or Hela cells results in unstable ZIP13 proteins undergoing VCP-dependent degradation (PMID: 25007800). Additionally, ZIP13 transcript is upregulated by myogenic stimulation in C2C12 mouse myoblasts and human dermal fibroblasts, along with the upregulation of myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and Myogenin. Knockdown of ZIP13 expression impairs myogenic differentiation, as evidenced by undifferentiated cell morphology and decreased MYH expression. In patient-derived stem cells with the p.Gly74Asp variant, MyoD, Myogenin, and MYH mRNA and protein levels are reduced compared to healthy controls. Correcting the p.Gly74Asp variant from homozygous to heterozygous state in patient stem cells using gene editing rescues Myogenin mRNA and protein expression after eight days, suggesting ZIP13's role in myogenic differentiation (PMID: 38609428). In summary, SLC39A13 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive SCD-EDS, as demonstrated in both clinical diagnostic and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP on October 25th, 2024.
