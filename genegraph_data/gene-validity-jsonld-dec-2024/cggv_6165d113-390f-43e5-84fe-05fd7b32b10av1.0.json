Identification of four genes mutated in NPHP subtypes 1-4 (refs. 4-9) has linked the pathogenesis of NPHP to ciliary functions. Ten percent of affected individuals have retinitis pigmentosa, constituting the renal-retinal Senior-Loken syndrome (SLSN). Here we identify, by positional cloning, mutations in an evolutionarily conserved gene, IQCB1 (also called NPHP5), as the most frequent cause of SLSN. IQCB1 encodes an IQ-domain protein, nephrocystin-5. All individuals with IQCB1 mutations have retinitis pigmentosa. Hence, we examined the interaction of nephrocystin-5 with RPGR (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator), which is expressed in photoreceptor cilia and associated with 10-20% of retinitis pigmentosa. We show that nephrocystin-5, RPGR and calmodulin can be coimmunoprecipitated from retinal extracts, and that these proteins localize to connecting cilia of photoreceptors and to primary cilia of renal epithelial cells.

The BBSome is involved in the trafficking of membrane cargos to cilia. While it is known that a loss of any single subunit prevents ciliary trafficking of the BBSome and its cargos, the mechanisms underlying ciliary entry of this complex are not well characterized. Here, we report that a transition zone protein NPHP5 contains two separate BBS-binding sites and interacts with the BBSome to mediate its integrity. Depletion of NPHP5, or expression of NPHP5 mutant missing one binding site, specifically leads to dissociation of BBS2 and BBS5 from the BBSome and loss of ciliary BBS2 and BBS5 without compromising the ability of the other subunits to traffic into cilia. Depletion of Cep290, another transition zone protein that directly binds to NPHP5, causes additional dissociation of BBS8 and loss of ciliary BBS8. Furthermore, delivery of BBSome cargos, smoothened, VPAC2 and Rab8a, to the ciliary compartment is completely disabled in the absence of single BBS subunits, but is selectively impaired in the absence of NPHP5 or Cep290. These findings define a new role of NPHP5 and Cep290 in controlling integrity and ciliary trafficking of the BBSome, which in turn impinge on the delivery of ciliary cargo.","dc:creator":"Barbelanne M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Nephrocystin proteins NPHP5 and Cep290 regulate BBSome integrity, ciliary trafficking and cargo delivery."},"rdfs:label":"BBSome in vivo binding experiments"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d12cd06f-509c-4645-9c5a-b299f3c52336","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f85bdda9-e09b-42bd-94b7-58dfb2775c95","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Nephrocystin-5 directly interacts with calmodulin and is complexed with RPGR.

Several protein complexes localize to the gating zone and may regulate ciliary protein composition; however, the mechanisms of ciliary gating and the dynamics of the gating components are largely unknown. Here, we used the BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) assay and report for the first time on the protein-protein interactions that occur between ciliary gating components and transiting cargoes during ciliary entry. We find that the nucleoporin Nup62 and the C termini of the nephronophthisis (NPHP) proteins NPHP4 and NPHP5 interact with the axoneme-associated kinesin-2 motor KIF17 and thus spatially map to the inner region of the ciliary gating zone. Nup62 and NPHP4 exhibit rapid turnover at the transition zone and thus define dynamic components of the gate. We find that B9D1, AHI1, and the N termini of NPHP4 and NPHP5 interact with the transmembrane protein SSTR3 and thus spatially map to the outer region of the ciliary gating zone. B9D1, AHI1, and NPHP5 exhibit little to no turnover at the transition zone and thus define components of a stable gating structure.

First, homozygous NPHP1 deletions were detected in 97 patients (21%) by multiplex PCR. Second, 25 patients with infantile NPHP were screened for mutations in inversin (NPHP2/INVS). We detected a novel compound heterozygous frameshift mutation (p.[Q485fs]+[R687fs]), and a homozygous nonsense mutation (p.R899X). Third, 37 patients presenting with NPHP and retinitis pigmentosa (Senior-Løken syndrome [SLS]) were screened for NPHP5/IQCB1 mutations by direct sequencing. We discovered five different (three novel) homozygous premature termination codon (PTC) mutations (p.F142fsX; p.R461X; p.R489X; p.W444X; and c.488-1G>A).

A total of 32, eight, and 14 patients showed homozygosity, and were screened by heteroduplex crude celery extract (CEL I) endonuclease digests. The sensitivity of CEL I was established as 92%, as it detected 73 out of 79 different known mutations simply on agarose gels. A total of 10 novel PTC mutations were found in NPHP1 (p.P186fs, p.R347X, p.V492fs, p.Y509X, and c.1884+1G>A), in NPHP3 (c.3812+2T>C and p.R1259X), and in NPHP4 (p.R59X, p.T1004fs, and p.V1091fs). The combined homozygosity mapping and CEL I endonuclease mutation analysis approach allowed us to identify rare mutations in a large cohort of patients at low cost.","dc:creator":"Otto

The *IQCB1* gene spans through 15 exons and consists of 65,299 bases. This protein consists of 598 amino acids, with a central coiled-coil region and two calmodulin-binding IQ domains, localized to the primary cilia of renal epithelial cells and connecting cilia of photoreceptor cells. Nephrocystin-5 plays a role in ciliary function, abnormal or loss of function of this protein are associated with retinal degeneration and renal-cyst formation. Multiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: AR Ciliopathy: MONDO:0005308. *IQCB1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive nephronophthisis and Senior-Loken Syndrome (SLS) in 2005 (Otto et al., PMID: 15723066). Patients with *IQCB1* gene mutation are presented with SLS or Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). SLS typically presents in the first two decades of life as a combination of nephronophthisis (NPHP) and ocular problems. Clinical NPHP consists of polyuria, polydipsia, secondary enuresis, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) that can progress to kidney failure requiring transplant or dialysis. Patients with SLS can present with severe retinopathy, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), or a milder phenotype. LCA is a group of early-onset childhood retinal dystrophies characterized by vision loss, nystagmus, and severe retinal dysfunction.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. At least 544 variants, (deletion, duplication, indel, insertion and single nucleotide variants) have been reported in over 150 probands in over 30 publications (PMIDs: 15723066, 18076122, 25984213, 38522724 included this curation), with the first publication in 2005 and the most recent publication was in 2024. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data and segregation data. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental studies. Takao et al. (PMID: 28736169) report a study on biochemical function of *NPHP5*, showing that nucleoporin Nup62 and the C termini of the nephronophthisis (NPHP) proteins *NPHP4* and *NPHP5* interact with the axoneme-associated kinesin-2 motor KIF17 and thus spatially map to the inner region of the ciliary gating zone. They also found that *B9D1*, *AHI1*, and the N termini of *NPHP4* and *NPHP5* interact with the transmembrane protein SSTR3 and thus spatially map to the outer region of the ciliary gating zone. NPHP5 also forms a complex with *CEP290* / *NPHP6* , and this complex is localized from the basal body to transition zone. *B9D1*, *AHI1*, and *NPHP5* exhibit little to no turnover at the transition zone and thus define components of a stable gating structure. Being a stable component of the ciliary gating zone, *NPHP5* may play a structural role, and *NPHP6* may regulate its turnover and/or function during ciliary gating.\n\nOtto el at.( PMID: 15723066) studied expression of the nephrocystin-5 protein, describing that nephrocystin-5 localizes to primary cilia in renal tubular epithelial cells and retinal cells. Studies of an animal model from the same study revealed that nephrocystin-5, (which contain an IQ domain) directly interacts with calmodulin and is complexed with *RPGR* (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator). \nAnother study from Barbelanne et al.(PMID: 25552655) described that nephrocystin proteins *NPHP5* and *Cep290* regulate BBSome integrity, ciliary trafficking and cargo delivery. This study revealed that nephrocystin-5 interacts with the BBSome via 2 distinct BBSome-binding sites, which are at the N-terminal region and the C-terminal region. Further mapping studies revealed that the first 157 residues (1–157) and the last 68 residues (530–598) of *NPHP5* are critical for binding. Barbelanne et al. (PMID: 25552655) also showed that functional alteration of *NPHP5* in non-patient cells was associated with reduced ciliary Smo and BBSome, leading to impaired trafficking to cilia. Rescue experiments in a cell culture model revealed that loss of ciliary BBS2/BBS5 and proximal ciliary staining of BBS2, were largely rescued by full-length *NPHP5* (1–598) expression.\n\nKruczek et al.(PMID: 36084637) presented a study using fibroblasts from a family of patients with LCA/SLS causing from *IQCB1* mutations and their unaffected family members as controls. They showed that the patient fibroblasts and RPE demonstrated aberrantly elongated ciliary axonemes. Organoids revealed impaired development of outer segment structures that were modified primary cilia, and mislocalization of visual pigments to photoreceptor cell soma. All patient-derived cells showed reduced levels of *CEP290* protein, a critical ciliary transition zone component interacting with NPHP5, providing a plausible mechanism for aberrant ciliary gating and cargo transport. This evidence was classified as a functional alteration in patient cells. Furthermore, they presented evidence from a cell culture model by generating retinal organoids from both control and patient iPSClines. In early-stage retinal organoids(day 70), cilia in patient-derived organoids were significantly longer when compared with equivalent control organoids. Late stage (day 200) patient-derived organoids had significantly increased inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) thickness, indicating longer photoreceptor cilia. \nThere is also evidence from a  non-human model organism (mouse) from Ronquillo et al (PMID: 27328943). The mouse ocular phenotypes was consistent with the human ocular phenotype. *Nphp5-/- *mice develop blindness early in life. Fundi show peripheral and central mottling of the retina. Abnormal quantity and localization of rod and cone proteins are noted in the retina. *Nphp5-/-* photoreceptor degeneration was complete at 1 mo of age but was delayed significantly in *Nphp5-/-;Nrl-/-* (cone only) retina. *Nphp5-/-* mouse embryonic fibroblast developed normal cilia, and *Nphp5-/- *kidney histology at 1 yr of age showed no significant pathology. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) was reached. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *IQCB1* and AR Ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has held up over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date August, 28th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6165d113-390f-43e5-84fe-05fd7b32b10a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
