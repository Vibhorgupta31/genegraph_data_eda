To determine how alterations in PDX-1 affect islet function, we examined insulin secretion and islet physiology in mice with one PDX-1 allele inactivated. PDX-1(+/-) mice had a normal fasting blood glucose and pancreatic insulin content but had impaired glucose tolerance and secreted less insulin during glucose tolerance testing. The expression of PDX-1 and glucose transporter 2 in islets from PDX-1(+/-) mice was reduced to 68 and 55%, respectively, whereas glucokinase expression was not significantly altered. NAD(P)H generation in response to glucose was reduced by 30% in PDX-1(+/-) mice. The in situ perfused pancreas of PDX-1(+/-) mice secreted about 45% less insulin when stimulated with 16.7 mm glucose. The K(m) for insulin release was similar in wild type and PDX-1(+/-) mice. Insulin secretion in response to 20 mm arginine was unchanged; the response to 10 nm glucagon-like peptide-1 was slightly increased. However, insulin secretory responses to 10 mm 2-ketoisocaproate and 20 mm KCl were significantly reduced (by 61 and 66%, respectively). These results indicate that a modest reduction in PDX-1 impairs several events in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (such as NAD(P)H generation, mitochondrial function, and/or mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+)) and that PDX-1 is important for normal function of adult pancreatic islets.","dc:creator":"Brissova M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Reduction in pancreatic transcription factor PDX-1 impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion."},"rdfs:label":"Brissova Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Normal fasting glucose and pancreatic insulin content; secrete less insulin during glucose tolerance test, NADPH generation in response to glucose reduced by 30% in PDX1+/- mice; in situ perfused pancreas of PDX1+/- mice secreted 45% less insulin compared to WT; insulin secretory responses to 10 mm 2-ketoisocaproate reduced by 61% compared to WT; insulin secretory responses to 20 mm KCl reduced to 66% compared to WT; PDX1 expression in islets from PDX1+/- mice reduced to 55% compared to WT"},{"id":"cggv:5ca90031-0369-40c4-bccf-4e638c29614f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa5a1a8e-89c4-443c-a0d3-c9fb7e60c539","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"mice develop diabetes with age - heterozygosity of PDX1 null mutation resulted in impaired glucose tolerance (Table 1, Fig. 4) , PDX1 shown to be required for maintaining beta-cell identity through positive regulation of insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide expression by repression of glucagon expression (Figs. 1,2); PDX1 shown to regulate expression of Glut2 in dosage-dependent manner with supports that PDX1 activity plays a role in development of diabetes by causing impaired expression of Glut2 and insulin","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9637677","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To study the late beta-cell-specific function of the homeodomain protein IPF1/PDX1 we have generated mice in which the Ipf1/Pdx1 gene has been disrupted specifically in beta cells.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 9 publications.  These include three probands heterozygous for the c.188del/p.Pro63fs variant (PMIDs: 9326926, 28436541, 31595705), which was shown to create two isoforms, one which is transcriptionally inactive and one which localizes to the nucleus and binds DNA but lacks a transactivation domain and thus behaves as a null or possibly dominant negative variant (PMID: 9649577).  Homozygosity for c.188del/p.Pro63fs causes pancreatic agenesis and neonatal diabetes in the homozygous state (PMIDs: 8988180, 19496967).  The other probands had missense variants (PMIDs: 10720084, 10545530, 31595705, 33746035, 26226118, 25041077, 31333579), of which five were too common in gnomAD to cause monogenic diabetes (PMIDs 10720084, 10545530, 26226118, 31333579).  \nSummary of case-level data: 5.2 points. Notably, heterozygous parents of individuals with pancreatic agenesis with neonatal diabetes due to homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a *PDX1* missense variant do not consistently have diabetes (PMIDs: 12970316, 200009086), and thus the role of missense *PDX1* variants in autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes is unclear.  The c.188del/p.Pro63fs variant segregated with diabetes in 10 meioses in 1 family (LOD = 3.43, 1 point).  Total score for genetic evidence:  6.2 points.  Evidence from 2 mouse models has supported the role of PDX1 disruption in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and impaired glucose tolerance (PMIDs: 11781323, 9637677). An in vitro functional assay supported the role of PDX1 disruption in impaired proinsulin processing and insulin secretion (PMID: 15756539). *PDX1* expression has been confirmed in the pancreas vis eQTL analysis (PMID: 23715323). Summary of experimental data:  5 points.  Total score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence:  11.2 points.  \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, monogenic diabetes (OMIM:606391) and pancreatic agenesis with neonatal diabetes (OMIM:260370). The split curation for pancreatic agenesis with neonatal diabetes mellitus has been curated separately.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *PDX1* and autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes, in particular the c.188del/p.Pro63fs variant which creates two functionally inactive isoforms.  Missense variants should be interpreted with caution. \n\nTotal score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence: 11.2 points. Classification downgraded to moderate per MDGCEP.
