Transgenic mice were generated that express the LMNA mutation that causes familial partial lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type (FPLD2). The phenotype observed in FPLD-transgenic mice resembles many of the features of human FPLD2, including lack of fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and enlarged, fatty liver. Similar to the human disease, FPLD-transgenic mice appear to develop normally, but after several weeks they are unable to accumulate fat to the same extent as their wild-type littermates. One poorly understood aspect of lipodystrophies is the mechanism of fat loss. To this end, we have examined the effects of the FPLD2 mutation on fat cell function. Contrary to the current literature, which suggests FPLD2 results in a loss of fat, we found that the key mechanism contributing to the lack of fat accumulation involves not a loss, but an apparent inability of the adipose tissue to renew itself. Specifically, preadipocytes are unable to differentiate into mature and fully functional adipocytes. These findings provide insights not only for the treatment of lipodystrophies, but also for the study of adipogenesis, obesity, and insulin resistance.","dc:creator":"Wojtanik KM","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"The role of LMNA in adipose: a novel mouse model of lipodystrophy based on the Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy mutation."},"rdfs:label":"Transgenic mouse model  "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9191,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:183f7855-a6f6-41f7-b6ef-98d1e369ba5d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0006573","gene":"hgnc:6636","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Human pathogenic *LMNA* variants were first reported in association with autosomal dominant lipodystrophy in 1974 (Dunnigan et al, PMID 4362786). We have curated the inheritance pattern for *LMNA* related lipodystrophy as semidominant because, while most cases are autosomal dominant, a recessive mode of inheritance has been reported very rarely (Soyaltin et al, PMID:32685188, Savage et al, PMID:15298354, Le Dour et al, PMID:21346069).\n\nBoth partial and complete loss of *LMNA* function due to heterozygous and homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the *LMNA* have been reported. Typical autosomal dominant cases due to heterozygous variants present in exon 8 and 11 of *LMNA* with partial loss of subcutaneous limb and gluteal fat, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia (Morel et al, PMID:16636128, Akinci et al, PMID:28641778). The occasional recessive cases due to homozygous or compound heterozygous variants are usually present with severe lipodystrophic syndrome with diabetes and /or acanthosis nigricans, liver steatosis, hypertriglyceridemia, lower serum leptin and adiponectin levels, and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction disturbances (Le Dour et al, PMID:21346069, André et al PMID: 25819867, Treiber et al PMID: 34292171).\n\nAt least 200 lipodystrophy - causing *LMNA* variants (primarily missense than frameshift or nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting the association of this gene with lipodystrophy includes case level data, segregation data, and experimental data. The aggregated score for case-level and segregation data is 12 points. Of the over 200 reported, variants in this gene have been curated for this summary in 13 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 32686188,19201734, 18041775, 15298354, 16636128, 30177912, 28641778, 32524016, 21346069, 29108996) with 8 cases presenting as familial partial lipodystrophy and 5 cases with congenital generalized lipodystrophy. More evidence is available to support the gene-disease association in the literature, but as the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached; this has not been curated exhaustively. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays, expression studies and functional alterations (Corsa CAS, et al, PMID:34088712, Friesen M et al, PMID:29108996, Fagerberg L et al, PMID:243099898, Wojtanik et al, PMID:19201734). Total points for the experimental evidence are 5.5. Total points for genetic and experimental evidence together are 17.5.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we observed both differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability, but also overlap in the implicated variants. Specifically, *LMNA* has two associated lipodystrophy diseases entities, namely the more commonly associated autosomal dominant familial partial lipodystrophy (OMIM:151660), and the more rarely associated autosomal recessive congenital, generalized lipodystrophy.  Because the latter is rare and there is overlap in the implicated variants, these two entities have been lumped in a single curation of lipodystrophy (MONDO: 0006573).  In addition, *LMNA* has several other associated diseases, including but not limited to:  dilated cardiomyopathy (MONDO: 0005021), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC; MONDO: 0016587), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (MIM: 5005588), Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (MIM: 181350 and 616516), and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (MIM: 176670).  While there is some genetic and phenotypic overlap, there is enough distinction among these phenotypes and their implicated variants that these entities have (dilated cardiomyopathy and ARVC) or will be curated separately.\n\nIn summary, *LMNA* is definitively associated with semidominant lipodystrophy, with most cases presenting as autosomal dominant familial partial lipodystrophy in adolescents and young adults. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9a2725cf-2492-4f4d-8646-7a757cdac3dc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
