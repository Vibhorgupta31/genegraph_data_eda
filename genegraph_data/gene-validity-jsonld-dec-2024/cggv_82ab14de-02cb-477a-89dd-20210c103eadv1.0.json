CIII comprises 11 subunits encoded by one mitochondrial and 10 nuclear genes. Abnormalities of the nuclear genes such as BCS1L and TTC19 encoding mitochondrial assembly factors are well known, but an explanation of the majority of CIII deficiency remains elusive. Here, we report three patients from a consanguineous Mexican family presenting with neonatal onset of hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, ketosis, and hyperammonemia. We found a homozygous missense mutation in UQCRC2 that encodes mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein II by whole-exome sequencing combined with linkage analysis. On the basis of structural modeling, the mutation (p.Arg183Trp) was predicted to destabilize the hydrophobic core at the subunit interface of the core protein II homodimer. In vitro studies using fibroblasts from the index patient clearly indicated CIII deficiency, as well as impaired assembly of the supercomplex formed from complexes I, III, and IV.

The *UQCRC2* gene encodes a subunit of complex III (UQCRC2) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.\nThe *UQCRC2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 23281071). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *UQCRC2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *UQCRC2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two unique homozygous missense variants identified in three cases from three publications (PMIDs: 23281071, 28275242, 33865955). These individuals had neonatal hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatopathy; and one individual had bilateral brainstem lesions consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum. The Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel reviewed scoring guidance for homozygous variants in cases with consanguinity and decided that no scoring alteration was needed in these three cases given (1) comprehensive analyses (exome sequencing) were performed, (2) homozygous variants are a common cause of mitochondrial disease, and (3) biochemical evidence in these cases supported a complex III defect. Segregation data are available but did not meet criteria to be considered for scoring per ClinGen Gene Curation SOP V8. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 28844695, 23281071, 28275242, 33865955).\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 20, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:82ab14de-02cb-477a-89dd-20210c103ead"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
