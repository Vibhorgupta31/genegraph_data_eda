The typical clinical presentation includes intellectual disability and seizure onset in the first year of life, sometimes associated with movement disorders, autism, hypotonia, and abnormal brain MRI (PMID: 29630738). Some individuals were reported to have a Rett-like phenotype including stereotypic movements, breathing abnormalities, and sleep disruption (PMID: 29630738).\n\nA recurrent de novo missense variant (c.1768G>A, p.Glu590Lys) accounts for the majority of published variants in this gene and has been identified in at least 11 probands in four publications (PMIDs: 29630738, 23020937, 29795476, 30842224). Other missense variants (p.Thr642Met and p.Arg1458Gln) were given zero points due to a lack of detailed clinical information and presence of the variants in gnomAD (PMIDs: 31785789, 35571021). Finally, a de-novo p.Thr945Met missense variant was identified in a patient with a history of three febrile seizures, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. It was not scored at this time due to the probandâ€™s milder phenotypic presentation and uncertainty about the association of variants other than p.Glu590Lys with DEE (PMID: 35846140).The mechanism of pathogenicity is currently unknown and there is no experimental evidence available at this time.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date May 16, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5cf65346-db93-42cd-8911-0386bd314a79"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
