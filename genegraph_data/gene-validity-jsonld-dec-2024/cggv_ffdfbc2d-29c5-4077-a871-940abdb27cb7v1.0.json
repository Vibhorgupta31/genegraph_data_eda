Our molecular investigation of an autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia with optic atrophy, present among the Old Order Amish, identified a mutation of MTPAP associated with the disease phenotype. When subjected to poly(A) tail-length assays, mitochondrial mRNAs from affected individuals were shown to have severely truncated poly(A) tails. Although defective mitochondrial DNA maintenance underlies a well-described group of clinical disorders, our findings reveal a defect of mitochondrial mRNA maturation associated with human disease and imply that this disease mechanism should be considered in other complex neurodegenerative disorders.","dc:creator":"Crosby AH","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Defective mitochondrial mRNA maturation is associated with spastic ataxia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffdfbc2d-29c5-4077-a871-940abdb27cb7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffdfbc2d-29c5-4077-a871-940abdb27cb7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f1bcc31-8d95-41ea-ae68-75a9b261aec1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d8078ee-ae49-42ce-8920-1c0f01df88d7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"MTPAP contributes to the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression through the polyadenylation of mitochondrially-encoded mRNAs.

Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"mitochondrial transcript processing & modification"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"scored according to rubric; >10 genes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ffdfbc2d-29c5-4077-a871-940abdb27cb7_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d509d2bc-d5c2-42d3-bfb2-37e485897b68","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:09ddb777-e7c8-4075-8f01-cddfaaab75d4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Used siRNA to knockdown hmtPAP in HeLa cells.

Partial inactivation of hmtPAP by RNA interference using small interfering RNA in HeLa cells resulted in shortened poly(A) tails and decreased steady state levels of some mt mRNAs as well as their translational products. Moreover, knocking down hmtPAP generated markedly defective mt membrane potentials and reduced oxygen consumption. In contrast, knocking down hPNPase showed significantly extended poly(A) tails of mt mRNAs.

In the homozygous p.N478D lines, a substantial decrease was apparent in the mitochondrially encoded proteins of the respiratory chain, ND1, a component of complex I and COX1â3, members of complex IV. NDUFB8, although nuclear encoded, was also present at decreased steady-state levels. No decreased in complex II. Analysis of the fully assembled OXPHOS complexes by blue native gels (Fig. 1C) reflected the severe decrease seen in components of complexes I and IV. Decreases in transcript polyadenylation and in respiratory chain complexes were effectively rescued by overexpression of wild-type mtPAP. Both mutated and wild-type mtPAP localized to the mitochondrial RNA-processing granules. In vitro polyadenylation assays revealed severely compromised activity by the mutated protein, which generated only short oligo(A) extensions on RNA substrates.

The *MTPAP* gene encodes mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase, which functions in mitochondrial transcript processing and modification. \n\nThe *MTPAP* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2010 (PMID: 20970105), when a a founder variant, c.1432A>G (p.Asn478Asp), was identified in the Old Order Amish population. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MTPAP*-related disease, including autosomal recessive spastic ataxia 4 (SPAX4) (MIM 613672) in  additional to other mitochondrial disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MTPAP* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven unique variants (six missense variants and one stop-gained variant) identified in five individuals from four publications (PMIDs: 20970105, 31779033, 35235001, 27391121). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mitochondrial translation) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, early embryonic lethality and failure of developmental progression in a knockout mouse model, and disrupted expression of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction following gene knockdown in HeLa cells (PMIDs: 33340416, 32376682, 15769737).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MTPAP* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 1, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
