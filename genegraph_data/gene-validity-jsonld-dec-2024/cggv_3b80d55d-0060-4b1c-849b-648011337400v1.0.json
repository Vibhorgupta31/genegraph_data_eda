It occasionally occurs in syndromic metabolic diseases and plurisystemic ciliopathies. Using exome sequencing in a multiplex family and three simplex case subjects with an atypical association of LCA with early-onset hearing loss, we identified two heterozygous mutations affecting Arg391 in β-tubulin 4B isotype-encoding (TUBB4B). Inspection of the atomic structure of the microtubule (MT) protofilament reveals that the β-tubulin Arg391 residue contributes to a binding pocket that interacts with α-tubulin contained in the longitudinally adjacent αβ-heterodimer, consistent with a role in maintaining MT stability. Functional analysis in cultured cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant TUBB4B as well as in primary skin-derived fibroblasts showed that the mutant TUBB4B is able to fold, form αβ-heterodimers, and co-assemble into the endogenous MT lattice. However, the dynamics of growing MTs were consistently altered, showing that the mutations have a significant dampening impact on normal MT growth. Our findings provide a link between sensorineural disease and anomalies in MT behavior and describe a syndromic LCA unrelated to ciliary dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Luscan R","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations in TUBB4B Cause a Distinctive Sensorineural Disease."},"rdfs:label":"Luscan Non-Patient Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3b80d55d-0060-4b1c-849b-648011337400_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3b80d55d-0060-4b1c-849b-648011337400_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da24ac2f-9515-4129-901f-ca96d24d849a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:79005895-6267-428c-811d-d06065e75549","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"WES and deep sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0008527"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:da24ac2f-9515-4129-901f-ca96d24d849a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:997471a8-950b-4115-8092-021901b3c9bf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006088.5(TUBB4B):c.1171C>T (p.Arg391Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/492939"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29198720"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29198720","rdfs:label":"Family 4 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:c58a5f48-2d31-44a8-9898-c88e67946337_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c618d77d-94a1-4615-9fd8-40b9e02d399b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":34,"detectionMethod":"WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003577","obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0011474"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:c58a5f48-2d31-44a8-9898-c88e67946337_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:283f57c9-b730-42a6-95af-8b06c182f7fc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006088.5(TUBB4B):c.1172G>A (p.Arg391His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/492938"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29198720"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29198720","rdfs:label":"Family 1 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Variant is de novo mosaic in the maternal grandmother.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 2 missense variants have been reported de novo in humans, p.Arg391His and p.Arg391Cys. TUBB4B was first associated with this disease in humans in 2017 (Luscan et al.). Association is seen in at least 4 probands in 1 publication (29198720). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by an in vitro functional assay. According to Luscan et al. 2017, the Arg391, Arg390 and Lys392 residues form a binding pocket that interacts with alpha-tubulin in the longitudinally adjacent tubulin alpha-beta-heterodimer. It is possible that a substitution at Arg391 destabilizes the hydrophobic interactions between the residues. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/26/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3b80d55d-0060-4b1c-849b-648011337400"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
