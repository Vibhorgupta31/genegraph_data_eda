The genetic complexity and variable clinical presentation of TACI deficiency prompted us to evaluate the genetic, immunologic, and clinical condition in 50 individuals with TNFRSF13B alterations, following screening of 564 unrelated patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. We identified 13 new sequence variants. The most frequent TNFRSF13B variants (C104R and A181E; n=39; 6.9%) were also present in a heterozygous state in 2% of 675 controls. All patients with biallelic mutations had hypogammaglobulinemia and nearly all showed impaired binding to a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). However, the majority (n=41; 82%) of the pa-tients carried monoallelic changes in TNFRSF13B. Presence of a heterozygous mutation was associated with antibody deficiency (P< .001, relative risk 3.6). Heterozygosity for the most common mutation, C104R, was associated with disease (P< .001, relative risk 4.2). Furthermore, heterozygosity for C104R was associated with low numbers of IgD(-)CD27(+) B cells (P= .019), benign lymphoproliferation (P< .001), and autoimmune complications (P= .001).

We found that 11% of CVID and 13% of IgAD carried at least one mutated TNFRSF13B allele. Seven per cent of CVID had monoallelic-mutations and 4% had biallelic-mutations. The frequency of C104R monoallelic-mutations was not higher than that found in healthy controls. Biallelic-mutations were exclusively found in CVID. CVID patients carrying monoallelic-mutations had an increased prevalence of lymphadenopathy, granulomata, and autoimmune cytopenias. CVID carrying biallelic-mutations had a low prevalence of autoimmunity in comparison with TACI wild-type CVID. Moreover, biallelic-mutated CVID had higher frequency of switched memory B-cells and higher IgM and IgA antibodies to polysaccharide antigens than TACI wild-type and monoallelic-mutated CVID. TACI-mutated IgAD patients had only monoallelic-mutations and did not display clinical difference from IgAD wild-type patients. In conclusion, TNFRSF13B genetic screening of antibody deficiencies may allow the identification of mutational patterns.

TNFRSF13B encodes TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor), a transmembrane protein of the TNF receptor superfamily found predominantly on the surface of B cells. TACI is a receptor on B cells for APRIL, BAFF, syndecan-2, besides interacting with CAML. TACI mediates activation of transcription factors NF-AT, NF-kappa-B, and AP-1, and is involved in the stimulation of B- and T-cell function and the regulation of humoral immunity. CVID is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous entity, primarily presenting as an antibody deficiency with low levels of serum IgG, IgA, and/or IgM, functional antibody deficiency, and recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections. In addition, non-infectious complications linked to underlying immune dysregulation are present in a subset of patients. Evidence supporting the TNFRSF13B gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 14 unique variants have been reported in humans with biallelic variants, including nonsense, frameshift, splicing, and missense. Biallelic variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 16007086, 19779048, 19629655, 27123465, 16007087, 18981294, 17983875), and segregated with disease in four additional family members. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its expression in B cells (PMID: 15240667), its role in class switch recombination (PMID: 15630136), which is altered in patient cells (PMID: 16007087), and two mouse models (PMIDs: 11429549, 11371359) which recapitulate features of CVID. In summary TNFRSF13B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive CVID 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nOf note, variants in TNFRSF13B have been observed in CVID patients in both the monoallelic and biallelic forms. Heterozygous mutations in TNFRSF13B may lead to impaired ligand binding and contribute to defects in cell activation and B cell tolerance, but the connection between heterozygous mutations and disease is not clear, because normal relatives may have the same mutations without evidence of immune deficiency. Since additional genetic or environmental factors are required to induce immune deficiency, only biallelic cases are considered here for the relationship between TNFRSF13B and CVID 2. On the other hand, heterozygous TACI variants do affect B cell activation and peripheral tolerance resulting in autoimmunity (Romberg et al., 2013; PMID: 24051380), likely due to a dominant negative effect (Romberg et al., 2015; PMID: 26100089). Whereas, patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome (with a deletion on 17p) have haploinsufficiency of TACI but do not develop autoimmunity or abnormal B cell function. Additionally, epistatic interactions have been reported between TNFRSF13B and other genes, such as TCF3 with similar function, resulting in a digenic cause of humoral immunodeficiency (Ameratunga et al., 217; PMID: 29114388).
