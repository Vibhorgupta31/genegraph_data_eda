This is the first case involving substitutions in the heavy chain of the PK gene which affected blood coagulation. Because the apple domains of PK bind to the C-terminal domain (D6(H)) of high-molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), the two substitutions in A2 may therefore be the main cause of PKD Seki. We subsequently investigated the effects of amino acid substitutions in A2 to elucidate the binding activity of PK to HMWK using mutant A2 proteins produced in Escherichia coli. We clearly demonstrated that the Gly104Arg-substitution with the Asn124Ser-substitution in A2 reduce the binding activity of A2 to HMWK.

In sum, Klkb1(-/-) mice have a novel mechanism for thrombosis protection in addition to reduced contact activation.

PK has an important historical role as its deficiency state represents the second instance of a clotting defect without bleeding manifestations, the first one being factor XII deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare clotting disorder. Moreover, only 11 patients have been investigated so far by molecular biology techniques. In this article, we briefly review some of the history around PK and also present some recent data on a newly identified family from Argentina suffering from PK deficiency. Two patients are homozygous whereas other family members are heterozygous. PK activity and antigen are 1% of normal in the homozygotes and around 60 to 70% of normal in the heterozygotes. As expected, all patients are asymptomatic of bleeding or thrombosis presentations. However, the two homozygotes showed essential hypertension. The PK deficiency in this family is due to a new mutation (Arg541Gln) in exon 14. The defect segregates together with a known polymorphism, Asn124Ser, in exon 5. The significance of the presence of hypertension in the two homozygotes is discussed in view of the extra coagulation effects of PK on vasodilation, vessel permeability, and the control of blood pressure. Structure function analysis indicates that the substitution of Arg with Gln probably impedes the transmembrane diffusion of the molecule, which therefore cannot be secreted in the homozygotes. The presence of hypertension in patients with PK deficiency has been previously reported in some but not all patients. Future research activities will probably concentrate on the effect of PK and other contact phase factors on the vascular system.","dc:creator":"Girolami A","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"The old and the new in prekallikrein deficiency: historical context and a family from Argentina with PK deficiency due to a new mutation (Arg541Gln) in exon 14 associated with a common polymorphysm (Asn124Ser) in exon 5."}},"rdfs:label":"proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:f91c46fd-3f6a-4d6e-844e-8d6250ceecd8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f91c46fd-3f6a-4d6e-844e-8d6250ceecd8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Structure function analysis indicates that the substitution of Arg with Gln probably impedes the transmembrane diffusion of the molecule, which therefore cannot be secreted in the homozygotes, however functional data are not available"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:45c85a30-d5cd-4a05-8e60-435920683ba5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:45c85a30-d5cd-4a05-8e60-435920683ba5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":63,"allele":{"id":"cggv:97239bec-5a38-4c6c-825e-d29a1135f736"},"detectionMethod":"Gene analysis was performed by sequence analysis of\nboth strands of the 15 exons with amplification primers\nallowing analysis of the intron–exon junctions.

Moreover PK mediates the inflammatory response by liberating the vasodilatory and proinflammatory nonapeptide bradykinin from HMWK. \nKLKB1 was first reported in relation to inherited prekallikrein deficiency in 2003 (Shigekiyo T et al, PMID: 12871337) in a 47 years old male in which prolongation of the aPTT was discovered during coagulation tests before surgery. He referred episodes of epistaxis. Plasma PK activity was about 1% and molecular analysis showed homozygosis for the p.Gly420Glu (p.Gly401Glu in the paper) variant in KLKB1. Heterozygous family members showed a normal aPTT but reduced (mean 38%) PK activity.\nNo patients with bleeding were described so far, except one with epistaxis (PMID: 12871337).\n11 variants have been reported in humans: 6 missense, 3 nonsense and 2 frameshift. \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (functional evidence of biochemical function and expression, functional alteration in non-patient cells, non-human model organisms that replicate the disease).  \nSummary of Case Level Data: 8.35 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs:  15461630, 14652634, 21415712, 17598838, 25075649, 34847617, 17413767, 32202057, 20301226, 12871337) leading to a score of 12 for genetic evidence. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 4 POINTS \nThis gene-disease association is supported by evidences of Expression (A): This study demonstrateed that PK is present in plasma and associates with HMWK (PMID 1069308).\nEvidence of Biochemical function: PK-deficient plasma showed a diminished rate of kaolin-activable coagulation (i.e. contact phase or intrinsic coagulation, that was corrected by reconstitution with purified prekallikrein suggesting that kallikrein activates FXII (PMID: 11344577). \nFunctional alteration: two amino acid substitutions found in a patient (Gly123Arg and Asn143Ser; Gly104Arg and Asn124Ser in the paper) in the apple domain 2 (A2) of KLKB1 were expressed in E. Coli cells. The authors analyzed the binding activity of HMWK with the recombinant A2 and found that the binding activity of mutant PK was significantly reduced as compared with the wild-type (PMID:17598838). The Asn143Ser will be later described to be a common variant (MAF 0.54).\nA mouse model knockout for KLKB1 showed significantly low levels of plasma PK and a significantly prolonged aPTT (PMID: 25339356).\n\nIn summary, we found definitive association of KLKB1 with inherited PK deficiency. \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on 12/5/2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ada3e3e0-165c-4bfb-af20-d811b7b8d9b8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
