Urinary α-ketoglutarate was highly increased (Table 1). On subsequent  tests, lactate and pyruvate levels as well as urinary α-ketoglutarate were normalized. A severe decrease of PDH and α-KGDH activities was found in patient fibroblasts (Table 2), and BCKDH activity was also strongly reduced, as inferred by a 13C6 labeled leucine loading test that showed levels comparable to fibroblasts from a maple syrup urine disease patient. In contrast, mitochondrial respiratory chain activities and E3 subunit (DLD) activity measured in fibroblast homogenates were normal (data not shown). Polarographic assay in fibroblasts showed reduced oxygen production using pyruvate as substrate (2.2 nmol O2/min/mg of protein, reference range from 3.3 to 6.8 nmol O2/min/mg of protein). Oxidation rates of butyrate (fatty acid), 3-hydroxybutyrate (ketone body) and glucose were measured by incubating patient-derived fibroblasts with 1 and 10 mmol/l 1-14C labeled substrates. We found that CO2 production by the Krebs cycle and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in fibroblast’s patient were very low compared to controls after administration of each of these substrates (Table 2), suggesting a defect in both the Krebs’ cycle and PDH.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0003128","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0012707","obo:HP_0002015"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Direct sequencing of PDHA1, PDHB, PDHX, DLAT, DLD, LIAS, BOLA3, NFU1","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:99c56ca5-0530-4d7b-96e3-8d15d5d95b20_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:94221f8c-0948-460c-b3f8-673cd44f43a1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_145199.3(LIPT1):c.535A>G (p.Thr179Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA199518"}},{"id":"cggv:8bc2d359-ffae-4d70-bec9-b6ebf1205cd5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_145199.3(LIPT1):c.875C>G (p.Ser292Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1797396"}}],"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24341803","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Synthesis and apoenzyme attachment of lipoic acid have emerged as a new complex metabolic pathway.

Here, we report a patient with an early onset fatal lactic acidosis presenting a biochemical phenotype compatible with a combined defect of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHC) and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (2-KGDH) activities, which suggested a deficiency in lipoic acid metabolism. Immunostaining analysis showed that lipoylated E2-PDH and E2-KGDH were extremely reduced in this patient. However, the absence of glycine elevation, the normal activity of the glycine cleavage system and the normal lipoylation of the H protein suggested a defect of lipoic acid transfer to particular proteins rather than a general impairment of lipoic acid biosynthesis as the potential cause of the disease. By analogy with yeast metabolism, we postulated LIPT1 as the altered candidate gene causing the disease. Sequence analysis of the human LIPT1 identified two heterozygous missense mutations (c.212C>T and c.292C>G), segregating in different alleles.

All of them harbor at least one [Fe-S] cluster and their activity is dependent on the mitochondrial [Fe-S] cluster (ISC) assembly machinery. Disorders in the ISC machinery affect numerous Fe-S proteins and lead to a heterogeneous group of diseases with a wide variety of clinical symptoms and combined enzymatic defects. Here, we present the biochemical profiles of several key mitochondrial [Fe-S]-containing proteins in fibroblasts from 13 patients carrying mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in either the lipoic acid (LIPT1 and LIPT2) or mitochondrial ISC biogenesis (FDX1L, ISCA2, IBA57, NFU1, BOLA3) pathway.

We confirm that the fibroblast is a good cellular model to study these deficiencies, except for patients presenting mutations in FDX1L and a muscular clinical phenotype.

Our work suggests a functional difference between IBA57 and other proteins involved in maturation of [Fe-S] proteins.

The LIPT1 gene encodes lipoyltransferase which catalyzes the attachment of lipoate to four mitochondrial enzymes (two of which are important for energy metabolism and two of which are needed for amino acid metabolism). Defects in this process result in a disorder of lipoate biosynthesis which impacts mitochondrial energy generation and amino acid metabolism.\n\nThe LIPT1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2013 (PMID: 24341803). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants identified in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 24341803, 29681092). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by the biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, rescue in human cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 24341803, 28803783, 31042466).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:55d66b81-fe31-4965-b5fc-483393af820d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
