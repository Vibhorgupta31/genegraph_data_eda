Mutations in the gene encoding nexilin (NEXN) occur in patients with both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM); however, little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms and relevance of NEXN to these disorders. Here, we evaluated the functional role of NEXN using a constitutive Nexn knock-out (KO) mouse model. Heterozygous (Het) mice were inter-crossed to produce wild-type (WT), Het, and homozygous KO mice. At birth, 32, 46, and 22 % of the mice were WT, Het, and KO, respectively, which is close to the expected Mendelian ratio. After postnatal day 6, the survival of the Nexn KO mice decreased dramatically and all of the animals died by day 8. Phenotypic characterizations of the WT and KO mice were performed at postnatal days 1, 2, 4, and 6. At birth, the relative heart weights of the WT and KO mice were similar; however, at day 4, the relative heart weight of the KO group was 2.3-fold higher than of the WT group. In addition, the KO mice developed rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dilation and wall thinning and decreased cardiac function. At day 6, the KO mice developed a fulminant DCM phenotype characterized by dilated ventricular chambers and systolic dysfunction. At this stage, collagen deposits and some elastin deposits were observed within the left ventricle cavity, which resembles the features of endomyocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Overall, these results further emphasize the role of NEXN in DCM and suggest a novel role in EFE.

NEXN encodes a filamentous actin (F-actin)-binding protein that also binds to RyR2 and Jph2, is a pivotal component of the junctional membrane complex, is required for initiation and formation of T-tubules and is important Ca2+ homeostasis in the heart (Liu et al, 2019, PMID: 30982350). At least 14 variants (both truncating and non-truncating) have been described in patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and case-control data. The heterozygous variant NM_144573.3(NEXN):c.1949_1951del p.(Gly650del) was found in 6 of 1000 DCM patients analyzed in Germany. All 6 shared an identical haplotype over a large genomic region surrounding the NEXN gene suggesting a founder effect. This variant occurred 29 times in 279530 gnomAD alleles. Overexpression of this variant in zebrafish results in DCM (Hassel et al, 2009, PMID: 19881492). In addition, rare NEXN variants (truncating and non-truncating jointly) are significantly enriched in DCM compared to controls (Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID: 31983221). In addition, this gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence.  Importantly, NEXN RNA and protein are highly expressed in the myocardium (Zhao et al, 2001, PMID: 12053183, Hassel et al, 2009, PMID: 19881492). Nexn knock-out (KO) zebrafish (using morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotides) and mouse models (using cre-loxP) show severe, progressive DCM (Hassel et al, 2009, PMID: 19881492; Aherrahrou et al, 2016, PMID: 26659360; Liu et al, 2019, PMID: 30982350). Western blot analyses and pull-down results showed that NEXN was coimmunoprecipitated with both Jph2 and RyR2 (proteins from the T tubule) (Liu et al, 2019, PMID: 30982350). Confocal analysis of postnatal control and Nexn KO cardiomyocytes showed that organized T-tubules were completely absent in KO cells (Liu et al, 2019, PMID: 30982350). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.  While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on February 14, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ffe00b43-a449-4476-b7e0-f24cf6613766"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
