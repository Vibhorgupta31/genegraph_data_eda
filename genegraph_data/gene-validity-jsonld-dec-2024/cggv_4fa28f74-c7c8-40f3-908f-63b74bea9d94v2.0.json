Similarly, in the mouse model, Mlh1-/- animals are highly cancer prone and present with gastrointestinal tumors at an early age, whereas Pms2-/- mice succumb to cancer much later in life and do not present with gastrointestinal tumors. This evidence suggested that MLH1 might functionally interact with another MutL homologue, which compensates, at least in part, for a deficiency in PMS2.

Although, hMLH3 is suggested to be causative in HNPCC, its relevance to MMR needs to be confirmed to reliably assess significance of the inherited sequence variations in it.

To repair mismatches in vivo, hMLH3 ought to localize in the nucleus. Our immunofluorescence analyses indicated that when all the three MutL homologues are natively expressed in human cells, endogenous hMLH1 and hPMS2 localize in the nucleus, whereas hMLH3 stays in the cytoplasm. Absence of hPMS2 and co-expression of hMLH3 with hMLH1 results in its partial nuclear localization.

The continuous nuclear localization of hMLH1 and hPMS2 suggests that in vivo, hPMS2 (hMutLalpha) has a major activity in MMR.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability with dominant and recessive disorders associated with MLH3. Therefore, these entities were not lumped and this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant Colorectal cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis, type 7 (MONDO:0013725, OMIM:614385). Five heterozygous variants (four frameshifts and one missense) that have been reported in seven probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 11586295, 12702580, 27401157, 28195393, 29212164 and 31043711) are included in this curation (3.2 points). No familial segregation analysis was scored since no family with four or more segregations were described, and reported co-segregation suggests a lack of association of disease with segregating MLH3 variants. Scores assigned in this curation were exclusively for colorectal cancers, as no probands were detected with other Lynch-associated tumors (endometrial, ovarian). In addition, 6 of 7 probands reported with loss of function MLH3 variants display tumors lacking MSI. Experimental evidence was curated for this gene-disease relationship (2.8 points), including protein interaction with other mismatch repair proteins (PMIDs: 10615123, 11292842 and 16322221).
