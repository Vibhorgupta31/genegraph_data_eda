Genetic mutations have long been considered to be associated with this disease. At present, mutations in over 50 genes related to DCM have been documented. This study was carried out to elucidate the characteristics of gene mutations in patients with DCM. The candidate genes that may cause DCM include MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, LMNA, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYPN, MYL3, TPM1, SCN5A, DES, ACTC1 and RBM20. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subsequent mutation confirmation with traditional capillary Sanger sequencing analysis, possible causative non-synonymous mutations were identified in ~57% (12/21) of patients with DCM. As a result, 7 novel mutations (MYPN, p.E630K; TNNT2, p.G180A; MYH6, p.R1047C; TNNC1, p.D3V; DES, p.R386H; MYBPC3, p.C1124F; and MYL3, p.D126G), 3 variants of uncertain significance (RBM20, p.R1182H; MYH6, p.T1253M; and VCL, p.M209L), and 2 known mutations (MYH7, p.A26V and MYBPC3, p.R160W) were revealed to be associated with DCM. The mutations were most frequently found in the sarcomere (MYH6, MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNC1, TNNT2 and MYL3) and cytoskeletal (MYPN, DES and VCL) genes. As genetic testing is a useful tool in the clinical management of disease, testing for pathogenic mutations is beneficial to the treatment of patients with DCM and may assist in predicting disease risk for their family members before the onset of symptoms.","dc:creator":"Zhao Y","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing of candidate genes reveals novel mutations in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26458567","rdfs:label":"DCM-113"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"There is no functional data/segregation data to support pathogenicity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:6fdf5074-f853-473c-bd04-2c95c172b98a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":1343,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0.1,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d9bc85ce-1b25-4449-8835-ee43d80c4536","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:7584","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"MYL3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2015 (Zhao et al., 2015, PMID 26458567). MYL3 has also been curated by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) Gene Curation Expert Panel for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Definitive, October 4, 2016) and the Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) Gene Curation Expert Panel for ARVC (Limited, September 13, 2019). Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data.  At least one variant (missense) has been reported in humans with DCM (Zhao et al., 2015, PMID 26458567). Next-generation sequencing and followed by variant confirmation with traditional capillary Sanger sequencing analysis was completed in 21 individuals with DCM and revealed possible causative variants in ~57% of patients, including a novel variant in MYL3 (c.377A>G, p.D126G). There is no experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease assertion in the literature at the time of curation. In summary, the evidence presented for this gene-disease relationship does not provide convincing human genetic evidence in support of or refuting the role of MYL3 and autosomal dominant DCM. The relationship of MYL3 with DCM is unclear and therefore classified as disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on September 11, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\nThe DCM GCEP agreed, based on previous trends, MYL3 should be classified as disputed.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6fdf5074-f853-473c-bd04-2c95c172b98a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
