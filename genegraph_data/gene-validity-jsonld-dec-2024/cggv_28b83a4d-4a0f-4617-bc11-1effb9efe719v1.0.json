Mutations in hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSN2), a single-exon ORF originally identified in affected families in Quebec and Newfoundland, Canada, were found to cause HSANII. We report here that HSN2 is a nervous system-specific exon of the with-no-lysine(K)-1 (WNK1) gene. WNK1 mutations have previously been reported to cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II but have not been studied in the nervous system. Given the high degree of conservation of WNK1 between mice and humans, we characterized the structure and expression patterns of this isoform in mice. Immunodetections indicated that this Wnk1/Hsn2 isoform was expressed in sensory components of the peripheral nervous system and CNS associated with relaying sensory and nociceptive signals, including satellite cells, Schwann cells, and sensory neurons. We also demonstrate that the novel protein product of Wnk1/Hsn2 was more abundant in sensory neurons than motor neurons.

Mutations in WNK1 result in dysregulation of the WNK1-SPAK/OSR1 pathway and cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), a form of hypertension. WNK1 is also involved in the autosomal recessive neuropathy, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSANII). Mutations in a neural-specific splice variant of WNK1 (HSN2) cause HSANII. However, the mechanisms underlying HSN2 regulation in neurons and effects of HSN2 mutants remain unclear. Here, we found that HSN2 regulated neurite outgrowth through OSR1 activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Moreover, HSN2-OSR1 and HSN2-GSK3β signalling induced expression of LIM homeobox 8 (Lhx8), which is a key regulator of cholinergic neural function. The HSN2-OSR1/GSK3β-LHX8 pathway is therefore important for neurite outgrowth. Consistently, HSN2 mutants reported in HSANII patients suppressed SPAK and OSR1 activation and LHX8 induction. Interestingly, HSN2 mutants also suppressed neurite outgrowth by preventing interaction of between wild-type HSN2 and GSK3β.

It is due to autosomal recessive mutations confined to exon \"HSN2\" of the WNK1 (with-no-lysine protein kinase 1) serine-threonine kinase. While this kinase is well studied in the kidneys, little is known about its role in the nervous system. We hypothesized that the truncating mutations present in the neural-specific HSN2 exon lead to a loss-of-function of the WNK1 kinase, impairing development of the peripheral sensory system. To investigate the mechanisms by which the loss of WNK1/HSN2 isoform function causes HSANII, we used the embryonic zebrafish model and observed strong expression of WNK1/HSN2 in neuromasts of the peripheral lateral line (PLL) system by immunohistochemistry. Knocking down wnk1/hsn2 in embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides led to improper PLL development. We then investigated the reported interaction between the WNK1 kinase and neuronal potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2, as this transporter is a target of WNK1 phosphorylation. In situ hybridization revealed kcc2 expression in mature neuromasts of the PLL and semi-quantitative RT-PCR of wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos showed an increased expression of kcc2 mRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of human KCC2 mRNA in embryos replicated the wnk1/hsn2 knockdown phenotype. We validated these results by obtaining double knockdown embryos, both for wnk1/hsn2 and kcc2, which alleviated the PLL defects. Interestingly, overexpression of inactive mutant KCC2-C568A, which does not extrude ions, allowed a phenocopy of the PLL defects. These results suggest a pathway in which WNK1/HSN2 interacts with KCC2, producing a novel regulation of its transcription independent of KCC2's activation, where a loss-of-function mutation in WNK1 induces an overexpression of KCC2 and hinders proper peripheral sensory nerve development, a hallmark of HSANII.","dc:creator":"Bercier V","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"WNK1/HSN2 mutation in human peripheral neuropathy deregulates KCC2 expression and posterior lateral line development in zebrafish (Danio rerio)."},"rdfs:label":"Drosophila Wnk1 knockdown"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Although this is a relevant model to study the sensory system, it was downgraded because the it doesn't truly reflects the human phenotype.

In the nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, WNK1/HSN2 contributed to a maladaptive decrease in the activity of the K(+)-Cl(-)cotransporter KCC2 by increasing its inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr(906)and Thr(1007), resulting in an associated loss of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition of spinal pain-transmitting nerves.

Patients' symptoms began in infancy and they suffered from loss of touch and pain sensation in the distal limbs, leading to ulcerations and amputation of digits. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type IIC (OMIM #614492). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, no overlapping phenotypes were identified in WNK1 patients with the two different diseases. The precise molecular mechanism leading to the diseases is still unknown; however, the two phenotypes are caused by mutations in different isoforms. HSAN2 variants affect a neuronal specific isoform and PHA affects a kidney specific isoform. Moreover, HSAN2 is caused by recessive LOF variants and PHA is caused by dominant intronic deletions leading to increased WNK1 expression. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, HSAN2 (OMIM: 201300) and pseudohypoaudosteronism (OMIM:614492). Five loss-of-function (LOF) variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in five probands with HSAN2 (PMIDs: 15060842, 15911806, 16636245​, 30497409​), which are included in this curation reaching the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. The gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies (expressed in the dorsal root ganglion), two animal models (drosophila and mouse), and in vitro functional assay (neurite outgrowth induction) [PMIDs:18521183, 36151370, 23300475, 27025876​].
