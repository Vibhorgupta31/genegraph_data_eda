Here, exome sequencing of a single cohort of 2,871 CHD probands, including 2,645 parent-offspring trios, implicated rare inherited mutations in 1.8%, including a recessive founder mutation in GDF1 accounting for ∼5% of severe CHD in Ashkenazim, recessive genotypes in MYH6 accounting for ∼11% of Shone complex, and dominant FLT4 mutations accounting for 2.3% of Tetralogy of Fallot. De novo mutations (DNMs) accounted for 8% of cases, including ∼3% of isolated CHD patients and ∼28% with both neurodevelopmental and extra-cardiac congenital anomalies. Seven genes surpassed thresholds for genome-wide significance, and 12 genes not previously implicated in CHD had >70% probability of being disease related. DNMs in ∼440 genes were inferred to contribute to CHD. Striking overlap between genes with damaging DNMs in probands with CHD and autism was also found.","dc:creator":"Jin SC","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4e87080-7e90-4e19-a3dc-e986bfd01e0f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:b4e87080-7e90-4e19-a3dc-e986bfd01e0f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4e87080-7e90-4e19-a3dc-e986bfd01e0f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffef8bd6-0aab-4add-abdf-b149b49a194b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9fab450a-8d5e-4900-8ef8-f5e160b758ef","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) analysis was performed to detect quantitative changes in transcript levels of collagen genes (including COL1A2) in endocardial cushions, remodeling, maturing, and adult murine atrioventricular heart valves.

Therefore, we examined the temporal and spatial expression of select fibril-, network-, beaded filament-forming, and FACIT collagens in endocardial cushions, remodeling, maturing, and adult murine atrioventricular heart valves. Of the genes examined, col1a1, col2a1, and col3a1 transcripts are most highly expressed in endocardial cushions. Expression of col1a1, col1a2, col2a1, and col3a1 remain high, along with col12a1 in remodeling valves. Maturing neonate valves predominantly express col1a1, col1a2, col3a1, col5a2, col11a1, and col12a1 within defined proximal and distal regions. In adult valves, collagen protein distribution is highly compartmentalized, with ColI and ColXII observed on the ventricular surface and ColIII and ColVa1 detected throughout the leaflets. Together, these expression data identify patterning of collagen types in developing and maintained heart valves, which likely relate to valve structure and function.","dc:creator":"Peacock JD","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Temporal and spatial expression of collagens during murine atrioventricular heart valve development and maintenance."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in mouse heart valves"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":9141,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":0.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:2459f3e5-7e12-4711-b284-99c391d9fb73","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:2198","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000005"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*COL1A2* was first reported in relation to congenital heart disease in 2017 (Jin et al., PMID: 28991257). This gene-disease relationship in the literature reports both autosomal dominant and recessive cases, so the mode of inheritance is currently undetermined. Four unique variants (1 homozygous missense, 3 heterozygous missense) that have been reported in four probands with CHD in three publications are included in this curation (PMID: 28991257, 33064175, 35885997). However, these variants were not scored due to a high minor allele frequency in gnomAD v.4 or a low REVEL score. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression data in mouse cardiac tissues (PMID: 18816857). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *COL1A2* and congenital heart disease has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *COL1A2* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date September 9th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\nThere are papers implicating the gene in the disease but the genetic evidence could not be scored, so the EP classified it as Disputed. The evidence is insufficient to either refute or support the relationship.
