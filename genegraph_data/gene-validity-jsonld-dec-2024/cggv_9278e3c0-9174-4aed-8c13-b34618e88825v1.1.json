We identified heterozygous, novel variants in ACTL6A, a gene encoding a component of the BAF complex, in three subjects with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Two subjects have missense variants affecting highly conserved amino acid residues within the actin-like domain. Missense mutations in the homologous region in yeast actin were previously reported to be dominant lethal and were associated with impaired binding of the human ACTL6A to Î²-actin and BRG1. A third subject has a splicing variant that creates an in-frame deletion. Our findings suggest that the variants identified in our subjects may have a deleterious effect on the function of the protein by disturbing the integrity of the BAF complex. Thus, ACTL6A gene mutation analysis should be considered in patients with intellectual disability, learning disabilities, or developmental language disorder.","dc:creator":"Marom R","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Heterozygous variants in ACTL6A, encoding a component of the BAF complex, are associated with intellectual disability."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91e1a770-5bd6-4b47-b62d-7ef5a789476d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92476b67-80d7-4257-814c-3f6c47057acc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Baf53a is enriched in Sox2-expressing radial glia & TBR2-expressing intermediate progenitor cells in the ventricular & subventricular zones of the mouse embryonic cortex\nBAF53a is restricted to the neural progenitors; BAF45a & BAF53a is confined to the proliferated regions (part of the neural progenitor-specific complex, npBAF)\nThe switch to BAF53b & BAF45b/c is considered the postmitotic neuron-specific complex & is expressed in differentiated zones\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602870","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"mSWI/SNF or BAF chromatin regulatory complexes are dosage-sensitive regulators of human neural development frequently mutated in autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability.

ACTL6A was first reported in relation to a neurodevelopmental disorder with dysmorphic features in 2017 (Marom et al., PMID: 28649782).  This disorder is characterized by intellectual disability or developmental delay as well as clinical features that include intrauterine growth retardation and failure to thrive in infancy, facial dysmorphisms, digital and urogenital anomalies, and cardiac defects (PMID 28649782). Five variants (1 frameshift, 1 splice-site, and 3 missense variants) have been reported in six cases across four publications (PMID: 28649782; Pascolini et al. 2020, PMID: 31994175; Chen et al. 2021, PMID: 34906496; Yuan et al. 2021, PMID: 34485408) and are included in this curation. The ACTL6A gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression and biochemical function, and rescue in a non-human model data (Braun et al. 2021, PMID: 33602870). Homozygous deletion of the mouse homologue (Actl6a) results in early embryonic lethality (Krasteva et al. 2012, PMID: 23018638), while a conditional knockout mouse model demonstrates stalled cell cycle progression, resulting in cell death and disruption of appropriate neuronal cell differentiation (PMID: 33602870). \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This definitive classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP in the meeting on July 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
