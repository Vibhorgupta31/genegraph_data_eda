We have identified four new patients (from two different families) carrying novel variants in DPH1, enriching the clinical delineation of the DPH1 syndrome. Using a diphtheria toxin ADP-ribosylation assay, we have analyzed the activity of seven identified variants and demonstrated compromised function for five of them [p.(Leu234Pro); p.(Ala411Argfs*91); p.(Leu164Pro); p.(Leu125Pro); and p.(Tyr112Cys)]. We have built a homology model of the human DPH1-DPH2 heterodimer and have performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of these variants on the catalytic sites as well as on the interactions between subunits of the heterodimer. The results show correlation between loss of activity, reduced size of the opening to the catalytic site, and changes in the size of the catalytic site with clinical severity. This is the first report of functional tests of DPH1 variants associated with the DPH1 syndrome. We demonstrate that the in vitro assay for DPH1 protein activity, together with structural modeling, are useful tools for assessing the effect of the variants on DPH1 function and may be used for predicting patient outcomes and prognoses.","dc:creator":"Urreizti R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"DPH1 syndrome: two novel variants and structural and functional analyses of seven missense variants identified in syndromic patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Urreizti_Family 2 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:85c222e9-039b-4e0f-9901-025bafb5a608","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85c222e9-039b-4e0f-9901-025bafb5a608_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:85c222e9-039b-4e0f-9901-025bafb5a608_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Reduced DPH1 functionality compared with wild-type DPH1."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8f035481-7b6f-45f6-a153-43eef771844b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f035481-7b6f-45f6-a153-43eef771844b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:bea1d94d-0575-477a-9d5b-1875c9aa1c92","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001383.6(DPH1):c.2T>A (p.Met1Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA280078"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Developmental delay/Intellectual Disability, Unusual skull shape (including scaphocephaly or prominent forehead) with or without craniosynostosis, Dysmorphic features (hypertelorism, downslanting palperbral fissure, epicanthal folds, low-set ears, depressed nasal bridge and micrognathia), Sparse hair on scalp/eyelashes, eyebrows, Short stature, Renal anomaly(mild focal interstitial nephritis).","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:58f44236-894f-4d18-9a78-b1bff7309826_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bea1d94d-0575-477a-9d5b-1875c9aa1c92"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26220823","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recently, Alazami etÂ al.

This postpublication \"match\" validates DPH1 as a gene underlying syndromic intellectual disability with short stature and craniofacial and ectodermal anomalies, reminiscent of, but distinct from, 3C and Sensenbrenner syndromes. This validation took several years after the independent discoveries due to the absence of effective methods for sharing both candidate phenotype and genotype data between investigators.

DPH1 defects result in a failure of protein synthesis involving EEF2, leading to growth defects, embryonic lethality, and cell death. In humans, DPH1 mutations cause developmental delay with a short stature, dysmorphic features, and sparse hair, and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (MIM#616901). To date, only two homozygous missense mutations in DPH1 (c.17T>A, p.Met6Lys and c.701T>C, p.Leu234Pro) have been reported.

Dph2 and Dph5 were previously identified. Here, we report the identification of the remaining three yeast proteins (Dph1, -3, and -4) and show that all five Dph proteins have either functional (Dph1, -2, -3, and -5) or sequence (Dph4) homologs in mammals. We propose a unified nomenclature for these proteins (e.g., HsDph1 to -5 for the human proteins) and their genes based on the yeast nomenclature. We show that Dph1 and Dph2 are homologous in sequence but functionally independent. The human tumor suppressor gene OVCA1, previously identified as homologous to yeast DPH2, is shown to actually be HsDPH1. We show that HsDPH3 is the previously described human diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A sensitivity required gene 1 and that DPH4 encodes a CSL zinc finger-containing DnaJ-like protein. Other features of these genes are also discussed. The physiological function of diphthamide and the basis of its ubiquity remain a mystery, but evidence is presented that Dph1 to -3 function in vivo as a protein complex in multiple cellular processes.","dc:creator":"Liu S","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Identification of the proteins required for biosynthesis of diphthamide, the target of bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins on translation elongation factor 2."},"rdfs:label":"Dph1- Dph2 physical Interaction "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0b36dd3d-e391-4940-896f-141199b43f2c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9696871b-5b0a-4888-88b4-5f69bf65640b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Diphthamide is the posttranslationally modified histidine residue on EEF2 that promotes protein chain elongation in the ribosome.

Ovca1/Dph1 (Ovca1)-null mice exhibit multiple developmental defects, including cleft palate, growth restriction and perinatal lethality, suggesting a role in the craniofacial abnormalities associated with MDS. Conditional ablation of Ovca1 in neural crest cells, but not in cranial paraxial mesoderm, also results in cleft palate and shortened lower jaw phenotypes, similar to Ovca1-null embryos. Expression of transgenic myc-tagged Ovca1 in craniofacial structures can partially rescue the cleft palate and shortened mandible of Ovca1-null embryos. Interestingly, Ovca1-null mutants are resistant to conditional expression of diphtheria toxin subunit A in both neural crest cell and paraxial mesoderm derivatives. However, OVCA1-dependent diphthamide biosynthesis is essential for neural crest cell-derived craniofacial development but that is dispensable for paraxial mesodermal-derived craniofacial structures in mammals. These findings suggest that OVCA1 deficiency in the neural crest contributes to the craniofacial abnormalities in patients with MDS.

DPH1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive developmental delay with short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and sparse hair 1 (DEDSSH1) in 2015 (Loucks et al., 2015 PMID: 26220823). DEDSSH1 is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the DPH1 gene. The clinical profile of this disease includes craniofacial dysmorphism (an abnormal skull shape, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, low-set ears, depressed nasal bridge, micrognathia), short stature, ectodermal anomalies (such as sparse eyebrows, eyelashes, and scalp hair, hypoplastic toenails), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Some patients have cerebral/cerebellar malformations and mild renal involvement.\nNine unique variants (six missense, three frameshift) reported in fourteen probands in seven publications (PMID: 26220823, 29362492, 29410513, 30877278,33704902, 34645488,32732226) are included in this curation. The mechanism of disease is loss-of-function whereby pathogenic variants reduce the presence of diphthamide on eEF2, and therefore reduced DPH1 functionality. A total of 11 genetic evidence points was reached, considering case-level data. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model, protein interaction, and biochemical data (PMID: 24895408, 15485916). \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between DPH1 and autosomal recessive developmental delay with short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and sparse hair 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
