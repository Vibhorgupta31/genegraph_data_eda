The disease is characterized by increased urinary excretion of the amino acids and often leads to recurrent nephrolithiasis. Cystinuria is classified into two subtypes (type I and type non-I). Type I is caused predominantly by mutations in the SLC3A1 gene (2p16.3), encoding heavy subunit (rBAT) of the heterodimeric transporter. Cystinuria non-I type is caused by mutations in the SLC7A9 gene (19q13.1). In this study, we present results of molecular genetic analysis of the SLC3A1 and the SLC7A9 genes in 24 unrelated cystinuria families. Individual exons of the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes were analyzed by direct sequencing. We found ten different mutations in the SLC3A1 gene including six novel ones: three missense mutations (G140R), D179Y and R365P), one splice site mutation (1137-2A>G), one deletion (1515_1516delAA), and one nonsense mutation (Q119X). The most frequent mutation, M467T; was detected in 36% of all type I classified alleles. In the SLC7A9 gene we found six mutations including three new ones: one missense mutation (G319R), one insertion (611_612insA) and one deletion (205_206delTG). One patient was compound heterozygote for one SLC3A1 and one SLC7A9 mutation. Our results confirm that cystinuria is a heterogeneous disorder at the molecular level, and contribute to the understanding of the distribution and frequency of mutations causing cystinuria in the Caucasian population.","dc:creator":"SkopkovÃ¡ Z","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Molecular genetic analysis of SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes in Czech and Slovak cystinuric patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16138908","rdfs:label":"Patient 10"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The homozygous splicing variant, c.1137-2A>G, alters the canonical acceptor site at the intron 6/exon 7 boundary."},{"id":"cggv:ce16a93b-ffa4-4d4b-8c33-b011db009bdb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0b0c9a7-868f-424d-a50e-af3f176bf99d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"All coding exons and flanking introns of the SLC3A1 gene was PCR amplified followed by direct sequencing.","phenotypeFreeText":"5358 uM cystine/g creatinine [reference 27-150], 7849 uM ornithine/g creatinine [reference <44], 14910 uM lysine/g creatinine [<44], 9746 uM arginine/g creatinine [reference <44]","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000787","obo:HP_0003297","obo:HP_0003131","obo:HP_0000010","obo:HP_0003532","obo:HP_0003268"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"SLC7A9 was also sequenced.","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:ce16a93b-ffa4-4d4b-8c33-b011db009bdb_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:0151694f-73a2-4f5f-a21f-34a90a428d11","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000002.12:g.44320401del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1640767"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049243","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cystinuria is an inherited disorder characterized by defective renal reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids leading to nephrolithiasis.

Trafficking of the transporter requires the intracellular assembly of the two subunits. Without its partner, rBAT, but not b(0,+)AT, is rapidly degraded. We analyzed the initial biogenesis of wild-type rBAT and type I cystinuria rBAT mutants. rBAT was degraded, at least in part, via the ERAD pathway. Assembly with b(0,+)AT within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) blocked rBAT degradation and could be independent of the calnexin chaperone system. This system was, however, necessary for post-assembly maturation of the heterodimer. Without b(0,+)AT, wild-type and rBAT mutants were degraded with similar kinetics. In its presence, rBAT mutants showed strongly reduced (L89P) or no transport activity, failed to acquire complex N-glycosylation and to oligomerize, suggesting assembly and/or folding defects. Most of the transmembrane domain mutant L89P did not heterodimerize with b(0,+)AT and was degraded. However, the few [L89P]rBAT-b(0,+)AT heterodimers were stable, consistent with assembly, but not folding, defects. Mutants of the rBAT extracellular domain (T216M, R365W, M467K and M467T) efficiently assembled with b(0,+)AT but were subsequently degraded. Together with earlier results, the data suggest a two-step biogenesis model, with the early assembly of the subunits followed by folding of the rBAT extracellular domain. Defects on either of these steps lead to the type I cystinuria phenotype.","dc:creator":"Bartoccioni P","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Distinct classes of trafficking rBAT mutants cause the type I cystinuria phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"rBAT-b(0,+)AT heterodimer"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:819cc00a-33b2-44c9-ad69-74afa08a624c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64af6722-a97c-475c-9a02-1fc32ffe58de","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"SLC3A1 encodes part of a transporter protein complex which absorbs cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine back into the blood during urine formation.

Type I cystinuria is the most common form and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in humans. Cystinuria has been recognized in more than 60 breeds of dogs and a severe form, resembling type I cystinuria, has been characterized in the Newfoundland breed. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the canine SLC3A1 cDNA and gene, and the identification of a nonsense mutation in exon 2 of the gene in cystinuric Newfoundland dogs. A mutation-specific test was developed for the diagnosis and control of cystinuria in Newfoundland dogs. In cystinuric dogs of six other breeds, either heterozygosity at the SLC3A1 locus or lack of mutations in the coding region of the SLC3A1 gene were observed, indicating that cystinuria is genetically heterogeneous in dogs, as it is in humans.

At least 236 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 8054986, 8792820, 16374432, 16138908, 9648062, 28049243). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of SLC3A1 in a cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine transporter protein complex (PMID: 8486766), its interaction with b(0,+)AT in that complex (PMID: 18332091), and its expression in the kidneys (PMID: 8486766), where the protein complex absorbs cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine back into the blood during urine formation. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by mouse and canine models which recapitulate the elevated urinary cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine levels associated with abnormal function of this protein, leading to formation of cystine crystals and stones in the bladder or kidneys.
