The introduction of tandem mass spectrometry in newborn screening has revealed an unexpectedly high incidence of this disorder, which, in certain areas, appears to be the most frequent organic aciduria. MCC, an heteromeric enzyme consisting of alpha (biotin-containing) and beta subunits, is the only one of the four biotin-dependent carboxylases known in humans that has genes that have not yet been characterized, precluding molecular studies of this disease. Here we report the characterization, at the genomic level and at the cDNA level, of both the MCCA gene and the MCCB gene, encoding the MCC alpha and MCC beta subunits, respectively. The 19-exon MCCA gene maps to 3q25-27 and encodes a 725-residue protein with a biotin attachment site; the 17-exon MCCB gene maps to 5q12-q13 and encodes a 563-residue polypeptide. We show that disease-causing mutations can be classified into two complementation groups, denoted \"CGA\" and \"CGB.\" We detected two MCCA missense mutations in CGA patients, one of which leads to absence of biotinylated MCC alpha. Two MCCB missense mutations and one splicing defect mutation leading to early MCC beta truncation were found in CGB patients. A fourth MCCB mutation also leading to early MCC beta truncation was found in two nonclassified patients. A fungal model carrying an mccA null allele has been constructed and was used to demonstrate, in vivo, the involvement of MCC in leucine catabolism. These results establish that 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria results from loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of MCC and complete the genetic characterization of the four human biotin-dependent carboxylases.","dc:creator":"Gallardo ME","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"The molecular basis of 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria, a disorder of leucine catabolism."},"rdfs:label":"MCCC2 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9729a1bb-9f91-4778-b339-662419a8c19e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2419b9ec-e288-4dd5-a8d0-a632f62d6261","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"MCCC2 encodes the beta subunit of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, a biotin-dependent mitochondrial enzyme involved in the catabolism of leucine.

MCCC2 encodes the beta subunit of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, which is involved in the catabolism of leucine. Deficiency of MCCC2 is associated with increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovalerate & 3-methylcrotonylglycine, The clinical phenotype ranges from severe neurological abnormalities and death in infancy to asymptomatic. Variants in MCCC2 were ﬁrst reported in humans with this deﬁciency in 2001 (Gallardo et al., PMID: 11170888; Baumgartner et al., PMID: 11181649). At least 113 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, deletion) have been identiﬁed in humans (Cozzolino et al., 2018; PMID 29767664). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays, expression studies, and in vitro studies. In summary, MCCC2 is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3653ea30-b630-499a-a6f0-65152106ad8c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
