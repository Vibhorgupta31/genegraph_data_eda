We show that the BRCA1 BRCT domain directly interacts with phosphorylated BRCA1-Associated Carboxyl-terminal Helicase (BACH1). This specific interaction between BRCA1 and phosphorylated BACH1 is cell cycle regulated and is required for DNA damage-induced checkpoint control during the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. Further, we show that two other BRCT domains interact with their respective physiological partners in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thirteen additional BRCT domains also preferentially bind phospho-peptides rather than nonphosphorylated control peptides.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split the autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia complementation group J into separate curation due to phenotypic variability and different inheritance patterns. We also curated separately the autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer to refute the gene-disease relationship. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least six case-control or cohort studies at the aggregate variant level (12 points). Five case-control studies suggested significant increased risk for ovarian cancer in monoallelic *BRIP1* variant carriers compared to controls (PMIDs: 26315354, 26720728, 29368626, 32359370, 35172496). Another case-control study (PMID: 31341520) showed conflicting results, in which the authors found a significant association of pathogenic variants in *BRIP1* and ovarian cancer by analyzing crude data; whereas age-adjusted data showed no ovarian cancer association, which may reflect that *BRIP1* variant carriers are more likely to be diagnosed with late-onset ovarian cancer than non-carriers. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence of protein interaction assay and cell culture models (1.5 Points; PMIDs: 11301010, 14576433, 16153896). Pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the BRCT domain of BRCA1 protein directly interacts with phosphorylated BRIP1, which is further required for DNA damage-induced checkpoint control during the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. Cells deficient of *BRIP1* also failed to elicit homologous recombination after DNA double stranded breaks. In summary, *BRIP1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 10/12/2016. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 07/28/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b1224a6d-5676-4109-b844-a577bd0bff62"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
