U3S activity is essential in all organisms, and decreased activity in humans leads to the autosomal recessive disorder congenital erythropoetic porphyria. We have determined the crystal structure of recombinant human U3S at 1.85 A resolution. The protein folds into two alpha/beta domains connected by a beta-ladder. The active site appears to be located between the domains, and variations in relative domain positions observed between crystallographically independent molecules indicates the presence of flexibility that may be important in the catalytic cycle. Possible mechanisms of catalysis were probed by mutating each of the four invariant residues in the protein that have titratable side chains. Additionally, six other highly conserved and titratable side chains were also mutated. In no case, however, did one of these mutations abolish enzyme activity, suggesting that the mechanism does not require acid/base catalysis.","dc:creator":"Mathews MA","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Crystal structure of human uroporphyrinogen III synthase."},"rdfs:label":"Enzymatic Activity Assay for UROS & Crystal Structure"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9dbf60cb-25ae-44e1-b5aa-598146e63694_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2312a004-2ddc-498e-b1fc-bb3917a354e6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:18c4f565-3780-444f-9c75-395457c6d02a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This mouse model recapitulates the major phenotypes observed in humans which are cutaneous photosensitivity, porphyrin accumulation in tissues, an enlarged spleen, liver problems, etc. ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16314073","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a recessive autosomal disorder characterized by a deficiency in uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), the fourth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway.

An animal model of CEP has been designed to evaluate the feasibility of retroviral gene transfer in hematopoietic stem cells. We have previously demonstrated that the knockout of the Uros gene is lethal in mice (Uros(del) model). This work describes the achievement of a knock-in model, which reproduces a mutation of the UROS gene responsible for a severe UROS deficiency in humans (P248Q missense mutant). Homozygous mice display erythrodontia, moderate photosensitivity, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemolytic anemia. Uroporphyrin (99% type I isomer) accumulates in urine. Total porphyrins are increased in erythrocytes and feces, while Uros enzymatic activity is below 1% of the normal level in the different tissues analyzed.

The amount of residual activity expressed by each allele provided a basis to correlate genotype with disease severity, thereby permitting genotype/phenotype predictions in this clinically heterogeneous disease.","dc:creator":"Xu W","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: identification and expression of 10 mutations in the uroporphyrinogen III synthase gene."}},{"id":"cggv:467b8604-2cf4-415f-840a-0a2230443583_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d005f71a-9c7e-4756-a062-a029e2e18bdf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7860775"}],"rdfs:label":"19950201_Xu&Desnick_Proband18"},{"id":"cggv:4e4a067a-08ca-4c0e-a5d1-ab1ec88e7efe","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e4a067a-08ca-4c0e-a5d1-ab1ec88e7efe_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4e4a067a-08ca-4c0e-a5d1-ab1ec88e7efe_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expression of URO-Synthase variant in E. coli showed that enzyme activity was 1.2 % of mean normal level."}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:467b8604-2cf4-415f-840a-0a2230443583","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:467b8604-2cf4-415f-840a-0a2230443583_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:467b8604-2cf4-415f-840a-0a2230443583_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expression of URO-Synthase variant in E. coli showed that enzyme activity was 1.1 % of mean normal level."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:30416af2-cf29-4290-8ee7-1c6d8fff0173_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30416af2-cf29-4290-8ee7-1c6d8fff0173","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:4d1f7507-6691-48ef-8a41-d7ac96f6b180","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000375.3(UROS):c.683C>T (p.Thr228Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252866"}},{"id":"cggv:ef013f31-fcfe-45e3-92fb-c29e3d5fe761","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000375.3(UROS):c.217T>C (p.Cys73Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340118"}}],"detectionMethod":"\"Mutations in the first four coding exons of the URO-synthase gene of CEP patients were detected by SSCP as described (20), with modifications (21).\"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"Moderately severe phenotype","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:d65ddf5b-1ec9-49bf-9339-7d9712612bc8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4d1f7507-6691-48ef-8a41-d7ac96f6b180"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1737856","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), an inborn error of heme biosynthesis, results from the deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (URO-synthase). This autosomal recessive disorder is heterogeneous; patients with severe disease are often transfusion dependent, while milder patients primarily have cutaneous involvement. To investigate this phenotypic heterogeneity, exonic point mutations in the URO-synthase gene were identified in unrelated CEP patients. Four missense mutations were identified: (a) an A to G transition of nucleotide (nt) 184 that predicted a Thr to Ala substitution at residue 62 (designated T62A); (b) a C to T transition of nt 197 that encoded an Ala to Val replacement at residue 66 (A66V); (c) a T to C transition of nt 217 that predicted a Cys to Arg substitution at residue 73 (C73R); and (d) a C to T transition of nt 683 that resulted in a Thr to Met replacement at residue 228 (T228M). In addition, a G to A transition of nt 27 that did not change the encoded amino acid (A9A) was detected in an African patient. The T62A, C73R, and T228M alleles did not express detectable enzymatic activity, while the A66V allele expressed residual, but unstable activity. The C73R allele was present in eight of 21 unrelated CEP patients (21% of CEP alleles). In three patients, identification of both alleles permitted genotype-phenotype correlations; the A66V/C73R, T228M/C73R, and C73R/C73R genotypes had mild, moderately severe, and severe disease, respectively. These findings provide the first genotype-phenotype correlations and permit molecular heterozygote detection in this inherited porphyria.","dc:creator":"Warner CA","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: identification and expression of exonic mutations in the uroporphyrinogen III synthase gene."}},{"id":"cggv:a0a6cd60-9387-4a11-8b22-d02fdd97eaac_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ef013f31-fcfe-45e3-92fb-c29e3d5fe761"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1737856"}],"rdfs:label":"19920201_Warner&Desnick_Proband2"},{"id":"cggv:a0a6cd60-9387-4a11-8b22-d02fdd97eaac","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0a6cd60-9387-4a11-8b22-d02fdd97eaac_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a0a6cd60-9387-4a11-8b22-d02fdd97eaac_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The p.C73R enzyme has been shown to have markedly decreased enzymatic stability (<1% of wild-type) due to its unfolding, instability, and rapid degradation (PMID: 21570665) (PMID: 24925316)"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d65ddf5b-1ec9-49bf-9339-7d9712612bc8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d65ddf5b-1ec9-49bf-9339-7d9712612bc8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d65ddf5b-1ec9-49bf-9339-7d9712612bc8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant has <1% of normal activity when expressed in E. coli.

Three years post-BMT, the recipient had normal hemoglobin, markedly reduced urinary porphyrin excretion, and no cutaneous lesions with unlimited exposure to sunlight. The patient was homoallelic for a novel URO-synthase missense mutation, G188R, that expressed less than 5% of mean normal activity in Escherichia coli, consistent with her transfusion dependency.

It catalyzes the cyclization of the linear substrate hydroxymethylbilane into uroporphyrinogen III. When UROS activity is reduced, hydroxymethylbilane can spontaneously cyclize into uroporphyrinogen I isomers. Although these isomers, like uroporphyrinogen III, are substrates for the next enzyme in the pathway, UROD (Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), the products, coproporphyrinogen I isomers are not a substrate for the subsequent enzyme, CPOX (coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase), in heme synthesis. As a result, the non enzymatically produced uroporphyrinogen I isomers represent a dead end in the pathway (PMID: 19268002).\n\nUROS-related porphyria, like other porphyrias, shows phenotypic variability ranging from mild to severe, with the severity generally correlating with the degree of reduced enzymatic activity. But unlike the semidominant porphyria, PPOX-related variegate porphyria where severe symptoms present at <25% WT enzyme activity, autosomal recessive UROS-related porphyria must have homozygous or biallelic mutations that nearly abolish enzyme function <5% before severe disease manifests. Mutations causing this disease are found throughout the UROS exons and in the promoter region. A common severe presentation is caused by homozygosity for the p.C73R mutation, resulting in less than 1-2% enzymatic activity (PMID: 19268002). Affected individuals may present in utero with non-immune hydrops fetalis due to hemolytic anemia. If they survive infancy, they experience extreme photosensitivity, often leading to disfigurement from severe scarring. Hemolysis is common, and additional described symptoms include red-wine-colored urine, erythrodontia (red-brown-stained teeth), splenomegaly, scleromalacia, and chronic ulcerative keratitis. Biochemical phenotypes include elevated urinary porphyrins (particularly massive amounts of uroporphyrin I), fecal porphyrins, and plasma porphyrins. In the blood, erythrocytes show polychromasia, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, and basophilic stippling, along with an increase in reticulocytes and nucleated red blood cells. The only known cure for severe disease is bone marrow transplantation which is required as early as possible after birth, to improve chances of its effectiveness (PMID: 30594473, PMID: 31326287).\n\nFor biallelic heterozygotes if enzyme activity is <5%, severe disease often results, but for activity levels between 5-12% of WT mild to moderate disease occurs. Mild to moderate disease may have later onset and symptoms are usually cutaneous photosensitivity which often presents as bullous skin lesions, hypo- or hyperpigmentation of the affected skin, and recurrent skin infections (PMID: 19268002).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): 14 probands were scored with 15 unique variants (two splicing mutations, three promoter mutations and ten missense variants in exons). All of the variants scored have been characterized in *E. coli* for their relative enzymatic activity compared to WT.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (2.5 points): Biochemical characterization of the enzymatic reaction was scored (.5 pts). A knock-in mouse model for the P248Q missense mutation reproducing the phenotypes of erythrodontia, moderate photosensitivity, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemolytic anemia was scored at 2 points.\n\nIn summary, UROS has been definitively associated with autosomal recessive UROS-related porphyria.\n\nReplicated over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9dbf60cb-25ae-44e1-b5aa-598146e63694"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
