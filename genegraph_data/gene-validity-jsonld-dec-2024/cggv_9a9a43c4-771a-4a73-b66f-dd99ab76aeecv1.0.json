Early death occurs in most cases from anuria, pulmonary hypoplasia, and refractory arterial hypotension. The disease is linked to mutations in the genes encoding several components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): AGT (angiotensinogen), REN (renin), ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme), and AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor type 1). Here, we review the series of 54 distinct mutations identified in 48 unrelated families. Most of them are novel and ACE mutations are the most frequent, observed in two-thirds of families (64.6%). The severity of the clinical course was similar whatever the mutated gene, which underlines the importance of a functional RAS in the maintenance of blood pressure and renal blood flow during the life of a human fetus. Renal hypoperfusion, whether genetic or secondary to a variety of diseases, precludes the normal development/ differentiation of proximal tubules. The identification of the disease on the basis of precise clinical and histological analyses and the characterization of the genetic defects allow genetic counseling and early prenatal diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Gribouval O","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Spectrum of mutations in the renin-angiotensin system genes in autosomal recessive renal tubular dysgenesis."}},{"id":"cggv:f7916783-084e-4bf4-9d34-810287512b2d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9b5dafd9-5f65-42cf-a8ae-2da13013e656"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22095942"}],"rdfs:label":"P1"},{"id":"cggv:59701e81-742f-4e65-b2ea-79fda59b65f2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59701e81-742f-4e65-b2ea-79fda59b65f2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:59701e81-742f-4e65-b2ea-79fda59b65f2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The authors of the paper published “In silico” analysis of identified REN variants and immunohistochemical study of presence/absence renin RNA as well as renin protein in affected fetuses kidney.

During the systematic screening of mutations of the different genes of the renin-angiotensin system associated with RTD, two missense mutations in the renin gene were previously identified, the first affects one of the two catalytic aspartates (D38N) of renin, and the second, S69Y, is located upstream of the 'flap', a mobile β-hairpin structure which covers the substrate-binding site of renin. Here we report a novel renin mutation leading to the duplication of the tyrosine residue Y15dup, homologous to Y9 in some other aspartyl proteases, which seems to play a crucial role along the activation pathway. The biochemical and cellular mechanisms underlying renin inactivation were investigated. We expressed prorenin constructs harboring the identified point mutations in two established cell lines, able (AtT-20 cells) or unable (CHO cells) to process prorenin to renin and we evaluated the cellular localization of renin mutants and their functional properties. All three mutants were misfolded to different levels, were enzymatically inactive and exhibited abnormal intracellular trafficking. We suggest a misfolding of Y15dup renin, a partial misfolding of D38N prorenin and a misfolding of S69Y prorenin leading to complete absence of secretion. The structural consequences of the renin mutations were estimated by molecular modeling, which suggested some important structural alterations.

To illuminate the importance of renin in the context of a disease background in vivo, we used zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to target the renin gene and create a renin knockout in the SS/JrHsdMcwi (SS) rat. ZFN against renin caused a 10-bp deletion in exon 5, resulting in a frameshift mutation. Plasma renin activity was undetectable in the Ren-/- rat, and renin protein was absent from the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. Body weight was lower in the Ren-/- rats (than in the Ren+/- or wild-type littermates), and conscious BP on low-salt diet (0.4% NaCl) was 58 ± 2 mm Hg in the Ren-/- male rats versus 117 mm Hg in the Ren+/- littermates, a reduction of almost 50 mm Hg. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine levels were elevated in the Ren-/- strain (BUN 112 ± 7 versus 23 ± 2 mg/dL and creatinine 0.53 ± 0.02 versus 0.26 ± 0.02 mg/dL), and kidney morphology was abnormal with a rudimentary inner renal medulla, cortical interstitial fibrosis, thickening of arterial walls, and abnormally shaped glomeruli.

RTD is characterized by prenatal development with hypoperfusion during fetal development leading to abnormal kidney development, persistent anuria, persistent oligohydramnios that leads to the Potter sequence (clubbed feet, pulmonary hypoplasia and cranial anomalies), skull ossification defects and perinatal death. The histopathological hallmark of the disease is absence or poor development of proximal tubules and glomeruli. Approximately 20% of RTD cases are caused by either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in REN. Other known cases of RTD are associated with biallelic mutations in genes encoding other components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS, e.g. angiotensin and angiotensin converting enzyme). The REN gene is associated with two disease entities by different inheritance patterns and molecular mechanisms, as well as different clinical findings including: (1) renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD-REN; OMIM: 267430) and (2) autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD-REN; OMIM: 613092). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these two disease entities have been curated separately.\n\nVariants in the REN gene have been reported in at least 20 individuals (PMIDs: 16116425, 22095942, 17443344, 27994858). Homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in this gene segregated with the disease. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is loss of function. Biallelic nonsense, frameshift or splice site mutations in REN result in undetectable expression of renin RNA or protein in kidney sections (PMID: 16116425; PMID: 22095942). Conversely, biallelic non-truncating mutations or missense mutations of the active site altered renin trafficking and sorting resulting in marked kidney accumulation of defective renin with a dramatically low level of plasma active renin (PMID: 22095942). Aberrant function of renin (as well as other RAS components) affects nephron development and causes the RTD phenotype.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by immunohistochemical studies of renin in kidney biopsies of affected individuals, determination of active renin in plasma, experimental cellular models and a knockout rat model (PMID: 21036942; PMID: 21242461). \nIn summary, there is DEFINITIVE evidence to support the relationship between REN and autosomal recessive renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 10/28/2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9a9a43c4-771a-4a73-b66f-dd99ab76aeec"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
