In this study, we used single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to screen two large and nine small LQTS families for mutations of the KVLQT1 potassium channel gene. We identified a novel missense mutation in two unrelated families which substitutes a serine for a conserved glycine in the putative pore region of the KVLQT1 channel. In a third family, a new alanine to valine mutation at a CpG dinucleotide resulted in the spontaneous occurrence of the long QT syndrome in monozygotic twin offspring of unaffected parents. Mutations at this same nucleotide have been observed in eight of the 19 LQTS families determined to have KVLQT1 mutations, suggesting this is a mutational hot spot. Both of these mutations alter the amino acid sequence in, or adjacent to, the pore of the channel and many diminish the channel's ability to conduct a repolarizing potassium current. To date, all KVLQT1 mutations determined to cause the LQTS are missense mutations.

LQTS can occur either as an autosomal dominant (Romano Ward) or as an autosomal recessive disorder (Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome). Mutations in at least five genes have been associated with the LQTS. Four genes, encoding cardiac ion channels, have been identified. The most common forms of LQTS are due to mutations in the potassium-channel genes KCNQ1 and HERG. We have screened 24 Dutch LQTS families for mutations in KCNQ1 and HERG. Fourteen missense mutations were identified. Eight of these missense mutations were novel: three in KCNQ1 and five in HERG. Novel missense mutations in KCNQ1 were Y184S, S373P, and W392R and novel missense mutations in HERG were A558P, R582C, G604S, T613M, and F640L. The KCNQ1 mutation G189R and the HERG mutation R582C were detected in two families. The pathogenicity of the mutations was based on segregation in families, absence in control individuals, the nature of the amino acid substitution, and localization in the protein.

Surface channel expression was studied using a proteinase K assay for KCNQ1 D202H/N, I204F/M, V205M, S209F, and V215M coexpressed with KCNE1 in mammalian cells. In each case, the majority of synthesized channel was found at the surface, but mutant I(Ks) current density at +100 mV was reduced significantly for S209F, which showed approximately 75% reduction over wild type (WT). All mutants except S209F showed positively shifted V(1/2)'s of activation and slowed channel activation compared with WT (V(1/2) = +17.7 +/- 2.4 mV and tau(activation) of 729 ms at +20 mV; n = 18). Deactivation was also accelerated in all mutants versus WT (126 +/- 8 ms at -50 mV; n = 27), and these changes led to marked loss of repolarizing currents during action potential clamps at 2 and 4 Hz, except again S209F. KCNQ1 models localize these naturally occurring S3 mutants to the surface of the helices facing the other voltage sensor transmembrane domains and highlight inter-residue interactions involved in activation gating. V207M, currently classified as a polymorphism and facing lipid in the model, was indistinguishable from WT I(Ks). We conclude that S3 mutants of KCNQ1 cause LQTS predominantly through biophysical effects on the gating of I(Ks), but some mutants also show protein stability/trafficking defects, which explains why the kinetic gain-of-function mutation S209F causes LQT1.","dc:creator":"Eldstrom J","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mechanistic basis for LQT1 caused by S3 mutations in the KCNQ1 subunit of IKs."},"rdfs:label":"S3 mutations and channel function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:dff8874e-98a1-472b-9cc2-3f441b1c1064_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7febfffc-c232-421b-a664-e9f7e79c0afd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0547f09-0c2a-47dc-ad57-54270f1f19fa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"A340E\n- heterozygotes demonstrated prolonged QT, prolonged QTc and prolonged JT intervals similar to humans RWS\n- homozygotes demonstrated more profound effects on the above parameters\n\nA340V - showed no prolonged QT in homozygous or heterzygous mice\nT311I\n- heterozygotes showed prolonged QT intervals\n- homozygotes had prevalent cardiac phenotype and mimics JLNS","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15498462","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Inherited long QT syndrome is most frequently associated with mutations in KCNQ1, which encodes the primary subunit of a potassium channel.

Targeted disruption of mouse Kcnq1 models JLNS in that mice are deaf and show abnormal ECGs. However, the phenotype is broader than that seen in patients. Most dramatically, the inner ear defects result in a severe hyperactivity/circling behavior, which may influence cardiac function. To understand the etiology of the cardiac phenotype in these mice and to generate a potentially more useful model system, we generated new mouse lines by introducing point mutations associated with RWS. The A340E line phenocopies RWS: the repolarization phenotype is inherited in a dominant manner and is observed independent of any inner ear defect.

Among genotyped individuals, mutations in genes encoding repolarizing K+ channels (LQT1:KCNQ1; LQT2:KCNH2) are present in approximately 90% of affected individuals. Expression of pore mutants of the human genes KCNQ1 (KvLQT1-Y315S) and KCNH2 (HERG-G628S) in the rabbit heart produced transgenic rabbits with a long QT phenotype. Prolongations of QT intervals and action potential durations were due to the elimination of IKs and IKr currents in cardiomyocytes. LQT2 rabbits showed a high incidence of spontaneous sudden cardiac death (>50% at 1 year) due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Optical mapping revealed increased spatial dispersion of repolarization underlying the arrhythmias. Both transgenes caused downregulation of the remaining complementary IKr and IKs without affecting the steady state levels of the native polypeptides. Thus, the elimination of 1 repolarizing current was associated with downregulation of the reciprocal repolarizing current rather than with the compensatory upregulation observed previously in LQTS mouse models. This suggests that mutant KvLQT1 and HERG interacted with the reciprocal wild-type alpha subunits of rabbit ERG and KvLQT1, respectively. These results have implications for understanding the nature and heterogeneity of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.","dc:creator":"Brunner M","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death in transgenic rabbits with long QT syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Rabbit Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1833,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5a36a6ae-9225-477e-ad73-bd77aa4f1be0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0002442","gene":"hgnc:6294","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.3","dc:description":"KCNQ1 encodes the alpha subunit of the slowly activating delayed rectifier cardiac potassium channel (Iks).
