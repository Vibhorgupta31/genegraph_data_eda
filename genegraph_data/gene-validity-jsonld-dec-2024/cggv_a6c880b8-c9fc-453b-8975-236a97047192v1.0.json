We found that glycosylation-deficient patient fibroblasts have less intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and because of its role in innate immune response, we hypothesized that its reduction might help explain recurrent infections in CDG patients. We, therefore, studied mice with mutations in Mpi encoding phosphomannose isomerase (Fru-6-P → Man-6-P), the cause of human MPI-CDG. We challenged MPI-deficient mice with an intraperitoneal injection of zymosan to induce an inflammatory response and found decreased neutrophil extravasation compared with control mice. Immunohistochemistry of mesenteries showed attenuated neutrophil egress, presumably due to poor ICAM-1 response to acute peritonitis. Since phosphomannose isomerase (MPI)-CDG patients and their cells improve glycosylation when given mannose, we provided MPI-deficient mice with mannose-supplemented water for 7 days. This restored ICAM-1 expression on mesenteric endothelial cells and enhanced transendothelial migration of neutrophils during acute inflammation.

Despite the well-characterized biochemical consequences in these individuals, the underlying cellular defects that contribute to CDG are not well understood. Synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), which serves as the sugar donor for the N-glycosylation of secretory proteins, requires conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate via the phosphomannose isomerase (MPI) enzyme. Individuals who are deficient in MPI present with bleeding, diarrhea, edema, gastrointestinal bleeding and liver fibrosis. MPI-CDG patients can be treated with oral mannose supplements, which is converted to mannose-6-phosphate through a minor complementary metabolic pathway, restoring protein glycosylation and ameliorating most symptoms, although liver disease continues to progress. Because Mpi deletion in mice causes early embryonic lethality and thus is difficult to study, we used zebrafish to establish a model of MPI-CDG. We used a morpholino to block mpi mRNA translation and established a concentration that consistently yielded 13% residual Mpi enzyme activity at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf), which is within the range of MPI activity detected in fibroblasts from MPI-CDG patients. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis detected decreased LLO and N-glycans in mpi morphants. These deficiencies resulted in 50% embryonic lethality by 4 dpf. Multi-systemic abnormalities, including small eyes, dysmorphic jaws, pericardial edema, a small liver and curled tails, occurred in 82% of the surviving larvae. Importantly, these phenotypes could be rescued with mannose supplementation. Thus, parallel processes in fish and humans contribute to the phenotypes caused by Mpi depletion. Interestingly, mannose was only effective if provided prior to 24 hpf. These data provide insight into treatment efficacy and the broader molecular and developmental abnormalities that contribute to disorders associated with defective protein glycosylation.","dc:creator":"Chu J","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A zebrafish model of congenital disorders of glycosylation with phosphomannose isomerase deficiency reveals an early opportunity for corrective mannose supplementation."},"rdfs:label":"Chu 2013 Zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:a6c880b8-c9fc-453b-8975-236a97047192_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3dde1eb-170e-42e8-85c6-19a654b88681_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3dde1eb-170e-42e8-85c6-19a654b88681","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:143b5f3e-7b2d-4ca1-be2c-f28c9871798f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000015.10:g.74896324_74896326del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA619413160"}},{"id":"cggv:77b978b4-7ab9-4b85-8dd8-c4e982d1cdc2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002435.3(MPI):c.466G>A (p.Glu156Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA393173678"}}],"phenotypeFreeText":"PMI activity in leukocytes was 1.2 U/g (ref >5.5), abnormal CDG-I glycosylation pattern of serum glycoproteins.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002014","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001943"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:92d2413c-fe7d-442d-bf24-e9c0e8f6b6ae_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:143b5f3e-7b2d-4ca1-be2c-f28c9871798f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33098580","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mannose phosphate isomerase MPI-CDG (formerly CDG-1b) is a potentially fatal inherited metabolic disease which is readily treatable with oral D-mannose.

The combination of symptoms was suggestive of the recently characterized congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib (CDG-Ib), which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phosphomannose isomerase (PMI). An abnormal serum transferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF) pattern and a reduced PMI activity confirmed the diagnosis of CDG-Ib. Furthermore, mutational analysis of the MPI gene revealed two missense mutations, 419 T --> C (I140T) and 636 G --> A (R219Q), a single base substitution in intron 5, 670 + 9G --> A, as well as a polymorphism 1131A --> C (V377V) in both sibs. The surviving 33-year-old sib has had no further symptoms following childhood. Short-term low-dose oral mannose supplementation improved her transferrin IEF pattern and normalized her antithrombin III activity, further substantiating the beneficial effect of mannose in CDG-Ib. When her mannose blood level was measured, she showed a lower steady-state level but a faster mannose clearance rate. These results suggest that the clinical manifestations of PMI deficiency, although serious in childhood, can improve with age, even without mannose therapy, and allow for a normal adult life. However, the long-term prognosis may vary from patient to patient.","dc:creator":"Westphal V","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Genetic and metabolic analysis of the first adult with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib: long-term outcome and effects of mannose supplementation."}},{"id":"cggv:1878fb83-0020-4960-b16d-3861d6ba3bcd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:88de57ce-de4b-4f12-b671-d38f2c0f2285"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11350186"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:1878fb83-0020-4960-b16d-3861d6ba3bcd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1878fb83-0020-4960-b16d-3861d6ba3bcd_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1878fb83-0020-4960-b16d-3861d6ba3bcd_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expression of the variant in COS-7 cells showed significantly reduced enzymatic activity compared to wt (Table IV).

CDG-Ib is caused by a deficiency of mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (synonym: phosphomannose isomerase, EC 5.3.1.8), due to mutations in the MPI gene. We determined the genomic structure of the MPI gene in order to simplify mutation detection. The gene is composed of 8 exons and spans only 5 kb. Eight (7 novel) different mutations were found in seven patients with a confirmed phosphomannose isomerase deficiency, analyzed in the context of this study: six missense mutations, a splice mutation and one insertion. In the last, the mutation resulted in an unstable transcript, and was hardly detectable at the mRNA level.

Fourteen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site) that have been reported in 10 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs 9525984, 10980531, 9585601, 11350186, 17945525, 33204592, 33098580) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Patients have a range of symptoms, including protein losing enteropathy, gastrointestinal involvement, hepatomegaly, hepatic fibrosis, and hypoglycemia. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of MPI, which converts fructose-6-phosphate into mannose-6-phosphate, providing the necessary mannose-6-phosphate for glycosylation (PMID 9525984). Animal models deficient in MPI, including mouse and zebrafish, have defects in N-glycosylation consistent with patients with MPI-CDG (PMIDs 22899857, 24474243). In vitro assays in patient cells also support an N-glycosylation defect (PMID 22496445). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between MPI and autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 20, 2023 (SOP version 10). Additional contributions to this curation were made by UNC Biocuration Core and Counsyl.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a6c880b8-c9fc-453b-8975-236a97047192"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
