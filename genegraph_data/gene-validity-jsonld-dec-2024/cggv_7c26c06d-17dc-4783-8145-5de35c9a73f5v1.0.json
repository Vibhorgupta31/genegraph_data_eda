To understand the precise role of Ndufaf2 in Complex-1 function and its links to neurologic disease, we studied the effects on Complex-1 assembly and function, as well as pathological consequences at the cellular level, in multiple in vitro models of Ndufaf2 deficiency. Using both Ndufaf2-deficient human neuroblastoma cells and primary fibroblasts cultured from Ndufaf2 knock-out mice we found that Ndufaf2-deficiency selectively reduces Complex-1 activity. While Ndufaf2 is traditionally referred to as an assembly factor of Complex-1, surprisingly, however, Ndufaf2-deficient cells were able to assemble a fully mature Complex-1 enzyme, albeit with reduced kinetics. Importantly, no evidence of intermediate or incomplete assembly was observed. Ndufaf2 deficiency resulted in significant increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA deletion, consistent with contemporary hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of inherited mutations in Complex-1 disorders. These data suggest that Ndufaf2, unlike other Complex-1 assembly factors, may be more accurately described as a chaperone involved in proper folding during Complex-1 assembly, since it is dispensable for Complex-1 maturation but not its proper function.

The NDUFAF2 gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor 2. Defects of this protein lead to a complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFAF2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2005 (PMID: 16200211). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants identified in seven cases from five publications (PMIDs: 16200211, 18180188, 19384974, 20571988, 20818383). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, and cell culture models (PMIDs: 27977873, 16200211, 25613900, 23702311). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 20, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7c26c06d-17dc-4783-8145-5de35c9a73f5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
