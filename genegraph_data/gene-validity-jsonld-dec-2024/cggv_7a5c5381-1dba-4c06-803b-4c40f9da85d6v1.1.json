Here we report that human DPM synthase consists of three subunits. The third subunit, DPM3, comprises 92 amino acids associated with DPM1 via its C-terminal domain and with DPM2 via its N-terminal portion. The stability of DPM3 was dependent upon DPM2. However, overexpression of DPM3 in Lec15 cells, a null mutant of DPM2, restored the biosynthesis of DPM with an increase in DPM1, indicating that DPM3 directly stabilized DPM1. Therefore, DPM2 stabilizes DPM3 and DPM3 stabilizes DPM1. DPM synthase activity was 10 times higher in the presence of DPM2, indicating that DPM2 also plays a role in the enzymatic reaction.

The three zebrafish ortholog subunits (encoded by the dpm1, dpm2 and dpm3 genes, respectively) showed high similarity to the human proteins, and their expression displayed localization in the midbrain/hindbrain area and somites. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting each subunit were used to transiently deplete the dpm genes. The resulting morphant embryos showed early death, muscle disorganization, low DPMS complex activity, and increased levels of apoptotic nuclei, together with hypoglycosylated α-DG in muscle fibers, thus recapitulating most of the characteristics seen in patients with mutations in DPMS.

Patients have a range of symptoms, including acquired microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, respiratory distress, congenital contractures, scoliosis, hypotonia, and lack of psychomotor development. The disease mechanism is thought to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by DPM2's interaction with DPM1 and DPM3, the other members of the DPM synthase complex, as well as an animal model (PMID: 27291147). Co-transfection and immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that DPM2 is the regulatory subunit of this complex (PMIDs: 9724629, 10835346).
