Fluorescence staining detected abnormal morphology of mitochondria and peroxisomes in fibroblasts from the patient; a strong reduction in MFF protein levels and the presence of truncated forms were observed. No biochemical alterations denoting peroxisomal disorders were found. As reported in other disorders affecting the dynamics of intracellular organelles, our patient showed clinical features suggesting both mitochondrial and peroxisomal impairment.

Here, we describe a novel protein that controls mitochondrial fission. This protein was identified in a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen using Drosophila cells. The human homologue of this protein was named Mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). Mitochondria of cells transfected with Mff siRNA form a closed network similar to the mitochondrial networks formed when cells are transfected with siRNA for two established fission proteins, Drp1 and Fis1. Like Drp1 and Fis1 siRNA, Mff siRNA also inhibits fission induced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, it delays cytochrome c release from mitochondria and further progression of apoptosis, and it inhibits peroxisomal fission. Mff and Fis1 are both tail anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane, but other parts of these proteins are very different and they exist in separate 200-kDa complexes, suggesting that they play different roles in the fission process. We conclude that Mff is a novel component of a conserved membrane fission pathway used for constitutive and induced fission of mitochondria and peroxisomes.","dc:creator":"Gandre-Babbe S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The novel tail-anchored membrane protein Mff controls mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission in mammalian cells."},"rdfs:label":"MFF function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:021d15d7-dbf0-4b71-bbb5-48dc4a4b5ee6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f8c79d2c-470d-4616-bf53-e37dd1b09ed0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:741e393e-6560-436d-9e09-aaf23f90be98","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblasts from all MFF-deficient patients showed highly elongated peroxisomes (>30 μm) whereas in controls peroxisomes showed a punctate staining pattern typical for human fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Authors transfected MFF-deficient fibroblasts with Myc-MFF using microporation, which resulted in MFF being observed to localize in spots on elongated peroxisomes (and elongated mitochondria) supporting a role in the assembly of the division machinery and the formation of division sites. Many MFF-expressing cells showed short, dividing peroxisomes or fully divided, spherical peroxisomes. The highly elongated peroxisomes in MFF-deficient cells may be subject to autophagic processes and capable of being degraded. No notable abnormalities were found in all three MFF-deficient cell lines relating to the metabolism of VLCFAs or branched-chain fatty acids in peroxisomes.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32224193","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Peroxisomes are highly dynamic subcellular compartments with important functions in lipid and ROS metabolism. Impaired peroxisomal function can lead to severe metabolic disorders with developmental defects and neurological abnormalities. Recently, a new group of disorders has been identified, characterised by defects in the membrane dynamics and division of peroxisomes rather than by loss of metabolic functions. However, the contribution of impaired peroxisome plasticity to the pathophysiology of those disorders is not well understood. Mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) is a key component of both the peroxisomal and mitochondrial division machinery. Patients with MFF deficiency present with developmental and neurological abnormalities. Peroxisomes (and mitochondria) in patient fibroblasts are highly elongated as a result of impaired organelle division. The majority of studies into MFF-deficiency have focused on mitochondrial dysfunction, but the contribution of peroxisomal alterations to the pathophysiology is largely unknown. Here, we show that MFF deficiency does not cause alterations to overall peroxisomal biochemical function. However, loss of MFF results in reduced import-competency of the peroxisomal compartment and leads to the accumulation of pre-peroxisomal membrane structures. We show that peroxisomes in MFF-deficient cells display alterations in peroxisomal redox state and intra-peroxisomal pH. Removal of elongated peroxisomes through induction of autophagic processes is not impaired. A mathematical model describing key processes involved in peroxisome dynamics sheds further light into the physical processes disturbed in MFF-deficient cells. The consequences of our findings for the pathophysiology of MFF-deficiency and related disorders with impaired peroxisome plasticity are discussed.","dc:creator":"Passmore JB","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) is a critical regulator of peroxisome maturation."},"rdfs:label":"Peroxisomal elongation in MFF-deficient fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The evidence suggests that MFF plays a role in peroxisomal and mitochondrial fission."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:021d15d7-dbf0-4b71-bbb5-48dc4a4b5ee6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a3be9a4-396a-45bc-81ed-25a0fa8d045a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11d91687-ec38-40d9-8abb-e947c4dbf3ef","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Reintroduction of MFF resulted in formation of numerous spherical peroxisomes, restoring the normal phenotype","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28108524","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Peroxisomes (POs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cooperate in cellular lipid metabolism and form tight structural associations, which were first observed in ultrastructural studies decades ago. PO-ER associations have been suggested to impact on a diverse number of physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, phospholipid exchange, metabolite transport, signaling, and PO biogenesis. Despite their fundamental importance to cell metabolism, the mechanisms by which regions of the ER become tethered to POs are unknown, in particular in mammalian cells. Here, we identify the PO membrane protein acyl-coenzyme A-binding domain protein 5 (ACBD5) as a binding partner for the resident ER protein vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB). We show that ACBD5-VAPB interaction regulates PO-ER associations. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PO-ER association perturbs PO membrane expansion and increases PO movement. Our findings reveal the first molecular mechanism for establishing PO-ER associations in mammalian cells and report a new function for ACBD5 in PO-ER tethering.","dc:creator":"Costello JL","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"ACBD5 and VAPB mediate membrane associations between peroxisomes and the ER."},"rdfs:label":"Restoration of peroxisome morphology "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":9449,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":9.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:fe6688d2-7022-44ff-8922-f2e75456f99c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0054865","gene":"hgnc:24858","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"3.0","dc:description":"*MFF* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive  encephalopathy due to peroxisomal and mitochondrial fission defect in 2012 (Shamseldin et al., PMID: 22499341).

Summary of case-level and experimental data: 9.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22499341, 30581454, 26783368, 32181496). This gene disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays (PMID: 18353969, 22499341, 28108524, 32224193). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
