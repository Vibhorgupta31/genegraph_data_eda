OFCD is an X-linked dominant syndrome caused by a variety of BCOR null mutations. As it manifests only in females, it is presumed to be lethal in males. The severe male X-linked recessive microphthalmia syndrome ('Lenz') usually includes developmental delay in addition to the eye findings and is caused by hypomorphic BCOR variants, mainly by a specific missense variant c.254C > T, p.(Pro85Leu). Here, we detail 16 new cases (11 females with 4 additional, genetically confirmed, affected female relatives; 5 male cases each with unaffected carrier mothers). We describe new variants and broaden the phenotypic description for OFCD to include neuropathy, muscle hypotonia, pituitary underdevelopment, brain atrophy, lipoma and the first description of childhood lymphoma in an OFCD case. Our male X-linked recessive cases show significant new phenotypes: developmental delay (without eye anomalies) in two affected half-brothers with a novel BCOR variant, and one male with high myopia, megalophthalmos, posterior embryotoxon, developmental delay, and heart and bony anomalies with a previously undescribed BCOR splice site variant. Our female OFCD cases and their affected female relatives showed variable features, but consistently had early onset cataracts. We show that a mosaic carrier mother manifested early cataract and dental anomalies. All female carriers of the male X-linked recessive cases for whom genetic confirmation was available showed skewed X-inactivation and were unaffected. In view of the extended phenotype, we suggest a new term of X-linked BCOR-related syndrome.","dc:creator":"Ragge N","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Expanding the phenotype of the X-linked BCOR microphthalmia syndromes."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29974297","rdfs:label":"Case 9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This is a recurrent missense variant found in at least 7 affected males; relevant publications are: 15004558: Ng et al.

Female OFCD patients suffer from severe ocular, craniofacial, cardiac, and digital developmental defects and males do not survive through gestation. BCOR can mediate transcriptional repression by the oncoprotein BCL6 and has the ability to reduce transcriptional activation by AF9, a known mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion partner. The essential role of BCOR in development and its ability to modulate activity of known oncogenic proteins prompted us to determine the expression profile of Bcor during mouse development. Identification of independently transcribed exons in the 5' untranslated region of Bcor suggests that three independent promoters control the expression of Bcor in mice. Although Bcor is widely expressed in adult mouse tissues, analysis of known spliced isoforms in the coding region of Bcor reveals differential isoform usage.

To model OFCD (female phenotype), they generated heterozygous Bcor +/DE9-10 females by breeding females carrying the ubiquitous Cre transgene b-actin-Cre to Bcor Fl/Y males (Fig. 1F, left). This cross generates experimental female Bcor +/DE9-10 (“OFCD animals”). ~50% of female OFCD mice die between birth and weaning, likely due to cleft palate and/or cardiac defects. \n\"OFCD\" female mice: Eye phenotype - Fifty-five percent (23/42) of OFCD animals had lens opacification, and in these animals 8/23 were affected bilaterally while none of the 28 control animals had lens opacification (Fig. 2A). On average the width of all OFCD globes was 0.2 mm less than that of controls (Fig. 2B). In addition, there was pronounced bilateral asymmetry of the globe width in the OFCD animals (Fig. 2C). Facial features - OFCD mice snouts were occasionally broader or asymmetric (Fig. 1I, middle and Fig. 2 E, F). Bcor is expressed in the eyelid progenitor cells and often the eyelids of OFCD animals appeared ptotic and/or swollen and more prone to closure, which, together with the microphthalmia, was the most common recognizable facial feature (Fig. 2 E, F).

Heterozygous mutations of BCOR in females cause the X-linked developmental disorder Oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (OFCD), and hemizygous mutations of BCOR in males cause gestational lethality. BCOR associates with Polycomb group proteins to form one subfamily of the diverse Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) complexes, designated PRC1.1. Currently there is limited understanding of differing developmental roles of the various PRC1 complexes. We therefore generated a conditional exon 9-10 knockout Bcor allele and a transgenic conditional Bcor expression allele and used these to define multiple roles of Bcor, and by implication PRC1.1, in mouse development. Females heterozygous for Bcor exhibiting mosaic expression due to the X-linkage of the gene showed reduced postnatal viability and had OFCD-like defects. By contrast, Bcor hemizygosity in the entire male embryo resulted in embryonic lethality by E9.5. We further dissected the roles of Bcor, focusing on some of the tissues affected in OFCD through use of cell type specific Cre alleles.

The BCOR gene was first reported in relation to X-linked oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes in 2004 (Ng et al., PMID 15004558). Evidence supporting these gene-disease relationships includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least nine probands in three publications (Hilton et al., 2009 PMID 19367324; Kraus et al., 2018 PMID 30450806; Ragge et al., 2019 PMID 29974297). At least seven unique variants have been reported in humans, including six predicted null variants in female patients and one recurrent missense variant in male patients. De novo occurrence and inheritance from an affected mother have been reported in females, while male patients typically inherit the missense variant from unaffected mothers. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for BCOR-related syndromic microphthalmia is not completely understood; however, loss of function and haploinsufficiency appear to play an important role. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression in relevant tissues during embryogenesis, and data from a non-human model organisms, including zebrafish and Xenopus knockdown models and a conditional knockout mouse model (Ng et al., 2004 PMID 15004558; Wamstad & Bardwell, 2007 PMID 17344103; Hilton et al., 2007 PMID 17517692; Hamline et al., 2020 PMID 32692983). In summary, BCOR is definitively associated with X-linked syndromic microphthalmia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nLumping and Splitting: Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no clear difference in the phenotypic variability or molecular mechanism(s) underlying the disease entities: oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (MONDO:0017125) and Lenz-type microphthalmia (MONDO:0018924). There is phenotypic variability seen in both male and female patients, and the body systems affected are similar in males and females and include ocular, cardiac, and skeletal defects, developmental delays and some facial dysmorphisms (Ragge et al., 2019 PMID 29974297). Although null variants cause the disease in females, while missense variants appear to be causative in males, it is suggested that the underlying mechanism is LoF with less severe effect of missense variants and male lethality with null variants (Ng et al., 2004 PMID 15004558; Ragge et al., 2019 PMID 29974297). Male lethality was recently confirmed in a knockout mouse line (Hamline et al., 2020 PMID 32692983).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3da06b77-1ed0-4197-948c-a9bbf80b6ed4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
