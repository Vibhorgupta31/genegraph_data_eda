Here, we report two siblings with ACOX1 deficiency born to non-consanguineous Japanese parents. They showed mild global developmental delay from infancy and began to regress at 5 years 10 months and 5 years 6 months of age respectively. They gradually manifested with cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, pyramidal signs, and dysphasia. Brain MRI revealed T2 high-intensity areas in the cerebellar white matter, bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, and transverse tracts of the pons, followed by progressive atrophy of these areas. Intriguingly, the ratios of C24:0, C25:0, and C26:0 to C22:0 in plasma, which usually increase in ACOX1 deficiency were within normal ranges in both patients. On the other hand, whole exome sequencing revealed novel compound heterozygous variants in ACOX1: a frameshift variant (c.160delC:p.Leu54Serfs*18) and a missense variant (c.1259 T > C:p.Phe420Ser). The plasma concentration of individual very long chain fatty acids (C24:0, C25:0, and C26:0) was elevated, and we found that peroxisomes in fibroblasts of the patients were larger in size and fewer in number as previously reported in patients with ACOX1 deficiency. Furthermore, the C24:0 β-oxidation activity was dramatically reduced. Our findings suggest that the elevation of individual plasma very long chain fatty acids concentration, genetic analysis including whole exome analysis, and biochemical studies on the patient's fibroblasts should be considered for the correct diagnosis of ACOX1 deficiency.","dc:creator":"Morita A","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Novel ACOX1 mutations in two siblings with peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:32aa0ebf-0489-47f1-ae5e-8a9b3c6869ff_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4633b1fa-0dfd-4e50-b92b-8bd9f92defff"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33234382"}],"rdfs:label":"Morita_Proband"},{"id":"cggv:cb747e54-3c77-468e-ad6f-1671dc1d2a6b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb747e54-3c77-468e-ad6f-1671dc1d2a6b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The proband and her similarly affected brother were compound heterozygous, confirmed in trans, for a frameshift variant, Leu54SerfsTer18, and a missense variant, Phe420Ser.

acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) oxidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation due to a deficiency of straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (SCOX). The biochemical hallmark of this disorder is the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids. Although some case reports and small series of patients have been published, a comprehensive overview of the clinical, biochemical, and mutational spectrum of this disorder is still lacking. For this reason, we report clinical information for a cohort of 22 patients with peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency and the results from biochemical and mutation analyses in fibroblasts of the patients. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation was observed. An intriguing mutation in the alternatively-spliced transcript encoding the isoform SCOX-exon 3II in a patient with normal expression of the transcript encoding the isoform SCOX-exon 3I, prompted us to characterize these two isoforms of human SCOX. The recombinant SCOX-exon 3I displayed activity toward medium-chain fatty acyl-CoAs and was not active with very long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. In contrast, recombinant SCOX-exon 3II was capable of oxidizing a broad range of substrates, including very long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. These results explain why this patient with a mutation in exon 3II of the ACOX1 gene, but with normal expression of exon 3I, was indistinguishable from other patients with peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency with respect to his clinical presentation and the biochemical abnormalities in his fibroblasts.","dc:creator":"Ferdinandusse S","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Clinical, biochemical, and mutational spectrum of peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:4be46eaa-6028-4f62-9ef4-e4b35f14f2df","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4be46eaa-6028-4f62-9ef4-e4b35f14f2df_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Score reduced due to lack of variant evidence located in loop shown to interact with cofactor FAD predicted to result in reduced enzymatic activity;

adrenoleukodystrophy (P-NALD) is characterized by the acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1) deficiency, which leads to the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and inflammatory demyelination. However, the components of this inflammatory process in P-NALD remain elusive. In this study, we used transcriptomic profiling and PCR array analyses to explore inflammatory gene expression in patient fibroblasts. Our results show the activation of IL-1 inflammatory pathway accompanied by the increased secretion of two IL-1 target genes, IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines. Human fibroblasts exposed to very-long-chain fatty acids exhibited increased mRNA expression of IL-1α and IL-1β cytokines. Furthermore, expression of IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines in patient fibroblasts was down-regulated by MAPK, p38MAPK, and Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitors. Thus, the absence of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 activity in P-NALD fibroblasts triggers an inflammatory process, in which the IL-1 pathway seems to be central. The use of specific kinase inhibitors may permit the modulation of the enhanced inflammatory status.","dc:creator":"El Hajj HI","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"The inflammatory response in acyl-CoA oxidase 1 deficiency (pseudoneonatal adrenoleukodystrophy)."},"rdfs:label":"Inflammatory Response"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:96026ae4-050d-4eb5-849c-178c703a556e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b45ee48b-ec8b-443c-b10b-cf1ed3746ee2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ea0bd39-d167-4d80-a440-80974b51e424","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Homozygous dACOX1-ywg mutants die as pupae, while ~10% of dACOX1-T2A eclose as adults Semi-lethality was observed in dACOX1T2A/dACOX1ywg flies.

The biologic role of peroxisomal beta-oxidation system, which consists of three enzymes: fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD), and thiolase, has been examined in mice by disrupting ACOX gene, which encodes the first and rate-limiting enzyme of this system. Homozygous (ACOX -/-) mice lacked the expression of ACOX protein and accumulate very long chain fatty acids in blood. However, these homozygous mice are viable, but growth-retarded and infertile. During the first 3-4 months of age, the livers of ACOX -/- mice reveal severe microvesicular fatty metamorphosis of hepatocytes. In such steatotic cells, peroxisome assembly is markedly defective; as a result, they contain few or no peroxisomes. Few hepatocytes in 1-3-month-old ACOX -/- mice contain numerous peroxisomes, and these peroxisome-rich hepatocytes show no fatty change. At this stage, the basal mRNA levels of HD, thiolase, and other peroxisome proliferator-induced target genes were elevated in ACOX -/- mouse liver, but these mice, when treated with a peroxisome proliferator, showed no increases in the number of hepatic peroxisomes and in the mRNAs levels of these target genes. Between 4 and 5 months of age, severe steatosis resulted in scattered cell death, steatohepatitis, formation of lipogranulomas, and focal hepatocellular regeneration. In 6-7-month-old animals, the newly emerging hepatocytes, which progressively replaced steatotic cells, revealed spontaneous peroxisome proliferation. These livers showed marked increases in the mRNA levels of the remaining two genes of the beta-oxidation system, suggesting that ACOX gene disruption leads to increased endogenous ligand-mediated transcription levels. These observations demonstrate links among peroxisomal beta-oxidation, development of severe microvesicular fatty liver, peroxisome assembly, cell death, and cell proliferation in liver.","dc:creator":"Fan CY","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Hepatocellular and hepatic peroxisomal alterations in mice with a disrupted peroxisomal fatty acyl-coenzyme A oxidase gene."},"rdfs:label":"ACOX -/- mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5781,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d07e1234-8e5d-49cd-8ecc-529cf018f250","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009919","gene":"hgnc:119","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.1","dc:description":"The relationship between ACOX1 and peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency, inherited in the autosomal recessive manner, was evaluated using the ClinGen clinical validity framework as of December 2019 and re-evaluated in October 2022. ACOX1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency in 1994 (Fournier et al., PMID: 8040306). Numerous variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 17.5 points. Variants (nonsense, missense, and frameshift) in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 6 publications (PMID:18536048, PMID: 17458872, PMID: 8040306, PMID: 26965209, PMID: 11815777, PMID: 33234382). The mechanism for disease is expected to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and animal models. In summary, ACOX1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nLumping and Splitting Considerations: \nOMIM entities: Mitchell syndrome (MIM# 618960), Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency (MIM# 264470). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns AND phenotypic presentation. Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, ACOX1 deficiency and ACOX1 dysregulation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:96026ae4-050d-4eb5-849c-178c703a556e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
