The degradation of GC is controlled by glucosylceramidase (GCase) and saposin (Sap) C, a member of a family of four small glycoproteins (Saps A, B, C and D), all derived by proteolytic processing of a common precursor, prosaposin (PSAP). Saps contain six cysteine residues, forming three disulfide bridges, that affect their structure and function. Sap C is an essential activator of GCase and its deficit impairs the GCase activity causing GD. In the present study the biological properties of cells from four recently described GD patients carrying mutations in the Sap C domain of the PSAP gene have been characterized. Two patients had mutations involving a cysteine residue, whereas the other two had a L349P mutation. It was found that: (i) in the four Sap C-deficient cells PSAP was normally processed and sorted, the lack of Sap C being mainly due to the Sap C instability in late endosomal/lysosomal environment; (ii) the decrease/absence of Sap C affected the GCase intracellular localization; (iii) the lowest level of Sap C and enhanced autophagy were observed in the cells, which carried a Sap C mutation involving a cysteine residue; (iv) the four Sap C-deficient fibroblasts stored GC, ceramide and cholesterol, the last two lipids being clearly localized in lysosomes; (v) a correlation was observed between the type of Sap C mutation and the Gaucher phenotype: apparently, mutations involving cysteine residues lead to a neurological variant of GD.","dc:creator":"Vaccaro AM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Saposin C mutations in Gaucher disease patients resulting in lysosomal lipid accumulation, saposin C deficiency, but normal prosaposin processing and sorting."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 4"},{"id":"cggv:b36d1b50-57a1-4cc0-a423-240302c82318","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b36d1b50-57a1-4cc0-a423-240302c82318_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b36d1b50-57a1-4cc0-a423-240302c82318_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 24925315: in transfected COS-7 cells, resulted in significantly reduced expression versus wild-type protein; when overexpressed in COS-1 cells, half-life (as assessed by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX)), showed significantly reduced half-life and increased instability versus wild-type Sap C protein"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Scored 0.25pts per variant to prevent double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5fd99b07-5cec-4233-ae2e-729a306170e6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5fd99b07-5cec-4233-ae2e-729a306170e6","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:8ce42bec-8fd8-45f1-974b-2d889a2f908d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002778.4(PSAP):c.1145G>T (p.Cys382Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA123059"}},"detectionMethod":"Only a single (heterozygous) variant detected; second allele not identified","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:906db80d-1ded-4de9-90a7-7ec8e85c2ed6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8ce42bec-8fd8-45f1-974b-2d889a2f908d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2060627","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The lysosomal degradation of glucosylceramide requires the hydrolase, glucosylceramide-beta-glucosidase and a sphingolipid activator protein (Gaucher factor, SAP-2, saposin C).

Saposin (SAP-) C is required for glucosylceramide degradation, and its deficiency results in a variant form of Gaucher disease. In this report, we present clinical, biochemical, and molecular findings in a 36-year-old man and his 30-year-old sister with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease due to SAP-C deficiency. Very high levels of chitotriosidase activity, chemokine CCL18, and increased concentration of glucosylceramide in plasma and normal beta-glucosidase activity in skin fibroblasts were observed in the patients. A molecular genetics study of the PSAP gene enabled the identification of one missense mutation, p.L349P, located in the SAP-C domain and another mutation, p.M1L, located in the initiation codon of the prosaposin precursor protein.

Here, we report two Emirati families with Gaucher-like disorder due to Saposin C deficiency. Affected patients from both families carry the homozygous state of the novel c.1005‚Äâ+‚Äâ1G‚Äâ>‚ÄâA splice site (first to be reported) variant in the PSAP gene. Molecular analysis showed that the underlying variant is predicted to result in the retention of intron 9-10 and the formation of a premature stop codon leading to the complete loss of Saposin C. Clinical examination of the affected patients showed a wide heterogeneity in the patients' age of onset and symptoms ranging from Gaucher-like type 3 phenotype with severe refractory myoclonic epilepsy to Gaucher-like type 1 phenotype with growth retardation and hepatosplenomegaly. Collectively, the available clinical and molecular data confirms the pathogenicity of the reported PSAP splice site variant. The reported clinical cases expand the genetic and clinical spectrum of Saposin C deficiency.","dc:creator":"Mohamed FE","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"A Type 3 Gaucher-Like Disease Due To Saposin C Deficiency in Two Emirati Families Caused by a Novel Splice Site Variant in the PSAP Gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1-Mohamed"},{"id":"cggv:f7488f9b-0dbb-4c98-a2e6-8b2699cdfd10","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7488f9b-0dbb-4c98-a2e6-8b2699cdfd10_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Scored 0.75pts per variant to yield 1.5pts total and prevent double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:47115ba5-d04b-443c-b350-abacb3764a99_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47115ba5-d04b-443c-b350-abacb3764a99","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:73fe3d9d-e6c2-46b3-9bce-2968ee47e8d3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002778.4(PSAP):c.1144T>G (p.Cys382Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA123065"}},{"id":"cggv:fcd7f4bb-2ce8-4059-b479-990136ba22fa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002778.4(PSAP):c.1288C>T (p.Gln430Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA123067"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:4a63f624-494c-4e0d-80c8-9c18217a20ba_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:73fe3d9d-e6c2-46b3-9bce-2968ee47e8d3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15856305","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Only two Gaucher disease (GD) patients bearing mutations in the prosaposin gene (PSAP), and not in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), have been reported.

The mutant prosaposin cDNA (PS-CBC) encoded a chimeric saposin C that contained the non-neuritogenic sequence of saposin B, but retained acid beta-glucosidase (GCase) activation effects. When driven by the PGK (3-phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter, transgene expression was highest in the cerebrum for any of the transgenes (range from 15% to 42% of wild-type). Low levels were in visceral tissues. Prosaposin knock-out (PS-/-) mice expressing N or CBC transgenes, even at low levels, had delayed onset of neurologic signs and neuropathology, and significant lengthening of life span (from 1.7- to 7-fold) with age dependent partial correction of GlcCer and LacCer accumulation in the brain. Neuropathologic progression and neuronal glycosphingolipid storage were related directly to the transgene expression levels in the brain. Purkinje cell loss was age dependent. Gross brain and neuronal organizations were indistinguishable in PS-/- mice with or without the various transgenes, albeit the phenotype appeared later in the mice with transgenes. These studies show the degree of neuropathologic manifestations in each transgenic line depended on expression level rather than on the nature of the transgene.

The few patients with saposin C deficiency develop a Gaucher disease-like central nervous system (CNS) phenotype attributed to diminished glucosylceramide (GC) cleavage activity by acid beta-glucosidase (GCase). The in vivo effects of saposin C were examined by creating mice with selective absence of saposin C (C-/-) using a knock-in point mutation (cysteine-to-proline) in exon 11 of the psap gene. In C-/- mice, prosaposin and saposins A, B and D proteins were present at near wild-type levels, but the saposin C protein was absent. By 1 year, the C-/- mice exhibited weakness of the hind limbs and progressive ataxia. Decreased neuromotor activity and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation were evident. Foamy storage cells were observed in dorsal root ganglion and there was progressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and atrophy of cerebellar granule cells. Ultrastructural analyses revealed inclusions in axonal processes in the spinal cord, sciatic nerve and brain, but no excess of multivesicular bodies. Activated microglial cells and astrocytes were present in thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord, indicating regional pro-inflammatory responses. No storage cells were found in visceral organs of these mice. The absence of saposin C led to moderate increases in GC and lactosylceramide (LacCer) and their deacylated analogues.

GDSAPC was first reported by Christomanou et al. in 1986 (PMID: 3024666) and the first report of biallelic variants in PSAP among GDSAPC cases was by Diaz-Font in 2005 (PMID: 15856305). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between PSAP and GDSAPC. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, deletions, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 20484222, PMID: 15856305, PMID: 2060627, PMID: 17919309, PMID: 28457694, PMID: 35316504, PMID: 31061751, PMID: 35456468). In total, thirteen variants from nine probands in eight publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between PSAP and GDSAPC includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (prosaposin) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with GDSAPC (PMID: 20484222, PMID: 22652185, PMID: 15464415); the biochemical and clinical features of PSAP knockout mice (PMID: 20015957); and partial rescue of central nervous system glucocerebrosidase accumulation and neurologic impairment via insertion of saposin C cDNA into PSAP knockout mice (PMID: 12208132). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, PSAP is definitively associated with GDSAPC. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time.
