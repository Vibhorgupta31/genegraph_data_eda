Six multi-gene CNVs that have been reported in six probands in one publication (PMID: 22318994) are included in this curation. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between* FMO5* and congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *FMO5* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date [11/27/2023] (SOP Version 10).\nDisputed was decided to be appropriate due to the lack of any scorable genetic or experimental evidence implicating FMO5 in congenital heart disease.
