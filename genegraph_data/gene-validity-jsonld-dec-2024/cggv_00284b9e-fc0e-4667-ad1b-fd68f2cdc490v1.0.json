PINCH1 and PINCH2 interact, through their first LIM domain, with the integrin-linked kinase and thereby link integrins with several signal transduction pathways. Despite their high similarity, it has been shown that PINCH1 and PINCH2 could exert distinct functions during cell spreading and cell survival. To investigate the function of PINCH2 in vivo, we deleted PINCH2 in mouse using the loxP/Cre system. In contrast to the PINCH1-deficient mice, which die at the peri-implantation stage, PINCH2-null mice are viable, fertile and show no overt phenotype. Histological analysis of tissues that express high levels of PINCH2 such as bladder and kidney revealed no apparent abnormalities, but showed a significant upregulation of PINCH1, suggesting that the two PINCH proteins may have, at least in part, overlapping function in vivo. To further test this possibility, we established PINCH1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which express neither PINCH1 nor PINCH2. We found that in fibroblasts with a PINCH1/2-null background, PINCH2 is able to rescue the spreading and adhesion defects of mutant fibroblasts to the same extent as PINCH1. Furthermore, we show that the LIM1 domain only of either PINCH1 or PINCH2 can prevent ILK degradation despite their failure to localize to focal adhesions. Altogether these results suggest that PINCH1 and PINCH2 share overlapping functions and operate dependently and independently of their subcellular localization.","dc:creator":"Stanchi F","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Consequences of loss of PINCH2 expression in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Stanchi Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The model does not recapitulate the human phenotype and is therefor not scored.

Three missense variants have been reported in a pair of siblings with the limb-girdle phenotype in the literature; this is the only report known to have been published of a *LIMS2* variant identified in a patient with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. None of these variants have functional evidence in support of pathogenicity and the mechanism for disease is unknown. \n\nClinVar contains submissions for variants within this gene; the panel contacted submitters of pathogenic and likely pathogenic ClinVar contributions and found no additional evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. \n\nThe loxP/Cre system was used to knock out *LIMS2* in a mouse model. The resulting *LIMS2* deficient mice showed no apparent phenotype when compared to their wild-type and heterozygous littermates (PMID:16317048). RNA sequencing of total RNA from 20 human tissues shows non-specific expression of *LIMS2* in skeletal muscle, low to moderate in comparison to expression in other tissues (NCBI Bioproject:PRJNA280600).\n\nThe evidence of this gene-disease relationship is limited to a few cases carrying missense variants and presenting with genetically heterogeneous phenotypes with a sum of genetic evidence below 0. No compelling experimental evidence is available. \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *LIMS2* and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *LIMS2* plays in this disease.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date November 12, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\nThe evidence of this gene-disease relationship is limited to a few cases carrying missense variants and presenting with genetically heterogeneous phenotypes with a sum of genetic evidence below 0.
