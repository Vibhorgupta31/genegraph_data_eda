These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.

Dysregulated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal traffic has been established to represent the molecular pathogenic cause underlying these conditions. To investigate the phenotypic spectrum and molecular diversity of germline mutations affecting BRAF, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase functioning as a RAS effector frequently mutated in CFCS, subjects with a diagnosis of NS (N=270), LS (N=6), and CFCS (N=33), and no mutation in PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, RAF1, MEK1, or MEK2, were screened for the entire coding sequence of the gene. Besides the expected high prevalence of mutations observed among CFCS patients (52%), a de novo heterozygous missense change was identified in one subject with LS (17%) and five individuals with NS (1.9%). Mutations mapped to multiple protein domains and largely did not overlap with cancer-associated defects. NS-causing mutations had not been documented in CFCS, suggesting that the phenotypes arising from germline BRAF defects might be allele specific. Selected mutant BRAF proteins promoted variable gain of function of the kinase, but appeared less activating compared to the recurrent cancer-associated p.Val600Glu mutant. Our findings provide evidence for a wide phenotypic diversity associated with mutations affecting BRAF, and occurrence of a clinical continuum associated with these molecular lesions.","dc:creator":"Sarkozy A","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Germline BRAF mutations in Noonan, LEOPARD, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes: molecular diversity and associated phenotypic spectrum."},"rdfs:label":"Functional alteration MEK ERK"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"cannot score as this assay does not differentiate NS from other RAS disorders"},{"id":"cggv:bb7c35d9-7bf5-4a28-96f3-9fe4047722b4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9bad798f-c94b-41a9-b263-d422fac30697","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The p.Ile326Val variant showed no significant difference from the WT.

However, variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals may complicate the clinical diagnosis of NS versus cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC). Additional genotype-phenotype correlations are necessary to solidify the association of BRAF with Noonan syndrome (Lee et al., 2011; Nystrom et al., 2008; Razzaque et al., 2007; Sarkozy et al., 2009; van Trier et al., 2016). The BRAF gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway which is associated with the NS phenotype (Aoki, Niihori, Inoue, & Matsubara, 2016; Rauen, 2013). Of note, BRAF has also been classified as definitive in association with CFC, limited in association with NS with multiple lentigines, and disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating BRAF with NS with loose anagen hair.
