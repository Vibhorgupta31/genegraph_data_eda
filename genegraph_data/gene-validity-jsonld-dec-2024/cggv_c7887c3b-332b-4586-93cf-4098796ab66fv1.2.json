Both children were born to consanguineous parents, one presented with infantile spasms, the other with migrating partial seizures of infancy. We describe an infant presenting with severe intractable epilepsy (without a specific EIEE electroclinical syndrome diagnosis) and neurodevelopmental delay associated with compound heterozygous mutations in PLCB1. A case note review and molecular genetic investigations were performed for a child, approximately 10 months of age, admitted to Johns Hopkins University Hospital for developmental delay and new-onset seizures. The patient presented at 6 months of age with developmental delay, followed by the onset of intractable, focal, and generalized seizures associated with developmental regression from 10 months of age. Presently, at 2 years of age, the child has severe motor and cognitive delays. Diagnostic microarray revealed a heterozygous 476kb deletion of 20p12.3 (encompassing PLCB1), which was also detected in the mother. The genomic breakpoints for the heterozygous deletion were determined. In order to investigate the presence of a second PLCB1 mutation, direct Sanger sequencing of the coding region and flanking intronic regions was undertaken, revealing a novel heterozygous intron 1 splice site variant (c.99+1G>A) in both the index individual and the father. Advances in molecular genetic testing have greatly improved diagnostic rates in EIEE, and this report further confirms the important role of microarray investigation in this group of disorders. PLCB1-EIEE is now reported in a number of different EIEE phenotypes and our report provides further evidence for phenotypic pleiotropy encountered in early infantile epilepsy syndromes.","dc:creator":"Ngoh A","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy due to mutations in PLCB1: expansion of the genotypic and phenotypic disease spectrum."}},"rdfs:label":"1"},{"id":"cggv:557ae082-a1af-4192-a005-7e4cacb325cd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:557ae082-a1af-4192-a005-7e4cacb325cd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Per the Gene Curation SOP, two LOF variants could score up to 3 points.

Our three patients were one sporadic case with an intragenic homozygous deletion and two cousins with the homozygous p.(Arg222*) nonsense variant in PLCB1. These patients had severe to profound intellectual disability, epileptic spasms at age 3-5 months concomitant with developmental arrest or regression, other seizure types and drug-resistant epilepsy. With this report, we expand the clinical, radiologic and electroencephalographic knowledge about the extremely rare PLCB1-related encephalopathy. Since the first report in 2010, the overall number of reported patients with our additional patients is currently limited to seven. All seven patients had epileptic encephalopathy, mainly infantile spasms and 6/7 had profound intellectual disability, with one only being able to walk. Truncal hypotonia was the most frequent neurological sign, sometimes associated with pyramidal and/or extrapyramidal hypertonia of limbs. Microcephaly was inconstant. In conclusion, the phenotypical spectrum of PLCB1-related encephalopathy is relatively narrow, comprises infantile spasms and severe to profound intellectual disability, and does not seem to define a recognizable clinical entity.","dc:creator":"Desprairies C","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Three novel patients with epileptic encephalopathy due to biallelic mutations in the PLCB1 gene."}},"rdfs:label":"1"},{"id":"cggv:a0c9cba7-35ef-4b87-9744-ec35f41cbd4d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0c9cba7-35ef-4b87-9744-ec35f41cbd4d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Per the Gene Curation SOP, two LOF variants could score up to 3 points.

The evidence summary below reflects this change. The original evidence and conclusion remains the same; therefore, the original date of approval has not been changed. **\n\n\n\nPathogenic variants in the PLCB1 gene have been reported in the literature in several individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, usually characterized by refractory infantile onset seizures, EEG abnormalities- often with hypsarrhythmia, neurologic and developmental regression and long term cognitive and motor impairment. Homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function variants have been primarily reported in association with this phenotype supporting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Sequence variants (PMIDs: 24684524, 30554916, 31054490, 31883110) as well as large multi-exon deletions (PMID:26818157, 31883110) have been reported in the literature, often from individuals with consanguineous family history. Of note, a recurrent deletion which encompasses the promoter and exons 1-3 of the gene has been reported in multiple individuals (approximate reported breakpoints GRCh37 20:803442-8099252 to 8520654-8575520) (PMIDs:20833646, 22690784, 24684524). Evidence supporting this gene disease pair includes experimental data as well. Supporting experimental data has been reported in a knockout mouse model (PMID:9305844) that exhibited no phenotype in the heterozygous state, but demonstrated delayed growth, low viability and recurrent tonic-clonic seizures in the homozygous state. In summary PLCB1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This has been demonstrated in both the clinical and research settings and this evidence has been maintained over time.\nDue to limitations of the ClinGen curation portal, copy number variants (CNVs) are not able to be entered.
