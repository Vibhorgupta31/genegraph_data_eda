This is in agreement with the observation of vitreoretinal degeneration and retinal detachment already in young patients with Stickler syndrome. The molecular mechanism of disease is also consistent with COL2A1 inactivation, leading to altered expression of structural matrix molecules also in the vitreous, including HA and proteoglycans.

The eyes were collected from C57BL mice heterozygous for a targeted inactivation of one allele of the Col2a1 gene (Col2a1(+/-) mice). The eyes of C57BL mice with normal gene alleles were used as controls (Col2a1(+/+) mice). Ocular histology was analyzed from tissue sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue and alcian blue. Type II collagen was localized by immunohistochemistry. Hyaluronan (HA) was stained utilizing the biotinylated complex of the hyaluronan-binding region of aggrecan and link protein (bHABC). The anterior segment of the eye was well-formed in both genotypes, but typical folding of ciliary processes was decreased, while increased stromal extracellular matrix vacuolization was seen in the Col2a1(+/-) mice. In the lens of these mice, subcapsular extracellular matrix changes were observed. Differences in retinal structures or the number of the eyes with retinal detachment were not detected between the genotypes. In Col2a1(+/-) mice, staining for type II collagen was weaker in cornea, ciliary body, iris, lens, vitreous, retina, choroid and sclera than in the control mice. HA staining was detected in the extraocular tissues, ciliary body, iris and the choroid of both genotypes. HA staining was observed only in the vitreous body of the control animals. Heterozygous inactivation of Col2a1 gene causes structural defects in the murine eye. The observed structural changes in the ciliary body, lens and vitreous of the Col2a1(+/-) mice may represent ocular features found in the human Stickler syndrome, where the abnormalities result from COL2A1 gene mutations which lead to functional haploinsufficiency.","dc:creator":"Kaarniranta K","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"A mouse model for Stickler's syndrome: ocular phenotype of mice carrying a targeted heterozygous inactivation of type II (pro)collagen gene (Col2a1)."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6977,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:105da347-bede-4bab-9161-d9bde7eb8979","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007160","gene":"hgnc:2200","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.1","dc:description":"*COL2A1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Stickler syndrome type 1 in 1987 (Francomano et al., PMID: 2896625). Stickler syndrome is characterized by ocular, auditory, skeletal, and orofacial abnormalities. Most forms are identifiable by findings in the eye including high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, retinal detachment, and cataracts (Baker et al., PMID: 21671392). 10 variants (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in 10 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 1677770, 17721977, 26626311, 27408751, 31736238, 8434604, 8737653) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Notably, *COL2A1* has been definitively associated with Achondrogenesis type 2-hypochondrogenesis, Platyspondylic dysplasia, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Kniest dysplasia, and spondyloperipheral dysplasia as well as moderately with SED with metatarsal shortening (Czech Dysplasia) after curation by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP. This gene has also been associated with Dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses (PMID: 31633310), which will be assessed separately. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models and expression studies) (PMIDs: 12525971, 16546167, 3033664, 7806485). *COL2A1* is expressed throughout the skeletal structure as well as throughout the eye, with expression in the vitreous space and the ganglion cell layer of the retina being most relevant to the most common phenotypes seen in patients. In summary, *COL2A1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Stickler syndrome type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/7/22 (SOP version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3eb9287e-d731-417e-a814-9630b47301a4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
