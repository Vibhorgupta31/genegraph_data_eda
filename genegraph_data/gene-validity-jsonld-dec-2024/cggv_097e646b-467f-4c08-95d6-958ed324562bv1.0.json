We elucidate a mechanism normally limiting axon branching, whereby giant ankB localizes to periodic axonal plasma membrane domains through L1 cell-adhesion molecule protein, where it couples microtubules to the plasma membrane and prevents microtubule entry into nascent axon branches. Giant ankB mutation or deficiency results in a dominantly inherited impairment in selected communicative and social behaviors combined with superior executive function.

Individuals with variants identified in this gene have presented with neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, seizures, and microcephaly. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. De novo protein truncating variants in this gene have been reported in over 12 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including 8 probands from 7 publications (PMIDs: 22542183, 25363768, 27479843, 28554332, 30564305, 30755392, 31981491) that are included in this curation, and 5 additional probands (PMIDs: 33004838 [3 individuals], 33057194 [2]) not scored since the maximum points had been reached. In addition, 10 protein truncating variants of unknown inheritance have also been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (PMIDs: 25363760 [2], 28191889 [6], 28263302 [1], 27824329 [1]).  One de novo missense variant (PMID: 25621899) with evidence of loss-of-function (PMID: 31285321) and at least six de novo missense variants of unknown significance (PMIDs: 28135719 [(2]), 31981491 [(4])) have also been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. The mechanism for disease is predicted to be haploinsufficiency based on the protein truncating variants reported in individuals affected with neurodevelopmental disorders and experimental data showing reduced protein expression in cultured cells bearing truncating variants in ANK2 (PMID: 31285321). The gene-disease association is also supported by mouse models and rescue experiments in cultured cells (PMID: 31285321).  Of note, loss-of-function missense variants in ANK2 have also been observed in individuals with Long QT syndrome (PMIDs: 15178757,17242276); the ClinGen Long QT GCEP is evaluating the clinical validity of this reported gene-disease relationship. In summary, there is sufficient evidence to support a definitive gene-disease relationship between ANK2 and complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
