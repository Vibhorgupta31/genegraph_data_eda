Loss of any of the enzymes needed to make either putrescine or spermidine (which also -prevent the production of spermine) is lethal, but male mice lacking spermine synthase (SpmS) due to a deletion of part of the X chromosome are viable on the B6C3H background.

They can therefore be used to evaluate the physiological function(s) uniquely provided by spermine. They also provide a potential animal model for Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), a rare human inherited disease due to a loss of SpmS activity.

Each monomer has three domains: a C-terminal domain, which contains the active site and is similar in structure to spermidine synthase; a central domain made up of four beta-strands; and an N-terminal domain with remarkable structural similarity to S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, the enzyme that forms the aminopropyl donor substrate.

Deletion of the N-terminal domain led to a complete loss of spermine synthase activity, suggesting that dimerization may be required for activity.

The active site is similar to those of spermidine synthases but has a larger substrate-binding pocket able to accommodate longer substrates.

It is confirmed experimentally that the variant, bearing four amino acid substitutions, is catalytically more active than the wild type. The increased functionality is attributed to enhanced monomer stability, lowering the pKa of proton donor catalytic residue, optimized spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential around the SMS with respect to substrates, and increase of the frequency of mechanical vibration of the clefts presumed to be the gates toward the active sites. The study demonstrates that wild type SMS is not particularly evolutionarily optimized with respect to the reaction spermidine â†’ spermine.

A similar spermine-related defect in the functioning of cardiac Kir channels could account for arrhythmias leading to sudden death.

This modeling is clinically relevant as 28% of all UK families with dependent children are single parent households. In conclusion, to diagnose patients with ID in the absence of parental DNA, we recommend investigation of all LoF variants in known genes that cause ID and assessment of a limited list of proven pathogenic missense variants in these genes.

Nonetheless, little is known about the specific cellular functions of these compounds, and extensive laboratory investigations have failed to identify a heritable condition in humans in which polyamine synthesis is perturbed. We report the first polyamine deficiency syndrome caused by a defect in spermine synthase (SMS). The defect results from a splice mutation, and is associated with the Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS, OMIM_309583), an X-linked mental retardation disorder. The affected males have mild-to-moderate mental retardation (MR), hypotonia, cerebellar circuitry dysfunction, facial asymmetry, thin habitus, osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, decreased activity of SMS, correspondingly low levels of intracellular spermine in lymphocytes and fibroblasts, and elevated spermidine/spermine ratios. The clinical features observed in SRS are consistent with cerebellar dysfunction and a defective functioning of red nucleus neurons, which, at least in rats, contain high levels of spermine. Additionally, the presence of MR reflects a role for spermine in cognitive function, possibly by spermine's ability to function as an 'intrinsic gateway' molecule for inward rectifier K(+) channels.","dc:creator":"Cason AL","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"X-linked spermine synthase gene (SMS) defect: the first polyamine deficiency syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14508504","rdfs:label":"V-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This exon is out of frame, and the RT-PCR data shows that it is missing in patients with the disease.

The mechanism for disease is thought to be that variants that destabilize the dimer cause loss of the SMS protein, leading a dearth of sperimine which is an essential developmental polyamine. This has been demonstrated by animal models, expression studies, functional alteration studies, and analysis of the crystal structure of SMS (Wu 2008, Zhange 2013, Wang 2011, Peng 2016, Zhang 2011, Li 2018, Pegg 2009, Pegg 2011).
