Clinical features of this disorder include microcephaly, cognitive impairment, dysmorphic features, and variable ophthalmological anomalies including chorioretinopathy. Microcephaly can be recognized prenatally and visual impairment becomes evident during the first year of life. The clinical presentation resembles the findings in some acquired conditions such as congenital toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus infections; thus, it is important to recognize and diagnose this syndrome in view of its impact on patient health management and familial reproductive plans. To date, only seven molecularly confirmed patients from five unrelated families have been reported. We report an additional four unrelated patients with TUBGCP6 variants including one prenatal diagnosis and review the clinical phenotypes and genotypes of all the known cases.

Among the Plain people, we have used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to genetically map recessive disorders to large autozygous haplotype blocks (mean = 4.4 Mb) that contain many genes (mean = 79). For some, uninformative mapping or large gene lists preclude disease-gene identification by Sanger sequencing. Seven such conditions were selected for exome sequencing at the Broad Institute; all had been previously mapped at the CSC using low density SNP microarrays coupled with autozygosity and linkage analyses. Using between 1 and 5 patient samples per disorder, we identified sequence variants in the known disease-causing genes SLC6A3 and FLVCR1, and present evidence to strongly support the pathogenicity of variants identified in TUBGCP6, BRAT1, SNIP1, CRADD, and HARS.

The gamma-tubulin small complex (gamma-TuSC) components, gamma-tubulin, GCPB and GCPC, are essential for viability and mitotic spindle formation, whereas GCPD-GCPF are not essential for viability, spindle formation or sexual reproduction. GCPD-GCPF function in reducing the frequency of chromosome mis-segregation and in the assembly of large gamma-tubulin complexes. Deletion of any of the gamma-TuSC components eliminates the localization of all GCPs to the spindle pole body (SPB), whereas deletion of GCPD-GCPF does not affect localization of gamma-TuSC components. Thus, GCPD-GCPF do not tether the gamma-TuSC to the SPB, but, rather, the gamma-TuSC tethers them to the SPB. GCPD-GCPF exhibit a hierarchy of localization to the SPB. Deletion of GCPF eliminates GCPD-GCPE localization to the SPB, and deletion of GCPD eliminates GCPE (but not GCPF) localization. All GCPs localize normally in a GCPE deletion. We propose a model for the structure of the gamma-tubulin complex and its attachment to polar microtubule organizing centers.","dc:creator":"Xiong Y","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"In vivo analysis of the functions of gamma-tubulin-complex proteins."},"rdfs:label":"A. nidulans tubulin"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ccb03ff1-94d3-4387-b312-ac8e38d83d89_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e57a1111-7693-409e-9941-aa7c1d4a645b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ee45c19-8463-4447-a863-329fdfb20108","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Degradation of TUBGCP6 caused a clear failure of centriole duplication.

A previous genome-wide screen revealed that depletion of 14 RNA splicing factors leads to a specific defect in centriole duplication, but the cause of this deficit remains unknown. Here, we identified an additional pre-mRNA splicing factor, WBP11, as a novel protein required for centriole duplication. Loss of WBP11 results in the retention of ∼200 introns, including multiple introns in TUBGCP6, a central component of the γ-TuRC. WBP11 depletion causes centriole duplication defects, in part by causing a rapid decline in the level of TUBGCP6. Several additional splicing factors that are required for centriole duplication interact with WBP11 and are required for TUBGCP6 expression. These findings provide insight into how the loss of a subset of splicing factors leads to a failure of centriole duplication. This may have clinical implications because mutations in some spliceosome proteins cause microcephaly and/or growth retardation, phenotypes that are strongly linked to centriole defects.","dc:creator":"Park EM","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"WBP11 is required for splicing the TUBGCP6 pre-mRNA to promote centriole duplication."},"rdfs:label":"Functional alteration evidence: non-patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"It wasn't from this article but there is expression level data from GTEx, which is linked below.

An important note is that this condition, which has both microcephaly and the ophthalmic/retinal phenotype, is distinct from simple microcephaly. No pre-curation was necessary for the gene as there is only one gene disease assertion for autosomal recessive microcephaly and chorioretinopathy 1 (OMIM: # 251270). 12 variants (missense, in-frame duplication, read-through, splice site, frameshift, and nonsense) that have been reported in 7 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 22279524, 25344692, 37031378) are included in this curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. There is only one reported prenatal diagnosis of this condition, described by Thomas-Wilson et al., 2023 (PMID: 37031378), and found by fetal ultrasound/MRI exams showing microcephaly. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression evidence, biochemical function, functional alteration; PMIDs: 19861490, 31874114). The deletion of the gene has been shown to cause cell division defects, consistent with short stature/developmental issues, often seen in affected individuals. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TUBGCP6 and autosomal recessive chorioretinopathy and microcephaly 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Prenatal GCEP on the meeting date [May 31, 2023] (SOP Version 1).
