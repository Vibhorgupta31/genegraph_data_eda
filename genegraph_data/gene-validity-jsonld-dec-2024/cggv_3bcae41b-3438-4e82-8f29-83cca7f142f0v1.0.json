Whole-exome sequencing was carried out in 39 Korean patients with EA to identify pathogenic mutations of the five known EA genes. We also evaluated 40 candidate genes that cause EA as a secondary phenotype or cerebellar ataxia. Eighteen patients (46%) revealed genetic information useful for establishing a molecular diagnosis of EA. In 11 patients, 16 pathogenic mutations were detected in three EA genes. These included nine mutations in CACNA1A, three in SLC1A3, and four in UBR4. Three patients had mutations in two genes, either CACNA1A and SLC1A3 or CACNA1A and UBR4, suggesting that SLC1A3 and UBR4 may act as genetic modifiers with synergic effects on the abnormal presynaptic activity caused by CACNA1A mutations. In seven patients with negative results for screening of EA genes, potential pathogenic mutations were identified in the candidate genes ATP1A2, SCN1A, TTBK2, TGM6, FGF14, and KCND3.

The excitatory amino acid transporter 1 is the predominant glial glutamate transporter in the cerebellum. However, this glutamate transporter also functions as an anion channel and earlier work in heterologous expression systems demonstrated that the mutation impairs the glutamate transport rate, while increasing channel activity. To understand how these changes cause ataxia, we developed a constitutive transgenic mouse model. Transgenic mice display epilepsy, ataxia and cerebellar atrophy and, thus, closely resemble the human disease. We observed increased glutamate-activated chloride efflux in Bergmann glia that triggers the apoptosis of these cells during infancy. The loss of Bergmann glia results in reduced glutamate uptake and impaired neural network formation in the cerebellar cortex.

This disease entity represents a spectrum of disorder, ranging from episodic migraine and hemiparesis to the more severe form characterized by ataxia, slurred speech, and seizures. Eight unique variants, most of which are missense, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least eight probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 27829685, 16116111, 29062094, 19139306, 29208948, 29066757, 32754645, 25497598). Functional studies performed on the seven observed missense variants demonstrate several possible pathogenic mechanisms depending on the mutation, with the most severe variants (p.M128R, p.P290R, and p.T318A) causing a gain-of-function altered glutamate transport and anion channels. Other variants usually cause increased amounts of transcribed protein for similar effectiveness to WT, indicating a haploinsufficency defect in glutamate uptake and anion currents (Chivukula et al., PMID: 32741053). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Tourette syndrome and ADHD/Autism susceptibility (PMIDs: 21233784, 27296938). These will be assessed separately\nThis gene-disease association is supported primarily by a knock-in mouse model of the most characterized variant P290R which recapitulated the phenotypes of the human disorder. Several instances of functional evidence have also been characterized, with a knock-out model organism demonstrating altered glutamate transport and motor/neurological phenotypes as well as a thorough functional characterization of six missense variants in HEK293 cells.\nIn summary, SLC1A3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant episodic ataxia. Although more published genetic evidence would allow for further characterization, the large amount of experimental data available provides important evidence towards its pathogenicity.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3bcae41b-3438-4e82-8f29-83cca7f142f0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
