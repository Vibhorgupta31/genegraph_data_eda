Hepatic cystogenesis is characterized by progressive proliferation of cholangiocytes, ultimately causing hepatomegaly. Genetically, polycystic liver disease is a heterogeneous disorder with incomplete penetrance and caused by mutations in PRKCSH, SEC63, PKD1, or PKD2. Genome-wide SNP typing and Sanger sequencing revealed no pathogenic variants in hitherto genes in an extended PCLD family. We performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples from two members. A heterozygous variant c.3562C > T located at a highly conserved amino acid position (p.R1188W) in the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene segregated with the disease (logarithm of odds score, 4.62) but was not observed in more than 1,000 unaffected individuals. Screening of LRP5 in a PCLD cohort identified three additional mutations in three unrelated families with polycystic livers (p.V454M, p.R1529S, and p.D1551N), again all undetected in controls. All variants were predicted to be damaging with profound structural effects on LRP5 protein domains. Liver cyst tissue and normal hepatic tissue samples from patients and controls showed abundant LRP5 expression by immunohistochemistry. Functional activity analyses indicated that mutant LRP5 led to reduced wingless signal activation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that germ-line LRP5 missense mutations are associated with hepatic cystogenesis. The findings presented in this study link the pathophysiology of PCLD to deregulation of the canonical wingless signaling pathway.

LRP-5, when expressed in fibroblast cells, showed no effect on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by itself, but acted synergistically with Wnt. In contrast, LRP-5 mutants lacking the extracellular domain functioned as constitutively active forms that bind Axin and that induce LEF-1 activation by destabilizing Axin and stabilizing beta-catenin. Addition of Wnt caused the translocation of Axin to the membrane and enhanced the interaction between Axin and LRP-5. In addition, the LRP-5 sequences involved in interactions with Axin are required for LEF-1 activation. Thus, we conclude that the binding of Axin to LRP-5 is an important part of the Wnt signal transduction pathway.","dc:creator":"Mao J","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 binds to Axin and regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway."},"rdfs:label":"Cell Culture, Transfection and Luciferase Assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:dd2a14d4-0c98-4b0d-bee8-a0c5f3550009_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:15670e4a-d1db-44f1-a60b-12a433dfd41e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:180d2a36-75f5-4056-b111-b9aae9ddec67","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Over-expression of mutatnt LRP5 constructs in CHO, H69 and HEK293 cells increased basal and Wnt3a-induced luciferase activity compared with empty vector","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24706814","rdfs:label":"Luciferase assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":4013,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":4.7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:742f6079-b0e4-4365-99e4-f472381b18bc","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044327","gene":"hgnc:6697","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*LRP5 *was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease with or without kidney cysts in 2014 (Cnoseen et al., PMID: 24706814). Of note, *LRP5 *is associated with a number of gene-disease relationships in OMIM. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, given differences in phenotype and inheritance patterns, these different clinical entities were split. This curation focuses only on the association between *LRP5 *and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease with or without kidney cysts. Four variants (all missense) that have been reported in *LRP5 *probands in one publication (PMID: 24706814) are included in this curation. Given this curation focuses on monoallelic disease, publications supporting the role of *LRP5 *in modifying phenotype in patients with an alternate genetic mechanism for their cystic disease were not included in this curation. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies that demonstrated *LRP5 *expression in liver tissue (PMID: 24706814) and studies that demonstrate that LRP5 has a role in the WNT-signaling pathway that is associated with polycystic liver disease (PMID: 30361437). In summary, there is limited evidence to support a gene-disease relationship between *LRP5 *and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease with or without kidney cysts. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
