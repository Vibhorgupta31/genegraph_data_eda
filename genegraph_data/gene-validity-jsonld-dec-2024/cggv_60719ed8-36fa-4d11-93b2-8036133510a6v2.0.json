At the cellular level, FA is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal breakage and a unique hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. Complementation analysis has indicated that at least seven distinct genes are involved in the pathogenesis of FA. Despite the identification of four of these genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCF and FANCG), the nature of the 'FA pathway' has remained enigmatic, as the FA proteins lack sequence homologies or motifs that could point to a molecular function. To further define this pathway, we studied the subcellular localizations and mutual interactions of the FA proteins, including the recently identified FANCF protein, in human lymphoblasts. FANCF was found predominantly in the nucleus, where it complexes with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG. These interactions were detected in wild-type and FA-D lymphoblasts, but not in lymphoblasts of other FA complementation groups. This implies that each of the FA proteins, except FANCD, is required for these complexes to form. Similarly, we show that the interaction between FANCA and FANCC is restricted to wild-type and FA-D cells. Furthermore, we document the subcellular localization of FANCA and the FANCA/FANCG complex in all FA complementation groups. Our results, along with published data, culminate in a model in which a multi-protein FA complex serves a nuclear function to maintain genomic integrity.","dc:creator":"de Winter JP","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"The Fanconi anemia protein FANCF forms a nuclear complex with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG."},"rdfs:label":"Co-immunoprecipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The protein interactions were supported by three independent experiments of co-immunoprecipitation of FANCA, FANCG and FANCC."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:60719ed8-36fa-4d11-93b2-8036133510a6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb3d6ad6-dc13-42a5-ac28-60deec4fa881","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3dc34ff3-1323-4b55-a343-a9bd4aa70880","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Both the short and the long isoforms of FANCD2 were present in control mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas in Fancf −/− MEFs, only the short non-monoubiquitinated isoform (FANCD2-S) was present.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21915857","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare recessive disorder marked by developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and a high risk for the development of leukaemia and solid tumours.

To study whether there is a causal relationship between FA pathway defects and tumour development, we have generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the FA core complex gene Fancf. Fancf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed a phenotype typical for FA cells: they showed an aberrant response to DNA cross-linking agents as manifested by G(2) arrest, chromosomal aberrations, reduced survival, and an inability to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. Fancf homozygous mice were viable, born following a normal Mendelian distribution, and showed no growth retardation or developmental abnormalities. The gonads of Fancf mutant mice functioned abnormally, showing compromised follicle development and spermatogenesis as has been observed in other FA mouse models and in FA patients. In a cohort of Fancf-deficient mice, we observed decreased overall survival and increased tumour incidence. Notably, in seven female mice, six ovarian tumours developed: five granulosa cell tumours and one luteoma. One mouse had developed tumours in both ovaries. High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on these tumours suggests that the increased incidence of ovarian tumours correlates with the infertility in Fancf-deficient mice and the genomic instability characteristic of FA pathway deficiency.","dc:creator":"Bakker ST","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Fancf-deficient mice are prone to develop ovarian tumours."},"rdfs:label":"FANCD2 ubiquitination analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"These data show that FANCF is an essential FA core complex member and in its absence, the FA pathway is impaired, which results in failure to maintain genome stability."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:60719ed8-36fa-4d11-93b2-8036133510a6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b22279d-f1e5-47a4-9f2b-c72462fb5011","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2b897be-85d2-4e21-895c-5d7bfc3cf64c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"MMC hypersensitivity of FA-F cell line EUFA698 is corrected after transfection of FANCF cDNA clone.
