It is genetically linked to the CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes that, respectively, encode two cytochrome P450 isozymes, P450XIB1 and P450XIB2. Whereas P450XIB1 only catalyzes hydroxylation at position 11 beta of 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, P450XIB2 catalyzes the synthesis of aldosterone from deoxycorticosterone, a process that successively requires hydroxylation at positions 11 beta and 18 and oxidation at position 18. To determine the molecular genetic basis of CMO-II deficiency, seven kindreds of Iranian-Jewish origin were studied in which members suffered from CMO-II deficiency. No mutations were found in the CYP11B1 genes, but two candidate mutations, R181W and V386A, were found in the CYP11B2 genes. When these mutations were individually introduced into CYP11B2 cDNA and expressed in cultured cells, R181W reduced 18-hydroxylase and abolished 18-oxidase activities but left 11 beta-hydroxylase activity intact, whereas V386A caused a small but consistent reduction in the production of 18-hydroxycorticosterone. All individuals affected with CMO-II deficiency were homozygous for both mutations, whereas eight asymptomatic subjects were homozygous for R181W alone and three were homozygous for V386A alone. These findings confirm that P450XIB2 is the major enzyme mediating oxidation at position 18 in the adrenal and suggest that a small amount of residual activity undetectable in in vitro assays is sufficient to synthesize normal amounts of aldosterone.","dc:creator":"Pascoe L","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Mutations in the human CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) gene causing corticosterone methyloxidase II deficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33b5d07b-9acf-45a5-aec3-f3b7b5f05549_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33b5d07b-9acf-45a5-aec3-f3b7b5f05549","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:90965b9b-ccea-425b-9a4a-caae5a3768ad","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000498.3(CYP11B2):c.554C>T (p.Thr185Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA126946"}},{"id":"cggv:dccc28f1-2a5a-43cc-91d9-2b82a7562556","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000498.3(CYP11B2):c.1492A>G (p.Thr498Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA126948"}}],"detectionMethod":"Direct PCR screening","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Aldosterone synthase deficiency type II.

An exon 3 mutation (C554T, leading to amino acid T185I) was found in the father and both siblings, and an exon 9 mutation (A1492G, leading to T498A) was found in the affected infant and the mother.

Both mutations in this compound heterozygote localize to the beta 3-sheet in the cytochrome P450 enzyme structure, as does the previously characterized R181W mutation.

Laboratory tests showed hyponatremia (119 mmol/L), serum potassium 5.4 mmol/L, low plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA) levels. Next-generation sequencing of his DNA revealed compound heterozygous mutations in CYP11B2, a known variant c.1391_1393delTGC (p.Leu464del, rs776404064) and a novel variant c.1294delA (p.Arg432Glyfs*37). The HEK-293T expression system was used to investigate the variants, demonstrating negligible aldosterone synthesis compared with WT CYP11B2. The patient started fludrocortisone and subsequently gained 3.2 kg of weight and normalized serum sodium (137 mmol/L). We further reviewed reported cases of ASD, summarizing clinical features and CYP11B2 mutations; missense and nonsense mutations are most frequent. Fludrocortisone treatment is essential for ASD, and the need for mineralocorticoid replacement wanes with age; eventually, therapy can be discontinued for many affected children.

Sequence analysis of CYP11B2, the gene encoding aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for c.168G>A, p.W56X in exon 1 and c.1149C>T, p.R384X in exon 7. p.W56X was inherited from his mother and p.R384X was from his father. Since both alleles contain nonsense mutations, a lack of CYP11B2 activity was speculated to cause his condition. To our knowledge, this is the first Japanese patient in which the molecular basis of aldosterone synthase deficiency type 1 has been clarified. This case also indicates that spot urinary steroid analysis is useful for diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Kondo E","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Two novel mutations of the CYP11B2 gene in a Japanese patient with aldosterone deficiency type 1."}},{"id":"cggv:60678104-1274-416e-aa81-5e4f981574d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bbfcd1f1-5265-4934-8d4f-f4d08c5f865e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23018980"}],"rdfs:label":"Kondo Proband"},{"id":"cggv:60678104-1274-416e-aa81-5e4f981574d2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:60678104-1274-416e-aa81-5e4f981574d2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:dc2db7e9-9cd6-4981-8be8-cfe470ae455a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc2db7e9-9cd6-4981-8be8-cfe470ae455a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f811fbd-b91f-4e3f-be4a-f6cb4de30aab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd2e1840-d582-4d09-a1a1-49643bb48e93","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Expressed sporadically in the zona glomerulosa (zG) of the adrenal cortex (conventional zonation), as well as in aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCCs) composed of morphological zG cells in contact with the capsule (variegated zonation).

Aldosterone synthase deficiency usually finds its expression in infancy as a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, caused by mutations in the CYP11B2 gene. Therefore, in depth studies of mutations and their enzymatic activities will provide information for the diagnosis and management of hypoaldosteronism caused by CYP11B2 deficiencies. Here, we report the development of a fast and cheap whole-cell technology for the enzymatic characterisation of CYP11B2 mutations. The principle of the new system is the heterologous expression of the mutants of CYP11B2 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) followed by steroid bioconversion assays for the enzymatic characterisation of the investigated mutants. The new system was validated and 10 known mutations of CYP11B2 have been investigated, two of them for the first time concerning their effect on the CYP11B2 three-step reaction. The results of the fission yeast system were in good agreement with the cell culture results presenting this new system as an alternative non radioactive method that can be applied for the enzymatic characterisation of CYP11B2 mutations.","dc:creator":"Tin MK","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a new system for the investigation of corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency-causing mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Aldosterone synthase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7447,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3718a298-0d18-4471-9b78-f09ef851cea3","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0011754","gene":"hgnc:2592","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The *CYP11B2* gene is located on chromosome 8 at q24.3 and encodes the cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 2. \nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their inheritance pattern or phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: congenital hypoaldosteronism due to CMO I deficiency (OMIM:203400) and congenital hypoaldosteronism due to CMO II deficiency (OMIM:610600). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism - *CYP11B2*’.\n\n*CYP11B2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism in 1992 (Pascoe et al., PMID: 1594605). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. Familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism typically presents in infancy as a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, characterized by failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, and severe dehydration. A history of diarrhea, lethargy, poor weight gain, and poor feeding since birth may also be present. \n\nAt least 9 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) have been reported in 5 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 12788848, 23018980, 31302112, 32539318, 34243750 included in this curation). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and biochemical function. CYP11B2 is expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal glands and is used to synthesize aldosterone, with biallelic variation leading to aldosterone deficiency causing disease (PMIDs: 20200334, 21237269). A total of 1/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CYP11B2* and autosomal recessive familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
