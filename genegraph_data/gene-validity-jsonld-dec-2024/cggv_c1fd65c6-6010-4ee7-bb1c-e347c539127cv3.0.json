Ten causative genes (NPHP1-NPHP9 and NPHP11), whose products localize to the primary cilia-centrosome complex, support the unifying concept that cystic kidney diseases are \"ciliopathies\". Using genome-wide homozygosity mapping, we report here what we believe to be a new locus (NPHP-like 1 [NPHPL1]) for an NPHP-like nephropathy. In 2 families with an NPHP-like phenotype, we detected homozygous frameshift and splice-site mutations, respectively, in the X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3 (XPNPEP3) gene. In contrast to all known NPHP proteins, XPNPEP3 localizes to mitochondria of renal cells. However, in vivo analyses also revealed a likely cilia-related function; suppression of zebrafish xpnpep3 phenocopied the developmental phenotypes of ciliopathy morphants, and this effect was rescued by human XPNPEP3 that was devoid of a mitochondrial localization signal. Consistent with a role for XPNPEP3 in ciliary function, several ciliary cystogenic proteins were found to be XPNPEP3 substrates, for which resistance to N-terminal proline cleavage resulted in attenuated protein function in vivo in zebrafish. Our data highlight an emerging link between mitochondria and ciliary dysfunction, and suggest that further understanding the enzymatic activity and substrates of XPNPEP3 will illuminate novel cystogenic pathways.","dc:creator":"O'Toole JF","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Individuals with mutations in XPNPEP3, which encodes a mitochondrial protein, develop a nephronophthisis-like nephropathy."}},"rdfs:label":"A313 II-4 "},{"id":"cggv:d93059bf-6f91-40bf-9be0-f0b5a0b2d3c0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d93059bf-6f91-40bf-9be0-f0b5a0b2d3c0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.05,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity: only counted once, not twice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c9bb53ce-dc50-498e-b7bf-c21b5593008b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c9bb53ce-dc50-498e-b7bf-c21b5593008b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:b4864450-da45-4dbd-a3bd-2ad0ab68039b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"XPNPEP3, 4-BP DEL, 931AACA","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/52"}},"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis of 116 consanguineous families to find genomic segments in common.

This protein has been shown to localize to the mitochondria of kidney cells and have a role in ciliary function. (provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011). \n\n*XPNPEP3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Nephronophthisis-like Nephropathy 1 (NPHPL1) in 2010 (O'Toole et al. PMID: 20179356). The mechanism of disease is biallelic loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 29383790, 32660933,37599822,38035175, DOI: 10.1681/ASN.20233411S1571a). Unpublished data was included in this curation, a patient with a consistent phenotype associated with compound heterozygous null variants (Molecular Biology Laboratory, Fundació Puigvert and  submitted to ClinVar), increasing the final score by 3.0 points for a total of 11.3 genetic evidence points. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction, in vitro functional assays, and a zebrafish and a mouse model (PMID: 20179356, 37599822). There is significant correlation between β-catenin nuclear localization and XPNPEP3 levels, suggesting *XPNPEP3* has a role in Wnt-mediated regulation of ciliary development (Kumar et al. 2018; PMID: 29383790, non-scorable evidence).\n\nIn summary, there is Definitive evidence to support *XPNPEP3* as a cause of an autosomal recessive ciliopathy. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 04/28/2021 (SOP Version 8). It was reevaluated on 6/10/2024 (SOP Version 10). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Moderate to Definitive. \nA patient with consistent phenotypes and two compound heterozygous null variants submitted to ClinVar (Molecular Biology Laboratory, Fundació Puigvert), and a proband from Xunzi Tang et al., 2023 (DOI: 10.1681/ASN.20233411S1571a) with nephronophthisis and compound heterozygous for a missense and nonsense mutation were included in this curation. The genetic evidence increased by 4.6 points for a total of 14.3 points.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c1fd65c6-6010-4ee7-bb1c-e347c539127c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
