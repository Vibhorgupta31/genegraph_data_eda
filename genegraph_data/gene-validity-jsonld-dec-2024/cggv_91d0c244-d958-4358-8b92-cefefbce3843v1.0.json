Cells cultured from XP patients are both UV sensitive and defective in the nucleotide excision repair of damaged DNA. These cellular phenotypes are amenable to experimental strategies employing complementation, an approach previously used to demonstrate the correction of XP-D phenotypes following the introduction of the XPD (ERCC2) gene. In the present study, we have characterized the genomic organization of the XPD (ERCC2) gene and found it to be comprised of 23 exons. These data were helpful in evaluating the functional integrity of alleles in two XP-D cell lines. In cell line GM436 a C-->G transversion was found at nucleotide position 1411 in the XPD (ERCC2) cDNA, a change expected to result in a Leu461Val substitution. Cell line XP67MA carries a C-->T transition in genomic DNA at nucleotide position 2176 in exon 22, introducing the termination codon TAG at amino acid 726. The latter would be expected to produce a protein truncated by 34 amino acids. Although expression of the normal XPD cDNA could be shown to correct the UV sensitivity phenotype in XP-D cells, cDNA constructs bearing either of the two mutations failed to yield complementation. These results confirm the role of ERCC2 in XP-D and illustrate the power of utilizing cellular phenotypes to evaluate the significance of single nucleotide substitutions.","dc:creator":"Frederick GD","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Structural and mutational analysis of the xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7849702","rdfs:label":"GM436"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Mutant allele were unable to complement the sensitivity of XP-D cells to UV radiation (fig.4)."},{"id":"cggv:25bf5401-b0f3-4ce1-99e0-ea427206f647_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc4778f0-874d-40d3-8803-617a1d6d6888","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":18,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000992","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:25bf5401-b0f3-4ce1-99e0-ea427206f647_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:14c343f0-2483-48b7-9583-12c934222449","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000400.3(ERCC2):c.1847G>C (p.Arg616Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/329508"}},{"id":"cggv:683d46ea-5067-4ed1-9178-12eb25588bf5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000400.3(ERCC2):c.2048G>A (p.Arg683Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/264679"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22826098","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The XPD protein plays a pivotal role in basal transcription and in nucleotide excision repair (NER) as one of the ten known components of the transcription factor TFIIH.

We also describe four patients from one family, homozygous for the identical p.R683Q mutation in XPD, who exhibit mild skin pigmentation and loss of tendon reflexes. Three homozygous patients presented with late-onset skin tumors, and two with features of premature aging and moderate cognitive decline.

TFIIH has two functions, in basal transcription and nucleotide excision repair. Mutations in XPD that affect DNA repair but not transcription result in the skin cancer-prone disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). If transcription is also affected, the result is the multi-system disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD), in which there is no skin cancer predisposition, or in rare cases, XP combined with Cockayne syndrome. Up till now there have been no reports of combined clinical features of XP and TTD. We have now identified two patients with some features of both these disorders. One of these, XP189MA, a 3-year-old girl with sun sensitivity, mental and physical developmental delay, has XPD mutations not previously reported, and barely detectable levels of nucleotide excision repair. The other, XP38BR, a 28-year-old woman with sun sensitivity, pigmentation changes and skin cancers typical of XP, has a mutation that has been identified previously, but only in TTD patients with no features of XP. The level of repair of UV damage in XP38BR is substantially higher than that in other patients with the same mutation. With both patients, polarized light microscopy revealed a 'tiger-tail' appearance of the hair, and amino acid analysis of the hair shafts show levels of sulfur-containing proteins intermediate between those of normal and TTD individuals.

Some XP group D patients exhibit clinical symptoms of other genetic disorders, CS, and TTD. The XP group D gene (XPD gene) product is required for nucleotide excision repair and is one of the components of basal transcription factor TFIIH as well. Therefore, different mutations in the XPD gene may result in a variety of clinical manifestations. Here we report on two causative mutations of the XPD gene in XP61OS, a Japanese XP group D patient who has only mild skin symptoms of XP without CS, TTD, or other neurological complications. One of the mutations was the 4-bp deletion at nucleotides 668-671, resulting in frameshift and truncation of the protein. The other was a nucleotide substitution leading to Ser-541 to Arg (S541R) in helicase domain IV of the XPD protein. The patient's father was heterozygous for the 4-bp deletion, while the mother was heterozygous for the S541R mutation. Thus, the parents were obligate carriers of the XP-D trait. The expression study showed that the XPD cDNA containing the deletion or the S541R missense mutation failed to restore the UV sensitivity of XP6BE, group DaXP cells, while the wild-type XPD cDNA restored it to the normal level. However, the transfectant expressing the XPD cDNA with the missense mutation was slightly more resistant than the parental XP6BE cells. These findings are consistent with the mild symptoms of the XP61OS patient.","dc:creator":"Kobayashi T","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutations in the XPD gene leading to xeroderma pigmentosum symptoms."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9101292","rdfs:label":"XP61OS"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"XPD cDNA containing the deletion or the S541R missense mutation failed to restore the UV sensitivity of XP6BE, group D XP cells, while the wild-type XPD cDNA restored it to the normal level."},{"id":"cggv:1c3752ae-2e7a-4d1c-b239-7e74badd9755_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37e7053e-3fdc-4f3c-8697-71a43a1779bf","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000992","obo:HP_0008069"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:1c3752ae-2e7a-4d1c-b239-7e74badd9755_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:732ea9b6-d76b-481a-9ded-133e8e5fb265","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000400.3(ERCC2):c.2176C>T (p.Gln726Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/16780"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7849702"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7849702","rdfs:label":"XP67MA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"A 2176C-T transition in exon 22 of the ERCC2 gene, changing codon 726 from CAG (gln) to TAG (stop).
