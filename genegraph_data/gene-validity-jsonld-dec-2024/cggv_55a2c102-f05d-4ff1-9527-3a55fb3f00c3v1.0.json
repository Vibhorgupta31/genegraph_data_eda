Human complex I comprises seven subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA and 38 nuclear-encoded subunits that are assembled together in a process that is only partially understood. To date, mutations causing complex I deficiency have been described in all 14 core subunits, five supernumerary subunits, and four assembly factors. We describe complex I deficiency caused by mutation of the putative complex I assembly factor C20orf7. A candidate region for a lethal neonatal form of complex I deficiency was identified by homozygosity mapping of an Egyptian family with one affected child and two affected pregnancies predicted by enzyme-based prenatal diagnosis. The region was confirmed by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, and 11 candidate genes encoding potential mitochondrial proteins were sequenced. A homozygous missense mutation in C20orf7 segregated with disease in the family. We show that C20orf7 is peripherally associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and that silencing its expression with RNAi decreases complex I activity. C20orf7 patient fibroblasts showed an almost complete absence of complex I holoenzyme and were defective at an early stage of complex I assembly, but in a manner distinct from the assembly defects caused by mutations in the assembly factor NDUFAF1.

Little is known about the function of the protein and the cytopathological consequences of the mutations. Disruption of Dictyostelium Ndufaf5 leads to CI deficiency and defects in growth and development. The predicted sequence of Ndufaf5 contains a putative methyltransferase domain. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the methyltransferase motif is essential for its function. Pathological mutations were recreated in the Dictyostelium protein and expressed in the mutant background. These proteins were unable to complement the phenotypes, which further validates Dictyostelium as a model of the disease. Chronic activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed to play a role in Dictyostelium and human cytopathology in mitochondrial diseases. However, inhibition of the expression of AMPK gene in the Ndufaf5-null mutant does not rescue the phenotypes associated with the lack of Ndufaf5, suggesting that novel AMPK-independent pathways are responsible for Ndufaf5 cytopathology. Of interest, the Ndufaf5-deficient strain shows an increase in autophagy. This phenomenon was also observed in a Dictyostelium mutant lacking MidA (C2orf56/PRO1853/Ndufaf7), another CI assembly factor, suggesting that autophagy activation might be a common feature in mitochondrial CI dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Carilla-Latorre S","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Ndufaf5 deficiency in the Dictyostelium model: new roles in autophagy and development."},"rdfs:label":"Dictyostelium model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Poor growth = 0.5; C1 deficiency = 0.5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:55a2c102-f05d-4ff1-9527-3a55fb3f00c3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55a2c102-f05d-4ff1-9527-3a55fb3f00c3_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b48c3c5b-b619-46b4-b9be-80a7771d25e5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78e8ceb0-3f17-4ccf-926e-4485ab6a10a8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Data was obtained with parental consent (CHOC approved IRB 130990); re-analysis of clinical sequencing data on a research basis revealed a potential disease candidate variant in exon 3 of NDUFAF5 at position c.327G>C, p.Lys109Asn (maternal) (all nomenclature refers to NM_024120, CCDS13118.1, NP_077025 ISOFORM 1) (Fig. 2A), which had bypassed the clinical filtering criteria.\n\nTo investigate the location of a potential second intronic NDUFAF5 mutation we filtered the patient's 7,181,082 WGS variants for NDUFAF5, which resulted in 45 hits.

This study is to investigate the performance characteristics of trio whole exome sequencing (Trio-WES) in a pediatric setting by presenting our patient cohort and displaying the diagnostic yield. A total of 31 pediatric patients showing neurodevelopmental delay accompanied unexplained dyspnea were admitted to our hospital and referred for molecular genetic testing using Trio-WES. Eight genes namely MMACHC, G6PC, G6PT, ETFDH, OTC, NDUFAF5, SLC22A5, and MAGEL2 were suspected to be responsible for the onset of the clinical symptoms and 6 variants were novel. Standard interpretation according to ACMG guideline showed that the variants were pathogenic. Finally, diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, glycogen storage disease, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, glutaric acidemia II, mitochondrial complex 1 deficiency, carnitine deficiency, and Schaaf-Yang syndrome was made in 12 out of the 31 patients. Trio-WES is an effective means for molecular diagnosis of infantile neurodevelopmental delay accompanied unexplained dyspnea. As for molecular etiology identification, when routine potential monogenetic inheritance patterns including de novo, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and X-linked recessive inheritance analysis is negative, physicians should take into account imprinted genes.","dc:creator":"Tong W","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Whole-exome Sequencing Helps the Diagnosis and Treatment in Children with Neurodevelopmental Delay Accompanied Unexplained Dyspnea."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29581464","rdfs:label":"P16"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"No functional testing performed in this patient but one variant (M279R) reported in others with functional validation performed."},{"id":"cggv:b91ec186-3e45-459f-a0e1-58b6e12c3cc4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2eeaf422-1f40-48c0-8016-e9fc522fcf24","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"For family I, in which an isolated complex I deficiency in muscle was initially reported, homozygosity mapping seemed to be the most promising approach, given the numerous proteins involved in complex I structure and assembly, of which most produce a similar biochemical phenotype.

The NDUFAF5 gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor 5. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFAF5 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2010 (PMID: 19542079). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven unique variants identified in seven unrelated cases from four publications (PMID: 19542079, 21607760, 29581464, 30473481). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in non-patient cells, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 18940309, 25613900, 19542079, 23536703).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the gene-disease association.
