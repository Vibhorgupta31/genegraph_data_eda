Using Affymetrix 250K SNP Array genotyping and homozygosity mapping, we mapped an autosomal-recessive LGMD phenotype to the telomeric portion of chromosome 8q in a consanguineous Turkish family with three affected individuals. DNA sequence analysis of PLEC identified a homozygous c.1_9del mutation containing an initiation codon in exon 1f, which is an isoform-specific sequence of plectin isoform 1f. The same homozygous mutation was also detected in two additional families during the analysis of 72 independent LGMD2-affected families. Moreover, we showed that the expression of PLEC was reduced in the patient's muscle and that there was almost no expression for plectin 1f mRNA as a result of the mutation. In addition to dystrophic changes in muscle, ultrastructural alterations, such as membrane duplications, an enlarged space between the membrane and sarcomere, and misalignment of Z-disks, were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Unlike the control skeletal muscle, no sarcolemmal staining of plectin was detected in the patient's muscle. We conclude that as a result of plectin 1f deficiency, the linkage between the sarcolemma and sarcomere is broken, which could affect the structural organization of the myofiber. Our data show that one of the isoforms of plectin plays a key role in skeletal muscle function and that disruption of the plectin 1f can cause the LGMD2 phenotype without any dermatologic component as was previously reported with mutations in constant exons of PLEC.","dc:creator":"Gundesli H","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutation in exon 1f of PLEC, leading to disruption of plectin isoform 1f, causes autosomal-recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67674d96-8b18-4139-8b88-317f63485a14_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67674d96-8b18-4139-8b88-317f63485a14_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3653cb2f-7516-4d63-8422-6218e5ee36a8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b5049d9-678b-462a-94ed-e1ce917de801","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both the plectin deficient mouse model and humans with plectinopathies share a phenotype of altered mitochondrial morphology and function including altered cristae structure and massive subsarcolemmal aggregation of mitochondria, and the presence of fibers with attenuated levels of mitochondria.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26019234","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Plectin, a versatile 500-kDa cytolinker protein, is essential for muscle fiber integrity and function. The most common disease caused by mutations in the human plectin gene, epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD), is characterized by severe skin blistering and progressive muscular dystrophy. Besides displaying pathological desmin-positive protein aggregates and degenerative changes in the myofibrillar apparatus, skeletal muscle specimens of EBS-MD patients and plectin-deficient mice are characterized by massive mitochondrial alterations. In this study, we demonstrate that structural and functional alterations of mitochondria are a primary aftermath of plectin deficiency in muscle, contributing to myofiber degeneration. We found that in skeletal muscle of conditional plectin knockout mice (MCK-Cre/cKO), mitochondrial content was reduced, and mitochondria were aggregated in sarcoplasmic and subsarcolemmal regions and were no longer associated with Z-disks. Additionally, decreased mitochondrial citrate synthase activity, respiratory function and altered adenosine diphosphate kinetics were characteristic of plectin-deficient muscles. To analyze a mechanistic link between plectin deficiency and mitochondrial alterations, we comparatively assessed mitochondrial morphology and function in whole muscle and teased muscle fibers of wild-type, MCK-Cre/cKO and plectin isoform-specific knockout mice that were lacking just one isoform (either P1b or P1d) while expressing all others. Monitoring morphological alterations of mitochondria, an isoform P1b-specific phenotype affecting the mitochondrial fusion-fission machinery and manifesting with upregulated mitochondrial fusion-associated protein mitofusin-2 could be identified. Our results show that the depletion of distinct plectin isoforms affects mitochondrial network organization and function in different ways.

Positive Gowers sign and myasthenic phenotypes have also been noted in the literature in probands with asserted autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. *PLEC* has also been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS)5A (Ogna type), EBS5B (with muscular dystrophy), EBS5C (with pyloric astresia), and EBS5D (generalized intermediate). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in the phenotypic variability and molecular mechanisms among the EBS disease entities and isolated autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMDR17 included). Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities whereby autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMDR17 included) is to be curated separately from EBS 5A-5D(OMIM IDs: 131950, 226670, 612138, and 616487). Probands asserted to have autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy have not had any reported skin phenotype that is characteristically observed in EBS cases. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying EBS with muscular dystrophy (EBS5B) has primarily been nonsense, out-of-frame insertions or deletions within exon 31 and 32, leading to premature protein termination. The mechanism underlying autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy appears to be recessive truncating variants in exon 1f. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nFor autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMDR17 included), a 9-bp deletion variant has been reported in seven probands in two publications (PMIDs: 21109228, 32605089); the probands have been included in this curation. The homozygous deletion variant segregated with disease in 3 additional members of one of the reported families (PMID: 21109228). Homozygosity mapping of the affected individuals suggests a possible founder event in the Turkish population. This deletion contains the initiation codon in one of the alternate first exons of PLEC (exon 1f). It is the first variant to be reported in an alternate first exon. The alternate first exons produce 8 different plectin isoforms, each with specific functionality. The plectin 1f isoform is one of the scaffolds for costameric protein. The (c.1_9del) variant was reported using the NM_201378 MANE transcript in both publications. Additional variants in *PLEC* have been noted in the literature in patients with asserted LGMD (PMIDs:28447722, 25556389, 28824526, 32576226) however, this curation does not include probands who harbored missense variants nor variants in other transcripts that have no impact on the plectin 1f isoform. At this time there is insufficient evidence to evaluate gene-disease association in the case of compound heterozygosity where one of the two variants is not specific to the 1f isoform. The evidence presented in this curation solely applies to biallelic variants impacting the 1f isoform in relation to isolated autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMDR17 included).\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by an animal model (PMID: 26019234). Knockdown of *PLEC* in a mouse model supported a role of *PLEC* in mitochondrial morphology and organization in skeletal muscle; a phenotype that is also present in humans.\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\nSummary of Case Level Data: 4.5 POINTS Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 21109228, 32605089). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members (Family 1; PMID:21109228). The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 21109228)\nSummary of Experimental Data: 2 POINTS This gene-disease association is supported by an animal model. Conditional knockdown (MCK-Cre/cKO) of PLEC in a mouse model reduced mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity and altered mitochondrial morphology and position at Z-disk structures in heart and in soleus and gastrocnemius skeletal muscle, supporting the role of plectin in altered muscular phenotype (PMID: 26019234).\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on the meeting date of May 9, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:67674d96-8b18-4139-8b88-317f63485a14"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
