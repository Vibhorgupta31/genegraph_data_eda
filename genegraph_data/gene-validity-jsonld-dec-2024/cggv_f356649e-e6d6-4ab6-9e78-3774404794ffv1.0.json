Here, homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a consanguineous family revealed a homozygous missense mutation, c.973C>T (p.His325Tyr), in RCBTB1. In affected individuals, it was found to segregate with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), goiter, primary ovarian insufficiency, and mild intellectual disability. Subsequent analysis of WES data in different cohorts uncovered four additional homozygous missense mutations in five unrelated families in whom iRD segregates with or without syndromic features. Ocular phenotypes ranged from typical RP starting in the second decade to chorioretinal dystrophy with a later age of onset. The five missense mutations affect highly conserved residues either in the sixth repeat of the RCC1 domain or in the BTB1 domain. A founder haplotype was identified for mutation c.919G>A (p.Val307Met), occurring in two families of Mediterranean origin. We showed ubiquitous mRNA expression of RCBTB1 and demonstrated predominant RCBTB1 localization in human inner retina. RCBTB1 was very recently shown to be involved in ubiquitination, more specifically as a CUL3 substrate adaptor. Therefore, the effect on different components of the CUL3 and NFE2L2 (NRF2) pathway was assessed in affected individuals' lymphocytes, revealing decreased mRNA expression of NFE2L2 and several NFE2L2 target genes. In conclusion, our study puts forward mutations in RCBTB1 as a cause of autosomal-recessive non-syndromic and syndromic iRD. Finally, our data support a role for impaired ubiquitination in the pathogenetic mechanism of RCBTB1 mutations.

Here, we characterized the effects of RCBTB1 gene deficiency in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells derived from a patient with RCBTB1-associated retinopathy and restored RCBTB1 expression in these cells using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with compound heterozygous RCBTB1 mutations (c.170delG and c.707delA) and healthy control subjects were differentiated into RPE cells. RPE cells were treated with AAV vectors carrying a RCBTB1 transgene. Patient-derived RPE cells showed reduced expression of RCBTB1. Expression of NFE2L2 showed a non-significant reduction in patient RPE cells compared with controls, while expression of its target genes (RXRA, IDH1 and SLC25A25) was significantly reduced. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance, surface microvillus densities and primary cilium lengths were reduced in patient-derived RPE cells, compared with controls. Treatment of patient RPE with AAV vectors significantly increased RCBTB1, NFE2L2 and RXRA expression and cilium lengths. Our study provides the first report examining the phenotype of RPE cells derived from a patient with RCBTB1-associated retinopathy. Furthermore, treatment of patient-derived RPE with AAV-RCBTB1 vectors corrected deficits in gene expression and RPE ultrastructure, supporting the use of gene replacement therapy for treating this inherited retinal disease.","dc:creator":"Huang Z","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Gene replacement therapy restores RCBTB1 expression and cilium length in patient-derived retinal pigment epithelium."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in patient-derived iPSC"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0250c6ce-5fff-4529-967e-260d78bead78","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f818de4b-44b6-4ad0-9b7a-3d9922bfc123","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Targeted qPCR-based expression analysis of mRNA from RCBTB1 shows strong expression in retina and limited expression in RPE (compared to positive control genes CEP290 and CRB1)\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27486781","rdfs:label":"Expression human retina"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fcdcac9f-b5db-4396-b45f-fb0661fadcf5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:10f295da-413c-4e4d-a9c3-87855dec1d8c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RCBTB1 immunoreactivity in the murine retina mainly localized to the inner retina","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27486781","rdfs:label":"Expression in murine retina"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:f356649e-e6d6-4ab6-9e78-3774404794ff_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f09394c0-f8f2-4a3a-a52c-a51aee10a6eb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72f6d126-c9c0-4a96-89ae-566d2219a6a0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Development of RPE barrier function impaired and mean cilium length is reduced (though not significant).

All had retinal disease, with phenotypes ranging from retinitis pigmentosa to chorioretinal macular atrophy. 7 of the individuals from the initial publication had extra-ocular features, primarily affecting the thyroid, ovary, and/or inner ear. The RCBTB1 gene was therefore associated with the disease entity retinal dystrophy with or without extraocular anomalies (MIM# 617175). \n\nIn total, 12 variants (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in 11 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 27486781, 33104391, 35057699, 33624564) are included in this curation. A total of 16 affected individuals were reported in those 4 publications. All had retinopathy, and 8/16 (50%) were reported to have one or more extra-ocular feature, such as symptoms affecting the thyroid, ovary, ear, kidney, and/or neurologic system. 4 of these individuals with reported extra-ocular manifestations were from consanguineous families (3 from the same extended family). No clear pattern of extra-ocular features is evident at this time. Therefore, the Retina GCEP has curated this gene for RCBTB1-related retinopathy, as opposed to a syndromic entity. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF (PMID: 31494449). While not counted in this curation, members of the Retina GCEP have observed at least 6 additional patients affected with retinopathy with potentially causative RCBTB1 variants and no other molecular genetic diagnosis on panel testing (unpublished, Invitae; unpublished, Blueprint). Of note, there is a report of 3 individuals from 2 families with heterozygous RCBTB1 variants with Coats disease and/or FEVR (Wu et al., 2016; PMID: 26908610). However, others report that RCBTB1 does not appear to be enriched in FEVR cohorts as compared to controls (Yang et al., 2021; PMID: 33104391). At this time, there is not sufficient evidence to curate this gene for these phenotypes or autosomal dominant inheritance. \n\nThis gene-disease association of RCBTB1 with autosomal recessive retinopathy is also supported by experimental evidence including expression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 27486781, 34617687). Expression analysis of mRNA shows strong expression in human retina and limited expression in RPE, and RCBTB1 immunoreactivity in the murine retina mainly localized to the inner retina (PMID: 27486781). In addition, RCBTB1 expression reduced in patient RPE compared to control (PMID: 34617687). In cultured RPE cells, RCBTB1 expression reduced in patient RPE compared to control (PMID: 34617687) and morphologic differences (flattened appearance and reduced surface microvillus densities) were observed in cilia in patient-derived RPE cells as compared to control cells (PMID: 34617687). \n\nIn summary, RCBTB1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RCBTB1-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
