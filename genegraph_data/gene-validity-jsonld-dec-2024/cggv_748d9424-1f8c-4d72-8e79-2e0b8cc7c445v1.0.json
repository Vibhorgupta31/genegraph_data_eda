In contrast, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is caused by >50 known genes, which still explain only half of the clinical cases. In a single, one-generation, nonsyndromic RP family, we have identified a gene, dehydrodolichol diphosphate synthase (DHDDS), demonstrating the power of combining whole-exome sequencing with rapid in vivo studies. DHDDS is a highly conserved essential enzyme for dolichol synthesis, permitting global N-linked glycosylation. Zebrafish studies showed virtually identical photoreceptor defects as observed with N-linked glycosylation-interfering mutations in the light-sensing protein rhodopsin. The identified Lys42Glu variant likely arose from an ancestral founder, because eight of the nine identified alleles in 27,174 control chromosomes were of confirmed Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity.

Using homozygosity mapping in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) patients with autosomal-recessive RP (arRP), we identified a shared 1.7 Mb homozygous region on chromosome 1p36.11. Sequence analysis revealed a founder homozygous missense mutation, c.124A>G (p.Lys42Glu), in the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase gene (DHDDS) in 20 AJ patients with RP of 15 unrelated families. The mutation was not identified in an additional set of 109 AJ patients with RP, in 20 AJ patients with other inherited retinal diseases, or in 70 patients with retinal degeneration of other ethnic origins. The mutation was found heterozygously in 1 out of 322 ethnically matched normal control individuals. RT-PCR analysis in 21 human tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of DHDDS. Immunohistochemical analysis of the human retina with anti-DHDDS antibodies revealed intense labeling of the cone and rod photoreceptor inner segments. Clinical manifestations of patients who are homozygous for the c.124A>G mutation were within the spectrum associated with arRP. Most patients had symptoms of night and peripheral vision loss, nondetectable electroretinographic responses, constriction of visual fields, and funduscopic hallmarks of retinal degeneration. DHDDS is a key enzyme in the pathway of dolichol, which plays an important role in N-glycosylation of many glycoproteins, including rhodopsin. Our results support a pivotal role of DHDDS in retinal function and may allow for new therapeutic interventions for RP.","dc:creator":"Zelinger L","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A missense mutation in DHDDS, encoding dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase, is associated with autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa in Ashkenazi Jews."}],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:748d9424-1f8c-4d72-8e79-2e0b8cc7c445_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:748d9424-1f8c-4d72-8e79-2e0b8cc7c445_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bfe2a6a0-c6b0-4742-a2b4-cec6347a05c4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57a4cda8-4add-4963-83ca-8f9b4736c82b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells, expressing hCIT (DHDDS)-HA and the reciprocal immunoprecipitation of NgBR (NUS1)-FLAG showed that the two proteins interact with one another (Figure 6A and B).

Mutations that could be sufficient to cause pathology were observed in more than one gene in one pedigree.","dc:creator":"Biswas P","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Genetic analysis of 10 pedigrees with inherited retinal degeneration by exome sequencing and phenotype-genotype association."}},"rdfs:label":"Biswas et al, Pedigree 8 (RF.TE.0512), II-I"},{"id":"cggv:d56cf019-9e8a-491f-8d62-35f7b2b74e84","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d56cf019-9e8a-491f-8d62-35f7b2b74e84_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d56cf019-9e8a-491f-8d62-35f7b2b74e84_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"See previous entry."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:748d9424-1f8c-4d72-8e79-2e0b8cc7c445_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1bd7be3c-ee06-4e3c-9386-e38502846fb1","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1bd7be3c-ee06-4e3c-9386-e38502846fb1_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","caseCohort":{"id":"cggv:c2f5702b-2312-4c7f-85a4-8bd883332779","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":246,"alleleFrequency":0.1219512195121951,"detectionMethod":"3 initial probands identified underwent sequencing of all DHDDS exons and intron/exon junctions; subsequent group was \"screened\" (details not given)","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1bd7be3c-ee06-4e3c-9386-e38502846fb1_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":30,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0019118"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"cggv:1522ad1d-8b80-4849-a004-1c3b9269bbb9","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":644,"alleleFrequency":0.0015527950310559,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1bd7be3c-ee06-4e3c-9386-e38502846fb1_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":1},"method":{"id":"cg:SingleVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.001,"statisticalSignificanceType":"Fisher’sexacttest","statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Other","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295282","rdfs:label":"Zelinger et al; case-control"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlSingleVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"The DHDDS p.Lys42Glu variant was found in 1 of 644 chromosomes in the control group versus 30 of 246 chromosomes in patients; the number of homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type individuals was 0, 1, and 321, respectively, in controls compared to 15, 0, and 108 in patients."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:7394b113-97cb-40cd-a04c-604eb8e20167_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7394b113-97cb-40cd-a04c-604eb8e20167","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2a2e00c6-65b9-4ec8-ba20-d83cbd2b112c"},"detectionMethod":"\"Gene sequencing\"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"No clinical details available.","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:4e49e4fc-02a5-420a-b96c-a2394e061050_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2a2e00c6-65b9-4ec8-ba20-d83cbd2b112c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29276052","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To analyze the genetic and clinical findings in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent, aiming to identify genotype-phenotype correlations.","dc:creator":"Kimchi A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Nonsyndromic Retinitis Pigmentosa in the Ashkenazi Jewish Population: Genetic and Clinical Aspects."}},"rdfs:label":"Kimchi et al, MOL1230 proband"},{"id":"cggv:4e49e4fc-02a5-420a-b96c-a2394e061050","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e49e4fc-02a5-420a-b96c-a2394e061050_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4e49e4fc-02a5-420a-b96c-a2394e061050_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"See previous entry."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:748d9424-1f8c-4d72-8e79-2e0b8cc7c445_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":0.8},{"id":"cggv:45c14b2b-bfde-4913-ae8d-bb05bb9b6e0e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:45c14b2b-bfde-4913-ae8d-bb05bb9b6e0e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":50,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2a2e00c6-65b9-4ec8-ba20-d83cbd2b112c"},"detectionMethod":"Unclear geotyping method.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern for “retinitis pigmentosa 59” and “congenital disorder of glycosylation, type 1bb”. In fact, OMIM has given these two disorders the same MIM#, although note is made that the association of DHDDS with “congenital disorder of glycosylation, type 1bb” is described as provisional in OMIM. Due to the possibility for that additional symptoms could be present but mild in individuals reported with only retinal dystrophy and that additional symptoms may develop later in life, “retinitis pigmentosa 59” and “congenital disorder of glycosylation, type 1bb” were lumped together for the purposes of this curation as “DHDDS-CDG”. In contrast, “developmental delay and seizures with or without movement abnormalities” (MIM# 617836) typically results from *de novo*, heterozygous variants, and does not include retinal dystrophy as part of the phenotypic characteristics (Mehta and Lal, 2023, PMID: 36628425). Therefore, this condition will be curated separately.\n\nFive variants (3 missense, one nonsense, one intronic) that have been reported in 12 probands in 7 publications are included in this curation (Züchner et al, 2011, PMID: 21295283; Sabry et al, 2016, PMID:  27343064; Biswas et al, 2017, PMID: 28130426; Kimchi et al, 2018, PMID: 29276052; Diñeiro et al, 2020, PMID: 32483926; Mousa et al, 2022, PMID: 36046393). To date, the majority of individuals reported in the literature with biallelic variants in *DHDDS* have been diagnosed with retinal dystrophy, typically described as retinitis pigmentosa, and are homozygous for a missense variant, p.Lys42Glu, that is a founder variant in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. At least 30 homozygotes have been reported in the literature, as well individuals who are compound heterozygous for p.Lys42Glu and another missense change (Wen et al, 2013, PMID: 24078709; Biswas et al, 2017, PMID: 28005406; Ramkumar et al, 2017, PMID: 28130426; Stone et al, 2017, PMID: 28559085Kimchi et al, 2018, PMID: 29276052; Sharon et al, 2020, PMID: 31456290). In addition to individuals reported with retinal dystrophy, without mention of other symptoms, two families have been described with a more complex phenotype that includes retinal dystrophy. In one of these families two affected siblings, homozygous for p.Lys42Glu, were reported with retinal dystrophy and later onset of neurological features including ataxia (Mousa et al, 2022, PMID: 36046393). In the other family, two children were severely affected from a young age with seizures, severe global developmental delay, no ERG response, and sensorineural deafness (Sabry et al, 2016, PMID:  27343064). In addition to individual case-level evidence, segregation data from two small families, each with 3 affected and one unaffected sibling (Züchner et al, 2011, PMID: 21295283; Zelinger et al, 2011, PMID: 21295282), and data from a single variant (p.Lys42Glu) case-control comparison between Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with and without retinal dystrophy (Zelinger et al, 2011, PMID: 21295282), supported this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of the gene product, which is consistent with the finding of shortened dolichol chains in patients (Bar-El et al, 202, PMID: 33077723; Wen et al, 2013, PMID: 24078709), functional alteration resulting from siRNA knockdown in HepG2 cells (Sabry et al, 2016, PMID: 27343064), protein interaction between the gene products of *DHDDS* and *NUS1*, a gene that when altered has also been associated with congenital disorder of glycosylation (Harrison et al, 2011, PMID: 21572394), and the features reported in various animal models (see Fliesler et al, 2022, PMID: 36362109 for review), including a p.Lys42Glu knock-in mouse (see Fliesler et al, 2022, PMID: 36362109 for review), a rod-specific *Dhdds* knock-out mouse (Ramachandra et al, 2020, PMID: 32526701), and in zebrafish and Drosophila with *Dhdds* orthologs knocked down by siRNA (Züchner et al, 2011, PMID: 21295283; Brandwine et al 2021, PMID: 34290587). A review of all animal models for “retinitis pigmentosa 59” is available (Fliesler et al, 2022, PMID: 36362109).\n\nIn summary, *DHDDS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive DHDDS-CDG. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\n(ClinGen Gene Curation SOP v9; Classification approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP, April 6, 2023).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:748d9424-1f8c-4d72-8e79-2e0b8cc7c445"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
