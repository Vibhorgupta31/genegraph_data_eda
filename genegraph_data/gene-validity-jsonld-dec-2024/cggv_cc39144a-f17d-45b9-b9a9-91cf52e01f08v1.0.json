Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Complex I subunits"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"These are complex I subunits."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:cc39144a-f17d-45b9-b9a9-91cf52e01f08_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c366021d-40d4-486f-ae30-5252f641582a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a2307a0a-d022-410a-a9da-48ad8594f96a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mitochondria isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts of  four patients with confirmed NDUFS4 mutations and described as having Leigh-like syndrome demonstrated reduced complex 1 activity, decreased levels of fully-assembled complex I, and the presence of a non-functional lower molecular weight sub complex.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14749350","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) deficiency is amongst the most encountered defects of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and is associated with a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms.

In this paper we have used blue native electrophoresis in order to study how different nuclear mutations affect the integrity of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes in fibroblasts from 15 complex I-deficient patients. Our results show an important decrease in the levels of intact complex I in patients harboring mutations in nuclear-encoded complex I subunits, indicating that complex I assembly and/or stability is compromised. Different patterns of low molecular weight subcomplexes are present in these patients, suggesting that the formation of the peripheral arm is affected at an early assembly stage. Mutations in complex I genes can also affect the stability of other mitochondrial complexes, with a specific decrease of fully-assembled complex III in patients with mutations in NDUFS2 and NDUFS4. We have extended this analysis to patients with an isolated complex I deficiency in which no mutations in structural subunits have been found. In this group, we can discriminate between complex I assembly and catalytic defects attending to the fact whether there is a correlation between assembly/activity levels or not.

In this report we show, for the first time, that a nuclear gene mutation in a structural, nuclear encoded complex I gene is associated with combined complex I and III deficiency. After our initial report we describe mutations in the NDUFS4 gene of complex I in two additional patients. The first mutation is a deletion of G at position 289 or 290. Amino acid 96 changes from a tryptophan to a stop codon. The mutation was found homozygous in the patient; both parents are heterozygous for the mutation. The second mutation is a transition from C to T at cDNA position 316. Codon is changed from CGA (arginine) to TGA (stop). The patient is homozygous for the mutation; both parents are heterozygous. Both mutations in the NDUFS4 gene led to a premature stop in Leigh-like patients with an early lethal phenotype.

In order to offer urgent prenatal diagnosis, we have studied an inbred/multiplex family with complex I deficiency by using microsatellite DNA markers flanking the putative disease loci. Microsatellite DNA markers have allowed us to exclude the NDUFS7, NDUFS8, NDUFV1 and NDUFS1 genes and to find homozygosity at the NDUFS4 locus. Direct sequencing has led to identification of a homozygous splice acceptor site mutation in intron 1 of the NDUFS4 gene (IVS1nt -1, G-->A); this was not found in chorion villi of the ongoing pregnancy. We suggest that genotyping microsatellite DNA markers at putative disease loci in inbred/multiplex families helps to identify the disease-causing mutation.

The *NDUFS4* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit S4, an iron-sulfur protein. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\n*NDUFS4* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 1998 (PMID: 9463323). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFS4*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFS4* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFS4* was previously curated by this GCEP on February 11, 2019 (SOP Version 6) as having a definitive association with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation includes cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.   \n\nEvidence supporting the relationship between *NDUFS4* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes nine variants identified in 11 unrelated probands from ten publications (PMIDs: 9463323, 14765537, 12616398, 22326555, 24020637, 27079373, 27671926, 10944442, 11181577, 35379322). Nonsense, frameshift, splice, and missense variants have been reported. Affected individuals present with complex I deficiency and variable other features with a typically progressive disease course. Leigh syndrome spectrum disorders are the most common presentation; however, there is a report of adolescent-onset dystonia and parkinsonism (PMID: 29264396). Age of onset is typically in infancy or childhood. Clinical features may include LSS, lactic acidosis, developmental delay and regression, dystonia, ataxia, seizures, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, bradycardia, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure, ophthalmoplegia, failure to thrive, and poor feeding. Complex I deficiency may be observed in muscle biopsy and/or cultured skin fibroblasts.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by a biochemical function in mitochondrial complex I shared by more than 10 other genes also associated with primary mitochondrial disease as well as functional alteration in patient cells and model systems including Drosophila and mouse (PMIDs: 33340416, 14749350, 29590638, 18396137, 22653057).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFS4* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cc39144a-f17d-45b9-b9a9-91cf52e01f08"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
