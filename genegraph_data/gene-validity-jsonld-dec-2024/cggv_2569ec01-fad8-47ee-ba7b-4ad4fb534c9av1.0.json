Ciliopathies are a spectrum of human diseases resulting from defects in cilia structure or function. The mechanisms regulating the assembly of ciliary multiprotein complexes and the transport of these complexes to the base of cilia remain largely unknown. Combining proteomics, in vivo imaging and genetic analysis of proteins linked to planar cell polarity (Inturned, Fuzzy and Wdpcp), we identified and characterized a new genetic module, which we term CPLANE (ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector), and an extensive associated protein network. CPLANE proteins physically and functionally interact with the poorly understood ciliopathy-associated protein Jbts17 at basal bodies, where they act to recruit a specific subset of IFT-A proteins. In the absence of CPLANE, defective IFT-A particles enter the axoneme and IFT-B trafficking is severely perturbed. Accordingly, mutation of CPLANE genes elicits specific ciliopathy phenotypes in mouse models and is associated with ciliopathies in human patients.","dc:creator":"Toriyama M","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"The ciliopathy-associated CPLANE proteins direct basal body recruitment of intraflagellar transport machinery."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The other mouse model (PMID: 24302887) was scored to avoid duplication."},{"id":"cggv:58a7135f-5d88-43e8-8f67-226a736f91f5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bcc24d0e-6fec-4738-8764-c99a58fd493d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Similar to BBS/MKS1 syndromes seen in patients.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24302887","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Planar cell polarity (PCP) regulates cell alignment required for collective cell movement during embryonic development. This requires PCP/PCP effector proteins, some of which also play essential roles in ciliogenesis, highlighting the long-standing question of the role of the cilium in PCP. Wdpcp, a PCP effector, was recently shown to regulate both ciliogenesis and collective cell movement, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show Wdpcp can regulate PCP by direct modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. These studies were made possible by recovery of a Wdpcp mutant mouse model. Wdpcp-deficient mice exhibit phenotypes reminiscent of Bardet-Biedl/Meckel-Gruber ciliopathy syndromes, including cardiac outflow tract and cochlea defects associated with PCP perturbation. We observed Wdpcp is localized to the transition zone, and in Wdpcp-deficient cells, Sept2, Nphp1, and Mks1 were lost from the transition zone, indicating Wdpcp is required for recruitment of proteins essential for ciliogenesis. Wdpcp is also found in the cytoplasm, where it is localized in the actin cytoskeleton and in focal adhesions. Wdpcp interacts with Sept2 and is colocalized with Sept2 in actin filaments, but in Wdpcp-deficient cells, Sept2 was lost from the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting Wdpcp is required for Sept2 recruitment to actin filaments. Significantly, organization of the actin filaments and focal contacts were markedly changed in Wdpcp-deficient cells. This was associated with decreased membrane ruffling, failure to establish cell polarity, and loss of directional cell migration. These results suggest the PCP defects in Wdpcp mutants are not caused by loss of cilia, but by direct disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, Wdpcp mutant cochlea has normal kinocilia and yet exhibits PCP defects. Together, these findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that a PCP component required for ciliogenesis can directly modulate the actin cytoskeleton to regulate cell polarity and directional cell migration.","dc:creator":"Cui C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Wdpcp, a PCP protein required for ciliogenesis, regulates directional cell migration and cell polarity by direct modulation of the actin cytoskeleton."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2569ec01-fad8-47ee-ba7b-4ad4fb534c9a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:44b20275-3d47-4cd4-a0ea-b28d78463e37_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:44b20275-3d47-4cd4-a0ea-b28d78463e37","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:6f91885d-9972-42a1-9191-827d2ce122bf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015910.7(WDPCP):c.253+2T>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347066062"}},{"id":"cggv:50572de4-82dd-4ff1-940c-6607f3fde9da","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015910.7(WDPCP):c.1748+9431A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA533456143"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Small anterior fontanelle,Preauricular skin tag,Irritability,Growth delay,Intrauterine growth retardation,Premature birth,Patent ductus arteriosus,Patent foramen ovale,Abnormal facial shape,Poor suck,Apnea,Poor head control,Hyperbilirubinemia,Tricuspid regurgitation,Abnormality of the renal pelvis,Left-to-right shunt","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:baad963c-c4db-458f-a065-98482632e62f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6f91885d-9972-42a1-9191-827d2ce122bf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32860008","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Despite clear technical superiority of genome sequencing (GS) over other diagnostic methods such as exome sequencing (ES), few studies are available regarding the advantages of its clinical application. We analyzed 1007 consecutive index cases for whom GS was performed in a diagnostic setting over a 2-year period. We reported pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants that explain the patients' phenotype in 212 of the 1007 cases (21.1%). In 245 additional cases (24.3%), a variant of unknown significance (VUS) related to the phenotype was reported. We especially investigated patients which had had ES with no genetic diagnosis (n = 358). For this group, GS diagnostic yield was 14.5% (52 patients with P/LP out of 358). GS should be especially indicated for ES-negative cases since up to 29.6% of them  could benefit from GS testing (14.5% with P/LP, n = 52 and 15.1% with VUS, n = 54). Genetic diagnoses in most of the ES-negative/GS-positive cases were determined by technical superiority of GS, i.e., access to noncoding regions and more uniform coverage. Importantly, we reported 79 noncoding variants, of which, 41 variants were classified as P/LP. Interpretation of noncoding variants remains challenging, and in many cases, complementary methods based on direct enzyme assessment, biomarker testing and RNA analysis are needed for variant classification and diagnosis. We present the largest cohort of patients with GS performed in a clinical setting to date. The results of this study should direct the decision for GS as standard second-line, or even first-line stand-alone test.","dc:creator":"Bertoli-Avella AM","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Successful application of genome sequencing in a diagnostic setting: 1007 index cases from a clinically heterogeneous cohort."}},{"id":"cggv:2e2a155f-67eb-4b31-a5f3-0ec03a5a54ea_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:50572de4-82dd-4ff1-940c-6607f3fde9da"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32860008"}],"rdfs:label":"x"},{"id":"cggv:2e2a155f-67eb-4b31-a5f3-0ec03a5a54ea","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e2a155f-67eb-4b31-a5f3-0ec03a5a54ea_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"spliceai score 50 = 0."},{"id":"cggv:baad963c-c4db-458f-a065-98482632e62f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:baad963c-c4db-458f-a065-98482632e62f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Het variant, the other "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a84913a1-3ff6-4ae2-b160-d3d501c0433a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a84913a1-3ff6-4ae2-b160-d3d501c0433a","type":"Proband","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5c16c490-45e6-43e2-aa4c-7570bb0768dc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015910.7(WDPCP):c.720C>A (p.Cys240Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347062610"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1530bc14-fd77-4cf9-b605-954cd61134ad_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5c16c490-45e6-43e2-aa4c-7570bb0768dc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37239474","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare clinically and genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive multi-systemic disorder with 22 known genes.

The WDPCP protein localizes to the base of cilia and the actin cytoskeleton and is required for ciliogenesis (PMID: 24302887). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. In fact, BBS, OFD, and CHDTHP all belong to the larger family of ciliopathy. Therefore, these disease entities have been lumped into one curation.\n\nThis curation includes seven variants (one missense, one nonsense, two frameshift, and three splice disruptions) that have been reported in four probands in four publications. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and cellular studies indicating that loss-of-function in the WDPCP results in ocular and ciliary defects (PMIDs: 24302887, 27158779).\n\nIn summary, *WDPCP* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive WDPCP-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 7th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2569ec01-fad8-47ee-ba7b-4ad4fb534c9a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
