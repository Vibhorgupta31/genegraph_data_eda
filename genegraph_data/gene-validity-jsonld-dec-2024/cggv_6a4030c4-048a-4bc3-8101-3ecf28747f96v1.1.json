Targeted sequencing confirms allele segregation in six cases from four unrelated families. RNU4ATAC rare variants have been recently reported to cause microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type I (MOPD1), whose phenotype is distinct from Roifman Syndrome. Strikingly, all six of the Roifman Syndrome cases have one variant that overlaps MOPD1-implicated structural elements, while the other variant overlaps a highly conserved structural element not previously implicated in disease. RNA-seq analysis confirms extensive and specific defects of minor intron splicing. Available allele frequency data suggest that recessive genetic disorders caused by RNU4ATAC rare variants may be more prevalent than previously reported.

Pathogenic variants in RNU4ATAC, an RNA of the minor spliceosome important for the excision of U12-dependent introns, have been recently associated with LWS. This gene had previously also been associated with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) and Roifman syndrome (RS), two distinct conditions which share with LWS some skeletal and neurological anomalies. We performed exome sequencing in two individuals with Lowry-Wood syndrome. We report RNU4ATAC pathogenic variants in two further patients. Moreover, an analysis of all RNU4ATAC variants reported so far showed that FitCons scores for nucleotides mutated in the more severe MOPD are higher than RS or LWS and that they were more frequently located in the 5' Stem-Loop of the RNA critical for the formation of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, whereas the variants are more dispersed in the other conditions. We are thus confirming that RNU4ATAC is the gene responsible for LWS and provide a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis.","dc:creator":"Shelihan I","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Lowry-Wood syndrome: further evidence of association with RNU4ATAC, and correlation between genotype and phenotype."}},{"id":"cggv:49cdb2d6-76d5-41cb-a520-88ebd7e4bc52_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:347fb05c-39d6-4f6c-89ca-af17e10ed15e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30368667"}],"rdfs:label":"Shelihan P2"},{"id":"cggv:49cdb2d6-76d5-41cb-a520-88ebd7e4bc52","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:49cdb2d6-76d5-41cb-a520-88ebd7e4bc52_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:49cdb2d6-76d5-41cb-a520-88ebd7e4bc52_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Radiographs consistent with disease."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Scoring at 0.25 each for 0.5 total."},{"id":"cggv:2321ff78-c8db-4886-a32b-f0ad879c6bb9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2321ff78-c8db-4886-a32b-f0ad879c6bb9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2321ff78-c8db-4886-a32b-f0ad879c6bb9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Radiographs consistent with disease."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Scoring at 0.25 each for 0.5 total."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3096732e-5a69-4154-9f56-dc30eec1f23b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3096732e-5a69-4154-9f56-dc30eec1f23b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a05c74d3-7595-49b4-af2a-dfad0ac44b9b"},"phenotypeFreeText":"low IgG, low antibody titres, abnormal T cells, atopy","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000460","obo:HP_0000556","obo:HP_0001156","obo:HP_0000463","obo:HP_0004209","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0002656","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001510"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:ab75d32e-30d6-4061-9ff3-af6c86bf47fd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a05c74d3-7595-49b4-af2a-dfad0ac44b9b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29263834"},"rdfs:label":"Schejter Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:ab75d32e-30d6-4061-9ff3-af6c86bf47fd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab75d32e-30d6-4061-9ff3-af6c86bf47fd_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ab75d32e-30d6-4061-9ff3-af6c86bf47fd_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Significantly reduced relative splicing efficiency (Benoit-Pilven et al. 2020, PMID: 32628740)"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Scoring at 0.5 twice for functional evidence + radiographs."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8524ccbe-d095-4672-b313-d05e82485c85_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8524ccbe-d095-4672-b313-d05e82485c85","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c556297e-4ea6-4d5d-9fe7-7cda31af35a0"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0034392","obo:HP_0002652","obo:HP_0002269","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0000958","obo:HP_0008070","obo:HP_0001373"],"secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:b10ab03b-3ce9-4a80-a91c-58123d569787_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c556297e-4ea6-4d5d-9fe7-7cda31af35a0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21474760"},"rdfs:label":"Family 1 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:b10ab03b-3ce9-4a80-a91c-58123d569787","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b10ab03b-3ce9-4a80-a91c-58123d569787_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b10ab03b-3ce9-4a80-a91c-58123d569787_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"U4atac snRNA variants found in MOPD I patients disrupt minor class intron splicing in vivo.

Standard of care is often a time-consuming stepwise approach involving chromosomal microarray analysis and targeted gene sequencing panels, which can be costly and inconclusive. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a comprehensive testing platform that has the potential to streamline genetic assessments, but there are limited comparative data to guide its clinical use.MethodsWe prospectively recruited 103 patients from pediatric non-genetic subspecialty clinics, each with a clinical phenotype suggestive of an underlying genetic disorder, and compared the diagnostic yield and coverage of WGS with those of conventional genetic testing.ResultsWGS identified diagnostic variants in 41% of individuals, representing a significant increase over conventional testing results (24%; P = 0.01). Genes clinically sequenced in the cohort (n = 1,226) were well covered by WGS, with a median exonic coverage of 40 × ±8 × (mean ±SD). All the molecular diagnoses made by conventional methods were captured by WGS. The 18 new diagnoses made with WGS included structural and non-exonic sequence variants not detectable with whole-exome sequencing, and confirmed recent disease associations with the genes PIGG, RNU4ATAC, TRIO, and UNC13A.ConclusionWGS as a primary clinical test provided a higher diagnostic yield than conventional genetic testing in a clinically heterogeneous cohort.","dc:creator":"Lionel AC","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Improved diagnostic yield compared with targeted gene sequencing panels suggests a role for whole-genome sequencing as a first-tier genetic test."}},{"id":"cggv:1cb35cf5-bccd-41d7-98a8-386e9b110fcf_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:40f95d43-b5dc-4620-8a6b-f9d2ff67de96"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28771251"}],"rdfs:label":"Lionel Case 5"},{"id":"cggv:1cb35cf5-bccd-41d7-98a8-386e9b110fcf","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1cb35cf5-bccd-41d7-98a8-386e9b110fcf_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:058b12e9-7234-4655-9b18-15c035772eac","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:058b12e9-7234-4655-9b18-15c035772eac_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9f21a8f5-101a-428b-b453-ee474915e04d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f21a8f5-101a-428b-b453-ee474915e04d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":28,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:1b4a80f2-ddc5-4ae7-9928-1276b069325d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001395891.1(CLASP1):c.196-604C>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129004"}},{"id":"cggv:c556297e-4ea6-4d5d-9fe7-7cda31af35a0"}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"phenotypeFreeText":"A CT scan of the head performed at 9 months of age showed a large extra-axial fluid collection in the frontal region, which was the cause of a significant mass-effect on the brain. This fluid collection progressively increased in size in subsequent images, which included fetal MRI and several post-natal ultrasounds. Mass effect was observed. A cyst-peritoneal shunt was placed at 13 months of age to reduce pressure due to this fluid collection. The brain was dysmorphic with a thin mantle of brain tissue and dilated lateral ventricles. Corpus callosum was absent. The patient had an initially cystic right kidney which gradually involuted and appeared to be responsible for hypertension. She had an atrial septal defect which spontaneously closed and severe reflux with feeding difficulties, a Nissen fundoplication was performed and a g-tube placed at 26

RNU4ATAC spectrum disorder is characterized by growth restriction, microcephaly, skeletal dysplasia, and cognitive impairment. Less common but variable findings include brain anomalies, seizures, strokes, immunodeficiency, and cardiac anomalies, as well as ophthalmologic, skin, renal, gastrointestinal, hearing, and endocrine involvement (PMID: 36795902). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Lowry-Wood syndrome (OMIM:226960), Roifman syndrome (OMIM:616651), microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type I (OMIM:210710), and Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS). Twenty-five variants in a non-protein-coding gene that have been reported in eighteen probands in nine publications (PMIDs: 21474760, 21474761, 22581640, 26522830, 28771251, 29263834, 29265708, 30368667, https://doi.org/10.14785/lymphosign-2016-0015) are included in this curation meeting phenotypic criteria including growth restriction, microcephaly, skeletal dysplasia, and cognitive impairment. Of note, there is a wide variability of phenotypes associated with dysfunction of RNU4ATAC, and there have been reports of affected individuals who do not present with skeletal dysplasia and/or microcephaly (McMillan et al., PMID 34405953, Duker et al., PMID 36795902). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. RNU4ATAC encodes a snRNA (U4atac) part of the U12-dependent minor spliceosome complex involved in splicing of minor introns. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. RNA sequencing analysis on blood from affected individuals has revealed significant retention of minor introns in multiple genes, along with other transcriptional anomalies (Merico et al., PMID 26522830), consistent with a dysfunction of RNU4ATAC, which plays a crucial role in the splicing of minor introns. Notably, there is no MANE select transcript for this gene, and there is a discrepancy between Ensembl (Chr2:121,530,881-121,531,007 (Hg38)) and NCBI (Chr2:121,530,880-121,531,009) regarding the exact position of the first nucleotide of this non-coding gene, with a difference of one nucleotide. In summary, RNU4ATAC is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RNU4ATAC-spectrum disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date September 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9) and reviewed by experts from the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on August 27, 2024.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6a4030c4-048a-4bc3-8101-3ecf28747f96"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
