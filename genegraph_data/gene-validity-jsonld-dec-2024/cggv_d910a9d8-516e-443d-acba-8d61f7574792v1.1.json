To date, all mutations known to cause NS are dominant, activating mutations in signal transducers of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In 25% of cases, however, the genetic cause of NS remains elusive, suggesting that factors other than those involved in the canonical RAS/MAPK pathway may also have a role. Here, we used family-based whole exome sequencing of a case-parent trio and identified a de novo mutation, p.(Arg802His), in A2ML1, which encodes the secreted protease inhibitor Î±-2-macroglobulin (A2M)-like-1. Subsequent resequencing of A2ML1 in 155 cases with a clinical diagnosis of NS led to the identification of additional mutations in two families, p.(Arg802Leu) and p.(Arg592Leu). Functional characterization of these human A2ML1 mutations in zebrafish showed NS-like developmental defects, including a broad head, blunted face and cardiac malformations. Using the crystal structure of A2M, which is highly homologous to A2ML1, we identified the intramolecular interaction partner of p.Arg802. Mutation of this residue, p.Glu906, induced similar developmental defects in zebrafish, strengthening our conclusion that mutations in A2ML1 cause a disorder clinically related to NS. This is the first report of the involvement of an extracellular factor in a disorder clinically related to RASopathies, providing potential new leads for better understanding of the molecular basis of this family of developmental diseases.

Both Vissers et al. 2015 and van Trier et al. 2015 have identified variants in A2ML1 in patients with Noonan syndrome (NS). However, none of these variants could be scored due to their high frequency in the general population, lack of functional impact, or lack of segregation with disease (gnomad.broadinstitute.org, (van Trier et al., 2015; Vissers et al., 2015). As a result, no convincing genetic evidence has been published to associate the A2ML1 gene with RASopathies.  However, there is a knock-in zebrafish model that developed cardiac and craniofacial defects similar to those caused by other RASopathy variants (Vissers et al., 2015). The association between A2ML1 and Noonan syndrome remains Disputed. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating A2ML1 with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome, NS with loose anagen hair or NS with multiple lentigines. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/7/18 (SOP Version 5).\nNone of the variants that are suggested to be NS variants are convincing enough to be scored.
