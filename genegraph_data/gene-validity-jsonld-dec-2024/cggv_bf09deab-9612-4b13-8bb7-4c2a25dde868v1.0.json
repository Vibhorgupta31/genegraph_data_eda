We report three new XPB families: one has two sisters with relatively mild xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) symptoms not previously associated with XPB mutations and two have severe XP/Cockayne syndrome (CS) complex symptoms. All XP-B cells had reduced NER and post-ultraviolet (UV) cell viability. Surprisingly, cells from the milder XP sisters had the same missense mutation (c.296T>C, p.F99S) that was previously reported in two mild XP/CS complex brothers. These cells had higher levels of XPB protein than the severely affected XP/CS complex patients. An XPB expression vector with the p.F99S mutation partially complemented the NER defect in XP-B cells. The three severely affected XP/CS complex families all have the same splice acceptor site mutation (c.2218-6C>A, p.Q739insX42) in one allele. This resulted in alteration of 41 amino acids at the C terminus, producing partial NER complementation. This limited number of mutations probably reflects the very restricted range of alterations of this vital protein that are compatible with life. We found new mutations in the second allele yielding markedly truncated proteins in all five XP or XP/CS complex families: c.1273C>T, p.R425X; c.471+1G>A, p.K157insTSDSX; c.807-808delTT, p.F270X; c.1421-1422insA, p.D474EfsX475; and c.1633C>T, p.Q545X. The remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of XPB is associated with partially active missense mutations in milder patients while severe XP/CS complex patients have nonsense mutations in both alleles with low levels of altered XPB proteins.","dc:creator":"Oh KS","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Phenotypic heterogeneity in the XPB DNA helicase gene (ERCC3): xeroderma pigmentosum without and with Cockayne syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Patient cells show decreased DNA repair rate and XPB protein"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Increase points because four assays (DNA Repair, Post-UV Cell Viability, Post-UV RNA Synthesis Recovery, and XPB Protein Levels) were preformed using patient-derived cells from five XPB patients (XP11BE, XP33BR, XPCS1BA, XP131MA, and XP183MA)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:bf09deab-9612-4b13-8bb7-4c2a25dde868_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:999ee5bf-b21c-4a13-9d02-b2ed95989c46","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c66c1d9d-a6c0-443f-948e-573e853228d1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Severe alterations in Xpb cause embryonic lethality and knock-in mice closely mimicking an XPCS patient-derived XPB mutation recapitulate the UV sensitivity typical for XP but fail to show overt CS features unless the DNA repair capacity is further challenged by crossings to the NER-deficient Xpa background.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19114557","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Patients carrying mutations in the XPB helicase subunit of the basal transcription and nucleotide excision repair (NER) factor TFIIH display the combined cancer and developmental-progeroid disorder xeroderma pigmentosum/Cockayne syndrome (XPCS).

Genetically, it is assigned to eight complementation groups (XP-A to -G and variant). For the last 5 y, the UK national multidisciplinary XP service has provided follow-up for 89 XP patients, representing most of the XP patients in the United Kingdom. Causative mutations, DNA repair levels, and more than 60 clinical variables relating to dermatology, ophthalmology, and neurology have been measured, using scoring systems to categorize disease severity. This deep phenotyping has revealed unanticipated heterogeneity of clinical features, between and within complementation groups. Skin cancer is most common in XP-C, XP-E, and XP-V patients, previously considered to be the milder groups based on cellular analyses. These patients have normal sunburn reactions and are therefore diagnosed later and are less likely to adhere to UVR protection. XP-C patients are specifically hypersensitive to ocular damage, and XP-F and XP-G patients appear to be much less susceptible to skin cancer than other XP groups. Within XP groups, different mutations confer susceptibility or resistance to neurological damage. Our findings on this large cohort of XP patients under long-term follow-up reveal that XP is more heterogeneous than has previously been appreciated. Our data now enable provision of personalized prognostic information and management advice for each XP patient, as well as providing new insights into the functions of the XP proteins.
