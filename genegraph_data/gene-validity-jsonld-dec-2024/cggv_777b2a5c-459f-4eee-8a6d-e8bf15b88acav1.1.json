Here, by sequencing the entire exomes of nine early-onset familial breast cancer patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (diagnosed with breast cancer at or before the age of 35) we found that two index cases carried a potentially deleterious mutation in the RECQL gene (RecQ helicase-like; chr12p12). Recent studies suggested that RECQL is involved in DNA double-strand break repair and it plays an important role in the maintenance of genomic stability. Therefore, we further screened the RECQL gene in an additional 439 unrelated familial breast cancer patients. In total, we found three nonsense mutations leading to a truncated protein of RECQL (p.L128X, p.W172X, and p.Q266X), one mutation affecting mRNA splicing (c.395-2A>G), and five missense mutations disrupting the helicase activity of RECQL (p.A195S, p.R215Q, p.R455C, p.M458K, and p.T562I), as evaluated through an in vitro helicase assay. Taken together, 9 out of 448 BRCA-negative familial breast cancer patients carried a pathogenic mutation of the RECQL gene compared with one of the 1,588 controls (P = 9.14×10-6). Our findings suggest that RECQL is a potential breast cancer susceptibility gene and that mutations in this gene contribute to familial breast cancer development.","dc:creator":"Sun J","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Mutations in RECQL Gene Are Associated with Predisposition to Breast Cancer."},"rdfs:label":"Peking-Univ-RECQL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The 9 variants found in early onset BRCA1/2 negative women with familial cancer history were screened in the coding region of RECQL for 1588 healthy controls.

Three of the 5 known members of the human RecQ family are genetically linked with cancer susceptibility syndromes, but the association of the most abundant human RecQ homolog, RECQ1, with cellular transformation is yet unclear. RECQ1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, indicating oncogenic functions. Here, we assessed genome-wide changes in gene expression upon knockdown of RECQ1 in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells. Pathway analysis suggested that RECQ1 enhances the expression of multiple genes that play key roles in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, including EZR, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGB4, SMAD3, and TGFBR2. Consistent with these results, silencing RECQ1 significantly reduced cell migration and invasion. In comparison to genome-wide annotated promoter regions, the promoters of genes downregulated upon RECQ1 silencing were significantly enriched for a potential G4 DNA forming sequence motif. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of RECQ1 to the G4 motifs in the promoters of select genes downregulated upon RECQ1 silencing. In breast cancer patients, the expression of a subset of RECQ1-activated genes positively correlated with RECQ1 expression. Moreover, high RECQ1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Collectively, our findings identify a novel function of RECQ1 in gene regulation and indicate that RECQ1 contributes to tumor development and progression, in part, by regulating the expression of key genes that promote cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis.","dc:creator":"Li XL","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Identification of RECQ1-regulated transcriptome uncovers a role of RECQ1 in regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion."},"rdfs:label":"RECQL-Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Decreased score due to minimal scoring for expression data (RECQL is expressed in many areas and not limited to breast tissue or cancer).

Although the biochemical properties and protein interactions of the WRN and BLM helicases defective in Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome, respectively, have been extensively investigated, less information is available concerning the functions of the other human RecQ helicases. We have focused our attention on human RECQ1, a DNA helicase whose cellular functions remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we have characterized the DNA substrate specificity and optimal cofactor requirements for efficient RECQ1-catalyzed DNA unwinding and determined that RECQ1 has certain properties that are distinct from those of other RecQ helicases. RECQ1 stably bound to a variety of DNA structures, enabling it to unwind a diverse set of DNA substrates. In addition to its DNA binding and helicase activities, RECQ1 catalyzed efficient strand annealing between complementary single-stranded DNA molecules. The ability of RECQ1 to promote strand annealing was modulated by ATP binding, which induced a conformational change in the protein. The enzymatic properties of the RECQ1 helicase and strand annealing activities are discussed in the context of proposed cellular DNA metabolic pathways that are important in the maintenance of genomic stability.","dc:creator":"Sharma S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Biochemical analysis of the DNA unwinding and strand annealing activities catalyzed by human RECQ1."},"rdfs:label":"RECQL DNA Helicase Function "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No points given because DNA helicase role does not directly relate it specifically to breast cancer apart from DNA repair.

RECQL is a DNA helicase and part of a 5 gene family [RECQL1 (RECQL), Bloom syndrome protein (BLM, formerly RECQ2), Werner syndrome helicase (WRN, formerly RECQ3), RECQL4, and RECQL5] associated with rare recessive DNA-repair syndromes such as WRN, Bloom Syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome, but thus far RECQL is not associated with a recessive disorder. The proposed mechanism of pathogenicity is through loss of function / truncating or splice/frameshift variants, with missense variants being less commonly implicated. Evidence disputing this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data and experimental data. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there is no disease associated with RECQL in OMIM, and curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed.  \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 5.5 POINTS**\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 4 case-control cohorts at the single variant level and 7 case-control studies at the aggregate variant level. There is limited evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship from small to medium size case-control studies at the aggregate variant level in specific populations, for example in the Han Chinese of northern China (1 point, PMID: 25945795) and African American women (3 points, PMID: 32427313). In addition, Cybulski et al, 2015 (PMID:25915596) showed a significant association of aggregated pathogenic RECQL variants with breast cancer (0.5 point). The same paper also reported the association of a truncating variant (p.Arg215*) and a splice variant (c.1667_1667+3delAGTAA) with breast cancer (0.5 point for each variant). \nHowever, at least two studies published in 2017 and 2020 focusing on the single splice variant c.1667_1667+3delAGTA showed no significant association of this splice variant with breast cancer (PMID:27832498, 32824581). In addition, in 2021 two large case-control studies [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) and BCAC (PMID: 33471991); both with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in RECQL and breast cancer. Another case-control study at the aggregate variant level with smaller size of Australian women with breast cancer reports no association of LOF RECQL variants with breast cancer (PMID: 30224651). These studies provide evidence to refute the association.\n\n**Summary of Experimental Data : 1.75 POINTS**\n\nAn experimental study reported the role of RECQL as a DNA helicase and in the DNA repair process (0.5 point, PMID: 15899892). In addition, another study showed that RECQL is expressed in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and silencing of RECQL alters expression of (CCNB1, CD55, and FST - upregulated) and 6 down regulated genes (CDK6, CENPA, EBNA1BP2, PTK2, SSR1, and TGFBI) (0.25 point, PMID:25483193). RECQL and FOXA1 (FOXA1 is a transcription factor for Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) and mutations in FOXA1 are associated with estrogen positive breast cancer) co immunoprecipitate (0.5 point, PMID: 33468559). Sharma S, et al., 2005 (PMID: 18074021) showed cancer cells display defective DNA repair and damage responses (0.5 point), as do the MEF cells from RECQL knock-out mice (0.5 point). Notably, many experiments referenced above do not replicate a heterozygous loss of function state and instead eliminate or reduce expression of both alleles (i.e. siRNA or knock-out mice). \n\n**Overall Summary:** \n\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in the large breast cancer case/control studies to date, the relationship between RECQL and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer has been disputed, regardless of minor points assigned for some supporting data. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role of RECQL in hereditary breast cancer. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as moderate by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 9/28/2016. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 2/17/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\nGiven the lack of significant association in the large breast cancer case/control studies to date (PMID: 33471974, 33471991), the relationship between RECQL and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer has been disputed, regardless of minor points assigned for some supporting data.
