Human diseases have been associated with enzyme deficiencies at each step, including FAH and PAH which are the most well-known. Variants in FAH lead to hypersuccinylacetonemia, which is also found in patients with GSTZ1 variants, though milder. GSTZ1 is involved in the fifth step in the phenylalanine/tyrosine degradation pathway.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9417084","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have previously used Aspergillus nidulans as a fungal model for human phenylalanine catabolism. This model was crucial for our characterization of the human gene involved in alcaptonuria. We use here an identical approach to characterize at the cDNA level the human gene for maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI, EC 5.2.1.2), the only as yet unidentified structural gene of the phenylalanine catabolic pathway. We report here the first characterization of a gene encoding a MAAI enzyme from any organism, the A. nidulans maiA gene. maiA disruption prevents growth on phenylalanine (Phe) and phenylacetate and results in the absence of MAAI activity in vitro and Phe toxicity. The MaiA protein shows strong amino acid sequence identity to glutathione S-transferases and has MAAI activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. maiA is clustered with fahA and hmgA, the genes encoding the two other enzymes of the common part of the Phe/phenylacetate pathways. Based on the high amino acid sequence conservation existing between other homologous A. nidulans and human enzymes of this pathway, we used the MaiA sequence in data base searches to identify human expressed sequence tags encoding its putative homologues. Four such cDNAs were sequenced and shown to be encoded by the same gene. They encode a protein with 45% sequence identity to MaiA, which showed MAAI activity when expressed in E. coli. Human MAAI deficiency would presumably cause tyrosinemia that would be characterized by the absence of succinylacetone, the diagnostic compound resulting from fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency in humans and fungi. Culture supernatants of an A. nidulans strain disrupted for maiA are succinylacetone-negative but specifically contain cis and/or trans isomers of 2, 4-dioxohept-2-enoic acid. We suggest that this compound(s) might be diagnostic for human MAAI deficiency.","dc:creator":"Fernández-Cañón JM","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Characterization of a fungal maleylacetoacetate isomerase gene and identification of its human homologue."},"rdfs:label":"Phenylalanine/tyrosine degradation pathway"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8c287e0b-88be-4fbb-82a6-a8c70d430506_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d41a33c-6419-4b95-9f37-e05e5d00e367","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0757d9f3-9614-4caf-b8d0-5e96f6d63120","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Fertility and size were not affected during 22 months of observation.

There are well-described human diseases associated with deficiencies of all enzymes in this pathway except for maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI), which converts maleylacetoacetate (MAA) to fumarylacetoacetate (FAA). MAAI is also known as glutathione transferase zeta (GSTZ1). Here, we describe the phenotype of mice with a targeted deletion of the MAAI (GSTZ1) gene. MAAI-deficient mice accumulated FAA and succinylacetone in urine but appeared otherwise healthy. This observation suggested that either accumulating MAA is not toxic or an alternate pathway for MAA metabolism exists. A complete redundancy of MAAI could be ruled out because substrate overload of the tyrosine catabolic pathway (administration of homogentisic acid, phenylalanine, or tyrosine) resulted in renal and hepatic damage. However, evidence for a partial bypass of MAAI activity was also found. Mice doubly mutant for MAAI and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) died rapidly on a normal diet, indicating that MAA could be isomerized to FAA in the absence of MAAI. Double mutants showed predominant renal injury, indicating that this organ is the primary target for the accumulated compound(s) resulting from MAAI deficiency. A glutathione-mediated isomerization of MAA to FAA independent of MAAI enzyme was demonstrated in vitro. This nonenzymatic bypass is likely responsible for the lack of a phenotype in nonstressed MAAI mutant mice.","dc:creator":"Fernández-Cañón JM","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI/GSTZ)-deficient mice reveal a glutathione-dependent nonenzymatic bypass in tyrosine catabolism."},"rdfs:label":"GSTZ1 KO Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Biochemical analysis consistent with disease, but no phenotypic abnormalities.

The *GSTZ1* gene encodes an enzyme that is involved in the phenylalanine/phenylacetate degradation pathway. Most patients with the deﬁciency show only mild symptoms and remain well without treatment (Yang et al., 2017; PMID 27876694). Five variants (missense, nonsense, and intronic) that have been reported in seven probands in two publications (PMIDs: 27876694, 38535121) are included in this curation. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical assays and a mouse model (PMIDs: 12052898, 9417084). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 22nd, 2019. It was reevaluated on September 9th, 2022, and on December 5th, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, new genetic evidence was added (PMID: 38535121) but the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8c287e0b-88be-4fbb-82a6-a8c70d430506"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
