Complex I is also a major source of damaging reactive oxygen species and its dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial disease, Parkinson's disease and ageing. Bacterial and human complex I share 14 core subunits that are essential for enzymatic function; however, the role and necessity of the remaining 31 human accessory subunits is unclear. The incorporation of accessory subunits into the complex increases the cellular energetic cost and has necessitated the involvement of numerous assembly factors for complex I biogenesis. Here we use gene editing to generate human knockout cell lines for each accessory subunit. We show that 25 subunits are strictly required for assembly of a functional complex and 1 subunit is essential for cell viability. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cell lines revealed that loss of each subunit affects the stability of other subunits residing in the same structural module. Analysis of proteomic changes after the loss of specific modules revealed that ATP5SL and DMAC1 are required for assembly of the distal portion of the complex I membrane arm.

The complex I assembly defect, caused by mutation or RNAi of dCIA30, has repercussions both during development and adulthood in Drosophila, including developmental arrest at the pupal stage and reduced stress resistance during adulthood. Expression of the single-subunit yeast alternative NADH dehydrogenase, Ndi1, can partially or wholly rescue phenotypes associated with the complex I assembly defect. Our work shows that CG7598/dCIA30 is a functional homolog of Ndufaf1 and adds to the accumulating evidence that transgenic NDI1 expression is a viable therapy for disorders arising from complex I deficiency.","dc:creator":"Cho J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Expression of yeast NDI1 rescues a Drosophila complex I assembly defect."},"rdfs:label":"NDUFAF1 Drosophila model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Complex I deficiency 90.5 pts)  Developmental phenotype (0.5pts)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5237,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":9.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c117fb70-58a2-463c-9ca4-eb58f8401377","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:18828","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFAF1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 17, 2022. The *NDUFAF1* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\nThe *NDUFAF1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2007 (PMID: 17557076). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFAF1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFAF1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to per the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 17557076, 21931170). No segregation data were available. Loss of function resulting in a complex I assembly defect is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alterations in patient and non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27509854, 27626371, 18940309, 22387847, 23226344).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 17, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:20bd44f6-360d-42ef-ba08-549773282d2e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
