Mutations in GMPPA were subsequently found in ten additional individuals from eight independent families affected by the combination of achalasia, alacrima, and neurological deficits. This autosomal-recessive disorder shows many similarities with triple A syndrome, which is characterized by achalasia, alacrima, and variable neurological deficits in combination with adrenal insufficiency. GMPPA is a largely uncharacterized homolog of GMPPB. GMPPB catalyzes the formation of GDP-mannose, which is an essential precursor of glycan moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids and is associated with congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies with hypoglycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan. Surprisingly, GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase activity was unchanged and GDP-mannose levels were strongly increased in lymphoblasts of individuals with GMPPA mutations. This suggests that GMPPA might serve as a GMPPB regulatory subunit mediating feedback inhibition of GMPPB instead of displaying catalytic enzyme activity itself. Thus, a triple-A-like syndrome can be added to the growing list of congenital disorders of glycosylation, in which dysregulation rather than mere enzyme deficiency is the basal pathophysiological mechanism.","dc:creator":"Koehler K","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in GMPPA cause a glycosylation disorder characterized by intellectual disability and autonomic

The function of GMPPA is not well defined, however it is a homolog of GMPPB which catalyzes the reaction that converts mannose-1-phosphate and guanosine-5'-triphosphate to GDP-mannose. Previously, biallelic mutations in GMPPA were reported to cause a disorder characterized by achalasia, alacrima, neurological deficits, and intellectual disability. In this study, we report a female proband with achalasia, alacrima, hypohydrosis, apparent intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, esotropia, and craniofacial dysmorphism. Exome sequencing identified a previously unreported homozygous c.853+1G>A variant in GMPPA in the proband and her affected sister. Their unaffected parents were heterozygous, and unaffected brother homozygous wild type for this variant. Lymphoblast cells from the affected sisters showed complete loss of the GMPPA protein by Western blotting, and increased levels of GDP-mannose in lymphoblasts on high performance liquid chromatography. Based on our findings and the previous report describing patients with an overlapping phenotype, we conclude that this novel variant in GMPPA, identified by exome sequencing in the proband and her affected sister, is the genetic cause of their phenotype and may expand the known phenotype of this recently described glycosylation disorder.","dc:creator":"Gold WA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A

To date, 18 patients have been reported, nearly all displaying the same pathognomonic triad of symptoms described in the name. This condition shares considerable phenotypic overlap with Triple-A syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in the AAAS gene; however, AAMR lacks the characteristic adrenocortical findings associated with Triple-A syndrome.

Notably, both families reported indigenous Maya-Mam heritage and originated from the town of ConcepciÃ³n Chiquirichapa in Quezaltenango, Guatemala. Our cases help to expand the AAMR phenotype by outlining dysmorphic features not well described in the prior cases. Additionally, we encourage all providers with patients presenting with this unique triad of symptoms to consider sequencing of the GMPPA gene. Special consideration should be given to families of Guatemalan Maya-Mam ancestry who may also have this identified founder mutation.

In brief, GMPPB catalyzes the production of GDP-mannose from mannose-1-phosphate and GTP. GMPPA has the ability to bind GDP-mannose but is catalytically inactive (PMID: 11082198). Therefore at sufficient GDP-mannose concentrations, GMPPA binds GMPBB to inhibit the formation of GDP-mannose. Without functional GMPPA, GMPPB continues to produce GDP-mannose, resulting in elevated levels of GDP-mannose, as observed in lymphoblastoid cells of individuals with bi-allelic variants in GMPPA.\nThe assumption is that elevated GDP-mannose levels lead to abnormal glycosylation of proteins (as shown in the mouse Gmppa KO model) resulting in the clinical symptoms observed in individuals with biallelic variants in GMPPA.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33755596","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"GDP-mannose-pyrophosphorylase-B (GMPPB) facilitates the generation of GDP-mannose, a sugar donor required for glycosylation. GMPPB defects cause muscle disease due to hypoglycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG). Alpha-DG is part of a protein complex, which links the extracellular matrix with the cytoskeleton, thus stabilizing myofibers. Mutations of the catalytically inactive homolog GMPPA cause alacrima, achalasia, and mental retardation syndrome (AAMR syndrome), which also involves muscle weakness. Here, we showed that Gmppa-KO mice recapitulated cognitive and motor deficits. As structural correlates, we found cortical layering defects, progressive neuron loss, and myopathic alterations. Increased GDP-mannose levels in skeletal muscle and in vitro assays identified GMPPA as an allosteric feedback inhibitor of GMPPB. Thus, its disruption enhanced mannose incorporation into glycoproteins, including Î±-DG in mice and humans. This increased Î±-DG turnover and thereby lowered Î±-DG abundance. In mice, dietary mannose restriction beginning after weaning corrected Î±-DG hyperglycosylation and abundance, normalized skeletal muscle morphology, and prevented neuron degeneration and the development of motor deficits. Cortical layering and cognitive performance, however, were not improved. We thus identified GMPPA defects as the first congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by Î±-DG hyperglycosylation, to our knowledge, and we have unraveled underlying disease mechanisms and identified potential dietary treatment options.","dc:creator":"Franzka P","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"GMPPA defects cause a neuromuscular disorder with Î±-dystroglycan hyperglycosylation."},"rdfs:label":"GMPPA as an allosteric inhibitor of GMPPB"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score is increased based on the multiple lines of evidence investigating the function of GMPPA, and its interaction with GMPPB, which is also known to result in differences in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ac7d2391-9ba9-45de-870a-7a996ea0766f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:01f82e69-43f0-4a2f-8526-5b5876af0a20","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93fb029c-2e01-4699-9aec-864767a43496","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"siRNA-mediated knockdown of GMPPA in myoblasts from Gmppa knock out mouse caused alpha-dystroglycan hyperglycosylation and increased its turnover.

To date, about 20 patients have been reported, nearly all with the same triad of symptoms, alacrima, achalasia, and intellectual disability. Other commonly reported findings include dysmorphic features, short stature, ocular symptoms, and hypotonia (Diaz et al, 2020, PMID: 31898852; Oet et al, 2022, PMID: 35607266).The condition has significant phenotypic overlap with Triple-A syndrome, which is caused by biallelic variants in AAAS. However, unlike AAAS, individuals with alacrima, achalasia, and intellectual disability syndrome do not have adrenocortical insufficiency. \nEleven variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice variants) reported in eleven probands in 2 publications were curated (Koehler et al, 2013, PMID: 24035193; Gold et al, 2017, PMID: 28574218; Diaz et al, 2020, PMID: 31898852). All patients were negative for variants in AAAS. Of note, the majority of patients reported have consanguineous parents and are homozygous. However, compound heterozygous patients have also been reported recently (Geiculescu et al, 2022, PMID: 35665995; Oet et al, 2022, PMID: 35607266). One variant has been identified in two unrelated probands from an indigenous population in Guatemala and may be a founder variant in that population (Diaz et al, 2020, PMID: 31898852). All curated variants are rare or absent in gnomAD v2.1.1. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the function of GMPPA, which acts as a negative regular of GMPPB, thereby controlling GDP-mannose levels (Franzka et al, 2021, PMID: 33755596; Franzka et al, 2022, 36672654). Lack of GMPPA has been shown to result in hyperglycosylation of alpha-dystroglcan, and lowered overall alpha-dystroglycan levels, as well as abnormal structure and functionality of the ER and Golgi complex (PMIDs: 33755596, 36672654). Further evidence includes the features observed in a Gmppa knock out mouse (Franzka et al, 2021, PMID: 33755596), and results of siRNA knock down of Gmppa in mouse myoblasts (Franzka et al, 2021, PMID: 33755596).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between GMPPA and alacrima, achalasia, and intellectual disability syndrome, an autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation on September 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ac7d2391-9ba9-45de-870a-7a996ea0766f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
