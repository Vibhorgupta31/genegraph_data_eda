The disease is non-progressive, but life-threatening episodes of widespread weakness, severe metabolic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis may occur. The disease has so far only been identified in northern Sweden. The clinical, histochemical and biochemical phenotype is very homogenous and the patients are homozygous for a deep intronic IVS5 + 382G>C splicing affecting mutation in ISCU, which encodes the differently spliced cytosolic and mitochondrial iron-sulphur cluster assembly protein IscU. Iron-sulphur cluster containing proteins are essential for iron homeostasis and respiratory chain function, with IscU being among the most conserved proteins in evolution. We identified a shared homozygous segment of only 405,000 base pair with the deep intronic mutation in eight patients with a phenotype consistent with the original description of the disease. Two other patients, two brothers, had an identical biochemical and histochemical phenotype which is probably pathognomonic for muscle iron-sulphur cluster deficiency, but they presented with a disease where the clinical phenotype was characterized by early onset of a slowly progressive severe muscle weakness, severe exercise intolerance and cardiomyopathy. The brothers were compound heterozygous for the deep intronic mutation and had a c.149 G>A missense mutation in exon 3 changing a completely conserved glycine residue to a glutamate. The missense mutation was inherited from their mother who was of Finnish descent. The intronic mutation affects mRNA splicing and results in inclusion of pseudoexons in most transcripts in muscle. The pseudoexon inclusion results in a change in the reading frame and appearance of a premature stop codon. In western blot analysis of protein extracts from fibroblasts, there was no pronounced reduction of IscU in any of the patients, but the analysis revealed that the species corresponding to mitochondrial IscU migrates slower than a species present only in whole cells. In protein extracted from isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria the western blot analysis revealed a severe deficiency of IscU in the homozygous patients and appearance of a faint new fraction that could represent a truncated protein. There was only a slight reduction of mitochondrial IscU in the compound heterozygotes, despite their severe phenotype, indicating that the IscU expressed in these patients is non-functional.","dc:creator":"Kollberg G","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Clinical manifestation and a new ISCU mutation in iron-sulphur cluster deficiency myopathy."}},{"id":"cggv:16254c04-12be-4347-8077-a0cd1bb8c80d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e53932b1-4268-4e30-9b37-2dcfc10d3e3a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19567699"}],"rdfs:label":"Kollberg_Family G"},{"id":"cggv:cb66b59d-7541-4162-9679-5ce6f664eac0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb66b59d-7541-4162-9679-5ce6f664eac0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cb66b59d-7541-4162-9679-5ce6f664eac0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This is the scoring recommendation from this GCEP for a recurrent founder variant with strong functional evidence of deleterious impact."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This is the scoring recommendation from this GCEP for a recurrent founder variant with strong functional evidence of deleterious impact."},{"id":"cggv:16254c04-12be-4347-8077-a0cd1bb8c80d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16254c04-12be-4347-8077-a0cd1bb8c80d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:16254c04-12be-4347-8077-a0cd1bb8c80d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.5 (biochemistry)"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.5 (biochemistry)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a884d1ba-0f3b-46cc-8ec7-5aac20b63b05_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a884d1ba-0f3b-46cc-8ec7-5aac20b63b05","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:1509b9de-edda-42c1-a272-c6b56eeac6d0"},"phenotypeFreeText":"This individual had childhood onset early fatigue, dyspnea and palpitation on trivial exercise.

The g.7044G>C ISCU mutation induces a splicing error in the pre-mRNA that strengthens a weak intronic splice site leading to inclusion of a new exon and subsequent loss of mRNA and protein. While ISCU is widely expressed, homozygosity for this particular intronic mutation gives rise to a pure myopathy. In order to investigate tissue specificity and disease mechanism, we studied muscle, myoblasts, fibroblasts and blood cells from the first non-Swedish case of this disease. Consistent with the recognised role of ISCU, we found abnormal activities of respiratory chain complexes containing iron-sulfur clusters in patient muscle. We confirmed that, in the presence of the g.7044G>C mutation, splicing produces both abnormally and normally spliced mRNA in all tissues. The ratio of these products varies dramatically between tissues, being most abnormal in mature skeletal muscle that also has the lowest relative starting levels of ISCU mRNA compared with other tissues. Myoblasts and fibroblasts have more of the normally spliced variant as well as higher starting levels of ISCU mRNA. Up-regulation of mtDNA copy number was found in skeletal muscle and myoblasts, but not fibroblasts, and is thought to represent a compensatory response. Tissue specificity in this disorder appears therefore to be dependent on the mRNA starting level, the amount of remaining normally spliced RNA, and the degree to which compensatory mechanisms can respond.","dc:creator":"Sanaker PS","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Differences in RNA processing underlie the tissue specific phenotype of ISCU myopathy."}},"rdfs:label":"Sanaker_Case"},{"id":"cggv:2bfe1439-f2bd-4e30-9ce4-fb304d4fc88d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2bfe1439-f2bd-4e30-9ce4-fb304d4fc88d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2bfe1439-f2bd-4e30-9ce4-fb304d4fc88d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This is the scoring recommendation from this GCEP for a recurrent founder variant with strong functional evidence of deleterious impact."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This is the scoring recommendation from this GCEP for a recurrent founder variant with strong functional evidence of deleterious impact."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d495f9a7-7068-4f8d-951c-bf0fecf637e9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d495f9a7-7068-4f8d-951c-bf0fecf637e9","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:1509b9de-edda-42c1-a272-c6b56eeac6d0"},"phenotypeFreeText":"This individual had childhood onset early fatigue, dyspnea and palpitation on trivial exercise.

HML is characterized by low physical performance, resulting in physical exertion that causes early exhaustion, dyspnoea and palpitations. Using an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, we mapped the trait to chromosome 12q23.3-24.11, with a maximum lod score of 5.26. The 1.6-Mb disease-critical region contained one obvious candidate gene-ISCU-specifying a protein involved in iron-sulphur cluster assembly. IscU is produced in two isoforms; one cytosolic and one mitochondrial, coded for by different splice variants of the ISCU gene. Mutational analysis of all exon and intron sequences as well as 1000 bp of the promoter of the ISCU gene revealed one intron mutation that was specific for the disease haplotype. The mutation is located in a region with homology to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), but we could not see any effect of the mutation on expression levels in vitro or in vivo. We did, however, observe a drastic difference in the splicing pattern between patients and controls.

The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features.

The severe oxidative limitation was characterized by impaired muscle oxygen extraction indicated by subnormal systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-v O2 diff) in maximal exercise (patient = 4.0 ml/dl, normal men = 16.7 +/- 2.1) despite normal oxygen carrying capacity and Hgb-O2 P50.

Initially, the Fe-S clusters are assembled on a conserved scaffold protein, iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein (ISCU), in coordination with iron and sulfur donor proteins in human mitochondria. Loss of ISCU function leads to myopathy, characterized by muscle wasting and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition to the homozygous ISCU mutation (g.7044G→C), compound heterozygous patients with severe myopathy have been identified to carry the c.149G→A missense mutation converting the glycine 50 residue to glutamate. However, the physiological defects and molecular mechanism associated with G50E mutation have not been elucidated. In this report, we uncover mechanistic insights concerning how the G50E ISCU mutation in humans leads to the development of severe ISCU myopathy, using a human cell line and yeast as the model systems. The biochemical results highlight that the G50E mutation results in compromised interaction with the sulfur donor NFS1 and the J-protein HSCB, thus impairing the rate of Fe-S cluster synthesis. As a result, electron transport chain complexes show significant reduction in their redox properties, leading to loss of cellular respiration. Furthermore, the G50E mutant mitochondria display enhancement in iron level and reactive oxygen species, thereby causing oxidative stress leading to impairment in the mitochondrial functions. Thus, our findings provide compelling evidence that the respiration defect due to impaired biogenesis of Fe-S clusters in myopathy patients leads to manifestation of complex clinical symptoms.","dc:creator":"Saha PP","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"The presence of multiple cellular defects associated with a novel G50E iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein (ISCU) mutation leads to development of mitochondrial myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Saha_Yeast"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"There is consistent biochemistry."},{"id":"cggv:ca013452-d864-4365-a022-a418db3c8336","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ff9801b-0c95-43cd-a085-4873e8ea764b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Expression is recapitulated.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27783661","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by an intronic one-base mutation in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (ISCU) gene, resulting in aberrant splicing.

The symptoms in HML are restricted to skeletal muscle, and it has been proposed that this effect is due to higher levels of incorrectly spliced ISCU in skeletal muscle compared with other energy-demanding tissues. In this study, we confirm that skeletal muscle contains the highest levels of incorrect ISCU splice variants compared with heart, brain, liver and kidney using a transgenic mouse model expressing human HML mutated ISCU. We also show that incorrect splicing occurs to a significantly higher extent in the slow-twitch soleus muscle compared with the gastrocnemius and quadriceps. The splicing factor serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) was identified as a potential candidate for the slow fiber specific regulation of ISCU splicing since this factor was expressed at higher levels in the soleus compared to the gastrocnemius and quadriceps. We identified an interaction between SRSF3 and the ISCU transcript, and by overexpressing SRSF3 in human myoblasts we observed increased levels of incorrectly spliced ISCU, while knockdown of SRSF3 resulted in decreased levels.

The *ISCU* gene encodes an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly enzyme. This is a scaffold protein necessary for the de novo synthesis of Fe-S clusters within mitochondria. This is also important in iron homeostasis and for aconitase activity. There are two isoforms, one cytosolic and one mitochondrial, due to alternative splicing of pre-mRNA.\n\n*ISCU* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18304497) in three individuals with myopathy and myoglobinuria (although these individuals were reported in manuscripts from 1991 and 1995, PMIDS: 1918374, 7616539, respectively). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *ISCU*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *ISCU* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *ISCU* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes two variants (one splicing founder variant and one missense variant) in eleven probands across five publications (PMIDs: 18296749, 18304497, 19567699, 20206689, 35079622) although additional cases have been reported in the medical literature. Features seen in affected individuals include childhood-onset exercise intolerance/early fatigue, dyspnea, hyperkinetic circulation with tachycardia and palpitations on trivial exercise, ptosis, metabolic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. This condition is typically non-progressive with periods of stability. Muscle biopsy shows a distinctive deficiency of several mitochondrial Fe-S proteins (complex I, II, and III; mitochondrial aconitase) as well as iron overload in muscle fibers. Brain imaging was generally normal and affected individuals had variably elevated lactate at rest. \n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, yeast models, and a transgenic mouse model expressing human mutated *ISCU* (PMIDs: 33340416, 1918374, 8254022, 20206689, 24573684, 27783661).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
