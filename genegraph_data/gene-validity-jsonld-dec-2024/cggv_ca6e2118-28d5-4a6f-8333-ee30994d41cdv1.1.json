Except for clinical descriptions, little is known about the pathogenesis of this disease. We have generated heterozygous Sox9 mutant mice that phenocopy most of the skeletal abnormalities of this syndrome. The Sox9(+/-) mice died perinatally with cleft palate, as well as hypoplasia and bending of many skeletal structures derived from cartilage precursors. In embryonic day (E)14.5 heterozygous embryos, bending of radius, ulna, and tibia cartilages was already prominent. In E12.5 heterozygotes, all skeletal elements visualized by using Alcian blue were smaller. In addition, the overall levels of Col2a1 RNA at E10.5 and E12.5 were lower than in wild-type embryos. We propose that the skeletal abnormalities observed at later embryonic stages were caused by delayed or defective precartilaginous condensations. Furthermore, in E18.5 embryos and in newborn heterozygotes, premature mineralization occurred in many bones, including vertebrae and some craniofacial bones. Because Sox9 is not expressed in the mineralized portion of the growth plate, this premature mineralization is very likely the consequence of allele insufficiency existing in cells of the growth plate that express Sox9. Because the hypertrophic zone of the heterozygous Sox9 mutants was larger than that of wild-type mice, we propose that Sox9 also has a role in regulating the transition to hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate. Despite the severe hypoplasia of cartilages, the overall organization and cellular composition of the growth plate were otherwise normal. Our results suggest the hypothesis that two critical steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway are sensitive to Sox9 dosage. First, an early step presumably at the stage of mesenchymal condensation of cartilage primordia, and second, a later step preceding the transition of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes.","dc:creator":"Bi W","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Haploinsufficiency of Sox9 results in defective cartilage primordia and premature skeletal mineralization."},"rdfs:label":"Bi Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:ca6e2118-28d5-4a6f-8333-ee30994d41cd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca6e2118-28d5-4a6f-8333-ee30994d41cd_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:042a8a77-366d-4f29-8667-811b4ca8e9ed_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ecd7fef-b933-4d03-bbed-b95635de7542","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0009815","obo:HP_0000878","obo:HP_0004482","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0001776","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0002982"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:042a8a77-366d-4f29-8667-811b4ca8e9ed_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:926a923c-3680-42ef-9e6c-78af00208aff","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000346.4(SOX9):c.155del (p.Thr52SerfsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA916084400"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8411055","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We present a mother and daughter with clinical and radiological findings consistent with the diagnosis of campomelic dysplasia.

CD results from haploinsufficiency for the transcription factor SOX9, a key regulator at various steps of cartilage differentiation and of early testis development. Two functional domains are so far recognized for SOX9, a high-mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal transactivation domain. We present two CD patients with de novo mutations in a conserved region preceding the HMG domain. A long-term survivor with the acampomelic form of CD has an A76E amino acid substitution, while a severely affected CD patient had an in-frame deletion of amino acid residues 66-75. The conserved domain has been shown to function in the related transcription factor SOX10 as a DNA-dependent dimerization domain. We show that, like SOX10, SOX9 also binds cooperatively as a dimer to response elements in regulatory regions of some target genes such as the cartilage genes Col11a2 and CD-Rap. Dimerization and the resulting capacity to activate promoters via dimeric binding sites is lost in both mutant SOX9 proteins while other features involved in SOX9 function remained unaltered. These findings establish the dimerization domain as the third domain essential for SOX9 function during chondrogenesis.","dc:creator":"Sock E","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Loss of DNA-dependent dimerization of the transcription factor SOX9 as a cause for campomelic dysplasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12783851","rdfs:label":"Patient E.R."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:dd979b17-c1e5-4fca-b78b-7185cc0b9b84_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0cc56ccf-ec87-4cad-bd35-9fb67201f1bb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"detectionMethod":"","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002751","obo:HP_0006487","obo:HP_0003083","obo:HP_0010034","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0002104","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000316"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:dd979b17-c1e5-4fca-b78b-7185cc0b9b84_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5874be86-c03e-49e4-9aca-b930c2a81ef4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000346.4(SOX9):c.509C>T (p.Pro170Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA400866452"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12161603","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Mansour S","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The phenotype of survivors of campomelic dysplasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12161603","rdfs:label":"Case 5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:af96ec12-2a54-445f-b98c-785abc0773c6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89dbb4a3-d910-4f9c-9f0c-0c4f02c9ec5a","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","phenotypeFreeText":"Normal female genitalia and ovaries appear histologically normal with oocytes","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000476","obo:HP_0006487","obo:HP_0002827","obo:HP_0000882","obo:HP_0000878","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0009826"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Intersex","variant":{"id":"cggv:af96ec12-2a54-445f-b98c-785abc0773c6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:7fefc6d2-8236-4297-83ac-9d8a61636118","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000346.4(SOX9):c.855_858dup (p.Glu287HisfsTer10)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA923726100"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7990924","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Induction of testis development in mammals requires the presence of the Y-chromosome gene SRY.
