Here, we report the identification of mutations in transport protein particle complex 11 (TRAPPC11) in three individuals of a consanguineous Syrian family presenting with LGMD and in five individuals of Hutterite descent presenting with myopathy, infantile hyperkinetic movements, ataxia, and intellectual disability. By using a combination of whole-exome or genome sequencing with homozygosity mapping, we identified the homozygous c.2938G>A (p.Gly980Arg) missense mutation within the gryzun domain of TRAPPC11 in the Syrian LGMD family and the homozygous c.1287+5G>A splice-site mutation resulting in a 58 amino acid in-frame deletion (p.Ala372_Ser429del) in the foie gras domain of TRAPPC11 in the Hutterite families. TRAPPC11 encodes a component of the multiprotein TRAPP complex involved in membrane trafficking. We demonstrate that both mutations impair the binding ability of TRAPPC11 to other TRAPP complex components and disrupt the Golgi apparatus architecture. Marker trafficking experiments for the p.Ala372_Ser429del deletion indicated normal ER-to-Golgi trafficking but dramatically delayed exit from the Golgi to the cell surface. Moreover, we observed alterations of the lysosomal membrane glycoproteins lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and LAMP2 as a consequence of TRAPPC11 dysfunction supporting a defect in the transport of secretory proteins as the underlying pathomechanism.

Identifying additional variants will further our understanding of the clinical spectrum of phenotypes and will reveal regions of the protein critical for its functions. Here we report three individuals from unrelated families that have bi-allellic TRAPPC11 variants. Subject 1 harbors a compound heterozygous variant (c.1287 + 5G > A and c.3379_3380insT). The former variant results in a partial deletion of the foie gras domain (p.Ala372_Ser429del), while the latter variant results in a frame-shift and extension at the carboxy terminus (p.Asp1127Valfs*47). Subjects 2 and 3 both harbour a homozygous missense variant (c.2938G > A; p.Gly980Arg). Fibroblasts from all three subjects displayed membrane trafficking defects manifested as delayed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport and/or a delay in protein exit from the Golgi. All three individuals also show a defect in glycosylation of an ER-resident glycoprotein. However, only the compound heterozygous subject displayed an autophagic flux defect. Collectively, our characterization of these individuals with bi-allelic TRAPPC11 variants highlights the functional importance of the carboxy-terminal portion of the protein.","dc:creator":"Milev MP","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Characterization of three TRAPPC11 variants suggests a critical role for the extreme carboxy terminus of the protein."}},{"id":"cggv:924976fe-8e8a-4e03-9447-a539c73972ba_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0405b644-a56f-4480-8d77-c0aca77c1f45"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31575891"}],"rdfs:label":"S1"},{"id":"cggv:924976fe-8e8a-4e03-9447-a539c73972ba","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:924976fe-8e8a-4e03-9447-a539c73972ba_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:924976fe-8e8a-4e03-9447-a539c73972ba_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"c.3379–3380InsT variant led to defective protein glycosylation and impairment of autophagy in patient fibroblasts. \n"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The variant is in the C terminus and may escape nonsense mediated decay.

In addition, we uncover a defect in protein glycosylation intrappc11mutants that is associated with reduced levels of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) and compensatory up-regulation of genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway that produces the LLO anchor dolichol. Treating wild-type larvae with terpenoid or LLO synthesis inhibitors phenocopies the stressed UPR seen intrappc11mutants and is synthetically lethal withtrappc11mutation. We propose that reduced LLO level causing hypoglycosylation is a mechanism of stressed UPR induction intrappc11mutants. Of importance, in human cells, depletion of TRAPPC11, but not other TRAPP components, causes protein hypoglycosylation, and lipid droplets accumulate in fibroblasts from patients with theTRAPPC11mutation.

Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is typically characterized by childhood-onset of proximal muscle weakness resulting in gait abnormalities and scapular winging. Many patients have elevated serum creatine kinase. A subset of patients displayed hyperkinetic movement disorder with chorea, ataxia, or dystonia and global developmental delay. Additional phenotypes such as alacrima, achalasia, cataracts, or hepatic steatosis have been observed in the literature.\n \n*TRAPC11* has been noted to be associated with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although many authors have noted a phenotypic expansion in the literature, where the term *TRAPPC11*-related myopathy has been coined. ORPHANET lists intellectual disability-hyperkinetic movement-truncal ataxia syndrome (ORPHA:369847) and Triple A syndrome (ORPHA:869) as additional gene-disease assertions. For the purposes of this curation, cases have been scored under the autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMDR18 included) disease entity, which falls under the umbrella term of *TRAPPC11*-related myopathies in MONDO. \n \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 23830518, 26322222, 27707803, 28827486, 31575891, 30105108, 29855340, 27862579, 34648194). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 7 additional family members in 2 families (PMID:23830518). Not all probands were scored due to the absence of in trans confirmation of compound heterozygous variants, however, the maximum score for genetic evidence of 12 points has been reached.  The majority of pathogenic variants in *TRAPPC11* reported in ClinVar are nonsense or frameshift variants where loss of function is the mechanism of disease.\n \nSummary of Experimental Data: 2.5 POINTS. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal model and functional alteration in human cell line (PMID: 26912795, 21525244). Loss-of-function mutations in the zebrafish ortholog of C11 have been found in the foie gras mutant, characterized by steatohepatitis and eye development defects (PMID:26912795). Mutant *TRAPPC11* zebrafish exhibits a phenotype similar to that observed in humans with respect to Golgi complex formation and endoplasmic reticulum organization supporting the role of *TRAPPC11* in the characteristic muscle phenotypes. Research conducted using HeLa cell lines revealed the role of *TRAPPC11* subunit it protein glycosylation. In HeLa cells siRNA knockdown of C11 leads to impaired binding of other TRAPP components, functional impairment of the complex, retention of secretory proteins in the ERGIC, and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (PMID:21525244).\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on the meeting date of December 14th, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8b835ba1-afbd-48ac-afec-b9396acc5521"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
