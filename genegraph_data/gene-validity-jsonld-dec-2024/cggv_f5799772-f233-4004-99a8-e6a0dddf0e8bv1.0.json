The present study was performed to find whether the CDH23 mutations are also responsible for non-syndromic hearing loss in patients in the Japanese population. A total of 51 sequence variants were found in 64 Japanese probands with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment from autosomal recessive families. Among them, at least four missense mutations in six patients from five families were confirmed to be responsible for deafness by segregation study. All mutations detected were missense mutations, corroborating the previous reports regarding DFNB12. The present data confirmed that CDH23 mutations are frequently found and significantly responsible in Japanese. Interestingly, the CDH23 mutation spectrum in Japanese is very different from that found in Caucasians. This Japanese spectrum may be representative of those in Eastern Asian populations and its elucidation is expected to facilitate the molecular diagnosis of DFNB12 and USH1D.","dc:creator":"Wagatsuma M","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Distribution and frequencies of CDH23 mutations in Japanese patients with non-syndromic hearing loss."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17850630","rdfs:label":"Family 4 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgraded based on Founder variant guidelines.

To assess the importance of CDH23 mutations in non-syndromic hearing loss, two-step screening was applied and clinical characteristics of the patients with CDH23 mutations were examined in this study. As a first screening, we performed Sanger sequencing using 304 probands compatible with recessive inheritance to find the pathologic mutations. Twenty-six possible mutations were detected to be pathologic in the first screening. For the second screening, using the probes for these 26 mutations, a large cohort of probands (n = 1396) was screened using Taqman amplification-based mutation analysis followed by Sanger sequencing. The hearing loss in a total of 52 families (10 homozygous, 13 compound heterogygous, and 29 heterozygous) was found to be caused by the CDH23 mutations. The majority of the patients showed congenital, high frequency involved, progressive hearing loss. Interestingly, some particular mutations cause late onset moderate hearing loss.

In 20 Palestinian kindreds with prelingual nonsyndromic hearing loss, we generated homozygosity profiles reflecting linkage to the phenotype. Family sizes ranged from small nuclear families with two affected children, one unaffected sibling, and parents to multigenerational kindreds with 12 affected relatives. By including unaffected parents and siblings and screening 250 K SNP arrays, even small nuclear families yielded informative profiles. In 14 families, we identified the allele responsible for hearing loss by screening a single candidate gene in the longest homozygous region. Novel alleles included missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations of CDH23, MYO7A, MYO15A, OTOF, PJVK, Pendrin/SLC26A4, TECTA, TMHS, and TMPRSS3, and a large genomic deletion of Otoancorin (OTOA). All point mutations were rare in the Palestinian population (zero carriers in 288 unrelated controls); the carrier frequency of the OTOA genomic deletion was 1%. In six families, we identified five genomic regions likely to harbor novel genes for human hearing loss on chromosomes 1p13.3 (DFNB82), 9p23-p21.2/p13.3-q21.13 (DFNB83), 12q14.3-q21.2 (DFNB84; two

Interestingly, different mutations in a gene can cause syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of deafness, as well as progressive and age-related hearing loss. We provide here an explanation for the phenotypic variability associated with mutations in the cadherin 23 gene (CDH23). CDH23 null alleles cause deaf-blindness (Usher syndrome type 1D; USH1D), whereas missense mutations cause nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB12). In a forward genetic screen, we have identified salsa mice, which suffer from hearing loss due to a Cdh23 missense mutation modeling DFNB12. In contrast to waltzer mice, which carry a CDH23 null allele mimicking USH1D, hair cell development is unaffected in salsa mice. Instead, tip links, which are thought to gate mechanotransduction channels in hair cells, are progressively lost. Our findings suggest that DFNB12 belongs to a new class of disorder that is caused by defects in tip links. We propose that mutations in other genes that cause USH1 and nonsyndromic deafness may also have distinct effects on hair cell development and function.","dc:creator":"Schwander M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"A mouse model for nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB12) links hearing loss to defects in tip links of mechanosensory hair cells."},"rdfs:label":"Schwander Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f5799772-f233-4004-99a8-e6a0dddf0e8b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:39c8b0cf-c4ea-4565-9255-a6c9eb0d6f4a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b9d169c-186e-4629-a290-7a02dc7f10ce","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In salsa mice, hair bundles were unaffected at day P5 and P28.

Recently, we have discovered that the erlong (erl) mutation of the cadherin23 (Cdh23) gene leads to hearing loss due to hair cell apoptosis. In this study, we aimed to reveal the molecular pathways upstream to apoptosis in hair cells to exploit more effective therapeutics than an anti-apoptosis strategy. Our results suggest that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is the earliest molecular event leading to the apoptosis of hair cells and hearing loss in erl mice. We also report that the ER stress inhibitor, Salubrinal (Sal), could delay the progression of hearing loss and preserve hair cells. Our results provide evidence that therapies targeting signaling pathways in ER stress development prevent hair cell apoptosis at an early stage and lead to better outcomes than those targeting downstream factors, such as tip-link degeneration and apoptosis.","dc:creator":"Hu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"ER stress inhibitor attenuates hearing loss and hair cell death in Cdh23erl/erl mutant mice."},"rdfs:label":"Hu Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":633,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:88009b38-cb38-4ba8-a734-0210af2dfb48","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:13733","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between CDH23 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 11/30/2017. Variants in CDH23 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2007 (Wagatsuma et al. 2007). At least 23 missense and 1 in-frame deletion have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 40 probands in 4 publications (17850630, 19888295, 22899989, 21940737). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 9 additional family members. Only 9 missense variants have been scored in 9 probands, because the individuals were tested by funduscopy which sufficiently ruled out retinitis pigmentosa (Schultz et al. 2011, 21940737). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Usher syndrome Type 1. Mostly loss of function variants in CDH23 have been associated with Usher syndrome Type 1, therefore this has been assessed separately as Definitive by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group. The CDH23 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss gene-disease association is supported by multiple mouse models, including models with spontaneous homozygous missense variants (19270079, 27882946, 25732708, 21689626). Expression analysis suggests apoptosis as a mechanism of disease. In summary, CDH23 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 5/22/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f5799772-f233-4004-99a8-e6a0dddf0e8b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
