To determine whether novel DDX41 mutations could be identified in families with additional types of hematologic malignancies, our group screened two cohorts of families with a diverse range of hematologic malignancy subtypes. Among 289 families, we identified nine (3%) with DDX41 mutations. As previously observed, MDS and AML were the most common malignancies, often of the erythroblastic subtype, and 1 family displayed early-onset follicular lymphoma. Five novel mutations were identified, including missense mutations within important functional domains and start-loss and splicing mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins. We also show that most asymptomatic mutation carriers have normal blood counts until malignancy develops. This study expands both the mutation and phenotypic spectra observed in families with germ line DDX41 mutations.

The DDX41 gene encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase and is one of the 13 genes associated with autosomal dominant familial myeloid or lymphoid malignancies (PMID: 27133828, 28547672). DDX41 was first reported in relation to familial myeloid malignancy in a family with 4 family members affected by AML or MDS in 2015, where a germline frameshift variant in DDX41 was found to segregate in all tested affected individuals [PMID:25920683]. To date, at least 25 germline heterozygous variants (frameshift, splice, indel, missense) have been reported in over 70 families with a wide range of malignancies (PMID: 28547672, 28637623) of which 13 were included in this curation to maximize genetic evidence score (12 pts). The most commonly seen DDX41 variants are frameshifts, resulting in premature termination of the protein, suggesting loss of function or haploinsufficiency is the mechanism of tumorigenesis for this disorder (PMID:28637623, 26712909). This gene-disease association is also supported by rescue cell culture model, protein interactions, functional alteration and expression studies (PMID:25920683, 26944477). In summary, DDX41 is definitively associated with the autosomal-dominant (AD) DDX41-related hematologic malignancy predisposition syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e3db8214-a39d-408d-a3c2-7b4e817b1cc1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
