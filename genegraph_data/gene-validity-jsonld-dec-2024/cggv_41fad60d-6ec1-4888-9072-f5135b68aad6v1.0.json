To elucidate the molecular basis of IPF, we performed exome sequencing of familial kindreds with pulmonary fibrosis. Gene burden analysis comparing 78 European cases and 2,816 controls implicated PARN, an exoribonuclease with no previous connection to telomere biology or disease, with five new heterozygous damaging mutations in unrelated cases and none in controls (P = 1.3 × 10(-8)); mutations were shared by all affected relatives (odds in favor of linkage = 4,096:1). RTEL1, an established locus for dyskeratosis congenita, harbored significantly more new damaging and missense variants at conserved residues in cases than in controls (P = 1.6 × 10(-6)). PARN and RTEL1 mutation carriers had shortened leukocyte telomere lengths, and we observed epigenetic inheritance of short telomeres in family members. Together, these genes explain ~7% of familial pulmonary fibrosis and strengthen the link between lung fibrosis and telomere dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Stuart BD","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Exome sequencing links mutations in PARN and RTEL1 with familial pulmonary fibrosis and telomere shortening."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41fad60d-6ec1-4888-9072-f5135b68aad6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41fad60d-6ec1-4888-9072-f5135b68aad6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:90267600-1bdb-462e-aff0-67f97c703d27","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5702e24c-5efd-4a9d-9697-dded511d0f61","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"iPSCs from patient fibroblasts showed a deficiency in PARN transcripts and reduced TERC levels in comparison to normal iPSCs.

Deep sequencing of TERC RNA 3' termini shows that PARN is required for removal of post-transcriptionally acquired oligo(A) tails that target nuclear RNAs for degradation. Diminished TERC levels and the increased proportion of oligo(A) forms of TERC are normalized by restoring PARN, which is limiting for TERC maturation in cells.

PARN is an extensively characterized exonuclease with deadenylation activity that controls mRNA stability in part and therefore regulates expression of a large number of genes. The DC-associated mutations identified affect key domains within the protein, and evaluation of patient cells revealed reduced deadenylation activity. This deadenylation deficiency caused an early DNA damage response in terms of nuclear p53 regulation, cell-cycle arrest, and reduced cell viability upon UV treatment. Individuals with biallelic PARN mutations and PARN-depleted cells exhibited reduced RNA levels for several key genes that are associated with telomere biology, specifically TERC, DKC1, RTEL1, and TERF1.

The features of *PARN*-related short telomere syndrome are variable, but can include oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, abnormal skin pigmentation, premature graying of the hair, cerebellar hypoplasia, bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and short telomere length (PMIDs: 25893599, 25848748). Pulmonary phenotypes have been seen both in isolation and as part of a syndromic presentation (PMID: 34479523). In addition to a variable phenotype, there is also incomplete penetrance of pulmonary fibrosis in individuals who have monoallelic *PARN* variants (PMID: 25848748). Typically, pediatric presentation is often in the context of the Hoyerall-Hreidarsson syndrome or dyskeratosis congenita, whereas pulmonary fibrosis is the most common manifestation in adulthood. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: dyskeratosis congenita, autosomal recessive 6 (OMIM: 616353), pulmonary fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure syndrome, telomere-related, 4 (OMIM: 616371), Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (ORPHA:3322).\nThirteen variants (4 missense, 3 frameshift, 3 canonical splice-site, 2 nonsense, 1 intronic deletion) that have been reported in 11 probands across 4 publications (PMIDs: 30525901, 25893599, 25848748, 31448843) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function that results in shortened telomeres.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical function data showing a shared function with other genes that cause short telomere syndromes (PMIDs: 26482878, 20301779, 20301408). In addition, functional alteration assays in non-patient cells exhibiting reduced deadenylation of telomerase RNA and subsequent decrease in telomerase activity (PMIDs: 31273937, 25893599), a cell culture model showing reduced *PARN* protein level and shortened telomeres (PMID: 31448843), and a knockdown zebrafish model system that has a hematological phenotype similar to the human bone marrow phenotype, which is rescued by injection of human *PARN* mRNA (PMID: 26342108).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PARN* and semidominant *PARN*-related short telomere syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Interstitial Lung Disease GCEP on the meeting date October 25, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:41fad60d-6ec1-4888-9072-f5135b68aad6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
