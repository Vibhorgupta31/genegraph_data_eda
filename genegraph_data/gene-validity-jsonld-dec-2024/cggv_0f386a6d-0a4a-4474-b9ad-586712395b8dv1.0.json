Of note, *NPRL2* is a member of the GATOR1 complex, which also includes *DEPDC5* and *NPRL3*. Each of these genes have an asserted relationship with autosomal dominant focal epilepsy (PMID: 23542697, 26505888). \n\nTen variants in *NPRL2* (4 missense, 2 splice site, 3 nonsense and 1 frameshift) that have been reported in 12 probands in eight publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 26505888, 27173016, 28199897, 29281825, 30093711, 31835056, 34376795). Variants in this gene have been observed to segregate with disease in families, but with incomplete penetrance (PMIDs: 26505888, 27173016, 28199897, 34376795). Additionally, several individuals with focal epilepsy and variants in *NPRL2* have been reported to have focal cortical dysplasia (PMIDs: 27173016, 30093711, 29281825, 37259768). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NPRL2* and autosomal dominant focal epilepsy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date July 18, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0f386a6d-0a4a-4474-b9ad-586712395b8d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
