In wild type mice, claudin 14 was immunolocalized at hair cell and supporting cell TJs.

Typically, the DFNB29 phenotype is characterized by prelingual, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss. The goal of this study was to define the identity and frequency of CLDN14 mutations and associated inner ear phenotypes in a cohort of 800 Pakistani families segregating deafness. Hearing loss in 15 multi-generational families was found to co-segregate with CLDN14-linked STR markers. The sequence of the six exons and regions flanking the introns of CLDN14 in these 15 families revealed five likely pathogenic alleles. Two are novel missense substitutions (p.Ser87Ile and p.Ala94Val), whereas p.Arg81His, p.Val85Asp and p.Met133ArgfsX23 have been reported previously. Haplotype analyses indicate that p.Val85Asp and p.Met133ArgfsX23 are founder mutations. The p.Val85Asp accounts for ~67% of the mutant alleles of CLDN14 in our cohort.

Targeted serial Sanger sequencing of probands for deafness alleles (n = 23) that we previously identified in this founder population was negative. Whole exome sequencing in four members of the largest family (R2010) identified a CLDN14 (DFNB29) variant [c.488C>T; p.

Although not associated with deafness or disease, CLDN14 p.(Ala163Val) has been previously reported as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Targeted sequencing of 169 deafness probands identified one homozygote and one heterozygous carrier. Genealogical studies, cascade sequencing and haplotype analysis across four unrelated families showed all subjects with the unique audioprofile (n = 12) were also homozygous for p.(Ala163Val) and shared a 1.4 Mb DFNB29-associated haplotype on chromosome 21. Most significantly, sequencing 175 population controls revealed 1% of the population are heterozygous for CLDN14 p.(Ala163Val), consistent with a major founder effect in Newfoundland.

in claudin 14 (CLDN14) cause nonsyndromic DFNB29 deafness in humans. The analysis of a murine model indicated that this phenotype is associated with degeneration of hair cells, possibly due to cation overload. However, the mechanism linking these alterations to CLDN14 mutations is unknown. To investigate this mechanism, we compared the ability of wild-type and missense mutant CLDN14 to form tight junctions. Ectopic expression in L mouse fibroblasts (LM cells) of wild-type CLDN14 protein induced the formation of tight junctions, while both the c.254T>A (p.V85D) mutant, previously identified in a Pakistani family, and the c.301 G>A (p.G101R) mutant, identified in this study through the screen of 183 Spanish and Greek patients affected with sporadic nonsyndromic deafness, failed to form such junctions. However, the two mutant proteins differed in their ability to localize at the plasma membrane. We further identified hitherto undescribed exons of CLDN14 that are utilized in alternative spliced transcripts. We demonstrated that different mutations of CLDN14 impaired by different mechanisms the ability of the protein to form tight junctions. Our results indicate that the ability of CLDN14 to be recruited to these junctions is crucial for the hearing process.","dc:creator":"Wattenhofer M","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Different mechanisms preclude mutant CLDN14 proteins from forming tight junctions in vitro."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15880785","rdfs:label":"Patient K126"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because a second variant was not identified."},{"id":"cggv:dee0fc27-314b-45d6-98c8-253a12c49c86_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3e08c04-da07-4efc-a86f-9d6df2f36abd","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000407","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:dee0fc27-314b-45d6-98c8-253a12c49c86_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f7af004c-5b96-4230-9bbe-01be36c993be","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000021.9:g.36461405G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10019299"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27870113","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Identifying the genetic etiology in a person with hearing loss (HL) is challenging due to the extreme genetic heterogeneity in HL and the population-specific variability. In this study, after excluding GJB2 variants, targeted resequencing of 180 deafness-related genes revealed the causative variants in 11 of 19 (58%) Brazilian probands with autosomal recessive HL. Identified pathogenic variants were in MYO15A (10 families) and CLDN14 (one family). Remarkably, the MYO15A p.(Val1400Met) variant was identified in eight families from the city of Monte Santo in the northeast region of Brazil. Haplotype analysis of this variant was consistent with a single founder. No other cases with this variant were detected among 105 simplex cases from other cities of northeastern Brazil, suggesting that this variant is confined to a geographical region. This study suggests that it is feasible to develop population-specific screening for deafness variants once causative variants are identified in different geographical groups.","dc:creator":"Manzoli GN","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Targeted Resequencing of Deafness Genes Reveals a Founder MYO15A Variant in Northeastern Brazil."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27870113","rdfs:label":"Family 1502"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because there is no specific phenotypic information, and no functional evidence."},{"id":"cggv:df01e800-d289-4749-88e9-a94101d450d8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:059a26be-5cef-4885-ae94-58ac91523c2a","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Candidate sequencing performed after variant identified in R2010.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000399","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:df01e800-d289-4749-88e9-a94101d450d8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8ed47b6d-b664-4baa-a035-b0954fee9911"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27838790"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27838790","rdfs:label":"R2033 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because R2033 is related to R2010 and R2075."},{"id":"cggv:a503e092-1c04-4738-97fa-94013c4e6938_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41a36aa2-6eb8-4cd1-a071-e5343210fc97","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Candidate sequencing performed after variant identified in R2010.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000399","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:a503e092-1c04-4738-97fa-94013c4e6938_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8ed47b6d-b664-4baa-a035-b0954fee9911"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27838790"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27838790","rdfs:label":"R2072 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Possible founder variant, or possible relation to R2033, R2075, R2010."},{"id":"cggv:84df4f98-49cb-43d2-9b43-d60e85d68e2d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e5fd9c4-9d8e-4c49-baea-e87b1ceb4dba","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Negative for GJB2 vairants.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000399","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:84df4f98-49cb-43d2-9b43-d60e85d68e2d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:70b42d5d-74e5-4250-8647-bab2cdaa1bce","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001146077.1(CLDN14):c.242G>A (p.Arg81His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/189331"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22246673"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22246673","rdfs:label":"Family 4209 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded because variant is a missense in a consanguineous family."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":198,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:781fb953-9938-4083-bf8f-16965723d168","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:2035","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between CLDN14 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 11/17/2017. Variants in CLDN14 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2001 (Wilcox et al.). At least 7 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 6 publications (11163249, 20811388, 22246673, 23235333, 27870113, 27838790). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 49 additional family members.  Many of the reported variants are believed to be founder variants from Pakistan and Newfoundland and Labrador Province. This gene-disease association is supported by a knockout mouse model and additional expression and functional alteration evidence. In summary, CLDN14 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 5/1/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:17528cdb-97e0-4128-92de-9e419902aa62"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
