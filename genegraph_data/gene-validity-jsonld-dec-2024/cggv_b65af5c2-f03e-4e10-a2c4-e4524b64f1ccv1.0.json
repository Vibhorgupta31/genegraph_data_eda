In a forward genetic screen to identify genes required for neuronal function and survival in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons, we have identified mutations in the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase, Aats-met, the homologue of human MARS2. The fly mutants exhibit age-dependent degeneration of photoreceptors, shortened lifespan, and reduced cell proliferation in epithelial tissues. We further observed that these mutants display defects in oxidative phosphorylation, increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and an upregulated mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response. With the aid of this knowledge, we identified MARS2 to be mutated in Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia with Leukoencephalopathy (ARSAL) patients. We uncovered complex rearrangements in the MARS2 gene in all ARSAL patients. Analysis of patient cells revealed decreased levels of MARS2 protein and a reduced rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Patient cells also exhibited reduced Complex I activity, increased ROS, and a slower cell proliferation rate, similar to Drosophila Aats-met mutants.","dc:creator":"Bayat V","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase cause a neurodegenerative phenotype in flies and a recessive ataxia (ARSAL) in humans."}},{"id":"cggv:4d8abe70-20d0-4c4b-8227-867add7adfd0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3f9dcad1-be1d-4399-b135-bae1be356b0c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22448145"}],"rdfs:label":"E10"},{"id":"cggv:4d8abe70-20d0-4c4b-8227-867add7adfd0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d8abe70-20d0-4c4b-8227-867add7adfd0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4d8abe70-20d0-4c4b-8227-867add7adfd0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"E10 lymphoblast cell lines showed significantly increased MARS2 mRNA expression compared to controls (Fig. 8A).

Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.","dc:creator":"Boczonadi V","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial DNA transcription and translation: clinical syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Review of mitochondrial translation disorders "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10+ genes with mitochondrial disease association implicated in mitochondrial translation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:b65af5c2-f03e-4e10-a2c4-e4524b64f1cc_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:153a49da-f0fa-4aac-b3ee-b2c3f0c58111","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0512a9bf-dc09-4019-93fd-76359eb767aa","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"A severe shRNA-mediated knockdown (SH-452) clearly affects mitochondrial protein translation (Figure S6E), whereas a less severe reduction in MARS2 (SH-152) does not cause an obvious reduction in mitochondrial protein translation when compared to wild-type controls.

The *MARS2* gene encodes mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe *MARS2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2012 (PMID: 22448145). This paper described the molecular etiologies in families originally reported in 2006 (PMID: 16672289). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MARS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (three complex rearrangements, each determined to be a founder variant within the French-Canadian population, one missense variant, and one stop-gained variant) identified in five individuals from two publications (PMIDs: 22448145, 25754315). Affected individuals were reported to have leukoencephalopathy, cerebellar vermis atrophy, dystonia, ataxia, spasticity, and dysarthria. The phenotype of affected individuals with the French-Canadian founder variant or other complex rearrangements has been termed **a**utosomal **r**ecessive **s**pastic **a**taxia with **l**eukoencephalopathy (ARSAL; PMID: 22448145). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration studies in HEK293 cells showing disrupted mitochondrial protein translation, evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in patient cells, and early lethality and mitochondrial dysfunction in two independent Drosophila models, each homozygous for a missense change (PMID: 22448145). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 4, 2022 (SOP Version 8).
