Although neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse subventricular zone have been suggested to divide asymmetrically, intrinsic cell fate determinants for asymmetric NSC division are largely unknown. Stem cell niches are important for stem cell maintenance, but the niche for the maintenance of adult quiescent NSCs has remained obscure. Here we show that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) is required to maintain quiescent NSCs in the adult mouse subventricular zone. Dll1 protein is induced in activated NSCs and segregates to one daughter cell during mitosis. Dll1-expressing cells reside in close proximity to quiescent NSCs, suggesting a feedback signal for NSC maintenance by their sister cells and progeny. Our data suggest a model in which NSCs produce their own niche cells for their maintenance through asymmetric Dll1 inheritance at mitosis.","dc:creator":"Kawaguchi D","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Dll1 maintains quiescence of adult neural stem cells and segregates asymmetrically during mitosis."},"rdfs:label":"Kawaguchi_Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:540026a9-f4b2-45eb-a76e-d0d2ec8432de","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1966fdf2-c9a9-4f8b-8271-c4af25255bc1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Like brain abnormalities seen in humans, Arzate found that MRI analysis performed in adult mice brains confirmed the smaller size of the brain of Dll1+/lacZ mice; total brain volume of Dll1+/lacZ mice was about 15% less than that of WT mice.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36590296","rdfs:label":"Arzate_Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:83ba0dc3-95f6-4c50-8616-ea2d3eeb7456_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8645,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ae0faf48-f5ad-476b-be13-f6e8b2414a1b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0032877","gene":"hgnc:2908","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"DLL1 has been reported in relation to autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder with nonspecific brain abnormalities and with or without seizures (NEDBAS) (Fischer-Zirnsak et al. 2019, PMID: 31353024). NEDBAS is a highly variable syndrome characterized by impaired intellectual development and behavioral abnormalities associated with structural changes in brain imaging. Note: there have been reports of individuals with holoprosencephaly and either copy number variants including DLL1 (in addition to other genes) or single nucleotide variants in DLL1 (along with other variants in other holoprosencephaly genes).  This information is not being considered as part of this curation.  \n\nFive frameshift, four nonsense, two missense, and one indel variants that have been reported in 12 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs:31353024, 37204857) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity has been shown to be haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models (PMIDs: 23695674, 36590296). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between DLL1 and autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder with nonspecific brain abnormalities and with or without seizures. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations GCEP on the meeting date April 23rd, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:83ba0dc3-95f6-4c50-8616-ea2d3eeb7456"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
