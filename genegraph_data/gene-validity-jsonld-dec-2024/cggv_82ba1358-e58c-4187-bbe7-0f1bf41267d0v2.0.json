The existence of bacterial homologues (40-50% identity with AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2) forming bi- or tri-functional proteins with a putative kinase belonging to the family of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases suggested that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 acted on phosphorylated and aminated compounds. Vertebrate genomes were found to encode a homologue (AGPHD1) of these putative bacterial kinases, which was therefore likely to phosphorylate an amino compound bearing a hydroxyl group. These and other considerations led us to hypothesize that AGPHD1 corresponded to 5-hydroxy-L-lysine kinase and that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 catalyzed the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent breakdown of phosphoethanolamine and 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine. The three recombinant human proteins were produced and purified to homogeneity. AGPHD1 was indeed found to catalyze the GTP-dependent phosphorylation of 5-hydroxy-L-lysine. The phosphorylation product made by this enzyme was metabolized by AGXT2L2, which converted it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate, and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde. AGXT2L1 catalyzed a similar reaction on phosphoethanolamine, converting it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate, and acetaldehyde. AGPHD1 and AGXT2L2 are likely to be the mutated enzymes in 5-hydroxylysinuria and 5-phosphohydroxylysinuria, respectively. The high level of expression of AGXT2L1 in human brain, as well as data in the literature linking AGXT2L1 to schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, suggest that these diseases may involve a perturbation of brain phosphoethanolamine metabolism. AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2, the first ammoniophospholyases to be identified, belong to a family of aminotransferases acting on Ï‰-amines.","dc:creator":"Veiga-da-Cunha M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Molecular identification of hydroxylysine kinase and of ammoniophospholyases acting on 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine and phosphoethanolamine."},"rdfs:label":"5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine phospho-lyase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"PHYKPL catalyzed the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent breakdown of 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine, converting it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde.

Using a standardized phenotyping platform that incorporates high-resolution 3D imaging, we identify phenotypes at multiple time points for previously uncharacterized genes and additional phenotypes for genes with previously reported mutant phenotypes. Unexpectedly, our analysis reveals that incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are common even on a defined genetic background.

In the present work, we tested the hypothesis that this condition is due to mutations in the AGXT2L2 gene, recently shown to encode phosphohydroxylysine phospholyase. DNA analysis from a third patient, without neurological symptoms, but with an extreme hyperlaxicity of the joints, shows the existence of two mutations, p. Gly240Arg and p.Glu437Val, both in the heterozygous state. Sequencing of cDNA clones derived from fibroblasts mRNA indicated that the two mutations were allelic. Both mutations replace conserved residues. The mutated proteins were produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and HEK293T cells and shown to be very largely insoluble, whereas the wild-type one was produced as a soluble and active protein. We conclude that phosphohydroxylysinuria is due to mutations in the AGXT2L2 gene and the resulting lack of activity of phosphohydroxylysine phospholyase in vivo. The finding that the nul alleles of p.Gly240Arg and p.Glu437Val are present at low frequencies in the European and/or North American population suggests that this condition is more common than previously thought. The diversity of the clinical symptoms described in three patients with phosphohydroxylysinuria indicates that this is most likely not a neurometabolic disease.

The disease was first described by Dorland et al., 1990 (PMID: 2387074) from two patients with neurological problems, however these symptoms could be attributed to infectious causes in both cases. The two original cases were not available for molecular analysis of PHYKPL. A third case was subsequently identified and two unique missense variants were reported in this single case (PMID: 23242558). This case was not reported to have neurological problems but did have an Ehler-Danlos phenotype, thought to be unrelated to her metabolic defect. From the limited information available at this time it is difficult to determine if phosphohydroxylysinuria is a neurometabolic disease or an isolated metabolic abnormality. In addition to the single case, evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the experimental data establishing the role of PHYKPL in the breakdown of 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine (PMID: 22241472) and a knockout mouse model from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium with limited relevant characterization. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously approved by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020.
