In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging pattern recognition analysis to identify patients with the same novel heritable disorder. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to discover the mutated gene. We identified seven patients sharing a previously undescribed magnetic resonance imaging pattern, characterized by initial swelling with T2 hyperintensity of the basal nuclei, thalami, cerebral white matter and cortex, pons and midbrain, followed by rarefaction or cystic degeneration of the white matter and, eventually, by progressive cerebral, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy. All patients developed a severe encephalopathy with rapid deterioration of neurological functions a few weeks after birth, followed by respiratory failure and death. Lactate was elevated in body fluids and on magnetic resonance spectroscopy in most patients. Whole-exome sequencing in a single patient revealed two predicted pathogenic, heterozygous missense mutations in the SLC19A3 gene, encoding the second thiamine transporter. Additional predicted pathogenic mutations and deletions were detected by Sanger sequencing in all six other patients. Pathology of brain tissue of two patients demonstrated severe cerebral atrophy and microscopic brain lesions similar to Leigh's syndrome. Although the localization of SLC19A3 expression in brain was similar in the two investigated patients compared to age-matched control subjects, the intensity of the immunoreactivity was increased. Previously published patients with SLC19A3 mutations have a milder clinical phenotype, no laboratory evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and more limited lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. In some, cerebral atrophy has been reported. The identification of this new, severe, lethal phenotype characterized by subtotal brain degeneration broadens the phenotypic spectrum of SLC19A3 mutations. Recognition of the associated magnetic resonance imaging pattern allows a fast diagnosis in affected infants.","dc:creator":"Kevelam SH","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Exome sequencing reveals mutated SLC19A3 in patients with an early-infantile, lethal encephalopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23482991","rdfs:label":"Patient 5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:b735e694-e147-4139-8965-ad6478c34afa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2458cbd8-273f-4304-809b-2b3f39254bb2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":18,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"At 18 days old, admitted for irritability, seizures, vomiting;

We studied 11 Alaskan Husky dogs with AHE, but found no abnormalities in respiratory chain enzyme activities in muscle and liver, or mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear genes that cause LS in people. A genome wide association study was performed using eight of the affected dogs and 20 related but unaffected control AHs using the Illumina canine HD array. SLC19A3 was identified as a positional candidate gene. This gene controls the uptake of thiamine in the CNS via expression of the thiamine transporter protein THTR2. Dogs have two copies of this gene located within the candidate interval (SLC19A3.2 - 43.36-43.38 Mb and SLC19A3.1 - 43.411-43.419 Mb) on chromosome 25. Expression analysis in a normal dog revealed that one of the paralogs, SLC19A3.1, was expressed in the brain and spinal cord while the other was not. Subsequent exon sequencing of SLC19A3.1 revealed a 4bp insertion and SNP in the second exon that is predicted to result in a functional protein truncation of 279 amino acids (c.624 insTTGC, c.625 C>A). All dogs with AHE were homozygous for this mutation, 15/41 healthy AH control dogs were heterozygous carriers while 26/41 normal healthy AH dogs were wild type. Furthermore, this mutation was not detected in another 187 dogs of different breeds.

SLC19A3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2013 (Gerards et al., PMID: 23423671). At least 25 unique variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 6 publications (PMIDs 23482991, 24878502, 23589815, 24166474, 26975589, 27896110) and variants in this gene segregated with disease in three additional family members (PMID: 23423671). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by the known biochemical function and animal models. The mechanism for disease is thiamine transporter deficiency. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease. This phenotype will be assessed separately. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SLC19A3 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum.
