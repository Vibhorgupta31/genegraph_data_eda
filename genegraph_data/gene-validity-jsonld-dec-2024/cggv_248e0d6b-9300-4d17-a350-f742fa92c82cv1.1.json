These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.

The patient harbouring this mutation was followed for three decades, and her cardiac hypertrophy gradually normalised. However, she developed severe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and atrophy.

Here, we comprehensively analyzed the biochemical and structural features of ten germline KRAS mutations using physical and cellular biochemistry. According to their distinct biochemical and structural alterations, the mutants can be grouped into five distinct classes, four of which markedly differ from RAS oncoproteins. Investigated functional alterations comprise the enhancement of intrinsic and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalyzed nucleotide exchange, which is alternatively accompanied by an impaired GTPase-activating protein (GAP) stimulated GTP hydrolysis, an overall loss of functional properties, and a deficiency in effector interaction. In conclusion, our data underscore the important role of RAS in the pathogenesis of the group of related disorders including NS, CFCS, and CS, and provide clues to the high phenotypic variability of patients with germline KRAS mutations.","dc:creator":"Gremer L","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Germline KRAS mutations cause aberrant biochemical and physical properties leading to developmental disorders."},"rdfs:label":"Extensive study of 10 KRAS variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"these endpoints are not specific to NS."},{"id":"cggv:c34ce448-f6e9-494d-adee-5fe172fb31b5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fea2cd21-218a-485d-ad87-15d84de2b3bf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The luciferase assay revealed that the D153V protein led to significantly higher level of ELK activation than the WT.

Each of these conditions can be caused by germline mutations in key components of the highly conserved Ras-MAPK pathway, possibly reflecting a similar pathogenesis underlying the three disorders. Germline mutations in KRAS have recently been identified in a small number of patients with Noonan syndrome and CFC.","dc:creator":"Zenker M","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Expansion of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum in patients with KRAS germline mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056636","rdfs:label":"Patient No 8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Variant was functionally characterized by Niihori et al. 2006."},{"id":"cggv:80199ba6-1434-461b-858e-d8fd177f8d60_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ada4f93-100f-4d1f-bf30-36a80bb3fc9c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"phenotypeFreeText":"pulmonic stenosis; hypertelorism; downslanted palpebral fissures; anteverted nares; low-set ears; short neck; webbed neck; ptosis; moderate global developmental delay; fine hair; sparse eyebrow; deep palmar crease; deep plantar creases; failure to thrive; \"unilateral pyelectasia\"","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Negative for variants in BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:80199ba6-1434-461b-858e-d8fd177f8d60_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c3545151-cb3b-4f66-b602-5dfc0d711cf6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033360.4(KRAS):c.64C>G (p.Gln22Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA384157372"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056636"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056636","rdfs:label":"Patient No 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:98e29124-8c1a-4d47-806a-9c5b6dc1279b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c106e118-46c1-4c08-9da3-0d68f7cff566","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"phenotypeFreeText":"growth failure; intellectual disability, severe; macrocephaly; narrow forehead; underdeveloped supraorbital ridges; downslanted palpebral fissure; hypoplastic nasal bridge; anteverted nares; abnormality of the helix; high, narrow palate; curly hair; sparse hair; cardiomyopathy; paroxysmal atrial tachycardia","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:98e29124-8c1a-4d47-806a-9c5b6dc1279b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:74d1d660-37cb-4c74-ac46-0feba01fbf0c"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16474404"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16474404","rdfs:label":"CFC8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This study screened 43 CFCS patients for variants in HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS.

However, variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals may complicate the clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome (NS) versus CFC. Furthermore, there is sufficient variant overlap between KRAS-associated Noonan and CFC phenotypes. Additional genotype-phenotype correlations are necessary to solidify the association of KRAS with CFC syndrome, therefore it cannot yet be classified as Definitive. The KRAS gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the CFC phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). Of note, KRAS has also been classified as Definitive in association with Noonan syndrome and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating KRAS with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair or NS with multiple lentigines. In summary, the evidence supporting the association between KRAS and CFC is Strong. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).\nSee evidence summary","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:248e0d6b-9300-4d17-a350-f742fa92c82c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
