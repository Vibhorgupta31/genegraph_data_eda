The glycosylation status of CS serum proteins showed a very unusual pattern of glycosylation characterized by a significant accumulation of agalactosylated fucosylated structures as well as asialylated fucosylated structures demonstrating a major defect of glycan maturation in CS. However, CS transferrin and α1-AT profiles, two liver-derived proteins, were normal. We also showed that intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 and LAMP-2, two highly glycosylated cellular proteins, presented an altered migration profile on SDS-PAGE in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CS patients. RNA interference against VPS13B confirmed these glycosylation defects. Experiments with Brefeldin A demonstrated that intracellular retrograde cell trafficking was normal in CS fibroblasts. Furthermore, early endosomes were almost absent in these cells and lysosomes were abnormally enlarged, suggesting a crucial role of VPS13B in endosomal-lysosomal trafficking.

Here, we show that association of COH1 with the Golgi complex depends on the small GTPase RAB6. RNAi-mediated knockdown of RAB6A/A' prevents the localization of COH1 to the Golgi complex. Expression of the constitutively inactive RAB6_T27N mutant led to an increased solubilization of COH1 from lipid membrane preparations. Co-IP experiments confirmed the physical interaction of COH1 with RAB6 that preferentially occurred with the constitutively active RAB6_Q72L mutants. Depletion of COH1 in primary neurons negatively interfered with neurite outgrowth, indicating a causal link between the integrity of the Golgi complex and axonal outgrowth.

This association was made using case-level data only. More than 150 variants in this gene, mostly nonsense and frameshift, but also including large deletions and missense variants, have been reported in humans. Cohen syndrome is characterized chiefly by intellectual disability and developmental delay, typical facial gestalt, pigmentary retinopathy and intermittent neutropenia. It is over-represented in the Finnish population, likely due to a founder effect, with patients exhibiting a homogeneous phenotype. VPS13B was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2003 (Kolehmainen et al., PMID: 12730828).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS\nThe association is seen in at least 10 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 12730828, 15173253, 26104215, 29149870, 19006247, 29758347). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 41 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function, with the majority of variants observed being null variants (frameshift/nonsense) and predicted or shown to result in reduced mRNA product due to nonsense-mediated decay (PMID: 21865173).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 0.5 POINTS\nThe pathological mechanism of the disease is not clearly understood, and experimental evidence elucidating VPS13B protein function is still emerging. This gene is found to be expressed ubiquitously in most human tissues, but at higher levels in specific areas of the brain (PMID: 15173253). It is also shown that two alternatively spliced transcripts (using exon 28 and 28b) of the gene are expressed exclusively in the brain and retina, while only one (using exon 28b) is expressed ubiquitously (PMID: 19006247). Many alternatively spliced transcripts exist for VPS13B, but none of the variants reported in this gene are exclusive to specific transcripts. \n\nThe loss of VPS13B by siRNA silencing has been found to reduce neurite length, showing that loss of function variations in this gene result in functional alteration of the protein (PMID: 25492866). In addition, VPS13B is also shown to localize to the Golgi apparatus, interacting with Golgi-associated proteins, and be involved in Golgi assembly and glycosylation of other proteins (PMID: 21865173, 24334764). Although there is little experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship at this time, the abundance of genetic evidence compels a definitive link between VPS13B and Cohen syndrome. \n\nIn summary, the VPS13B - Autosomal Recessive Cohen Syndrome gene-disease relationship is Definitive.\nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Autism and Intellectual Disability Expert Panel on 08/15/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ccfc68bc-9f00-4565-b2c7-70ad9f8e2002"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
