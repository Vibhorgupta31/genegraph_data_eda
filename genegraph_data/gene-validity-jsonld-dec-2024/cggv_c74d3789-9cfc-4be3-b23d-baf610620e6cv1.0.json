Patients with ATP6B1 mutations also have sensorineural hearing loss; consistent with this finding, we demonstrate expression of ATP6B1 in cochlea and endolymphatic sac. Our data, together with the known requirement for active proton secretion to maintain proper endolymph pH, implicate ATP6B1 in endolymph pH homeostasis and in normal auditory function.

OMIM #267300) often associated with sensorineural hearing impairment; however, mice with a knockout mutation of Atp6v1b1 were reported to exhibit a compensated acidosis and normal hearing. We discovered a new spontaneous mutation (vortex, symbol vtx) of Atp6v1b1 in an MRL/MpJ (MRL) colony of mice. In contrast to the reported phenotype of the knockout mouse, which was developed on a primarily C57BL/6 (B6) strain background, MRL-Atp6v1b1vtx/vtx mutant mice exhibit profound hearing impairment, which is associated with enlarged endolymphatic compartments of the inner ear. Mutant mice have alkaline urine but do not exhibit overt metabolic acidosis, a renal phenotype similar to that of the Atpbv1b1 knockout mouse. The abnormal inner ear phenotype of MRL- Atp6v1b1vtx/vtx mice was lost when the mutation was transferred onto the C57BL/6J (B6) background, indicating the influence of strain-specific genetic modifiers. To genetically map modifier loci in Atp6v1b1vtx/vtx mice, we analysed ABR thresholds of progeny from a backcross segregating MRL and B6 alleles. We found statistically significant linkage with a locus on Chr 13 that accounts for about 20% of the hearing threshold variation in the backcross mice. The important effect that genetic background has on the inner ear phenotype of Atp6v1b1 mutant mice provides insight into the hearing loss variability associated with dRTA caused by ATP6V1B1 mutations. Because MRL-Atp6v1b1vxt/vtx mice do not recapitulate the metabolic acidosis of dRTA patients, they provide a new genetic model for nonsyndromic deafness with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA; OMIM #600791).","dc:creator":"Tian C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Hearing loss without overt metabolic acidosis in ATP6V1B1 deficient MRL mice, a new genetic model for non-syndromic deafness with enlarged vestibular aqueducts."},"rdfs:label":"Tian Mouse Model 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":510,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:506fd84f-c789-422e-a454-9afe51b2b6f4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009968","gene":"hgnc:853","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between ATP6V1B1 and autosomal recessive renal tubular acidosis with deafness was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 12/13/2017. Variants in ATP6V1B1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1999 (Karet et al.). At least 6 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Many more papers have been published since the original Kerat et al. 1999 paper with autosomal recessive renal tubular acidosis and hearing loss cases due to ATP6V1B1 variants, however the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The majority of patients have LOF variants, with some missense cases. There is one mouse model with a homozygous missense ATP6V1B1 variant resulting in hearing loss, however there is a knockout model in which the mice have renal tubular acidosis and normal hearing (PMID 28934385, 12782355). Hearing loss prevalence is about 90%. In summary, ATP6V1B1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive renal tubular acidosis with deafness.
