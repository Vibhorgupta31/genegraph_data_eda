In humans, three homozygous loss-of-function missense mutations located within the forkhead domain have been reported in 5 patients with Bamforth syndrome. This syndrome is a rare inherited condition whose main features are congenital hypothyroidism (CH) due to TD (usually athyreosis), cleft palate, and spiky hair, with or without choanal atresia and bifid epiglottis. These FOXE1 mutations were typically inherited from heterozygous carrier parents who were usually consanguineous. Recently, a novelmissense mutation was found in a patient with sporadic Bamforth syndrome, inherited via uniparental isodisomy. Altogether these observations strongly suggest that FOXE1 is involved in both familial and sporadic syndromic CH due to TD in association with cleft palate. Nevertheless, despite intensive research, FOXE1 mutations have been identified in only a minority of the affected patients. Recent data suggest that the transcription factor encoded by FOXE1 may act as a susceptibility factor for TD via variations in FOXE1 polyalanine tract length, which may modulate the risk of TD.","dc:creator":"Castanet M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Spectrum of Human Foxe1/TTF2 Mutations."}},"rdfs:label":"Castanet and Polak_Unpublished Case"},{"id":"cggv:34b96765-1a53-4f4b-9bb4-dd4e402ecd44","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34b96765-1a53-4f4b-9bb4-dd4e402ecd44_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:34b96765-1a53-4f4b-9bb4-dd4e402ecd44_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"To investigate MSX1 and TGF-β3 regulation by FOXE1, real-time PCR was performed on cDNA samples from 293 EBNA cells overexpressing wt or mutant FOXE1.

Mutations in PAX8, TITF1, or FOXE1 may account for congenital hypothyroidism in patients with either isolated TD or TD with associated malformations involving kidney, lung, forebrain, and palate. Pax8, titf1, and foxe1 are expressed in the mouse thyroid bud as soon as it differentiates on the pharyngeal floor. Because the spatio-temporal expression of these genes is unknown in humans, we decided to study them at different stages of human embryonic and fetal development. PAX8 and TITF1 were first expressed in the median thyroid primordium. Interestingly, PAX8 was also expressed in the thyroglossal duct and the ultimobranchial bodies. Human FOXE1 expression was detected later than in the mouse. PAX8 was also expressed in the developing central nervous system and kidney, including the ureteric bud and the main collecting ducts. TITF1 was expressed in the ventral forebrain and lung. FOXE1 expression was detected in the oropharyngeal epithelium and thymus. In conclusion, the expression patterns described here show some differences from those reported in the mouse. They explain the malformations associated with TD in patients carrying PAX8, TITF1, and FOXE1 gene mutations.","dc:creator":"Trueba SS","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"PAX8, TITF1, and FOXE1 gene expression patterns during human development: new insights into human thyroid development and thyroid dysgenesis-associated malformations."},"rdfs:label":"Trueba_Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0a00a763-90dc-4d36-8b34-54cf4f477269_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7530b01e-05b2-4523-bcb8-49d741d7a07e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:656496e3-8639-4a00-a027-8ed8e78e996f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"They found that that DNA binding by in vitro-translated p.Ala65Val mutant TTF-2 protein was dramatically reduced compared to WT","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9697705","rdfs:label":"Clifton-Bligh Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:0a00a763-90dc-4d36-8b34-54cf4f477269_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1b0e35c8-8322-4dff-906c-ba892909eadf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:acda726e-c33f-4646-923e-51aa2ca943f6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Decreased expression of MSX1 and TGF-B3 in the maxillary molar dental mesenchyme and in the epithelial cells of the anterior palate shelves is similar to the human phenotype since these are the regions of interest in the disease.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21177256","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"FOXE1 mutations cause the Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome characterized by thyroid and craniofacial defects. Although a pioneer activity of FOXE1 in thyroid development has been reported, FOXE1 regulation in other contexts remains unexplored. We pointed to: (i) a role of FOXE1 in controlling the expression of MSX1 and TGF-β3 relevant in craniofacial development and (ii) a causative part of FOXE1 mutations or mice Foxe1(-/-) genotype in the pathogenesis of cleft palate in the Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome. The MSX1 and TGF-β3 up-regulation in response to FOXE1 at both transcriptional and translational levels and the recruitment of FOXE1 to specific binding motifs, together with the transactivation of the promoters of these genes, indicate that MSX1 and TGF-β3 are direct FOXE1 targets. Moreover, we showed that all the known forkhead-domain mutations, but not the polyalanine-stretch polymorphisms, affect the FOXE1 ability to bind to and transactivate MSX1 and TGF-β3 promoters. In 14-day Foxe1(-/-) mice embryos, Tgf-β3 and Msx1 mRNAs were almost absent in palatal shelves compared with Foxe1(+/-) embryos. Our findings give new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome-associated facial defects.","dc:creator":"Venza I","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"MSX1 and TGF-beta3 are novel target genes functionally regulated by FOXE1."},"rdfs:label":"Venza_Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:4a4989b2-8461-4cac-9fbd-1e9b81a0cb79","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3662a3ba-efa6-44f7-a2bc-998b9662c163","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Like in humans, homozygous mice mice revealed severe cleft palate, no thyroid gland in its normal location, and a corresponding absence of thyroid hormones, measured as free thyroxine, in the bloodstream","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9697704","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Alteration of thyroid gland morphogenesis (thyroid dysgenesis) is a frequent human malformation. Among the one in three to four thousand newborns in which congenital hypothyroidism is detected, 80% have either an ectopic, small and sublingual thyroid, or have no thyroid tissue. Most of these cases appear sporadically, although a few cases of recurring familial thyroid dysgenesis have been described. The lack of evidence for hereditary thyroid dysgenesis may be due to the severity of the hypothyroid phenotype. Neonatal screening and early thyroid hormone therapy have eliminated most of the clinical consequences of hypothyroidism such that the heritability of this condition may become apparent in the near future. We have recently cloned cDNA encoding a forkhead domain-containing transcription factor, TTF-2, and have located the position of the gene, designated Titf2, to mouse chromosome 4 (ref. 3). Titf2 is expressed in the developing thyroid, in most of the foregut endoderm and in craniopharyngeal ectoderm, including Rathke's pouch. Expression of Titf2 in thyroid cell precursors is down-regulated as they cease migration, suggesting that this factor is involved in the process of thyroid gland morphogenesis. Here we show that Titf2-null mutant mice exhibit cleft palate and either a sublingual or completely absent thyroid gland. Thus, mutation of Titf2-/- results in neonatal hypothyroidism that shows similarity to thyroid dysgenesis in humans.","dc:creator":"De Felice M","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"A mouse model for hereditary thyroid dysgenesis and cleft palate."},"rdfs:label":"De Felice_Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8695,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":11.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:81b54495-c526-4001-b7d1-3c83dda2fd0e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009437","gene":"hgnc:3806","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"FOXE1 was first reported in relation to AR FOXE1-related athyreosis with cleft palate in 1998 (Clifton-Bligh et al., PMID: 9697705). FOXE1-related athyreosis with cleft palate, also known as Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, is a rare disorder characterized by congenital hypothyroidism due to thyroid agenesis or thyroid hypoplasia, cleft palate, and spiky hair. Variants in FOXE1 have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, thyroid cancer, nonmedullary 4, and athyreosis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability and inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into three disease entities, Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome (MIM:241850), thyroid cancer, nonmedullary 4 (MIM:616534), and athyreosis (no MIM). The split curations for AD thyroid cancer, nonmedullary 4 and athyreosis will be curated separately by a different GCEP. \n\nFive missense and one frameshift variants that have been reported in six probands in six publications (PMIDs: 9697705, 12165566, 16882747, 20453517, 24219130, 35963604) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown at this time. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration of patient cells, animal models, and expression data (PMIDs: 9697705, 9697704, 15494458, 21177256). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between FOXE1 and Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP on the meeting date May 16th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0a00a763-90dc-4d36-8b34-54cf4f477269"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
