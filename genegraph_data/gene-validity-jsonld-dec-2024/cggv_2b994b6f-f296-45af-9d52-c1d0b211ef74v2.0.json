The catabolism of the methyl group and sulfur atom of Met ultimately appears to be dependent upon the transmethylation-transsulfuration pathway because the MTA formed as the co-product of polyamine synthesis is efficiently recycled to Met. On the other hand, the fate of the four-carbon chain of Met appears to depend upon the initial fate of the Met molecule. During transsulfuration, the carbon chain is released as alpha-ketobutyrate, which is further metabolized to CO2. In the polyamine pathway, the carboxyl carbon of Met is lost in the formation of dAdoMet, whereas the other three carbons are ultimately excreted as polyamine derivatives and degradation products. The role of the transamination pathway of Met metabolism is not firmly established. Cys (which may be formed from the sulfur of Met and the carbons of serine via the transsulfuration pathway) appears to be converted to taurine and CO2 primarily by the cysteinesulfinate pathway, and to sulfate and pyruvate primarily by desulfuration pathways in which a reduced form of sulfur with a relatively long biological half-life appears to be an intermediate. With the exception of the nitrogen of Met that is incorporated into polyamines, the nitrogen of Met or Cys is incorporated into urea after it is released as ammonium [in the reactions catalyzed by cystathionase with either cystathionine (from Met) or cystine (from Cys) as substrate] or it is transferred to a keto acid (in Cys or Met transamination). Many areas of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism need further study. The magnitude of AdoMet flux through the polyamine pathway in the intact animal as well as details about the reactions involved in this pathway remain to be determined. Both the pathways and the possible physiological role of alternate (AdoMet-independent) Met metabolism, including the transamination pathway, must be elucidated. Despite the growing interest in taurine, investigation of Cys metabolism has been a relatively inactive area during the past two decades. Apparent discrepancies in the reported data on Cys metabolism need to be resolved. Future work should consider the role of extrahepatic tissues in amino acid metabolism as well as species differences in the relative roles of various pathways in the metabolism of Met and Cys.","dc:creator":"Stipanuk MH","dc:date":"1986","dc:title":"Metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids."},"rdfs:label":"Sarcosine Dehydrogenase role in Choline metabolism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Disruption of SARDH's involvement in the choline metabolic pathway is consistent with elevations of sarcosine in blood and urine.

We encountered six families from two different descents (French and Arab), each with at least one individual with elevated levels of sarcosine in blood and urine. Using the \"candidate gene approach\" we sequenced the gene encoding sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH), which plays an important role in the conversion of sarcosine to glycine, and found four different mutations (P287L, V71F, R723X, R514X) in three patients. In an additional patient, we found a uniparental disomy in the region of SARDH gene. In two other patients, we did not find any mutations in this gene. We have shown for the first time that mutations in the SARDH gene are associated with sarcosinemia. In addition, our results indicate that other genes are most probably involved in the pathogenesis of this condition.","dc:creator":"Bar-joseph I","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in the sarcosine dehydrogenase gene in patients with sarcosinemia."}},"rdfs:label":"D"},{"id":"cggv:68d4d3ad-30bd-41be-ba76-67a878e20d61","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:68d4d3ad-30bd-41be-ba76-67a878e20d61_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Homozygous missense variant with no supporting evidence for deleterious impact.

Sarcosinemia is caused by a defect in the conversion of sarcosine to glycine, which is catalyzed by SARDH. The clinical phenotypes of sarcosinemia vary considerably and it has been suggested that it is a benign condition (Bar-joseph et al., 2010). All known  variants in SARDH were reported in humans with this disease in 2012 (Bar-joseph et al., 22825317). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes only one paper with case-level data.   In summary, there is  limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence, both genetic and experimental, is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence that contradicts the gene-disease relationship has been found. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 06/28/19 (SOP Version 6). It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with no new evidence found.
