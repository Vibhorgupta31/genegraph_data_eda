A whole-genome linkage mapping effort was made with three HSP-affected families from Spain, Portugal, and Tunisia and it allowed us to reduce the SPG26 locus interval from 34 to 9 Mb. Subsequently, a targeted capture was made to sequence the entire exome of affected individuals from these three families, as well as from two additional autosomal-recessive HSP-affected families of German and Brazilian origins. Five homozygous truncating (n = 3) and missense (n = 2) mutations were identified in B4GALNT1. After this finding, we analyzed the entire coding region of this gene in 65 additional cases, and three mutations were identified in two subjects. All mutated cases presented an early-onset spastic paraplegia, with frequent intellectual disability, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy as well as cortical atrophy and white matter hyperintensities on brain imaging. B4GALNT1 encodes Î²-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 1 (B4GALNT1), involved in ganglioside biosynthesis. These findings confirm the increasing interest of lipid metabolism in HSPs. Interestingly, although the catabolism of gangliosides is implicated in a variety of neurological diseases, SPG26 is only the second human disease involving defects of their biosynthesis.","dc:creator":"Boukhris A","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Alteration of ganglioside biosynthesis responsible for complex hereditary spastic paraplegia."}},"rdfs:label":"Variant 3"},{"id":"cggv:3baad7fd-9c39-48d6-94a2-e8a748576430","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3baad7fd-9c39-48d6-94a2-e8a748576430_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3baad7fd-9c39-48d6-94a2-e8a748576430_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"- Enzyme activity of B4GALNT1 mutant M1 (Tunisian family) in flow cytometry showed small peaks of GM2.\n- Immunoblotting for B4GALNT1 proteins was performed, and M1 showed definite bands."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Missense mutation with significant functional evidence."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4cabf677-8fa5-4455-831c-1d06dd48c780_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:36b69d5c-65b8-4aa6-8fa9-4d6ed6ba2ac2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36b69d5c-65b8-4aa6-8fa9-4d6ed6ba2ac2","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:06dc050a-a9f4-4d56-86ec-01613fd97ec3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001478.5(B4GALNT1):c.1556G>C (p.Arg519Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA237818367"}},{"id":"cggv:f260fcc9-c153-48b8-8de5-27dfe6bb269a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001478.5(B4GALNT1):c.532-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA385499977"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b3e9066e-a2b2-428d-bec8-7be648705a67_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:06dc050a-a9f4-4d56-86ec-01613fd97ec3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35775650","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Childhood-onset forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia are ultra-rare diseases and often present with complex features. Next-generation-sequencing allows for an accurate diagnosis in many cases but the interpretation of novel variants remains challenging, particularly for missense mutations. Where sufficient knowledge of the protein function and/or downstream pathways exists, functional studies in patient-derived cells can aid the interpretation of molecular findings. We here illustrate the case of a 13-year-old female who presented with global developmental delay and later mild intellectual disability, progressive spastic diplegia, spastic-ataxic gait, dysarthria, urinary urgency, and loss of deep tendon reflexes of the lower extremities. Exome sequencing showed a novel splice-site variant in trans with a novel missense variant in B4GALNT1 [NM_001478.5: c.532-1G>C/c.1556G>C (p.Arg519Pro)]. Functional studies in patient-derived fibroblasts and cell models of GM2 synthase deficiency confirmed a loss of B4GALNT1 function with no synthesis of GM2 and other downstream gangliosides. Collectively these results established the diagnosis of B4GALNT1-associated HSP (SPG26). Our approach illustrates the importance of careful phenotyping and functional characterization of novel gene variants, particularly in the setting of ultra-rare diseases, and expands the clinical and molecular spectrum of SPG26, a disorder of complex ganglioside biosynthesis.","dc:creator":"Alecu JE","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Functional validation of novel variants in B4GALNT1 associated with early-onset complex hereditary spastic paraplegia with impaired ganglioside synthesis."}},{"id":"cggv:08f9f649-a09b-4cf6-86a7-66658fa6f650_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f260fcc9-c153-48b8-8de5-27dfe6bb269a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35775650"}],"rdfs:label":"Affected Puerto-Rican descent"},{"id":"cggv:08f9f649-a09b-4cf6-86a7-66658fa6f650","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08f9f649-a09b-4cf6-86a7-66658fa6f650_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:08f9f649-a09b-4cf6-86a7-66658fa6f650_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Exome sequencing showed a novel splice-site variant in trans with a novel missense variant in B4GALNT1.

Deficiencies in their catabolic pathways give rise to a large and well-studied group of inherited disorders, the lysosomal storage diseases. Although many glycosphingolipid catabolic defects have been defined, only one proven inherited disease arising from a defect in ganglioside biosynthesis is known. This disease, because of defects in the first step of ganglioside biosynthesis (GM3 synthase), results in a severe epileptic disorder found at high frequency amongst the Old Order Amish. Here we investigated an unusual neurodegenerative phenotype, most commonly classified as a complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, present in families from Kuwait, Italy and the Old Order Amish. Our genetic studies identified mutations in B4GALNT1 (GM2 synthase), encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the second step in complex ganglioside biosynthesis, as the cause of this neurodegenerative phenotype. Biochemical profiling of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis confirmed a lack of GM2 in affected subjects in association with a predictable increase in levels of its precursor, GM3, a finding that will greatly facilitate diagnosis of this condition. With the description of two neurological human diseases involving defects in two sequentially acting enzymes in ganglioside biosynthesis, there is the real possibility that a previously unidentified family of ganglioside deficiency diseases exist. The study of patients and animal models of these disorders will pave the way for a greater understanding of the role gangliosides play in neuronal structure and function and provide insights into the development of effective treatment therapies.","dc:creator":"Harlalka GV","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in B4GALNT1 (GM2 synthase) underlie a new disorder of ganglioside biosynthesis."}},"rdfs:label":"Kuwaiti Family Variant"},{"id":"cggv:797ba1c4-44b3-46a1-8c4c-2437d7748294","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:797ba1c4-44b3-46a1-8c4c-2437d7748294_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:797ba1c4-44b3-46a1-8c4c-2437d7748294_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Immunoblotting for B4GALNT1 proteins was performed M9 (Kuwaiti Family Variant) was expected to produce mutated enzymes, showing definite bands with a similar molecular weight to WT, or bands with a slightly higher MW.\n"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e7fb5e80-a59a-4438-838e-7f5a14c2d25e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e7fb5e80-a59a-4438-838e-7f5a14c2d25e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3c1ad49c-130d-4f71-8273-48098d5241b3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001478.5(B4GALNT1):c.1514G>A (p.Arg505His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6655420"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0034671","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0003487","obo:HP_0002061","obo:HP_0001761"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Genotyping","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:32b03208-33d6-4601-8462-5f41c770848c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3c1ad49c-130d-4f71-8273-48098d5241b3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24103911"},"rdfs:label":"VII: Old Order Amish Family"},{"id":"cggv:32b03208-33d6-4601-8462-5f41c770848c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:32b03208-33d6-4601-8462-5f41c770848c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:32b03208-33d6-4601-8462-5f41c770848c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Immunoblotting- Using cell lysates from transiently transfected B78 cells with individual mutant cDNAs, immunoblotting for B4GALNT1 proteins was performed, M11 (VII Old Order Amish) was expected to produce mutated enzymes, showing definite bands with a similar molecular weight to WT, or bands with a slightly higher MW.

Unlike the autosomal dominant form of B4GALNT1-related HSP,  the autosomal recessive form shows a broad phenotypic spectrum within and between families observed in the recorded subjects. Phenotypes reported with *B4GALNT*-related AR HSP include lower limb spasticity and weakness, mild to moderate intellectual impairment, amyotrophy, gait disturbance, and Babinski signs. Therefore, AR variants in *B4GALNT* have been lumped into one disease entity, complex hereditary spastic paraplegia. Fourteen different biallelic, loss-of-function variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletion, duplication, splice-site) that have been reported in 13 families in 6 different publications (PMIDs: 15635080, 24103911, 24283893, 23746551, 30521973, 35775650) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\n\nHaploinsufficiency is known to be the mechanism of disease (PMID: 35775650).This gene-disease relationship is not currently supported by experimental evidence.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *B4GALNT1* and autosomal recessive complex hereditary spastic paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 1, 2023 (SOP 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4cabf677-8fa5-4455-831c-1d06dd48c780"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
