Previously, genome-wide linkage in an Arab-Israeli pedigree mapped the gene to an approximately 25 cM locus on chromosome 1q24-q32. By using whole-exome sequencing in a further Palestinian-Jordanian SPG23 pedigree, we identified a complex homozygous 4-kb deletion/20-bp insertion in DSTYK (dual serine-threonine and tyrosine protein kinase) in all four affected family members. DSTYK is located within the established linkage region and we also found the same mutation in the previously reported pedigree and another Israeli pedigree (total of ten affected individuals from three different families). The mutation removes the last two exons and part of the 3' UTR of DSTYK. Skin biopsies revealed reduced DSTYK protein levels along with focal loss of melanocytes. Ultrastructurally, swollen mitochondria and cytoplasmic vacuoles were also noted in remaining melanocytes and some keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts from an affected individual, as well as knockdown of Dstyk in mouse melanocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, were associated with increased cell death after ultraviolet irradiation. Keratinocytes from an affected individual showed loss of kinase activity upon stimulation with fibroblast growth factor. Previously, dominant mutations in DSTYK were implicated in congenital urological developmental disorders, but our study identifies different phenotypic consequences for a recurrent autosomal-recessive deletion mutation in revealing the genetic basis of SPG23.","dc:creator":"Lee JYW","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Large Intragenic Deletion in DSTYK Underlies Autosomal-Recessive Complicated Spastic Paraparesis, SPG23."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7},{"id":"cggv:0a788f68-5d2c-4033-b859-a9d531500bef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a788f68-5d2c-4033-b859-a9d531500bef","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9a61b12f-7221-443c-8d42-385144a63d79","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000001.11:g.205145663_205149750delinsCCTCAAGGAGCAGGACTACA","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139656514"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR confirmed the event in this family to be the same as in Family 1: a deletion accompanied by insertion of an inverted 20-bp sequence originating from 5,765 bp downstream of the original stop codon.

It contains 14 exons and encodes a 929aa protein. It has been reported to play a role in regulation of cell death (PMID:15178406).\n\nVariants in *DSTYK* have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract 1 (OMIM 610805) and Spastic paraplegia 23 (OMIM 270750). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the clinical presentations have been split into the following disease entities: Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract 1 (OMIM 610805), and complex spastic paraplegia. The following curation reports on variants related to complex spastic paraplegia. \n\n*DSTYK* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive complex hereditary spastic paraplegia in 2017 (Lee et al., PMID: 28157540). However, reports of an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by childhood-onset spastic paraplegia resulting in gait difficulties and associated with pigmentary abnormalities, including premature graying of the hair and vitiligo-like or hyperpigmented skin lesions were first published in the 1980s (PMIDs: 7441281, 12868479, 6886718, 4061404, 6264350). The linkage interval of the disorder was subsequently defined to a 25-cM region on chromosome 1q24-q32 (Blumen et al. 2003 PMID:14681889).\n\nA single, homozygous, complex rearrangement identified in three unrelated consanguineous families (Lee et al. 2017, PMID: 28157540) is included in this curation. Functional data from patient fibroblasts, melanocytes and keratinocytes supports loss of protein expression. The mechanism for disease is therefore predicted to be loss of function (PMID 28157540). \n\nMicrosatellite marker analysis showed a shared haplotype in all three reported families, therefore the score for this variant was downgraded due to suspected founder effect.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays which demonstrate an increase in cell death following UV exposure in patient fibroblasts, melanocytes and keratinocytes (PMID: 28157540). This suggests a mechanism by which loss of function of *DSTYK* causes the pigmentation defect observed in all described affected individuals.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy GCEP on the meeting date September 7, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
