This article expands phenotypic descriptions in recessive SS due to variants in genes encoding Type IX collagen. Clinical features were assessed in four families. Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood were collected from family members. Six affected patients were identified from four pedigrees with variants in COL9A1 (one family, one patient), COL9A2 (two families, three patients), and COL9A3 (one family, two patients). Three variants were novel. All patients were highly myopic with congenital megalophthalmos and abnormal, hypoplastic vitreous gel, and all had sensorineural hearing loss. One patient had severe arthropathy. Congenital megalophthalmos and myopia are common to dominant and recessive forms of SS. Sensorineural hearing loss is more common and severe in recessive SS. We suggest that COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3 be added to genetic screening panels for patients with congenital hearing loss. Although recessive SS is rare, early diagnosis would have a high impact for children with potentially dual sensory impairment, as well as identifying risk to future children.","dc:creator":"Nixon TRW","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Homozygous Type IX collagen variants (COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3) causing recessive Stickler syndrome-Expanding the phenotype."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient E"},{"id":"cggv:acb44bfd-7e81-4a25-8c12-55fc362fed4b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:acb44bfd-7e81-4a25-8c12-55fc362fed4b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:251aee57-2447-4c49-8fa5-995935a9c0c6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:251aee57-2447-4c49-8fa5-995935a9c0c6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":16,"allele":{"id":"cggv:26ba138d-df25-44d2-805b-4e86f6744225","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001853.4(COL9A3):c.1176_1198del (p.Gln393CysfsTer25)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251190"}},"detectionMethod":"Coding region and exon-intron boundaries of COL9A3, NEUROD2, NLGN1, SLC4A10","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Moderate to high myopia, astigmatism and amblyopia, moderate to severe symmetric sensorineural hearing loss (age-dependent), internal rotation of the tibia (surgically corrected), pes planus, non-specific metacarpal and femoral alteration in epiphysis, moderate to severe ID.

The clinical features were similar to the previously described COL9A3 Stickler syndrome family, including moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss, high myopia, and both tibial and femoral bowing at birth. Radiographs demonstrated abnormal capital femoral epiphyses and mild irregularities of the vertebral endplates. This case further establishes the phenotype associated with mutations in this gene. We suggest that loss of the α3 chain of type IX collagen results in a Stickler syndrome phenotype similar to that of the other autosomal recessive forms caused by mutations in genes encoding the α1 and α2 chains of type IX collagen.","dc:creator":"Hanson-Kahn A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome resulting from a COL9A3 mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"R08-308A"},{"id":"cggv:fd7b56b3-b402-4d7b-9979-fddc7defd8ba","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fd7b56b3-b402-4d7b-9979-fddc7defd8ba_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ac052ee2-4b4f-453e-aee3-26db586d5273_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac052ee2-4b4f-453e-aee3-26db586d5273","type":"Proband","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":65,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c1025e95-4a95-4ea6-95c4-baf87ac16001","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001853.4(COL9A3):c.1204C>T (p.Arg402Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA317334770"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007773","obo:HP_0000407"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:7dd27073-495b-46b5-bdf4-b834a7ee9944_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c1025e95-4a95-4ea6-95c4-baf87ac16001"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35241111"},"rdfs:label":"2- Family 2"},{"id":"cggv:7dd27073-495b-46b5-bdf4-b834a7ee9944","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7dd27073-495b-46b5-bdf4-b834a7ee9944_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded due to HL scoring "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a436c41e-0873-4e4c-b2f2-d56f75ca737a_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7727,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:2096dcda-c5b9-4409-955d-07bec43ab666","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019354","gene":"hgnc:2219","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"3.0","dc:description":"*COL9A3* was reported in relation to autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome in 2014 (Faletra et al., 24273071). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, susceptibility to intervertebral disc disease, and non-syndromic hearing loss. These have been or will be assessed separately. At least eight unique nonsense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least seven probands in five publications (PMID: 24273071, 30450842,31090205,33570243, 35241111). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and animal models(PMIDs: 1844825,15802199, 20686772). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss Working group on September 18th 2019 (SOP Version 7). It was reevaluated on December 21st 2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did change from moderate to definitive due and new case level evidence was reviewed and added (SOP Version 9)","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a436c41e-0873-4e4c-b2f2-d56f75ca737a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
