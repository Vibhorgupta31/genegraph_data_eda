Studying a large inbred African family, we recently described a novel autosomal recessive LMND variant characterized by childhood onset, generalized muscle involvement, and severe outcome, and we mapped the disease gene to a 3.9-cM interval on chromosome 1p36. We identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.1940 T-->C [p.647 Phe-->Ser]) of the Pleckstrin homology domain-containing, family G member 5 gene, PLEKHG5. In transiently transfected HEK293 and MCF10A cell lines, we found that wild-type PLEKHG5 activated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) signaling pathway and that both the stability and the intracellular location of mutant PLEKHG5 protein were altered, severely impairing the NF kappa B transduction pathway. Moreover, aggregates were observed in transiently transfected NSC34 murine motor neurons overexpressing the mutant PLEKHG5 protein. Both loss of PLEKHG5 function and aggregate formation may contribute to neurotoxicity in this novel form of LMND.","dc:creator":"Maystadt I","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"The nuclear factor kappaB-activator gene PLEKHG5 is mutated in a form of autosomal recessive lower motor neuron disease with childhood onset."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f2f5a6d-3b4f-4f4c-b560-50944b4ab34f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e44bc579-7dcf-4c21-bf82-660ced998748_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e44bc579-7dcf-4c21-bf82-660ced998748","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:29a1d055-6d3a-4c34-8f12-885554368b52","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020631.6(PLEKHG5):c.1940T>C (p.Phe647Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114710"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003307","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0001284"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Linkage Analysis","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:adc8c8a5-c1cb-46e4-9b9e-502c8396a7f6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:29a1d055-6d3a-4c34-8f12-885554368b52"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17564964"},"rdfs:label":"II-5"},{"id":"cggv:adc8c8a5-c1cb-46e4-9b9e-502c8396a7f6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:adc8c8a5-c1cb-46e4-9b9e-502c8396a7f6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:adc8c8a5-c1cb-46e4-9b9e-502c8396a7f6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"aggregates were observed in transiently transfected NSC34 murine motor neurons\noverexpressing the mutant PLEKHG5 protein."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"clusters with variants in PH domain"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d06964a9-fe8a-4483-84cf-c6ea5163e5ce_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d06964a9-fe8a-4483-84cf-c6ea5163e5ce","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3e46e682-544d-4e07-88ee-ddfd47b3a97a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020631.6(PLEKHG5):c.38del (p.Pro13HisfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144674"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0001761","obo:HP_0000762"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:47385924-844d-47b3-9807-5f193413c4c4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3e46e682-544d-4e07-88ee-ddfd47b3a97a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23777631","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) comprises a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of peripheral neuropathies characterized by progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities and distal sensory loss.

Molecular investigation of the genes from this region allowed identification of two homozygous mutations in PLEKHG5 that produce premature stop codons and are predicted to result in functional null alleles. Analysis of Plekhg5 in the mouse revealed that this gene is expressed in neurons and glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, and that knockout mice display reduced nerve conduction velocities that are comparable with those of affected individuals from both families. Interestingly, a homozygous PLEKHG5 missense mutation was previously reported in a recessive form of severe childhood onset lower motor neuron disease (LMND) leading to loss of the ability to walk and need for respiratory assistance.

It is unclear how autophagy of synaptic vesicles and components of presynaptic active zones is regulated. Here, we show that Pleckstrin homology containing family member 5 (Plekhg5) modulates autophagy of synaptic vesicles in axon terminals of motoneurons via its function as a guanine exchange factor for Rab26, a small GTPase that specifically directs synaptic vesicles to preautophagosomal structures. Plekhg5 gene inactivation in mice results in a late-onset motoneuron disease, characterized by degeneration of axon terminals. Plekhg5-depleted cultured motoneurons show defective axon growth and impaired autophagy of synaptic vesicles, which can be rescued by constitutively active Rab26.

Spinal muscular atrophy, distal, autosomal recessive, 4 (OMIM:611067) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, recessive intermediate C (OMIM:615376) have been lumped into one disease entity, neuromuscular disease (MONDO:0019056), for this curation. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, no difference in inheritance pattern, and overlapping phenotypes.\n \nFive variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) that have been reported in four probands in three publications (PMIDs:17564964, 23777631, 23844677) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was nearly reached. Mutations cluster in the Pleckstrin-Homology Domain and Rho-Guanine Exchange Factor Domain. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function and involves aggregate formation. Case-level functional data supporting pathogenicity include luciferase reporter assays showing significant reduction of nuclear factor-κB (NFkB) signaling activation and immunofluorescence assays displaying formation of aggregates in cells expressing mutant PLEKHG5 (PMIDs:17564964, 23844677). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a PLEKHG5 knockout mouse models (PMID:29084947). PLEKHG5 gene inactivation in mice resulted in a late-onset motoneuron disease, characterized by degeneration of axon terminals. An experiment treating PLEKHG5 deficient murine motoneurons with constitutively activated Rab26 rescued NFkB activation levels, but was not included in the score of this curation (PMID:29084947). Rab26 is not a direct gene product of PLEKHG5 and therefore not congruent with ClinGen scoring guidelines for rescue models.\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between PLEKHG5 and autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over.
