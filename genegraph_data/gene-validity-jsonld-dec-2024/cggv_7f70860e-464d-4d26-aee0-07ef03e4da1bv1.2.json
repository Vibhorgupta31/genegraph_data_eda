In one affected sib pair, a shared homozygous region of 5.0 Mb was identified on chromosome 6, within the RP25 locus. One of the genes residing in this interval was the retina-expressed gene EGFL11. Several genes resembling EGFL11 were predicted just centromeric of EGFL11. Extensive long-range RT-PCR, combined with 5'- and 3'- RACE analysis, resulted in the identification of a 10-kb transcript, starting with the annotated exons of EGFL11 and spanning 44 exons and 2 Mb of genomic DNA. The transcript is predicted to encode a 3165-aa extracellular protein containing 28 EGF-like and five laminin A G-like domains. Interestingly, the second part of the protein was found to be the human ortholog of Drosophila eyes shut (eys), also known as spacemaker, a protein essential for photoreceptor morphology. Mutation analysis in the sib pair homozygous at RP25 revealed a nonsense mutation (p.Tyr3156X) segregating with RP. The same mutation was identified homozygously in three arRP siblings of an unrelated family. A frame-shift mutation (pPro2238ProfsX16) was found in an isolated RP patient. In conclusion, we identified a gene, coined eyes shut homolog (EYS), consisting of EGFL11 and the human ortholog of Drosophila eys, which is mutated in patients with arRP. With a size of 2 Mb, it is one of the largest human genes, and it is by far the largest retinal dystrophy gene. The discovery of EYS might shed light on a critical component of photoreceptor morphogenesis.","dc:creator":"Collin RW","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Identification of a 2 Mb human ortholog of Drosophila eyes shut/spacemaker that is mutated in patients with retinitis pigmentosa."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18836446","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Using a positional cloning approach supported by comparative genomics, we have identified a previously unreported gene, EYS, at the RP25 locus on chromosome 6q12 commonly mutated in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.

The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and nature of EYS mutations in a clinically well-characterized cohort of 239 sporadic and arRP French cases. Direct sequencing of EYS was performed in 186 subjects for whom known mutations had previously been excluded by applying microarray technology. We mostly identified novel mutations in EYS in a total of 29 patients: Fifteen of the mutations were predicted to create premature stop codons and two represent exonic deletions. In addition, twenty missense, silent or splice-site mutations were detected. Patients revealed homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations and in some cases, only a single mutation. Most patients showed classical signs of RP with relatively preserved central vision and visual field until late in the course of the disorder. One patient showed predominance of the disease in the inferior part of the retina suggesting potential phenotypic variability. With a prevalence of 12% or more we provide evidence that EYS is a major gene for RP in France and probably elsewhere.","dc:creator":"Audo I","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"EYS is a major gene for rod-cone dystrophies in France."}},{"id":"cggv:8c84ae03-455a-4b28-9439-95587b42119a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ddc8e046-c6bf-466e-8637-b339a686aeec"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20333770"}],"rdfs:label":"Fam602 II-1"},{"id":"cggv:8c84ae03-455a-4b28-9439-95587b42119a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c84ae03-455a-4b28-9439-95587b42119a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:2b079f13-016a-4fae-bb9d-857b8ddf549e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b079f13-016a-4fae-bb9d-857b8ddf549e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7f70860e-464d-4d26-aee0-07ef03e4da1b_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:6d733bed-6b7e-450f-ad6b-4c27d68dc781_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d733bed-6b7e-450f-ad6b-4c27d68dc781","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:480c5dd2-3e14-4a56-9a42-26bdf53c5025","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142800.2(EYS):c.9182_9185del (p.Asn3061ThrfsTer3)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1633381054"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0b3f30ae-69bd-40f7-898c-c17157173901_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:480c5dd2-3e14-4a56-9a42-26bdf53c5025"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21069908","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal dystrophies characterised ultimately by the loss of photoreceptor cells.

We are also presenting the characterisation of EYS homologues in different species, and a detailed analysis of the EYS domains, with the identification of an interesting novel feature: a putative coiled-coil domain.Majority of the mutations in the arRP patients have been found within the domain structures of EYS. The minimum observed prevalence of distinct EYS mutations in our group of patients is of 15.9% (15/94), confirming a major involvement of EYS in the pathogenesis of arRP in the Spanish population.

Due to the absence of EYS in several rodent species and its retina-specific expression, still little is known about the exact function of EYS and the pathogenic mechanism underlying EYS-associated RP. We characterized eys in zebrafish, by RT-PCR analysis on zebrafish eye-derived RNA, which led to the identification of a 8,715 nucleotide coding sequence that is divided over 46 exons. The transcript is predicted to encode a 2,905-aa protein that contains 39 EGF-like domains and five laminin A G-like domains, which overall shows 33% identity with human EYS. To study the function of EYS, we generated a stable eysrmc101/rmc101 mutant zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The introduced lesion is predicted to result in premature termination of protein synthesis and lead to loss of Eys function. Immunohistochemistry on retinal sections revealed that Eys localizes at the region of the connecting cilium and that both rhodopsin and cone transducin are mislocalized in the absence of Eys. Electroretinogram recordings showed diminished b-wave amplitudes in eysrmc101/rmc101 zebrafish (5 dpf) compared to age- and strain-matched wild-type larvae. In addition, decreased locomotor activity in response to light stimuli was observed in eys mutant larvae. Altogether, our study shows that absence of Eys leads to a disorganized retinal architecture and causes visual dysfunction in zebrafish.","dc:creator":"Messchaert M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Eyes shut homolog is important for the maintenance of photoreceptor morphology and visual function in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"Danio Rerio locomotor visual response"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:56b0287f-ca6f-487c-b1a2-ec5dbc2df61a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fca5aada-10be-466a-ace2-15955d78b773","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Human retinal degeneration is caused by photoreceptor cell death; increased zebrafish retinal apoptosis is analogous.

We found *EYS*-related retinopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with biallelic pathogenic *EYS* variants causing classic retinitis pigmentosa. However broader phenotypes including cone-rod dystrophy (PMIDs: 18976725, 24652164, 29550188) and macular dystrophy (PMID 31074760) have also been described; age of onset and severity of disease appears to be variable. Because the cases with different diagnoses all exhibit a recessive mode of inheritance and share overlapping phenotypes consistent with a single spectrum of disease, and consistent with criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these cases have been lumped into a single disease entity, *EYS*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800391).\n \nSeventeen variants suspected disease-causing variants (8 predicted null and 7 missense or other variants) that have been reported in 14 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 21069908, 18976725, 18836446, 20237254, 24652164, 29550188) were scored in this curation. Homozygous variants in families from multiple countries were included in the curation (PMID 20537394, 21069908, 18836446) from both consanguineous and non-consanguineous families. However, missense variants have also been associated with *EYS*-related disease in multiple publications (PMID 20237254). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, as multiple nonsense or frameshift variants resulting in *EYS*-related disease are described in the literature (PMID: PMID 20537394, 21069908, 18836446). However, missense and splicing variants are also reported to be associated with disease (PMID 20237254). While genotype-phenotype correlations have not been well established, pathogenic variants in the conserved C-terminal portion of the amino acid sequence have been associated with a higher probability of developing a hyper-autofluorescent ring on fundus autofluorescence imaging (PMID: 29550188).”\n\nWhile the *EYS* gene was originally described in drosophila melanogaster, the *EYS* gene has apparently been lost in multiple lower mammalian species, therefore no murine data is available to support the gene-disease correlation. However, this gene-disease association is supported by multiple zebrafish model systems in which *EYS* gene knockout impairs electroretinogram recording, retinal structure and photoreceptor protein localization (PMIDs: 28378834, 30052645), consistent with a cone-rod dysfunction. Expression of EYS has also been validated in macaque retina (PMID: 27846257). Multiple cell culture models support the role of EYS in cellular ciliary structures, as EYS localizes to ciliary structures *in vitro* (PMIDs: 27846257, 33833316, 35410372).\n\nIn summary, *EYS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive *EYS*-related retinopathy; while pathogenic variants are largely associated with retinitis pigmentosa (rod-cone dystrophy), other *EYS*-related phenotypes have also been described, including cone-rod dystrophy and macular dystrophy. The relationship with retinal dystrophy has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time, leading to a Definitive classification. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on November 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7f70860e-464d-4d26-aee0-07ef03e4da1b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
