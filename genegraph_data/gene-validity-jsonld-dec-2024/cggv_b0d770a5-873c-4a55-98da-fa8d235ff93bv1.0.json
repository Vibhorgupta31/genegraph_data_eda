Synaptophysin is a highly abundant, integral SV protein necessary for the efficient retrieval of the SV SNARE protein, synaptobrevin II (sybII). However the molecular mechanism underpinning synaptophysin-dependent sybII retrieval is still unclear. We recently identified a male patient with severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epilepsy and callosal agenesis who has a point mutation in the juxtamembrane region of the fourth transmembrane domain of synaptophysin (T198I). This mutation had no effect on the activity-dependent retrieval of synaptophysin that was tagged with the genetically-encoded pH-sensitive reporter (pHluorin) in synaptophysin knockout hippocampal cultures. This suggested the mutant has no global effect on SV endocytosis, which was confirmed when retrieval of a different SV cargo (the glutamate transporter vGLUT1) was examined. However neurons expressing this T198I mutant did display impaired activity-dependent sybII retrieval, similar to that observed in synaptophysin knockout neurons. Interestingly this impairment did not result in an increased stranding of sybII at the plasma membrane. Screening of known human synaptophysin mutations revealed a similar presynaptic phenotype between T198I and a mutation found in X-linked intellectual disability. Thus this novel human synaptophysin mutation has revealed that aberrant retrieval and increased plasma membrane localisation of SV cargo can be decoupled in human disease.","dc:creator":"Harper CB","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Altered synaptobrevin-II trafficking in neurons expressing a synaptophysin mutation associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28887151","rdfs:label":"Case report"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"12 individuals from gnomAD database carry this variant in hemizygous state."},{"id":"cggv:25c18d5d-3484-4d57-90ed-235dbccf2325_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c4368a11-0541-40e6-bf29-9fc27853b225","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000729","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Rett and Fragile-X syndrome screening","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:25c18d5d-3484-4d57-90ed-235dbccf2325_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:3aed8dec-c9fe-49c4-afd3-77eaab07ec01","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003179.3(SYP):c.251C>G (p.Ala84Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10409806"}},{"id":"cggv:389c54fe-4b81-48ca-9f5c-0a888aecc066","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031206.7(LAS1L):c.1848_1856del (p.Glu616_Thr619delinsAsp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139655006"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32193494","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder with an unclear aetiology and an estimated global prevalence of 1%.

In addition, we identified six genes that have not been previously reported in any autism database: CHM, ENPP1, IGF1, LAS1L, SYP and TBX22.

Four variants were identified in families with two or more males with intellectual disability, including  2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 1 missense variants. Two of these variants segregated with the phenotype in males from large multigenerational pedigrees. The phenotype description was limited; in the three families with truncating variants, intellectual disability was mild to moderate and there were no consistent additional features, although epilepsy was noted in some individuals. Subsequent functional studies showed that the 4 variants failed to rescue the synaptic vesicle transport deficits in cultured neurons derived from Syp KO mice (PMID: 23966691). Two other missense variants have been reported in humans since then (Philips et al., PMID: 24721225 and Harper et al., PMID: 28887151), but both were later found to have high population frequencies in gnomAD. According to gnomAD (v.2.1.1), SYP is constrained for loss of function variants (pLI = 0.92) but not missense variants (Z score = 1.33). The mechanism for disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is further supported by gene expression studies and functional studies in hippocampal cultures of Syp knockout mice (1.5 points). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the association between SYP and non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. Given that no other families with pathogenic SYP variants have been identified since the original report by Tarpey et al. in 2009, additional genetic evidence is necessary to strengthen this gene-disease relationship.
