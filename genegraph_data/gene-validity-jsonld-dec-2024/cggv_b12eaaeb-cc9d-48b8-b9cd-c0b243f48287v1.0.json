Most affected individuals are simplex cases, but both autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive inheritance have been described. We performed genetic linkage analysis in consanguineous families affected by hypogammaglobulinemia. Four consanguineous families with childhood-onset humoral immune deficiency and features of autoimmunity shared genotype evidence for a linkage interval on chromosome 4q. Sequencing of positional candidate genes revealed that in each family, affected individuals had a distinct homozygous mutation in LRBA (lipopolysaccharide responsive beige-like anchor protein). All LRBA mutations segregated with the disease because homozygous individuals showed hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmunity, whereas heterozygous individuals were healthy. These mutations were absent in healthy controls. Individuals with homozygous LRBA mutations had no LRBA, had disturbed B cell development, defective in vitro B cell activation, plasmablast formation, and immunoglobulin secretion, and had low proliferative responses. We conclude that mutations in LRBA cause an immune deficiency characterized by defects in B cell activation and autophagy and by susceptibility to apoptosis, all of which are associated with a clinical phenotype of hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmunity.","dc:creator":"Lopez-Herrera G","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Deleterious mutations in LRBA are associated with a syndrome of immune deficiency and autoimmunity."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b12eaaeb-cc9d-48b8-b9cd-c0b243f48287_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b12eaaeb-cc9d-48b8-b9cd-c0b243f48287_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:10318de3-c23f-425a-977c-a2bf780f5096_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:10318de3-c23f-425a-977c-a2bf780f5096","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:fa34b803-5f83-4b0e-b711-b90979b8c7ef","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001364905.1(LRBA):c.2032C>T (p.Gln678Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA175134"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"protracted diarrhea following his first childhood vaccination, autoimmune enteropathy,  positive insulin antibodies and hypothyroidism with positive thyroid antibodies, recurrent episodes of sepsis including Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia and Streptococcus pneumoniae-related septic shock.

LRBA deficiency is also referred to as LATAIE disease (LRBA deficiency with autoantibodies, Treg defects, autoimmune infiltration, enteropathy) (PMID: 27418640).\nThis disease, in contrast with its counterpart, CTLA4 haploinsufficiency (CHAI syndrome) is nearly completely penetrant though shows substantial variable expressivity (PMID: 34384744). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be biallelic loss of function leading to variable phenotypes of severe immune dysregulation due to loss of immune checkpoint function, organomegaly, and recurrent infections (PMID: 26768763).\n\nEvidence from 5 probands in 4 publications were included in this curation (PMID: 22608502, PMID: 22721650, PMID: 25468195 and PMID: 32154999) representing 6 (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) variants. A case report of uniparental isodisomy is included as an unscored evidence with a severe lethal phenotype (PMID: 30386343). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nExperimental evidence also supports this gene disease association.  LRBA-deficient patients show disturbed B cell function with production of low levels of IgG and reduced ability to induce autophagy in response to starvation compared to control cells (PMID: 22608502). Impaired function of regulatory T cells (Tregs/TR) cells is evident by a markedly reduced number of\nCD4+FOXP3+ TR cells and decreased suppression of T cell proliferation in LRBA-deficient patients (PMID: 25468195).\nLRBA is detected to colocalize with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (a known inhibitor of immune\nresponses by negative signaling) in endosomal vesicles and LRBA deficiency or knockdown resulted in increased CTLA4 turnover (PMID: 26206937). \n\nIn patients, assessment of CTLA4 transendocytosis is helpful in making the diagnosis (PMID: 28159733) in conjunction with assessment LRBA protein expression by flow cytometry (PMID: 29740429), which is not always helpful as an independent diagnostic assay. The relevance of LRBA chaperone function in maintaining CTLA4 expression in Tregs is evident from the response to exogenous CTLA4 therapy (abatacept) in patients with both LRBA deficiency and CTLA4 haploinsufficiency (PMID: 26206937 and PMID: 31238161).\n\nMurine Lrba knockout model showed decreased CTLA-4 expression by regulatory T cells and activated conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. It was able, nonetheless, to produce normal serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG with no evidence of clinical or immunological signs of disease (PMID: 28652580). While more experimental evidence is needed to understand the redundant gene function in the mouse model, other experimental evidence (expression, protein interaction, and disturbed immune cells' functions in LRBA-deficient patients) supported the genetic case-level evidence and provided the required score for a definitive classification.\n\nIn summary, the evidence to support the relationship of LRBA deficiency due to *LRBA* gene variants and CVID-like phenotype is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been held up overtime. \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Deficiency GCEP on May 5th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b12eaaeb-cc9d-48b8-b9cd-c0b243f48287"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
