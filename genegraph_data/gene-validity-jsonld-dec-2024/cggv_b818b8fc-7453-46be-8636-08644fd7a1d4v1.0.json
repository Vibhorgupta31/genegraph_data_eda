MUTYH mutations predispose to recessively inherited colorectal polyposis and cancer. Here, we evaluate an association with breast cancer (BC), following up our previous finding of an elevated BC frequency among Dutch bi-allelic MUTYH mutation carriers. A case–control study was performed comparing 1,469 incident BC patients (ORIGO cohort), 471 individuals displaying features suggesting a genetic predisposition for BC, but without a detectable BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (BRCAx cohort), and 1,666 controls. First, for 303 consecutive patients diagnosed before age 55 years and/or with multiple primary breast tumors, the MUTYH coding region and flanking introns were sequenced. The remaining subjects were genotyped for five coding variants, p.Tyr179Cys, p.Arg309Cys, p.Gly396Asp, p.Pro405Leu, and p.Ser515Phe, and four tagging SNPs, c.37-2487G>T, p.Val22Met, c.504+35G>A, and p.Gln338His. No bi-allelic pathogenic MUTYH mutations were identified. The pathogenic variant p.Gly396Asp and the variant of uncertain significance p.Arg309Cys occurred twice as frequently in BRCAx subjects as compared to incident BC patients and controls (p=0.13 and p=0.15, respectively). The likely benign variant p.Val22Met occurred less frequently in patients from the incident BC (p=0.03) and BRCAx groups (p=0.11), respectively, as compared to the controls. Minor allele genotypes of several MUTYH variants showed trends towards association with lobular BC histology. This extensive case–control study could not confirm previously reported associations of MUTYH variants with BC, although it was too small to exclude subtle effects on BC susceptibility.","dc:creator":"Out AA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"MUTYH gene variants and breast cancer in a Dutch case–control study."},"rdfs:label":"Out et al.

Biallelic and monoallelic variants in *MUTYH* were linked to multiple types of cancer and/or tumor, including hereditary breast cancer, familial ovarian cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split these associations into different curations due to phenotypic differences and/or inheritance mechanism. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer and given the frequency of variants and the cancer phenotype the curation focuses on case-control studies. \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point** \nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 4 case-control studies at the aggregate or single variant level. In 2021, a large case-control study [BCAC, with more than 48 thousand cases and controls (PMID: 33471991)] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *MUTYH* and autosomal dominant breast cancer. Likewise, another large case-control study published in 2022 did not find significant association with autosomal dominant breast cancer (PMID: 34981295). In addition, PMIDs: 22297469, 27466510 showed no significant association of monoallelic *MUTYH* variants with breast cancer although with a small population.\n \n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *MUTYH* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as no known disease relationship by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 05/25/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 06/23/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MUTYH and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b818b8fc-7453-46be-8636-08644fd7a1d4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
