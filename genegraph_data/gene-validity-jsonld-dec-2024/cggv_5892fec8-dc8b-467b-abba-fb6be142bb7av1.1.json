Whole-exome sequencing (WES) led to a rapid expansion of diagnostic capabilities in such disorders and facilitated a better understanding of disease pathogenesis, although functional characterization remains a bottleneck to the interpretation of potential pathological variants. We report a 2-year-old boy of Afro-Caribbean ancestry, who presented with neuromuscular symptoms without significant abnormalities on routine diagnostic evaluation. WES revealed compound heterozygous missense variants of uncertain significance in mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2), which encodes the TCA enzyme ACO2. Pathogenic variants in ACO2 have been described in a handful of families as the cause of infantile cerebellar-retinal degeneration syndrome. Using biochemical and cellular assays in patient fibroblasts, we found that ACO2 expression was quantitatively normal, but ACO2 enzyme activity was <20% of that observed in control cells. We also observed a deficiency in cellular respiration and, for the first time, demonstrate evidence of mitochondrial DNA depletion and altered expression of some TCA components and electron transport chain subunits. The observed cellular defects were completely restored with ACO2 gene rescue. Our findings demonstrate the pathogenicity of two VUS in ACO2, provide novel mechanistic insights to TCA disturbances in ACO2 deficiency, and implicate mitochondrial DNA depletion in the pathogenesis of this recently described disorder.","dc:creator":"Sadat R","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Functional cellular analyses reveal energy metabolism defect and mitochondrial DNA depletion in a case of mitochondrial aconitase deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of Aconitase Deficiency in Patient Cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"1 point for deficiencies and 1 point for rescue with WT ACO2"},{"id":"cggv:f908b276-1a6f-4bb7-93ec-cd82ad3d2ea5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:381ab6ba-690d-4792-87fb-bc24e463519b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"motor deficiencies, metabolic abnormalities, and shortened lifespan in flies similar to what has been reported in patients","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23438437","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Aconitase catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and its deficiency in humans is associated with an infantile neurodegenerative disorder affecting mainly the cerebellum and retina.

Acon-knockout flies were homozygous lethal, indicating that Acon is essential for viability. RNA interference-generated Acon-knockdown flies exhibited a variety of phenotypes, such as reduced locomotor activity, a shortened lifespan, and increased cell death in the developing brain. Metabolomic analysis revealed that acetyl-CoA, citrate/isocitrate, and cis-aconitate were significantly increased, while most metabolites of glycolysis and the TCA cycle were reduced. Reduced triacylglyceride and increased acetyl-CoA suggested that lipids were used as an energy source because of the impaired glycolysis and TCA cycle.

A homozygous pathogenic variant in the ACO2 gene was initially described in 2012 resulting in a novel disorder termed \"infantile cerebellar retinal degeneration\" (ICRD, OMIM#614559). Subsequently, additional studies reported patients with pathogenic ACO2 variants, further expanding the genetic and clinical spectrum of this disorder to include milder and later onset manifestations. Here, we report an international multicenter cohort of 16 patients (of whom 7 are newly diagnosed) with biallelic pathogenic variants in ACO2 gene. Most patients present in early infancy with severe truncal hypotonia, truncal ataxia, variable seizures, evolving microcephaly, and ophthalmological abnormalities of which the most dominant are esotropia and optic atrophy with later development of retinal dystrophy. Most patients remain nonambulatory and do no acquire any language, but a subgroup of patients share a more favorable course. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically normal within the first months but global atrophy gradually develops affecting predominantly the cerebellum.

We studied eight individuals from two unrelated families who presented at 2-6 months of age with truncal hypotonia and athetosis, seizure disorder, and ophthalmologic abnormalities. Their course was characterized by failure to acquire developmental milestones and culminated in profound psychomotor retardation and progressive visual loss, including optic nerve and retinal atrophy. Despite their debilitating state, the disease was compatible with survival of up to 18 years. Laboratory investigations were normal, but the oxidation of glutamate by muscle mitochondria was slightly reduced. Serial brain MRI displayed progressive, prominent cerebellar atrophy accompanied by thinning of the corpus callosum, dysmyelination, and frontal and temporal cortical atrophy. Homozygosity mapping followed by whole-exome sequencing disclosed a Ser112Arg mutation in ACO2, encoding mitochondrial aconitase, a component of the Krebs cycle. Specific aconitase activity in the individuals' lymphoblasts was severely reduced. Under restrictive conditions, the mutant human ACO2 failed to complement a yeast ACO1 deletion strain, whereas the wild-type human ACO2 succeeded, indicating that this mutation is pathogenic. Thus, a defect in mitochondrial aconitase is associated with an infantile neurodegenerative disorder affecting mainly the cerebellum and retina. In the absence of noninvasive biomarkers, determination of the ACO2 sequence or of aconitase activity in lymphoblasts are warranted in similarly affected individuals, based on clinical and neuroradiologic grounds.","dc:creator":"Spiegel R","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Infantile cerebellar-retinal degeneration associated with a mutation in mitochondrial aconitase, ACO2."}},"rdfs:label":"Spiegel et al 2012, Family B III-2"},{"id":"cggv:7ec1fe63-751b-4136-85b5-4427075c0fa0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ec1fe63-751b-4136-85b5-4427075c0fa0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7ec1fe63-751b-4136-85b5-4427075c0fa0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Founder variant scored in Family A - score 0.5 points per variant"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Founder variant scored in Family A (patient with similar phenotype) - score 0.5 points per variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:47c8964c-626c-4705-8265-801b3df1b9ef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47c8964c-626c-4705-8265-801b3df1b9ef","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:b002eee8-cd82-49bc-a087-0c8e5421381a"},"detectionMethod":"ACO2: c.336C>G; p.

This phenotype has been described as “infantile cerebellar-retinal degeneration” and is consistent with a primary mitochondrial disease phenotype. Subsequent cases have shown similar phenotypes ranging in age of onset and including cerebellar disease with or without optic atrophy, retinal disease, and epilepsy, as well as a cerebellar disease with spastic paraplegia. As per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these phenotypes were consistent with primary mitochondrial disease as agreed upon by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 11 unique missense variants, two nonsense variants, and three frameshift or splicing variants from 11 probands across six publications. Affected individuals presented with a similar cerebellar phenotype often with seizures and retinal dystrophy or optic atrophy (PMIDs: 22405087, 25351951, 30689204, 31106992). More cases are reported, but case evidence maximum was reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by functional alteration and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 26992325, 29564393, 29577077) as well as a Drosophila melanogaster RNAi knockdown model of Acon, an *ACO2* ortholog (PMID: 23438437). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ACO2* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 19, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5892fec8-dc8b-467b-abba-fb6be142bb7a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
