Although riboflavin is an essential nutrient, why mutations in its transporters result in a neural cell-specific disorder remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Slc52a3 is the mouse ortholog of SLC52A3 and show that Slc52a3 deficiency results in early embryonic lethality. Loss of mutant embryos was associated with both defects in placental formation and increased rates of apoptosis in embryonic cells. In contrast, Slc52a3 -/- embryonic stem cell lines could be readily established and differentiated into motor neurons, suggesting that this transporter is dispensable for neural differentiation and short-term maintenance. Consistent with this finding, examination of Slc52a3 gene products in adult tissues revealed expression in the testis and intestine but little or none in the brain and spinal cord.

Loss-of-function mutations in two riboflavin transporter genes, SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, have recently been linked to Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. However, the genetic frequency, neuropathology and downstream consequences of riboflavin transporter mutations are unclear. By screening a large cohort of 132 patients with early-onset severe sensory, motor and cranial nerve neuropathy we confirmed the strong genetic link between riboflavin transporter mutations and Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, identifying 22 pathogenic mutations in SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, 14 of which were novel. Brain and spinal cord neuropathological examination of two cases with SLC52A3 mutations showed classical symmetrical brainstem lesions resembling pathology seen in mitochondrial disease, including severe neuronal loss in the lower cranial nerve nuclei, anterior horns and corresponding nerves, atrophy of the spinothalamic and spinocerebellar tracts and posterior column-medial lemniscus pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction has previously been implicated in an array of neurodegenerative disorders. Since riboflavin metabolites are critical components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, we hypothesized that reduced riboflavin transport would result in impaired mitochondrial activity, and confirmed this using in vitro and in vivo models. Electron transport chain complex I and complex II activity were decreased in SLC52A2 patient fibroblasts, while global knockdown of the single Drosophila melanogaster riboflavin transporter homologue revealed reduced levels of riboflavin, downstream metabolites, and electron transport chain complex I activity. This in turn led to abnormal mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory chain activity and morphology. Riboflavin transporter knockdown in Drosophila also resulted in severely impaired locomotor activity and reduced lifespan, mirroring patient pathology, and these phenotypes could be partially rescued using a novel esterified derivative of riboflavin. Our findings expand the genetic, clinical and neuropathological features of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, implicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a downstream consequence of riboflavin transporter gene defects, and validate riboflavin esters as a potential therapeutic strategy.","dc:creator":"Manole A","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Clinical, pathological and functional characterization of riboflavin-responsive neuropathy."},"rdfs:label":"Drosophila \"drift\"  model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded for fly homolog of gene, but didn't do a complete downgrade because of the rescue of the phenotypes with riboflavin supplementation."},{"id":"cggv:86c2979d-bfde-449a-bdcd-9a2d35acbabd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:437c631a-b3c7-43e6-8ea1-75efc957252b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This study demonstrated the embryonic lethality of the SLC52A3 mouse model.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26976849","rdfs:label":"SLC52A3 -/- mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Already upgraded the Yoshimatsu mouse model by 0.5 points for replication in this paper."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5},{"id":"cggv:b0ae82e2-4c39-45b2-ba2d-6fe2570dbcfc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b0ae82e2-4c39-45b2-ba2d-6fe2570dbcfc_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:31876980-c9db-4bf3-a0e4-37477ee4199a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31876980-c9db-4bf3-a0e4-37477ee4199a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:322694e5-94ae-40a8-919d-1088a8d292ea","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033409.4(SLC52A3):c.49T>C (p.Trp17Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/210011"}},{"id":"cggv:8fa3a53f-e9ef-4cef-8d59-a84ff1f26f72","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033409.4(SLC52A3):c.639C>G (p.Tyr213Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/210018"}}],"detectionMethod":"PCR\n\nSequencing of the ETFDH, ETFA, ETFB genes and SLC52A3\u000b\n","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Clinical diagnosis of Brown-Violetto-Van Laere syndrome, feeding problems, slow motor development, onset of 5 months for generalized muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, severe sensorineural hearing loss, palsies of the 7th and 12th cranial nerves","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:9b90b72b-8181-447c-9b44-f0472d01782d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:322694e5-94ae-40a8-919d-1088a8d292ea"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21110228","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report on three patients (two siblings and one unrelated) presenting in infancy with progressive muscle weakness and paralysis of the diaphragm.

Riboflavin supplementation seems to stabilize and improve progression of the disease.","dc:creator":"Ciccolella M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Brown-Vialetto-van Laere and Fazio-Londe overlap syndromes: a clinical, biochemical and genetic study."}},{"id":"cggv:6212b14b-89da-408f-a502-ea0e9d2691fe_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a439e884-3ddb-4e90-a95d-54985432570a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22824638"}],"rdfs:label":"Ciccolella Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:6212b14b-89da-408f-a502-ea0e9d2691fe","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6212b14b-89da-408f-a502-ea0e9d2691fe_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:3ae575de-65ec-43e5-be80-687f818d7a5d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ae575de-65ec-43e5-be80-687f818d7a5d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3206beac-581e-4e31-bead-559f23d5a2b8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3206beac-581e-4e31-bead-559f23d5a2b8","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c9946e9f-954a-426c-9000-a0c651a2a63c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033409.4(SLC52A3):c.1325_1326del (p.Leu442ArgfsTer64)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/139"}},"detectionMethod":"The methodology used here to locate the causative\ngene: autozygosity mapping\ntogether with targeted sequencing in identifying genes in\nrare recessive disorders for which consanguineous families\nare available.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Case 1: Recurrent chest infections since age 4 mo, sub acute encephalopathy, respiratory compromise at age 17 mo, diagnosed with deafness at age 13 mo, Hypotonia, cerebellar signs, brisk reflexes in the lower limbs, persistent ankle clonus, stridor, EMG: bulbar palsy, anterior horn involvement; phrenic nerve denervation, auditory neuropathy","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002395","obo:HP_0001317","obo:HP_0002783","obo:HP_0008947","obo:HP_0000399","obo:HP_0010307","obo:HP_0011448","obo:HP_0001283"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:27ac6adc-23d2-4901-b141-8bf0fd8023db_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c9946e9f-954a-426c-9000-a0c651a2a63c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20206331","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome is a rare neurological disorder with a variable age at onset and clinical course.

relationship between SLC52A3 and autosomal recessive Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVL) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 9/12/2018. Variants in SLC52A3 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2010 (Green et al., PMID 20206331). SLC52A3 is associated with the childhood onset neurodegenerative syndrome Brownâ€“Vialettoâ€“Van Laere (BVVL) which is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ponto-bulbar palsy (PMID: 26976849, 30420458). Whilst these are the most common clinical features, BVVL can also present without either symptom (PMID: 26973221). The standard treatment for BVVL is riboflavin supplementation which is associated with favourable clinical outcomes (PMID: 26973221). At least 25 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, case-control data, segregation data, and mouse models, a drosophila model, biochemical function studies implicating the gene's role in riboflavin uptake, and functional alteration studies showing that alteration to the gene impairs riboflavin uptake which appears to be the mechanism for disease. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 22 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 29053833, 25462087, 21110228, 20206331, 22824638). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. In summary, SLC52A3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 9/18/2018. It was reevaluated on 6/21/2023 in collaboration with the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spectrum Disorders GCEP. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. However, scoring was adjusted to the current Gene Clinical Validity SOP Version 9. It is also worth highlighting that in the mouse and drosophila models (PMID: 27272163, 29053833) riboflavin supplementation was able to restore normal function and replicates the rescue of the phenotypes observed in humans with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (PMID: 30420458).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b0ae82e2-4c39-45b2-ba2d-6fe2570dbcfc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
