The patient was a newborn and the CFC diagnosis was based on prenatal findings of cystic hygroma, congenital heart defect and increased nuchal translucency combined with newborn phenotyping. The study admits that the diagnosis for a specific Noonan spectrum disorder may be inaccurate, as facial anomalies change with time. The p.S257L variant has also been identified in cases with RAF1-Noonan syndrome (NS). Therefore, this association is classified as Disputed. Of note, RAF1 is also classified as Definitive in association with Noonan syndrome (NS), Limited in association with NS with multiple lentigines, and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating RAF1 with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 5/31/18 (SOP Version 5).\nThe only known case does not have detailed/convincing phenotyping.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b1e7c802-14d7-435c-b396-637b728a3ae2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
