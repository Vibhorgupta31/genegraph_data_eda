Several pathways governed by the primary cilium, a sensory antenna present on most vertebrate cells, have been linked with fibrosis. Ciliopathies usually start early in life and represent a considerable disease burden. We performed massively parallel sequencing by using cohorts of genetically unsolved individuals with unexplained liver and kidney failure and correlated this with clinical, imaging, and histopathological analyses. Mechanistic studies were conducted with a vertebrate model and primary cells. We detected bi-allelic deleterious variants in TULP3, encoding a critical adaptor protein for ciliary trafficking, in a total of 15 mostly adult individuals, originating from eight unrelated families, with progressive degenerative liver fibrosis, fibrocystic kidney disease, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with atypical fibrotic patterns on histopathology. We recapitulated the human phenotype in adult zebrafish and confirmed disruption of critical ciliary cargo composition in several primary cell lines derived from affected individuals. Further, we show interaction between TULP3 and the nuclear deacetylase SIRT1, with roles in DNA damage repair and fibrosis, and report increased DNA damage ex vivo. Transcriptomic studies demonstrated upregulation of profibrotic pathways with gene clusters for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and WNT and TGF-β signaling. These findings identify variants in TULP3 as a monogenic cause for progressive degenerative disease of major organs in which affected individuals benefit from early detection and improved clinical management. Elucidation of mechanisms crucial for DNA damage repair and tissue maintenance will guide novel therapeutic avenues for this and similar genetic and non-genomic diseases.","dc:creator":"Devane J","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Progressive liver, kidney, and heart degeneration in children and adults affected by TULP3 mutations."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f45b6a3-7f38-436f-bfde-beac067fdb88_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f45b6a3-7f38-436f-bfde-beac067fdb88_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e2918322-2e1b-440c-b590-81de5aba08a3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb739a0d-c6b3-4f8c-a774-b10453c283cb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Tulp3 is expressed in the embryonic and early postnatal kidney by qRT-PCR (Figure S1)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30799239","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Polycystic kidney disease proteins, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, localize to primary cilia. Polycystin knockouts have severe cystogenesis compared to ciliary disruption, whereas simultaneous ciliary loss suppresses excessive cyst growth. These data suggest the presence of a cystogenic activator that is inhibited by polycystins and an independent but relatively minor cystogenic inhibitor, either of which are cilia dependent. However, current genetic models targeting cilia completely ablate the compartment, making it difficult to uncouple cystoprotein function from ciliary localization. Thus, the role of cilium-generated signaling in cystogenesis is unclear. We recently demonstrated that the tubby family protein Tulp3 determines ciliary trafficking of polycystins in kidney collecting duct cells without affecting protein levels or cilia. Here, we demonstrate that embryonic-stage, nephron-specific Tulp3 knockout mice developed cystic kidneys, while retaining intact cilia. Cystic kidneys showed increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mTOR, and persistently high cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling, suggesting contribution of multiple factors to cystogenesis. Based on kidney-to-body-weight ratio, cystic index, and epithelial proliferation in developing tubules or cysts, the severity of cystogenesis upon Tulp3 deletion was intermediate between that caused by loss of polycystin-1 or cilia. However, concomitant Tulp3 loss did not inhibit cystogenesis in polycystin-1 knockouts, unlike ciliary disruption. Interestingly, ciliary trafficking of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Arl13b, loss of which causes cystogenic severity similar to ciliary loss, was reduced prior to cyst initiation. Thus, we propose that cystogenesis in Tulp3 mutants results from a reduction of ciliary levels of polycystins, Arl13b, and Arl13b-dependent lipidated cargoes. Arl13b might be the ciliary factor that represses cystogenesis distinct from polycystins.","dc:creator":"Hwang SH","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Tulp3 Regulates Renal Cystogenesis by Trafficking of Cystoproteins to Cilia."},"rdfs:label":"Tulp3 is expressed in the embryonic and postnatal kidney"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b360a0f7-13d2-491f-a36c-b108c7094e8b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:83e788fa-1b05-4b58-a1e7-045b43147c62","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Figure 3, Tulp3 expressions on zebrafish embryos, KO zebrafish embryos, adult zebrafish","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35397207","rdfs:label":"Devane, zebrafish expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5db35fbe-2a59-4909-8f2c-54ba83e49dbc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5adbf58-7542-4c90-ba10-43cc2c0994a1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Northern Blot & RNA analysis","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9828123","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Tubby and related proteins are derived from a small family of novel genes.

Phylogenetically, TULP3 is the family member most closely related to TUB. Also, like TUB, it has a wider pattern of tissue expression than either TULP1 or TULP2. TULP3 is detected at high levels in human RNA from testis, ovaries, thyroid, and spinal chord. Tulp3 is also highly expressed in mouse RNA from eyes and adipose depots, tissues not tested in the human Northern analysis. We also report that TULP3 maps to human chromosome 12p13.

One of the most common human genetic diseases is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is caused by mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes that encode Polycystin 1 and 2 (PC1/2), transmembrane proteins that translocate to the cilium. Mutations in genes that disrupt ciliogenesis also cause kidney cysts as part of a \"ciliopathic\" disease spectrum. The molecular mechanisms that link cilia function with renal cystic diseases are not well understood, and the mechanistic relationship between ADPKD and ciliopathic PKD is not known. Here we identify the gene Tubby-like protein-3 (Tulp3) as a key regulator of renal cystic disease from a forward genetic screen in the mouse. Mice homozygous for a hypomorphic missense mutation within the conserved Tubby domain of Tulp3 develop cysts at late embryonic stages, leading to severe postnatal loss of kidney function. In contrast to other ciliopathic disease models, Tulp3 mutations do not affect ciliogenesis. Instead, we demonstrate that Tulp3 is essential for the trafficking of the Joubert syndrome-associated small GTPase Arl13b into kidney cilia. We show that reduction of Pkd1 dosage promotes cystogenesis in the Tulp3 conditional ciliopathic PKD model. However, in an adult model of ADPKD utilizing inducible conditional Pkd1 deletion, concomitant removal of Tulp3 surprisingly ameliorates cystic disease. Therefore, Tulp3 controls distinct ciliary pathways that positively or negatively regulate cystogenesis depending on the cellular context.","dc:creator":"Legué E","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Tulp3 Is a Ciliary Trafficking Gene that Regulates Polycystic Kidney Disease."},"rdfs:label":"Tulp3 K407I mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:35ac5c83-1b1f-4246-85ab-45fedd6fe171","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a3f4e94-4bf9-41e6-b1be-dea2f623234a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Cystic kidney disease","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30799239","rdfs:label":"Tulp3 cko models had extensive cysts "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:be5123b5-af67-4749-aefc-2842fd5cce7e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d973ace-f448-4366-9b9b-4feb73dbf3df","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Individuals with disease have cystic kidney disease and liver disease like the model.

At least eight variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, intragenic deletion, splice site) that have been reported in eight probands and additional family members in a publication (PMID: 35397207) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three additional family members. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation data, and experimental data. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be lodd of function (LOF). Animal models, with data from mice (Legue et al., 2019; PMID: 30799240 and Hwang et al., 2019; PMID: 30799239) and zebrafish models (Devane et al., 2022; PMID: 35397207), and expression studies also support this gene-disease relationship (PMIDs: 35397207, 30799240, 30799239, 9828123). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between *TULP3* and autosomal recessive ciliopathy. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the relationship to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 07/27/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6f45b6a3-7f38-436f-bfde-beac067fdb88"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
