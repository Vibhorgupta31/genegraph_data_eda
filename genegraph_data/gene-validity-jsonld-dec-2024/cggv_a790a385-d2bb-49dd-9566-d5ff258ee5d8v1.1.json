Assertions have been made for a relationship between *KCNQ2* and several neurodevelopmental presentations. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have found differences in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability between these assertions. Therefore, the curation has been split into multiple autosomal dominant disease entities: neonatal-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (MONDO:0100455; thought to be dominant negative), self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy (MONDO:0100023; thought to be loss of function), complex neurodevelopmental disorder (MONDO:0100038; thought to be gain of function, attributed primarily to p.R230C/H/S, p.R198Q, and p.R144Q/W/G recurrent de novo variants), and neonatal encephalopathy with non-epileptic myoclonus (MONDO:0100456; thought to be gain of function, attributed to p.R201C, p.R201H, and p.V175L recurrent de novo variants). The split curations have been curated separately by the Epilepsy GCEP and this entry will only cover autosomal dominant neonatal encephalopathy with nonepileptic myoclonus (MONDO:0100456).\n\nThree recurrent de novo missense variants, p.R201C, p.R201H, and p.V175L, reported in 12 probands in three publications, are included in this curation (PMIDs: 28139826, 23692823, 25092550). Patients often present with exaggerated startle responses and/or myoclonus within the first days or weeks or life, along with encephalopathy and hypotonia from birth (PMID: 28139826). Patients also commonly have respiratory insufficiency, central hypoventilation, a persistent suppression burst pattern of EEG background, and recurrent bouts of myoclonus that are not accompanied by epileptic discharges on electroencephalography (PMID: 28139826). Evolution to pharmacoresistant seizures is common, as is continued profound global developmental delay. The mechanism of pathogenicity is thought to be gain of function (PMIDs: 25740509, 27030113). In summary, there is a definitive relationship between *KCNQ2* and autosomal dominant neonatal encephalopathy with nonepileptic myoclonus. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 15, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a790a385-d2bb-49dd-9566-d5ff258ee5d8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
