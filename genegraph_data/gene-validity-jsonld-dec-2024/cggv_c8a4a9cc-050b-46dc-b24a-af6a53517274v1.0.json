We aim to identify the molecular defects and investigate the clinical and mutational characteristics in an index case and other members of a consanguineous family. We identified a novel homozygous mutation in the splice site acceptor (SSA) of intron 5 (c.653-1G>A) in two siblings with different clinical outcomes of APS-1. Coding DNA sequencing revealed that this AIRE mutation potentially compromised the recognition of the constitutive SSA of intron 5, splicing upstream onto a nearby cryptic SSA in intron 5. Surprisingly, the use of an alternative SSA entails the uncovering of a cryptic donor splice site in exon 5. This new transcript generates a truncated protein (p.A214fs67X) containing the first 213 amino acids and followed by 68 aberrant amino acids. The mutation affects the proper splicing, not only at the acceptor but also at the donor splice site, highlighting the complexity of recognizing suitable splicing sites and the importance of sequencing the intron-exon junctions for a more precise molecular diagnosis and correct genetic counseling. As both siblings were carrying the same mutation but exhibited a different APS-1 onset, and one of the brothers was not clinically diagnosed, our finding highlights the possibility to suspect mutations in the AIRE gene in cases of childhood chronic candidiasis and/or hypoparathyroidism otherwise unexplained, especially when the phenotype is associated with other autoimmune diseases.","dc:creator":"Mora M","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"New splice site acceptor mutation in AIRE gene in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 1"},{"id":"cggv:85d9c8fa-315d-42f7-8efd-c6d30541578a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85d9c8fa-315d-42f7-8efd-c6d30541578a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:85d9c8fa-315d-42f7-8efd-c6d30541578a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Both in silico prediction and mRNA functional analysis showed that the c.653-1G>A mutation is pathogenic and produces a nonfunctional trucated protein."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:083f11a9-4e8c-489e-8394-3490a5f2d31e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:083f11a9-4e8c-489e-8394-3490a5f2d31e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:3047ebb4-3778-46f8-8646-9312a4742fe7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000383.4(AIRE):c.607C>T (p.Arg203Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10051639"}},{"id":"cggv:ae9a6d16-9340-4f4b-b678-4225319f8ce7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000383.4(AIRE):c.769C>T (p.Arg257Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116134"}}],"detectionMethod":"All 14 exons of the AIRE gene were PCR amplified and directly sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:1133137c-8646-4913-916f-d21d43af2705_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3047ebb4-3778-46f8-8646-9312a4742fe7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18274776","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report the clinical and immunological features of the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE) in two Sicilian brothers with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED).

pathogenic variants in the autoimmune regulator (*AIRE*) gene were first reported in association with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy -candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also known as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1(APS-1) in 1997 (Ahonen et al, PMID:2348835; Aaltonen et al, PMID:9398840). Both autosomal recessive (Wang et al, PMID:9921903; Heino et al, PMID: 9888391; Cranston et al, PMID:35521792; Bjorses et al, PMID:8808604) and autosomal dominant (Cetani et al, PMID:11600535; Oftedal et al, PMID:26084028) forms have been reported.  \n\nClassical autosomal recessive *AIRE*-related APS-1 is typically caused by homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for variants in the CARD, SAND, PHD1, and PHD2 domains/exon-2,6,8,10 of *AIRE* with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, primary adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism and other organ specific autoimmune manifestations usually seen in children aged 3-5 years (Husebye et al, PMID:19382991; Suh et al, PMID:31905445; Bjorses et al, PMID:10677297). The occasional autosomal dominant cases were caused by apparent dominant negative variants in the first plant homeodomain (PHD1) Zinc finger and SAND domain and characterized by later onset, milder phenotypes, and reduced penetrance compared to classical APS-1 (PMIDs: 116005356, 26084028). \n\nAutoimmune diabetes has been reported as a rare manifestation of APS-1 with prevalence ranging from 1-18% in various populations (reviewed in PMID: 27420045).  Thus it makes sense to consider the possibility of an *AIRE* variant when autoimmune diabetes is accompanied by other autoimmune disorders characteristic of APS-1.  \n\nAt least 100 APS-1 - causing variants (primarily frameshift or nonsense) have been identified across *AIRE* in humans. Evidence supporting the association of this gene with APS-1 includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. The aggregated score for case-level and segregation data is 12 points. Variants in this gene have been curated in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 34991662, 34991662, 24988226, 28323927,18274776), with cases presenting as APS-1. More evidence is available to support the gene-disease association in the literature, but as the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached this has not been curated exhaustively. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays (both individual and massively parallel), expression studies and functional alterations. Total points for the experimental evidence are 5.5. The total score for genetic and experimental evidence together is 17.5.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern, mutational mechanism, and penetrance between the recessive and dominant forms of APS-1.  Therefore, we  curated *AIRE* related APS-1 with autosomal recessive inheritance (OMIM: 240300) as a split curation of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (MONDO: 0009411).  Given the decreased penetrance and apparent dominant negative mutational mechanism of autosomal dominant APS-1, this entity may be curated as a split curation at a later date if more data accumulates.\n\nIn summary, *AIRE* is definitively associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1, with most cases presenting in children from birth or 3-5 years of age. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c8a4a9cc-050b-46dc-b24a-af6a53517274"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
