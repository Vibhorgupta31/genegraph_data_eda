To date, no mutations have been described among patients with cystathioninuria. From genomic DNA, we sequenced CTH in four unrelated probands with cystathioninuria. We found two nonsense mutations, namely exon 8 c.940-941delCT and exon 11 c.1220delC, and two missense mutations, namely exon 2 c.356C>T (T67I) and exon 7 c.874C>G (Q240E). All affected subjects were either simple homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. A common non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 12, namely c.1364G>T (S403I), was also identified and characterized in four ethnic groups. The reagents described in this report make the molecular diagnosis of cystathioninuria possible, allowing for studies of phenotype-genotype correlation. Also, the availability of a common non-synonymous SNP can allow for testing of association of the CTH gene with biochemical traits affected by trans-sulfuration, such as plasma concentrations of homocysteine or even cystathionine itself, in addition to more downstream clinical phenotypes, such as vascular disease.","dc:creator":"Wang J","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Genomic basis of cystathioninuria (MIM 219500) revealed by multiple mutations in cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH)."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12574942","rdfs:label":"CaseGM01566"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Although variants were confirmed in trans and the deletion on one allele likely leads to a truncated protein, along with the variant evidence for the missense variant (this variant showed a marked decrease in activity, at ~0.2 mU/mg protein compared to ~1.65 for the wild-type), the lack of phenotypic evidence reduces the score."},{"id":"cggv:b824edcc-4c82-47a6-b9b2-e43d575509c7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9676568c-c139-4034-8e58-27cf9e12bd5f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"All twelve exons of the CTH gene and the intronic flanking sequences of the subjects and their parents was PCR amplified and directly sequenced.

To date, mutations in this gene have been described in 10 unrelated cystathioninuric patients. Enzyme assays have showed that mutated cystathionase exhibits lower activity than controls. As cystathioninuria is usually accompanied by a wide variety of symptoms, it has been questioned whether it is a disease or just a biochemical finding not associated with the clinical picture of these patients. This is the first report of Spanish patients with cystathioninuria and mild to severe neurological symptoms in childhood. After oral pyridoxine therapy biochemical parameters have normalized but clinical amelioration was not evident. All patients were homozygotes for the c.200C>T (p.T67I) variant which is the most prevalent inactivating mutation in the CTH gene. To further investigate the history of the alleles carrying the c.200C>T transition in Europe, we also constructed the haplotypes on the CTH locus in our Spanish patients as well as in a clinical series of cystathioninuric patients from the Czech Republic harboring the same nucleotide change. We suggest that the CTH p.T67I substitution could have an ancient common origin, which probably occurred in the Neolithic Era and spread throughout Europe.","dc:creator":"Espinós C","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Ancient origin of the CTH alelle carrying the c.200C>T (p.T67I) variant in patients with cystathioninuria."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20584029","rdfs:label":"765"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"There is sufficient variant evidence and phenotypic evidence and the parentage was confirmed for this proband.

Studies of CTH, the gene that encodes cystathionine gamma-lyase, revealed the presence among these individuals of either homozygous or compound heterozygous forms of a novel large deletion, p.Gly57_Gln196del, two novel missense mutations, c.589C>T (p.Arg197Cys) and c.932C>T (p.Thr311Ile), and one previously reported alteration, c.200C>T (p.Thr67Ile). Another novel missense mutation, c.185G>T (p.Arg62His), was found in heterozygous form in three mildly hypercystathioninemic members of a Taiwanese family. In one severely hypercystathioninemic individual no CTH mutation was found. Brief clinical histories of the cystathioninemic/cystathioninuric patients are presented. Most of the novel mutations were expressed and the CTH activities of the mutant proteins determined. The crystal structure of the human enzyme, hCTH, and the evidence available as to the effects of the mutations in question, as well as those of the previously reported p.Gln240Glu, on protein structure, enzymatic activity, and responsiveness to vitamin B(6) administration are discussed. Among healthy Czech controls, 9.3% were homozygous for CTH c.1208G>T (p.Ser403Ile), previously found homozygously in 7.5% of Canadians for whom plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) had been measured. Compared to wild-type homozygotes, among the 55 Czech c.1208G>T (p.Ser403Ile) homozygotes a greater level of plasma cystathionine was found only after methionine loading. Three of the four individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for inactivating CTH mutations had mild plasma tHcy elevations, perhaps indicating a cause-and-effect relationship.

The catabolism of the methyl group and sulfur atom of Met ultimately appears to be dependent upon the transmethylation-transsulfuration pathway because the MTA formed as the co-product of polyamine synthesis is efficiently recycled to Met. On the other hand, the fate of the four-carbon chain of Met appears to depend upon the initial fate of the Met molecule. During transsulfuration, the carbon chain is released as alpha-ketobutyrate, which is further metabolized to CO2. In the polyamine pathway, the carboxyl carbon of Met is lost in the formation of dAdoMet, whereas the other three carbons are ultimately excreted as polyamine derivatives and degradation products. The role of the transamination pathway of Met metabolism is not firmly established. Cys (which may be formed from the sulfur of Met and the carbons of serine via the transsulfuration pathway) appears to be converted to taurine and CO2 primarily by the cysteinesulfinate pathway, and to sulfate and pyruvate primarily by desulfuration pathways in which a reduced form of sulfur with a relatively long biological half-life appears to be an intermediate. With the exception of the nitrogen of Met that is incorporated into polyamines, the nitrogen of Met or Cys is incorporated into urea after it is released as ammonium [in the reactions catalyzed by cystathionase with either cystathionine (from Met) or cystine (from Cys) as substrate] or it is transferred to a keto acid (in Cys or Met transamination). Many areas of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism need further study. The magnitude of AdoMet flux through the polyamine pathway in the intact animal as well as details about the reactions involved in this pathway remain to be determined. Both the pathways and the possible physiological role of alternate (AdoMet-independent) Met metabolism, including the transamination pathway, must be elucidated. Despite the growing interest in taurine, investigation of Cys metabolism has been a relatively inactive area during the past two decades. Apparent discrepancies in the reported data on Cys metabolism need to be resolved. Future work should consider the role of extrahepatic tissues in amino acid metabolism as well as species differences in the relative roles of various pathways in the metabolism of Met and Cys.","dc:creator":"Stipanuk MH","dc:date":"1986","dc:title":"Metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids."},"rdfs:label":"Cystathionine γ-lyase Role in Met Metabolism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2f5047f7-80ba-4b8f-8009-59d7130e63be_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:425c2046-9259-46ca-b60b-0266d2add03f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72b3fdd3-aa6f-4b55-9ab3-c0f1a3b0ebdc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This mouse model shows the clear similarities between the CTH -/- mice, both on the low cysteine diet and on a normal diet, and the human cystathioninuria phenotypes that it attempts to display.

Here, we generated CTH-deficient (Cth(-/-)) mice as an animal model of cystathioninemia/cystathioninuria. Cth(-/-) mice developed normally in general but displayed hypercystathioninemia/hyperhomocysteinemia though not hypermethioninemia. When fed a low cyst(e)ine diet, Cth(-/-) mice showed acute skeletal muscle atrophy (myopathy) accompanied by enhanced gene expression of asparagine synthetase and reduced contents of glutathione in livers and skeletal muscles, and intracellular accumulation of LC3 and p62 in skeletal myofibers; they finally died of severe paralysis of the extremities. Cth(-/-) hepatocytes required cystine in a culture medium and showed greater sensitivity to oxidative stress. Cth(-/-) mice exhibited systemic vulnerability to oxidative injury, which became more prominent when they were fed the low cyst(e)ine diet. These results reveal novel roles of trans-sulfuration previously unrecognized in mice lacking another trans-sulfuration enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs(-/-)). Because Cbs(-/-) mice display hyperhomocysteinemia and hypermethioninemia, our results raise questions against the homocysteine-based etiology of CBS deficiency and the current newborn screening for homocysteinemia using Guthrie's method, which detects hypermethioninemia.","dc:creator":"Ishii I","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Cystathionine gamma-Lyase-deficient mice require dietary cysteine to protect against acute lethal myopathy and oxidative injury."},"rdfs:label":"Dietary Cysteine in Cystathionine γ-Lyase-deficient Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"This model shows many similar phenotypes between the CTH-deficient mice and the human patients with cystathioninuria, going beyond the basic requirements for elevated cysthionine.

This study aimed at revealing these roles by analyzing high-methionine diet-fed transsulfuration-defective cystathionine γ-lyase-deficient (Cth(-/-)) mice. Wild-type and Cth(-/-) mice were fed a standard diet (1 × Met: 0.44%) or a high-methionine diet (3 × Met or 6 × Met), and hepatic conditions were monitored by serum biochemistry and histology. Metabolome analysis was performed for methionine derivatives using capillary electrophoresis- or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and sulfur-detecting gas chromatography. The 6 × Met-fed Cth(-/-) (not 1 × Met-fed Cth(-/-) or 6 × Met-fed wild type) mice displayed acute hepatitis, which was characterized by markedly elevated levels of serum alanine/aspartate aminotransferases and serum/hepatic lipid peroxidation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hepatocyte ballooning; thereafter, they died of gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulation factor deficiency. After 1 week on 6 × Met, blood levels of ammonia/homocysteine and hepatic levels of methanethiol/3-methylthiopropionate (a methionine transamination product/methanethiol precursor) became significantly higher in Cth(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Although hepatic levels of methionine sulfoxide became higher in 6 × Met-fed wild-type mice and Cth(-/-) mice, those of glutathione, taurine/hypotaurine, and H(2)S became lower and serum levels of homocysteine became much higher in 6 × Met-fed Cth(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, transsulfuration plays a critical role in the detoxification of excessive methionine by circumventing aberrant accumulation of its toxic transamination metabolites, including ammonia, methanethiol, and 3-methylthiopropionate, in addition to synthesizing cysteine-derived antioxidants to counteract accumulated pro-oxidants such as methionine sulfoxide and homocysteine.","dc:creator":"Yamada H","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Methionine excess in diet induces acute lethal hepatitis in mice lacking cystathionine γ-lyase, an animal model of cystathioninuria."},"rdfs:label":"Cystathionine y-lyase Deficient Mice and Methionine Excess"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This is the same line of mice as the Ishii paper (PMID: 20566639) and is basically the same conclusions with only a few new developments.
