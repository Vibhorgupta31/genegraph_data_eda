Here, we show that reduced dosage of ERF, which encodes an inhibitory ETS transcription factor directly bound by ERK1/2 (refs. 2,3,4,5,6,7), causes complex craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures) in humans and mice. Features of this newly recognized clinical disorder include multiple-suture synostosis, craniofacial dysmorphism, Chiari malformation and language delay. Mice with functional Erf levels reduced to âˆ¼30% of normal exhibit postnatal multiple-suture synostosis; by contrast, embryonic calvarial development appears mildly delayed. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and high-throughput sequencing, we find that ERF binds preferentially to elements away from promoters that contain RUNX or AP-1 motifs. This work identifies ERF as a novel regulator of osteogenic stimulation by RAS-ERK signaling, potentially by competing with activating ETS factors in multifactor transcriptional complexes.","dc:creator":"Twigg SR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Reduced dosage of ERF causes complex craniosynostosis in humans and mice and links ERK1/2 signaling to regulation of osteogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"In situ hybridization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1954ba97-532a-4ef3-9d62-c4ebfd252084_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7cbdc344-aa0e-4319-8abb-d03e3dabaf93","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d14a929-c453-436d-adb4-2df5439954da","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both humans and mice experience craniosynostosis phenotypes.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439","rdfs:label":"Conditional Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:1954ba97-532a-4ef3-9d62-c4ebfd252084_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1954ba97-532a-4ef3-9d62-c4ebfd252084_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5419b157-d70b-4677-bddc-2ef342ef58bb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ffbc3a4-041b-4a55-a643-2a17cfe4a515","type":"Proband","phenotypeFreeText":"middle ear effusions, tonsillectomy","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0011322"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:5419b157-d70b-4677-bddc-2ef342ef58bb_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:3a36922d-5899-4bdc-9645-be7006711b82","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006494.4(ERF):c.256C>T (p.Arg86Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA249531"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439","rdfs:label":"Family 4 III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e920abf4-c54c-415c-983f-01494f21f369_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57e69744-dd44-4bf5-b74a-15c12c81bcc3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"exorbitism, mild early speech delay, poor coordination/concentration, ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0004626","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0002943","obo:HP_0011325","obo:HP_0010174"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:e920abf4-c54c-415c-983f-01494f21f369_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8b45bb42-04c6-45f7-af96-bcb1e1dd8b77","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006494.4(ERF):c.1270C>T (p.Gln424Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA249533"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439","rdfs:label":"Family 9 III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Truncating variant - shown to be hypomorphic"},{"id":"cggv:7ba13878-cded-412f-a08a-3056a5874b78_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9892255d-95ce-4e36-9d4e-15662a9d776b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"episodic visual loss, hypoplasia of optic nerves with dilated CSF sheaths, ectopic posterior pituitary gland, chronic raised intracranial pressure on head imaging, chiari type 1 malformation","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000272","obo:HP_0000520","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0002315","obo:HP_0000263","obo:HP_0011325"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"We included patients who tested negative on cytogenetic tests (karyotype, microarray, FISH for\n22q11.2 deletion) and/or the panel of genes offered by molecular genetics lab in our hospital (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and TWIST1),and for whom a DNA sample was available for analysis.

Knowledge of the specific genetic diagnosis in patients presenting with this condition is important for surgical and medical management. The most common single gene causes of syndromic craniosynostosis are mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, and EFNB1. Recently, a new single gene cause of craniosynostosis was published, together with phenotype data that highlight the clinical importance of making this specific molecular diagnosis. Phenotypic features of \"ERF-related craniosynostosis\" include sagittal or multiple-suture synostosis, Chiari malformation, and language delay. In order to determine the contribution of ERF mutations to genetically undiagnosed patients with craniosynostosis, we sequenced the coding regions of ERF in 40 patients with multi-suture or sagittal suture synostosis. We identified heterozygous ERF mutations in two individuals (5%). One mutation positive individual had pansynostosis, while the second had bilateral coronal and metopic synostosis. Both presented in infancy or childhood (age 3 months, and 6 years 9 months, respectively). One had CNS abnormalities including Chiari I malformation. Dysmorphic features included hypertelorism, proptosis, depressed nasal bridge, and retrognathia, in keeping with previously reported cases. The individuals did not require repeated cranial surgeries. ERF-related craniosynostosis should be suspected in patients presenting with multiple suture or sagittal synostosis.","dc:creator":"Chaudhry A","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Heterozygous mutations in ERF cause syndromic craniosynostosis with multiple suture involvement."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26097063","rdfs:label":"Patient A1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"2 P/LP variants upstream of potential in-frame start codon (amino acid 76)"},{"id":"cggv:4707d6db-b355-429f-b871-8563254cca2d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c31974b1-cc14-4fa9-a9b0-2f751eecf84c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":20,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0004442"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4707d6db-b355-429f-b871-8563254cca2d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:838da90c-a763-4743-a4ab-1caf5a19d100","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006494.4(ERF):c.21A>T (p.Thr7=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA507609078"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439","rdfs:label":"Family 11 III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Synonymous splice-site variant â†’ loss of 5â€™ donor site - shown hypomorphic"},{"id":"cggv:fc265f4d-5a58-41da-ad81-5c38ba3b1487_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:27c43f36-0880-4091-a50c-1deac6800a96","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"poor attention span, problems with writing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011325","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001156","obo:HP_0000377","obo:HP_0010059","obo:HP_0000316"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:fc265f4d-5a58-41da-ad81-5c38ba3b1487_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:96b6a0db-2b8b-450c-bb75-f76b89b062a5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006494.4(ERF):c.1201_1202del (p.Lys401fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16620858"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354439","rdfs:label":"Family 12 II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Truncating variant"},{"id":"cggv:3873a7c3-5ad6-4715-8894-3a3d1da85b41_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:79ad74b9-b1f6-4d34-b4d9-0913793167c5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0002007","obo:HP_0011800","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0004442"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3873a7c3-5ad6-4715-8894-3a3d1da85b41_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6af45e4a-f79c-4d99-aec4-935a0f21efb4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006494.4(ERF):c.985_1027del (p.Arg329SerfsTer54)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139771366"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31754721","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis (CRS).

was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant ERF-related craniosynostosis in 2013 (Twigg et al., PMID: 23354439). The phenotypic features of \"ERF-related craniosynostosis\" often include sagittal or multiple-suture synostosis, Chiari malformation, and language delay. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen\nLumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the phenotypic and genotypic variability between ERF-related craniosynostosis and Chitayat syndrome. Therefore, the two disease entities have been split. The split curation for autosomal dominant Chitayat syndrome will be curated separately. Ten variants (missense, nonsense, splice, frameshift) that have been reported in 12 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 23354439, 26097063, 31754721) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of\npathogenicity appears to be heterozygous loss of function (haploinsufficiency) (PMID: 23354439). This gene-disease association is supported by an expression study and a conditional mouse model (PMID: 23354439). In summary, ERF is definitively associated autosomal dominant ERF-related craniosynostosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has\nbeen upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP on the meeting date 5/20/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1954ba97-532a-4ef3-9d62-c4ebfd252084"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
