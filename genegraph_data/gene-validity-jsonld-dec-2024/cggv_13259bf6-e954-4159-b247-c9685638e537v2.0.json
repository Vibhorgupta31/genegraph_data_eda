The causative genes are known for fewer than 40% of PCLD index cases. Here, we have used whole exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 102 unrelated patients who were excluded for mutations in the 2 most common PCLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, to identify heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in 3 additional genes, ALG8, GANAB, and SEC61B. Similarly to PRKCSH and SEC63, these genes encode proteins that are integral to the protein biogenesis pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. We inactivated these candidate genes in cell line models to show that loss of function of each results in defective maturation and trafficking of polycystin-1, the central determinant of cyst pathogenesis. Despite acting in a common pathway, each PCLD gene product demonstrated distinct effects on polycystin-1 biogenesis. We also found enrichment on a genome-wide basis of heterozygous mutations in the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease gene PKHD1, indicating that adult PKHD1 carriers can present with clinical PCLD. These findings define genetic and biochemical modulators of polycystin-1 function and provide a more complete definition of the spectrum of dominant human polycystic diseases.","dc:creator":"Besse W","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Isolated polycystic liver disease genes define effectors of polycystin-1 function."},"rdfs:label":"European PCLD cases - European Yale in-house controls"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"No adjustments appear to have been done for multiple statistical tests performed"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.6},{"id":"cggv:13259bf6-e954-4159-b247-c9685638e537_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13259bf6-e954-4159-b247-c9685638e537_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:32812745-6b8d-4ec5-adb1-339d3acd331c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:224b20fe-6fc8-41bd-8263-1cd6d4ad2faf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Activation of the UPR pathway was measured via WB of spliced XBP1 and found to be increased.

Of note, biallelic ALG8 pathogenic variants have been associated with the congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ih (CDG-1h; OMIM #608104). Given that ALG8-associated ADPLD and ALG8-associated CDG-1h have different inheritance modes and phenotypic manifestations, we have split the two disease entities. As noted above, here we only curate the association between ALG8 and ADPLD. At least 7 variants (6 truncating and 1 missense) reported on ClinVar as Likely Pathogenic (LP) or Pathogenic (P) have been associated ADPLD phenotypes, three of which have also been associated with cystic kidney phenotypes across multiple publications (PMID: 28375157; PMID: 32457805, PMID: 36574950). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, case-control data, and experimental data. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays showing reduced maturation of polycystin 1 in ALG8 null cells.\n\nEvidence by Apple et al. 2023 showed that individuals carrying heterozygous ALG8 protein truncating variants (PTV) are at a significantly increased risk of a mild cystic kidney disease phenotypes, including multiple cases of probands with cystic kidney phenotypes that had ALG8 PTV that have been reported on ClinVar as LP or P (PMID: 36574950). Additionally, there was a case of a patient reported on ClinVar with a PTV, p.Leu241fs, in ALG8 (ClinVar Variation ID: 1333512,SCV002058782.1) with PLD with renal cysts. Another Likely Pathogenic variant (NM_024079.5(ALG8):c.1179-2A>G) was reported on Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) in a 75-year-old with multiple bilateral cysts and normal kidney size (Individual #00435459).\n\nAlthough more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. However, there are many individuals harboring PTV in ALG8 (including reported LP/P variants) that do not have any reported phenotype, indicating that truncating variants in ALG8 may either be risk alleles for polycystic liver and kidney phenotypes, or this gene-disease relationship may have low penetrance. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 07/08/2020. It was reevaluated and approved by the GCEP expert panel on 07/10/2023 and the classification did not change (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:13259bf6-e954-4159-b247-c9685638e537"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
