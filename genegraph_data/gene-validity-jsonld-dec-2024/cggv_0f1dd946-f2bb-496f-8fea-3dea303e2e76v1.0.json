However, recent morphological and molecular data indicate a mixing of adherens junctional and desmosomal components, resulting in a 'hybrid adhering junction' or 'area composita'. The α-catenin family member αT-catenin, part of the N-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex in the heart, is the only α-catenin that interacts with the desmosomal protein plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Thus, it has been postulated that αT-catenin might serve as a molecular integrator of the two adhesion complexes in the area composita. To investigate the role of αT-catenin in the heart, gene targeting technology was used to delete the Ctnna3 gene, encoding αT-catenin, in the mouse. The αT-catenin-null mice are viable and fertile; however, the animals exhibit progressive cardiomyopathy. Adherens junctional and desmosomal proteins were unaffected by loss of αT-catenin, with the exception of the desmosomal protein PKP2. Immunogold labeling at the ICD demonstrated in the αT-catenin-null heart a preferential reduction of PKP2 at the area composita compared with the desmosome. Furthermore, gap junction protein Cx43 was reduced at the ICD, including its colocalization with N-cadherin. Gap junction remodeling in αT-catenin-knockout hearts was associated with an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias after acute ischemia. This novel animal model demonstrates for the first time how perturbation in αT-catenin can affect both PKP2 and Cx43 and thereby highlights the importance of understanding the crosstalk between the junctional proteins of the ICD and its implications for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.","dc:creator":"Li J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Loss of αT-catenin alters the hybrid adhering junctions in the heart and leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmia following acute ischemia."},"rdfs:label":"Germline knockout of alphaT-catenin in the mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Only the homozygous KO tested and phenotype is different (DCM instead of ARVD)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0f1dd946-f2bb-496f-8fea-3dea303e2e76_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f1dd946-f2bb-496f-8fea-3dea303e2e76_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1951de1-4cf7-43ee-8ecf-b20abe1a060d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd1c5456-4f55-4abd-adc2-e6dccb28b31e","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:d1951de1-4cf7-43ee-8ecf-b20abe1a060d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:798e26bf-acb0-490a-9da5-6c91451d9c30","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_013266.3(CTNNA3):c.281T>A (p.Val94Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/100656"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23136403"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23136403","rdfs:label":"II: 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"not clear if paternaty is tested"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":701,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":3.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f8a3ab80-4c02-4f66-bfe8-c1d07ecd801d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016587","gene":"hgnc:2511","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CTNNA3: Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy\nMode of Inheritance: Autosomal dominant inheritance (HP:0000006)\nHGNC: 2511\t MONDO:0016587 \nExpert Panel: Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy\n\nThree papers were reviewed related to CTNNA3 and ARVD (23136403, 21254927, 224213630). In one paper the CTNNA3 gene was analyzed in 76 ARVD probands that were negative for PKP2, DSP, DSG2, DSC2, and JUP. In one of the probands the heterozygous NM_013266.3(CTNNA3):c.281T>A p.(Val94Asp) variant was found. This variant was not observed in 245296 reference alleles from gnomAD and was not present in both healthy parents and brother suggesting that the variant occurred de novo. Unfortunately no information was given about paternity testing or family history for ARVD. Another proband showed the heterozygous variant NM_013266.3(CTNNA3):c.2296_2298del p.(Leu766del). This variant was not found in 30971 reference alleles from gnomAD but was inherited from her father that only showed a mild right ventricular dilation. Her ant inherited the variant as well but she was asymptomatic. Yeast two-hybrid studies with both variants showed some aberrations (23136403). In another paper a missense variant was found in one of 55 Danish ARVD patients. The variant was found 37 times in 276338 (1 times homozygous) reference alleles in gnomAD making it less likely as a causal variant. In addition the proband did carry a missense variant of unknown significance in DSP (21254927). Germline knockout of alphaT-catenin encoded by ctnna3 in the mouse alters PKP2 distribution without affecting other junctional components of the areae Compositae. These mutant mice exhibit progressive dilated cardiomyopathy, gap junction remodelling, and increased sensitivity to ventricular arrhythmia following acute ischaemia, but not spontaneous ARVC (224213630).
