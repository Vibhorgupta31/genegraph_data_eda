A whole-genome scan by microarray analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (ref. 2) identified a founder haplotype and defined a critical interval of 1.53 cM on chromosome 14q23.3-q24.1 that contains the gene associated with this form of retinal dystrophy. RDH12 maps in this region and encodes a retinol dehydrogenase proposed to function in the visual cycle. A homozygous 677A-->G transition (resulting in Y226C) in RDH12 was present in all affected family members studied, as well as in two Austrian individuals with sporadic retinal dystrophy. We identified additional mutations in RDH12 in 3 of 89 non-Austrian individuals with retinal dystrophy: a 5-nucleotide deletion (806delCCCTG) and the transition 565C-->T (resulting in Q189X), each in the homozygous state, and 146C-->T (resulting in T49M) and 184C-->T (resulting in R62X) in compound heterozygosity. When expressed in COS-7 cells, Cys226 and Met49 variants had diminished and aberrant activity, respectively, in interconverting isomers of retinol and retinal. The severe visual impairment of individuals with mutations in RDH12 is in marked contrast to the mild visual deficiency in individuals with fundus albipunctatus caused by mutations in RDH5, encoding another retinal dehydrogenase. Our studies show that RDH12 is associated with retinal dystrophy and encodes an enzyme with a unique, nonredundant role in the photoreceptor cells.","dc:creator":"Janecke AR","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mutations in RDH12 encoding a photoreceptor cell retinol dehydrogenase cause childhood-onset severe retinal dystrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd51db77-53c3-4f89-9a4c-c92bbe182d7e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd51db77-53c3-4f89-9a4c-c92bbe182d7e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9fa7375b-ac91-46d2-a2ba-5e3ffad989c5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e4c31d6-21a7-4157-b403-cc8b5cd5ad8e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In situ hybridization of RDH12 transcripts in monkey and mouse retina using antisense RNA show the localization in photoreceptor inner segments and cell bodies.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12226107","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Retinoids are chromophores involved in vision, transcriptional regulation, and cellular differentiation. Members of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily catalyze the transformation of retinol to retinal. Here, we describe the identification and properties of three enzymes from a novel subfamily of four retinol dehydrogenases (RDH11-14) that display dual-substrate specificity, uniquely metabolizing all-trans- and cis-retinols with C(15) pro-R specificity. RDH11-14 could be involved in the first step of all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid production in many tissues. RDH11-14 fill the gap in our understanding of 11-cis-retinal and all-trans-retinal transformations in photoreceptor (RDH12) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RDH11). The dual-substrate specificity of RDH11 explains the minor phenotype associated with mutations in 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH5) causing fundus albipunctatus in humans and engineered mice lacking RDH5. Furthermore, photoreceptor RDH12 could be involved in the production of 11-cis-retinal from 11-cis-retinol during regeneration of the cone visual pigments. These newly identified enzymes add new elements to important retinoid metabolic pathways that have not been explained by previous genetic and biochemical studies.","dc:creator":"Haeseleer F","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Dual-substrate specificity short chain retinol dehydrogenases from the vertebrate retina."},"rdfs:label":"In situ hybridization of monkey and mouse RDH12"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:40c4babb-3f89-4a66-a848-d60ce8a7ba74","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dad561a5-e86e-46db-8884-671aaf649d8b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Cells expressing RDH12 were assayed for activity towards various retinoid isomers in the presence of NADH and NADPH.

It has recently been shown that mutations in RDH12, encoding a retinol dehydrogenase, result in severe and early-onset autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy (arRD). In a cohort of 1011 individuals diagnosed with arRD, we have now identified 20 different disease-associated RDH12 mutations, of which 16 are novel, in a total of 22 individuals (2.2%). Haplotype analysis suggested a founder mutation for each of the three common mutations: p.L99I, p.T155I and c.806_810delCCCTG. Patients typically presented with early disease that affected the function of both rods and cones and progressed to legal blindness in early adulthood. Eleven of the missense variants identified in our study exhibited profound loss of catalytic activity when expressed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and assayed for ability to convert all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol. Loss-of-function appeared to result from decreased protein stability, as expression levels were significantly reduced. For the p.T49M variant, differing activity profiles were associated with each of the alleles of the common p.R161Q RDH12 polymorphism, suggesting that genetic background may act as a modifier of mutation effect. A locus (LCA3) for Leber congenital amaurosis, a severe, early-onset form of arRD, maps close to RDH12 on chromosome 14q24. Haplotype analysis in the family in which LCA3 was mapped excluded RDH12 as the LCA3 gene and thus suggests the presence of a novel arRD gene in this region.","dc:creator":"Thompson DA","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Retinal degeneration associated with RDH12 mutations results from decreased 11-cis retinal synthesis due to disruption of the visual cycle."},"rdfs:label":"In vitro functional analysis of RDH12 missense mutations"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:386c4ab8-5e0c-49cb-a00d-58fc013c72fe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6549a37e-be06-47d8-a3a7-bc72171df34b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Ability of RDH12 protein to catalyzed the conversion of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol was assessed in cells transfected with wild type or variants.

Variants in RDH12 cause early-onset retinal degeneration leading to vision loss with variable severity. To capture the overlapping spectrum of clinical presentations linked to this gene, it is curated under the disease entity “inherited retinal degeneration”. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found there to be a difference in inheritance pattern phenotypic variability. Therefore, the curation will be split into autosomal recessive inherited retinal degeneration, which includes cases described with autosomal recessive LCA (OMIM: 612712) and autosomal dominant inherited retinal degeneration, which will include autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (OMIM: 268000). The split curation for autosomal dominant condition will be curated separately. \nFifteen variants (12 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 frameshift) that have been reported in 11 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 15258582, 32014858) are included in this curation. [Additional essential genetic evidence description]. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported animal models, expression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 12226107, 16269441, 17032653).  Haesseler et al (12226107) demonstrates that RDH12 enzyme catalyzed the reduction of all-trans-retinal and its 9-cis-, 11-cis-, and 13-cis-retinal isomers in the presence of NADPH. While Thompson et al. (16269441) shows expression of the transcript localizes to the inner segments of rod and cone photoreceptors.  Genetic alterations in RDH12 result in significantly decreased enzymatic activity and reduced expression of the protein suggesting LOF.  Finally, animal models show photoreceptor degeneration in RDH12 knockouts.  In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between RDH12 and RDH12-related recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retinal GCEP on the meeting date March 3, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bd51db77-53c3-4f89-9a4c-c92bbe182d7e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
