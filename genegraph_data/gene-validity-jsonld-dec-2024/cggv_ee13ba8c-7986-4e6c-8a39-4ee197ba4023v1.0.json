Mutations in the TMPRSS3 (transmembrane protease, serine 3) gene cause prelingual (DFNB10) or postlingual (DFNB8) deafness. In our previous study, three pathogenic mutations in TMPRSS3 were identified in one Chinese family. To evaluate the importance of TMPRSS3 mutations in recessive deafness among the Chinese, we screened 150 autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) families and identified 6 that carried seven causative TMPRSS3 mutations, including five novel mutations (c.809T>A, c.1151T>G, c.1204G>A, c.1244T>C, and c.1250G>A) and two previously reported mutations (c.323-6G>A and c.916G>A). Each of the five novel mutations was classified as severe, by both age of onset and severity of hearing loss. Together with our previous study, six families were found to share one pathogenic mutation (c.916G>A, p.Ala306Thr). To determine whether this mutation arose from a common ancestor, we analyzed six short tandem repeat (STR) markers spanning the TMPRSS3 gene. In four families, we observed linkage disequilibrium between p.Ala306Thr and STR markers. Our results indicate that mutations in TMPRSS3 account for about 4.6% (7/151) of Chinese ARNSHL cases lacking mutations in SLC26A4 or GJB2 and that the recurrent TMPRSS3 mutation p.Ala306Thr is likely to be a founder mutation.","dc:creator":"Gao X","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Identification of TMPRSS3 as a Significant Contributor to Autosomal Recessive Hearing Loss in the Chinese Population."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28695016","rdfs:label":"FH1523"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5cafa2ea-11da-46a5-a624-0a7b621dc5c9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96f6f670-b178-4348-af1e-f027c96021c4","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000408","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:5cafa2ea-11da-46a5-a624-0a7b621dc5c9_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:a56bd61d-f333-4d39-a8d4-cada16c58576","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024022.2(TMPRSS3):c.323-6G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/46113"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11137999","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Approximately 50% of childhood deafness is caused by mutations in specific genes.

To unravel the role of Tmprss3 in the acquisition of mature K(+) currents, we compared their function by patch-clamp technique in wild-type Tmprss3(WT) and Tmprss3(Y260X)-mutant mice.

To determine by which mechanism this occurred, we compared the protein network of Tmprss3(WT) and Tmprss3(Y260X)-mutant mice using proteomic analysis. This led to the identification of a pathway related to potassium Kcnma1 channels. This pathway was validated by immunohistochemistry, focusing on the most downregulated protein that was identified as a cochlear Kcnma1-associated protein, APOA1.

In conclusion, our data suggest that lack of Tmprss3 leads to a decrease in Kcnma1 potassium channels expression in (IHCs).","dc:creator":"Molina L","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Tmprss3 loss of function impairs cochlear inner hair cell Kcnma1 channel membrane expression."},"rdfs:label":"Molina Non-Patient Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ee13ba8c-7986-4e6c-8a39-4ee197ba4023_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1f4a7ba-09d1-4421-aa23-fa50872f7134","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16c6aa9e-8557-4231-a114-f00ad236903b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"deafness. showed hair cell degeneration by SEM.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21454591","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the type II transmembrane serine protease 3 (TMPRSS3) gene cause non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB8/10), characterized by congenital or childhood onset bilateral profound hearing loss. In order to explore the physiopathology of TMPRSS3 related deafness, we have generated an ethyl-nitrosourea-induced mutant mouse carrying a protein-truncating nonsense mutation in Tmprss3 (Y260X) and characterized the functional and histological consequences of Tmprss3 deficiency. Auditory brainstem response revealed that wild type and heterozygous mice have normal hearing thresholds up to 5 months of age, whereas Tmprss3(Y260X) homozygous mutant mice exhibit severe deafness. Histological examination showed degeneration of the organ of Corti in adult mutant mice. Cochlear hair cell degeneration starts at the onset of hearing, postnatal day 12, in the basal turn and progresses very rapidly toward the apex, reaching completion within 2 days. Given that auditory and vestibular deficits often co-exist, we evaluated the balancing abilities of Tmprss3(Y260X) mice by using rotating rod and vestibular behavioral tests. Tmprss3(Y260X) mice effectively displayed mild vestibular syndrome that correlated histologically with a slow degeneration of saccular hair cells. In situ hybridization in the developing inner ear showed that Tmprss3 mRNA is localized in sensory hair cells in the cochlea and the vestibule. Our results show that Tmprss3 acts as a permissive factor for cochlear hair cells survival and activation at the onset of hearing and is required for saccular hair cell survival. This mouse model will certainly help to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying DFNB8/10 deafness and cochlear function.","dc:creator":"Fasquelle L","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Tmprss3, a transmembrane serine protease deficient in human DFNB8/10 deafness, is critical for cochlear hair cell survival at the onset of hearing."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":343,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d1308b48-37ce-49e4-94b0-9bb7e542b7d1","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:11877","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The TMPRSS3 gene has been associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 8/16/2016. This association was made using case-level data only. At least 8 missense, frameshift, and splice-site variants have been reported in humans. TMPRSS3 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2001 (Scott et al.). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 5 publications (11137999, 28695016, 25474651, 26036852, 11907649). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in multiple additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model, expression studies, and functional assays. In summary, TMPRSS3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 8/22/2017.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ee13ba8c-7986-4e6c-8a39-4ee197ba4023"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
