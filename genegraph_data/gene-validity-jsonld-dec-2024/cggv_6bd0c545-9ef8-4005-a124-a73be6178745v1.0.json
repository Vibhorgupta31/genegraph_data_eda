In the liver, alpha-isocaproic acid, a product of leucine transamination, is metabolized to acetyl-CoA via 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and MCC. In the muscle, leucine can be a source of energy.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11170888","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"3-Methylcrotonylglycinuria is an inborn error of leucine catabolism and has a recessive pattern of inheritance that results from the deficiency of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC). The introduction of tandem mass spectrometry in newborn screening has revealed an unexpectedly high incidence of this disorder, which, in certain areas, appears to be the most frequent organic aciduria. MCC, an heteromeric enzyme consisting of alpha (biotin-containing) and beta subunits, is the only one of the four biotin-dependent carboxylases known in humans that has genes that have not yet been characterized, precluding molecular studies of this disease. Here we report the characterization, at the genomic level and at the cDNA level, of both the MCCA gene and the MCCB gene, encoding the MCC alpha and MCC beta subunits, respectively. The 19-exon MCCA gene maps to 3q25-27 and encodes a 725-residue protein with a biotin attachment site; the 17-exon MCCB gene maps to 5q12-q13 and encodes a 563-residue polypeptide. We show that disease-causing mutations can be classified into two complementation groups, denoted \"CGA\" and \"CGB.\" We detected two MCCA missense mutations in CGA patients, one of which leads to absence of biotinylated MCC alpha. Two MCCB missense mutations and one splicing defect mutation leading to early MCC beta truncation were found in CGB patients. A fourth MCCB mutation also leading to early MCC beta truncation was found in two nonclassified patients. A fungal model carrying an mccA null allele has been constructed and was used to demonstrate, in vivo, the involvement of MCC in leucine catabolism. These results establish that 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria results from loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of MCC and complete the genetic characterization of the four human biotin-dependent carboxylases.","dc:creator":"Gallardo ME","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"The molecular basis of 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria, a disorder of leucine catabolism."},"rdfs:label":"MCCC1 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fda9b26c-3948-474b-8a32-4c19aebb1c60","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cab93e9c-292b-4f59-a472-53e28150e336","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Aspergillus nidulans grows on leucine and isoleucine (and valine to a lesser extent) as the sole carbon source.

We identified eight novel mutations of MCCC1 or MCCC2 in six Chinese newborns screened by tandem mass spectrometry. Transcript analysis revealed that the novel splice mutation c.639+5G>T produced a normal transcript and a transcript of exon 6 skipping which led to truncated MCCC1 protein. The remaining seven novel mutations may cause structure damage and dysfunction of MCC as predicted by in silico analysis. In conclusion, our study expands the spectrum of mutations found in MCCC1 and MCCC2 and provides a rough prevalence of 1 of 68,333 in Chinese population. Although the affected patients remained asymptomatic during follow-up, we hold the view that early detection through newborn screening, early intervention and follow-up may provide an important guidance to prevent subsequent metabolic disorders and deal with crisis later in life.

The clinical phenotypes are highly variable ranging from asymptomatic to profound metabolic acidosis and death in infancy. Sequence similarity with Glycine max and Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding the two subunits of MCC permitted us to clone the cDNAs encoding the alpha- and beta-subunits of human MCC. The 2580 bp MCCA cDNA encodes the 725 amino acid biotin-containing alpha-subunit. The MCCA gene is located on chromosome 3q26-q28 and consists of 19 exons. The 2304 bp MCCB cDNA encodes the non-biotin-containing beta-subunit of 563 amino acids. The MCCB gene is located on chromosome 5q13 and consists of 17 exons. We have sequenced both genes in four patients with isolated biotin-unresponsive deficiency of MCC. In two of them we found mutations in the MCCA gene. Compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation (S535F) and a nonsense mutation (V694X) were identified in one patient. One heterozygous mutation (S535F) was found in another patient. The remaining two patients had mutations in the MCCB gene. One consanguineous patient was homozygous for a missense mutation (R268T). In the other we identified a missense mutation in one allele (E99Q) and allelic loss of the other. Mutations were correlated with an almost total lack of enzyme activity in fibroblasts. These data provide evidence that human MCC deficiency is caused by mutations in either the MCCA or MCCB gene.","dc:creator":"Holzinger A","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Cloning of the human MCCA and MCCB genes and mutations therein reveal the molecular cause of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA: carboxylase deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11406611","rdfs:label":"Patient MA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The authors state that compound heterozygosity was confirmed by segregation analysis, but no data provided."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":63,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:040e0b71-28e3-4be9-bb1a-a8e083b5598f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018950","gene":"hgnc:6936","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between MCCC1 and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (autosomal recessive) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August, 2019. MCCC1 encodes the alpha subunit of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, which is involved in the catabolism of leucine. Deficiency of MCCC1 is associated with increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovalerate & 3-methylcrotonylglycine, The clinical phenotype ranges from severe neurological abnormalities and death in infancy to asymptomatic. Variants in MCCC1 were ﬁrst reported in humans with this deﬁciency in 2001 (Gallardo et al., PMID: 11170888; Baumgartner et al., PMID: 11181649). At least 103 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, deletion) have been identiﬁed in humans (Cozzolino et al., 2018; PMID 29767664). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays, expression studies, and in vitro studies. In summary, MCCC1 is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6bd0c545-9ef8-4005-a124-a73be6178745"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
