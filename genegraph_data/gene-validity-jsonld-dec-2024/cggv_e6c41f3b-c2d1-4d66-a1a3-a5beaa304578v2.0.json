LS is caused by mutations in PTPN11, encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2. We report here 2 unrelated Japanese cases of LS with different PTPN11 mutations (p.Y279C and p.T468P). To elucidate the pathogenesis of multiple lentigines in LS, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses of lentigines and non-lesional skin were performed. Numerous mature giant melanosomes in melanocytes and keratinocytes were observed in lentigines. In addition, the levels of expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1), phosphorylated Akt, mTOR and STAT3 in the epidermis in lentigines were significantly elevated compared with non-lesional skin. In in vitro assays, melanin synthesis in human melanoma cells expressing SHP-2 with LS-associated mutations was higher than in cells expressing normal SHP-2, suggesting that LS-associated SHP-2 mutations might enhance melanin synthesis in melanocytes, and that the activation of Akt/mTOR signalling may contribute to this process.

We screened nine patients with ML/LEOPARD syndrome (including a mother-daughter pair) and two children with NS who had multiple café au lait spots, for mutations in the NS gene, PTPN11, and found, in 10 of 11 patients, one of two new missense mutations, in exon 7 or exon 12. Both mutations affect the PTPN11 phosphotyrosine phosphatase domain, which is involved in <30% of the NS PTPN11 mutations. The study demonstrates that ML/LEOPARD syndrome and NS are allelic disorders. The detected mutations suggest that distinct molecular and pathogenetic mechanisms cause the peculiar cutaneous manifestations of the ML/LEOPARD-syndrome subtype of NS.","dc:creator":"Digilio MC","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Grouping of multiple-lentigines/LEOPARD and Noonan syndromes on the PTPN11 gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12058348","rdfs:label":"Patient 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant functionally characterized by Hanna et al. 2006."},{"id":"cggv:d5efba42-69ae-42aa-a756-9979e4bff61d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e215643-d21f-4c05-9ae2-346a145e4488","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"This paper reported 4 Taiwanese individuals with NSML and variants in the PTPN11 gene.

Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing LS mutants of SHP2. We found that the GAB1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex was more abundant in fibroblasts from LS than control subjects and that both AKT and GSK-3beta hyperphosphorylation were prevented by reducing GAB1 expression or by overexpressing a GAB1 mutant unable to bind to PI3K. Consistently, purified recombinant LS mutants failed to dephosphorylate GAB1 PI3K-binding sites. These mutants induced PI3K-dependent increase in cell size in a model of chicken embryo cardiac explants and in transcriptional activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene in neonate rat cardiomyocytes.

The maximum amount of scorable genetic evidence has been published showing de novo as well as segregating variants occur in PTPN11 in patients with NSML (Digilio et al., 2002; Kim, Kim, Kim, Lee, & Lee, 2011; Lin, Wang, Chao, Wu, & Lin, 2009; Maridet et al., 2016; Motegi et al., 2015; Sarkozy, 2004). Additionally, the mechanism of disease has been characterized as LOF compared to that of PTPN11-NS, which is GOF (Edouard et al., 2010; Hanna et al., 2006; Marin et al., 2011; Stewart et al., 2010). The PTPN11 gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NSML phenotype and variants found in NSML patients in this gene disrupt the RAS pathway function as demonstrated by mouse and zebrafish models (Aoki et al., 2016; Marin et al., 2011; Rauen, 2013; Stewart et al., 2010). Variants observed in NSML patients are predicted to be neomorphic alleles with reduced phosphatase activity (e.g. p.Thr468Met) (Edouard et al., 2010; Hanna et al., 2006; Keilhack, David, McGregor, Cantley, & Neel, 2005; Kontaridis, Swanson, David, Barford, & Neel, 2006; Oishi et al., 2006; Oishi et al., 2009; Tartaglia et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2014). Of note, PTPN11 has also been classified as Definitive in association with NS and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.
