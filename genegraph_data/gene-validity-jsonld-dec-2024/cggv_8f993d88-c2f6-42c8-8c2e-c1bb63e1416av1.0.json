Amish nemaline myopathy is a form of nemaline myopathy common among the Old Order Amish. In the first months of life, affected infants have tremors with hypotonia and mild contractures of the shoulders and hips. Progressive worsening of the proximal contractures, weakness, and a pectus carinatum deformity develop before the children die of respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year. The disorder has an incidence of approximately 1 in 500 among the Amish, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Using a genealogy database, automated pedigree software, and linkage analysis of DNA samples from four sibships, we identified an approximately 2-cM interval on chromosome 19q13.4 that was homozygous in all affected individuals. The gene for the sarcomeric thin-filament protein, slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1), maps to this interval and was sequenced.

These results suggest that muscle cell-specific protein degradation is responsible for the absence of truncated slow TnT protein in patient muscle.  Additionally, binding of the truncated slow TnT to tropomyosin is almost non-detectable in a solid phase protein binding assay, whereas a saturable binding was found between intact slow TnT and tropomyosin. This result supports a hypothesis that the two-site binding to tropomyosin is necessary to anchor TnT and the rest of the troponin complex to the thin filament.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15665378","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"A nonsense mutation at codon Glu180 in exon 11 of slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TnT) gene (TNNT1) causes an autosomal-recessive inherited nemaline myopathy. We previously reported the absence of intact or prematurely terminated slow TnT polypeptide in Amish nemaline myopathy (ANM) patient muscle. The present study further investigates the expression and fate of mutant slow TnT in muscle cells. Intact slow TnT mRNA was readily detected in patient muscle, indicating unaffected transcription and RNA splicing. Sequence of the cloned cDNAs revealed the single nucleotide mutation in two alternatively spliced isoforms of slow TnT mRNA. Mutant TNNT1 cDNA is translationally active in Escherichia coli and non-muscle eukaryotic cells, producing the expected truncated slow TnT protein. The mutant mRNA was expressed at significant levels in differentiated C2C12 myotubes, but unlike intact exogenous TnT, truncated slow TnT protein was not detected. Transfective expression in undifferentiated myoblasts produced slow TnT mRNA but not a detectable amount of truncated or intact slow TnT proteins, indicating a muscle cell-specific proteolysis of TnT when it is not integrated into myofilaments. The slow TnT-(1-179) fragment has substantially lower affinity for binding to tropomyosin, in keeping with the loss of one of two tropomyosin-binding sites. Our findings suggest that inefficient incorporation into myofilament is responsible for the instability of mutant slow TnT in ANM muscle. Rapid degradation of the truncated slow TnT protein, rather than instability of the nonsense mRNA, provides the protective mechanism against the potential dominant negative effect of the mutant TnT fragment.","dc:creator":"Wang X","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Cellular fate of truncated slow skeletal muscle troponin T produced by Glu180 nonsense mutation in amish nemaline myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Tropomyosin binding"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8f993d88-c2f6-42c8-8c2e-c1bb63e1416a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94b4f903-d307-4542-9c43-e4382ead963d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca599cb5-dbe8-4ae3-8f70-fe96a398fd37","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Both the altered body shape and reduced birefringence were corrected in SP8‐MO morphants when WT human TNNT1 mRNA was introduced.

To investigate the pathogenesis and muscle pathophysiology of ANM, we studied the phenotypes of partial and total loss of ssTnT in Tnnt1 gene targeted mice. An insertion of neomycin resistance cassette in intron 10 of Tnnt1 gene caused an approximately 60% decrease in ssTnT protein expression whereas cre-loxP-mediated deletion of exons 11-13 resulted in total loss of ssTnT, as seen in ANM muscles. In diaphragm and soleus muscles of the knockdown and knockout mouse models, we demonstrated that ssTnT deficiency resulted in significantly decreased levels of other slow fibre-specific myofilament proteins whereas fast fibre-specific myofilament proteins were increased correspondingly. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that ssTnT deficiency produced significantly smaller type I slow fibres and compensatory growth of type II fast fibres. Along with the slow fibre atrophy and the changes in myofilament protein isoform contents, ssTnT deficiency significantly reduced the tolerance to fatigue in soleus muscle. ssTnT-deficient soleus muscle also contains significant numbers of small-sized central nuclei type I fibres, indicating active regeneration. The data provide strong support for the essential role of ssTnT in skeletal muscle function and the causal effect of its loss in the pathology of ANM. This observation further supports the hypothesis that the function of slow fibres can be restored in ANM patients if a therapeutic supplement of ssTnT is achieved.

At least eight unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, and deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 26296490, 31604653, 10952871, 25430424, 24689076, 29792937). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 16 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is homozygous, or compound heterozygous, loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction, expression in skeletal muscle, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and models in both zebrafish and mouse. In summary, TNNT1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy 5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nOf note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy. These have been assessed separately. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism (loss of function versus potential gain of function), inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive versus autosomal dominant), and phenotypic variability (the missense autosomal dominant mutation results in a mild phenotype with considerable clinical heterogeneity, whereas the recessive truncating and internal deletion mutations with loss of function are associated with severe, early‐onset phenotypes). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy and autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy 5.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8f993d88-c2f6-42c8-8c2e-c1bb63e1416a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
