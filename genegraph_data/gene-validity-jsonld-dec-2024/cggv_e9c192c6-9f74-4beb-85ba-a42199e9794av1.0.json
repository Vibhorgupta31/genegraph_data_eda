Approximately half of individuals with PCD also have alterations in the left-right organization of their internal organ positioning, including situs inversus and situs ambiguous (Kartagener's syndrome). Here, we identify an uncharacterized coiled-coil domain containing a protein, CCDC40, essential for correct left-right patterning in mouse, zebrafish and human. In mouse and zebrafish, Ccdc40 is expressed in tissues that contain motile cilia, and mutations in Ccdc40 result in cilia with reduced ranges of motility. We further show that CCDC40 mutations in humans result in a variant of PCD characterized by misplacement of the central pair of microtubules and defective assembly of inner dynein arms and dynein regulatory complexes. CCDC40 localizes to motile cilia and the apical cytoplasm and is required for axonemal recruitment of CCDC39, disruption of which underlies a similar variant of PCD.","dc:creator":"Becker-Heck A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"The coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC40 is essential for motile cilia function and left-right axis formation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9c192c6-9f74-4beb-85ba-a42199e9794a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58f9f365-c2c3-4591-afbe-aec6af1e92b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58f9f365-c2c3-4591-afbe-aec6af1e92b6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":{"id":"cggv:096cf27a-448d-4f6b-b4d7-a1b0f1fe41fa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017950.4(CCDC40):c.248del (p.Ala83fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338795"}},"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing, likely followed by Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplified exons and adjacent intronic regions from CCDC39 and CCDC40","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Prior to genotyping, the proband was previously diagnosed with classic PCD and axonemal ultrastructural defects previously known to be characteristic of CCDC39 and CCDC40 variants.

About 12% of cases show perturbed 9+2 microtubule cilia structure and inner dynein arm (IDA) loss, historically termed \"radial spoke defect.\" We sequenced CCDC39 and CCDC40 in 54 \"radial spoke defect\" families, as these are the two genes identified so far to cause this defect. We discovered biallelic mutations in a remarkable 69% (37/54) of families, including identification of 25 (19 novel) mutant alleles (12 in CCDC39 and 13 in CCDC40). All the mutations were nonsense, splice, and frameshift predicting early protein truncation, which suggests this defect is caused by \"null\" alleles conferring complete protein loss. Most families (73%; 27/37) had homozygous mutations, including families from outbred populations. A major putative hotspot mutation was identified, CCDC40 c.248delC, as well as several other possible hotspot mutations. Together, these findings highlight the key role of CCDC39 and CCDC40 in PCD with axonemal disorganization and IDA loss, and these genes represent major candidates for genetic testing in families affected by this ciliary phenotype. We show that radial spoke structures are largely intact in these patients and propose this ciliary ultrastructural abnormality be referred to as \"IDA and microtubular disorganisation defect,\" rather than \"radial spoke defect.\"","dc:creator":"Antony D","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in CCDC39 and CCDC40 are the major cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia with axonemal disorganization and absent inner dynein arms."}},"rdfs:label":"Antony_2013_PCD147-II:2"},{"id":"cggv:5445af63-d29a-40ca-bff4-64df0c2047a7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5445af63-d29a-40ca-bff4-64df0c2047a7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"NM_017950.4(CCDC40):c.248del (p.Ala83fs) is a single base deletion variant in exon 3 that is predicted to trigger a frameshift that disrupts ~93% of the protein product.

In Chlamydomonas, we used immunoblots and microtubule sliding assays to show that mutants in CCDC40 (PF7) and CCDC39 (PF8) fail to assemble N-DRC, several inner dynein arms, tektin, and CCDC39. Enrichment screens for suppression of pf7; pf8 cells led to the isolation of five independent extragenic suppressors defined by four different mutations in a NIMA-related kinase, CNK11. These alleles partially rescue the flagellar length defect, but not the motility defect. The suppressor does not restore the missing N-DRC and inner dynein arm proteins. In addition, the cnk11 mutations partially suppress the short flagella phenotype of N-DRC and axonemal dynein mutants, but do not suppress the motility defects. The tpg1 mutation in TTLL9, a tubulin polyglutamylase, partially suppresses the length phenotype in the same axonemal dynein mutants. In contrast to cnk11, tpg1 does not suppress the short flagella phenotype of pf7. The polyglutamylated tubulin in the proximal region that remains in the tpg1 mutant is reduced further in the pf7; tpg1 double mutant by immunofluorescence. CCDC40, which is needed for docking multiple other axonemal complexes, is needed for tubulin polyglutamylation in the proximal end of the flagella. The CCDC39 and CCDC40 proteins are likely to be involved in recruiting another tubulin glutamylase(s) to the flagella. Another difference between cnk11-1 and tpg1 mutants is that cnk11-1 cells show a faster turnover rate of tubulin at the flagellar tip than in wild-type flagella and tpg1 flagella show a slower rate. The double mutant shows a turnover rate similar to tpg1, which suggests the faster turnover rate in cnk11-1 flagella requires polyglutamylation. Thus, we hypothesize that many short flagella mutants in Chlamydomonas have increased instability of axonemal microtubules. Both CNK11 and tubulin polyglutamylation play roles in regulating the stability of axonemal microtubules.

The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 15, is one of at least 40 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Affected patients frequently present as neonates with respiratory distress, recurrent chest infections, cough and/or pneumonia (PMID: 23255504). Recurrent upper and lower respiratory infections are highly prevalent and include sinusitis, rhinorrhea, chronic cough, pneumonia, and bronchitis. Patients frequently exhibit chronic cough, age-dependent bronchiectasis, and/or otitis media. Heterotaxy is present with approximately 50% penetrance, most often in the form of situs inversus totalis. Immotile sperm and female infertility are also reported for some affected patients. Biopsies of the airway epithelium show a variable motility defect including static cilia and rigid cilia with variable fast, flicking movements but reduced beating amplitudes. Defects in axonemal morphology include shifting or absence of central pairs, disorganization of peripheral microtubular doublets, abnormalities in both radial spokes and nexin links, and usually complete but sometimes partial absence of inner dynein arms. Outer dynein arms appear to be normal/intact. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) was found to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited CCDC40 variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as primary ciliary dyskinesia 15 (MONDO:0013435, OMIM #613808). Seventeen suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (eight nonsense, seven frameshift, and two predicted to trigger frameshift by affecting splicing), which have been collectively reported in thirty-six probands in two publications (PMID: 21131974, PMID: 23255504). More case-level evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 22499950, PMID: 25619595, PMID: 32502479), but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points). This gene-disease relationship has not been studied in case-control studies at the single variant level or aggregate variant level. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by variants likely to trigger the absence of a gene product (PMID: 21131974, PMID: 23255504). All probands scored in this curation harbored two variant alleles within the CCDC40 locus. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that CCDC40 localizes specifically to tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the ovary (PMID: 10997877) and Kupffer’s vesicle in the developing zebrafish embryo (PMID: 21131974). Biochemical and immunoprecipitation studies from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii indicate that the orthologs of CCDC40 and CCDC39 form a complex that functions as an axonemal molecular ruler, defining the length of the cilia, radial spoke periodicity, and both the presence and orientation of components of the inner dynein arms and nexin-dynein regulatory complex (PMID: 25395538). Phenotypes of affected human patients are recapitulated by various model organisms with CCDC40 loss-of-function, including defective structure and motility in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (PMID: 26348919), left-right patterning defects and defective ciliary ultrastructure in zebrafish (PMID: 21131974), and situs inversus and defective ciliary ultrastructure in mice (PMID: 21131974). Restoring wild-type CCDC40 expression successfully rescues these phenotypes in both Chlamydomonas (PMID: 26348919) and zebrafish (PMID: 21131974) models. Additional evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 10997877, PMID: 28182636) but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points). In summary, CCDC40 is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 15. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on November 11, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e9c192c6-9f74-4beb-85ba-a42199e9794a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
