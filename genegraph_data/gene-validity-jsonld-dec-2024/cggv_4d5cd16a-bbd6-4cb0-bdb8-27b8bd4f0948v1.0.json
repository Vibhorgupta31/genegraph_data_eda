We generated npn-1 knockin mice, which express an altered ligand binding site variant of Npn-1, and npn-1 conditional null mice to establish the cell-type- and ligand specificity of Npn-1 function in the developing cardiovascular and nervous systems. Our results show that VEGF-Npn-1 signaling in endothelial cells is required for angiogenesis. In striking contrast, Sema-Npn-1 signaling is not essential for general vascular development but is required for axonal pathfinding by several populations of neurons in the CNS and PNS. Remarkably, both Sema-Npn-1 signaling and VEGF-Npn-1 signaling are critical for heart development. Therefore, Npn-1 is a multifunctional receptor that mediates the activities of structurally distinct ligands during development of the heart, vasculature, and nervous system.","dc:creator":"Gu C","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Neuropilin-1 conveys semaphorin and VEGF signaling during neural and cardiovascular development."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:4d5cd16a-bbd6-4cb0-bdb8-27b8bd4f0948_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d5cd16a-bbd6-4cb0-bdb8-27b8bd4f0948_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:7334e67a-51b2-41ec-af24-7dd13280f157_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7334e67a-51b2-41ec-af24-7dd13280f157","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Hours","ageValue":36,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ca47b3af-f1c9-4bfa-be49-8de036f2b996","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003873.7(NRP1):c.248+2T>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10575736"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Reduced length of neck; died 36 hours after birth due to hemodynamic instability","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0025668","obo:HP_0001660","obo:HP_0001561","obo:HP_0000028","obo:HP_0030148"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:78535852-bc16-4000-8d65-7e7ee3f3aa4f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ca47b3af-f1c9-4bfa-be49-8de036f2b996"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25713110"},"rdfs:label":"A: Consang. & homozygous for p.Asp25GlyfsTer25"},{"id":"cggv:78535852-bc16-4000-8d65-7e7ee3f3aa4f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78535852-bc16-4000-8d65-7e7ee3f3aa4f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:78535852-bc16-4000-8d65-7e7ee3f3aa4f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Lymphoblast analysis showed that neuropilin was non-detectable in mutant cells.

One variant (frameshift) that has been reported in one proband with persistent truncus arteriosus in one publication (PMID: 25713110) is included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (a mouse model; PMID: 12852851). In the mouse model, the mutant mice exhibit ventricular septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, and anomalous origin of the coronary arteries. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
