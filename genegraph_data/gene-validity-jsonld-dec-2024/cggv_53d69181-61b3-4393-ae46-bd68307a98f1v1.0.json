The exonuclease Trex1 regulates the DNA-sensing pathway by metabolizing potential DNA ligands that trigger it. However, an analogous mechanism for regulating the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that detect RNA remains unknown. We found here that the SKIV2L RNA exosome potently limited the activation of RLRs. The unfolded protein response (UPR), which generated endogenous RLR ligands through the cleavage of cellular RNA by the endonuclease IRE-1, triggered the production of type I interferons in cells depleted of SKIV2L. Humans with deficiency in SKIV2L had a type I interferon signature in their peripheral blood. Our findings reveal a mechanism for the intracellular metabolism of immunostimulatory RNA, with implications for specific autoimmune disorders.","dc:creator":"Eckard SC","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"The SKIV2L RNA exosome limits activation of the RIG-I-like receptors."},"rdfs:label":"Eckard_Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:53d69181-61b3-4393-ae46-bd68307a98f1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7294181c-fdcc-44f3-9e01-ba284e6fca13","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c258c0e4-12d7-4a01-9e1c-6f26dca34e59","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In knockout mice peripheral blood, B220+ B cells were completely lost, whereas CD3+ T cells were relatively unaffected.

Although databases report TTC37 as being the human ortholog of Ski3p, one of the yeast Ski-complex cofactors, this lead was not investigated in initial studies. The Ski complex is a multiprotein complex required for exosome-mediated RNA surveillance, including the regulation of normal mRNA and the decay of nonfunctional mRNA. Considering the fact that TTC37 is homologous to Ski3p, we explored a gene encoding another Ski-complex cofactor, SKIV2L, in six individuals presenting with typical syndromic diarrhea without variation in TTC37. We identified mutations in all six individuals. Our results show that mutations in genes encoding cofactors of the human Ski complex cause syndromic diarrhea, establishing a link between defects of the human exosome complex and a Mendelian disease.","dc:creator":"Fabre A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"SKIV2L mutations cause syndromic diarrhea, or trichohepatoenteric syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Fabre_4"},{"id":"cggv:4b2c2708-a206-4277-8628-c204f213cdaa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b2c2708-a206-4277-8628-c204f213cdaa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variant was downgraded due to homozygosity and consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f2fccf5f-eb66-42a7-964b-04896671654f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2fccf5f-eb66-42a7-964b-04896671654f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:5dd46ab7-e52a-439f-85a8-47dcee617029","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006929.5(SKIC2):c.3561_3581del (p.Leu1188_Gly1194del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915944179"}},{"id":"cggv:2bdcb366-0717-4f3a-8d8d-616f29d64ee0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006929.5(SKIC2):c.2479C>T (p.Arg827Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3729791"}}],"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing was performed to molecularly confirm trichohepatoenteric syndromic diagnosis","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000007","obo:HP_0008070","obo:HP_0030056","obo:HP_0002224"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:79a1f21d-a59f-4425-a1d3-6436641d6d25_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2bdcb366-0717-4f3a-8d8d-616f29d64ee0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34414925","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES) is a very rare disorder that is characterized by intractable congenital diarrhea, woolly hair, intrauterine growth restriction, facial dysmorphism, and short stature.

*SKIC2* gene is located on chromosome 6 at 6p21.33 and encodes the SKI2 subunit of superkiller complex, the cytoplasmic co-factor and regulator of the RNA-degrading exosome. *SKIC2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive trichohepatoenteric syndrome 2 in 2012 (Fabre et al., PMID: 22444670). Trichohepatoenteric syndrome 2 is characterized by intrauterine growth restriction, facial dysmorphism, hair abnormalities, intractable diarrhea, and immunodeficiency. Twelve variants (five nonsense, three frameshift, three missense, and one indel ) that have been reported in nine probands in two publications (PMIDs: 22444670, 34414925) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration of patient cells and an animal model (PMIDs: 25064072, 35658009). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SKIC2* and autosomal recessive trichohepatoenteric syndrome 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date April 23rd, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:53d69181-61b3-4393-ae46-bd68307a98f1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
