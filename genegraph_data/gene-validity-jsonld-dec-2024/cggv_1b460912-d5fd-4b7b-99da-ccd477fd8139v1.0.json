Additional recurrent features present in a minority of individuals have been upper eyelid ptosis and midline dermoid cysts of craniofacial structures. Assuming recessive inheritance, we mapped the locus in three families to chromosome 1 and identified mutations in ALX3, which is located at band 1p13.3 and encodes the aristaless-related ALX homeobox 3 transcription factor. In total, we identified seven different homozygous pathogenic mutations in seven families. These mutations comprise missense substitutions at critical positions within the conserved homeodomain as well as nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, all predicting severe or complete loss of function. Our findings contrast with previous studies of the orthologous murine gene, which showed no phenotype in Alx3(-/-) homozygotes, apparently as a result of functional redundancy with the paralogous Alx4 gene. We conclude that ALX3 is essential for normal facial development in humans and that deficiency causes a clinically recognizable phenotype, which we term frontorhiny.","dc:creator":"Twigg SR","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Frontorhiny, a distinctive presentation of frontonasal dysplasia caused by recessive mutations in the ALX3 homeobox gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Twigg_Subject 3"},{"id":"cggv:6b8749e5-2bfd-42c7-ba0e-d28b0ac5caa1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6b8749e5-2bfd-42c7-ba0e-d28b0ac5caa1_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6b8749e5-2bfd-42c7-ba0e-d28b0ac5caa1_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Radiographs display phenotype "}],"strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ed10e44a-69b6-407e-9526-f3f39eb3e82b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed10e44a-69b6-407e-9526-f3f39eb3e82b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:091e6b34-9136-4519-9046-375686ced6aa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006492.3(ALX3):c.642T>A (p.Tyr214Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341582103"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"slitlike nares. the very distinctive nasal swellings and bifid columella.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0005278","obo:HP_0000288","obo:HP_0000456"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:cd5638bd-790d-4931-aaad-5053f114fe1f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:091e6b34-9136-4519-9046-375686ced6aa"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22106187","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To (1) define the nasal, columellar, and lip deformities of 3 patients with characteristics consistent with frontorhiny; (2) illustrate the embryologic correlation of the oronasal findings to the development of the median nasal prominence; (3) report the clinical manifestation in 3 patients from 2 unrelated families; (4) report a novel Y214X mutation in ALX3 ; and (5) describe the surgical reconstruction.","dc:creator":"Pham NS","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Clinical and genetic characterization of frontorhiny: report of 3 novel cases and discussion of the surgical management."}},"rdfs:label":"Pham_Patient1"},{"id":"cggv:cd5638bd-790d-4931-aaad-5053f114fe1f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd5638bd-790d-4931-aaad-5053f114fe1f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5564c224-ad7b-4d78-9a4d-62b104002239_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5564c224-ad7b-4d78-9a4d-62b104002239","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:de616b18-6a81-419b-b27f-0b288e778341","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006492.3(ALX3):c.604C>T (p.Gln202Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341582260"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"broad bifid nasal tip, widened prominent philtral ridge, ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000601","obo:HP_0000678"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a6bfa032-cb14-4fa7-a77f-ae4ee144340e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:de616b18-6a81-419b-b27f-0b288e778341"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29215096","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Frontorhiny is one of the two forms of mid-facial malformations characterized by ocular hypertelorism, wide and short nasal ridge, bifid nasal tip, broad columella, widely separated nares, long and wide philtrum and V-shaped hairline.

Later in evolution one of the paralogues, Alx3, was lost independently from at least three different vertebrate lineages, whereas Alx1 and Alx4 were consistently retained. Comparison of spatial gene expression patterns reveals that the three mouse genes have equivalent craniofacial expression to the two chick and frog genes, suggesting that redundancy compensated for gene loss. We suggest that multiple independent loss of one Alx gene was predisposed by extensive and persistent overlap in gene expression between Alx paralogues.

Supplemental maternal intake of folic acid before and during pregnancy reduces their incidence significantly, but the mechanism underlying this preventive effect is unknown. As a number of genes that cause neural tube closure defects encode transcriptional regulators in mice, one possibility is that folic acid could induce the expression of transcription factors to compensate for the primary genetic defect. We report that folic acid is required in mouse embryos for the specific expression of the homeodomain gene Alx3 in the head mesenchyme, an important tissue for cranial neural tube closure. Alx3-deficient mice exhibit increased failure of cranial neural tube closure and increased cell death in the craniofacial region, two effects that are also observed in wild type embryos developing in the absence of folic acid. Folic acid cannot prevent these defects in Alx3-deficient embryos, indicating that one mechanism of folic acid action is through induced expression of Alx3. Thus, Alx3 emerges as a candidate gene for human neural tube defects and reveals the existence of induced transcription factor gene expression as a previously unknown mechanism by which folic acid prevents neural tube closure defects.","dc:creator":"Lakhwani S","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Alx3-deficient mice exhibit folic acid-resistant craniofacial midline and neural tube closure defects."},"rdfs:label":"Importance of Alx3 for cranial neural tube closure and midli"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5833,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ac46e8e7-15eb-4708-a4f3-0f7cdce2b4ba","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007636","gene":"hgnc:449","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"ALX3 has been repeatedly described in association with autosomal recessive Frontonasal dysplasia 1 also known as Frontorhiny.
