Since this metabolic pathway is disrupted, the substrates are unable to be processed and each accumulate in tissues or in the urine as demonstrated with every human proband with CMAMMA. Unlike other methylmalonic acidurias, such as those caused by MMAA, the MMA/MA ratio is still typical to what you would see in a control proband. Other potentially harmful phenotypes have been observed in probands with CMAMMA, however the biochemical abnormality is the only phenotype linking each proband known.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846720","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The objective of this study was to identify a source of intramitochondrial malonyl-CoA that could be used for de novo fatty acid synthesis in mammalian mitochondria. Because mammalian mitochondria lack an acetyl-CoA carboxylase capable of generating malonyl-CoA inside mitochondria, the possibility that malonate could act as a precursor was investigated. Although malonyl-CoA synthetases have not been identified previously in animals, interrogation of animal protein sequence databases identified candidates that exhibited sequence similarity to known prokaryotic forms. The human candidate protein ACSF3, which has a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, was cloned, expressed, and characterized as a 65-kDa acyl-CoA synthetase with extremely high specificity for malonate and methylmalonate. An arginine residue implicated in malonate binding by prokaryotic malonyl-CoA synthetases was found to be positionally conserved in animal ACSF3 enzymes and essential for activity. Subcellular fractionation experiments with HEK293T cells confirmed that human ACSF3 is located exclusively in mitochondria, and RNA interference experiments verified that this enzyme is responsible for most, if not all, of the malonyl-CoA synthetase activity in the mitochondria of these cells. In conclusion, unlike fungi, which have an intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA carboxylase, animals require an alternative source of mitochondrial malonyl-CoA; the mitochondrial ACSF3 enzyme is capable of filling this role by utilizing free malonic acid as substrate.","dc:creator":"Witkowski A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mammalian ACSF3 protein is a malonyl-CoA synthetase that supplies the chain extender units for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis."},"rdfs:label":"ACSF3 as a Malonate/Methylmalonate Synthetase"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"As ACSF3 encodes a malonyl-CoA synthetase protein, a loss-of-function in this gene would certainly result in the biochemical abnormalities observed in each proband (namely Malonic acidemia/uria and Mathylmalonic acidemia/uria).

Despite early specialist input, delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment initiation are common. Next-generation sequencing approaches still have limitations but are already enabling earlier and more efficient diagnoses in these patients. We designed a gene panel targeting 614 genes causing inborn errors of metabolism and tested its diagnostic efficacy in a paediatric cohort of 30 undiagnosed patients presenting with variable neurometabolic phenotypes. Genetic defects that could, at least partially, explain observed phenotypes were identified in 53% of cases. Where biochemical abnormalities pointing towards a particular gene defect were present, our panel identified diagnoses in 89% of patients. Phenotypes attributable to defects in more than one gene were seen in 13% of cases. The ability of in silico tools, including structure-guided prediction programmes to characterize novel missense variants were also interrogated. Our study expands the genetic, clinical and biochemical phenotypes of well-characterized (POMGNT1, TPP1) and recently identified disorders (PGAP2, ACSF3, SERAC1, AFG3L2, DPYS).

At least 19 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and some experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 26 probands in six publications (PMIDs: 21785126, 26915364, 30740739, 26827111, 27604308, 21841779). All of these probands show evidence of the biochemical abnormalities characteristic of this disorder, however many of them do not demonstrate any additional phenotypic abnormalities. Additionally, many of these variants have high population frequencies that would not befit a deleterious function when affected as well as a high recorded pLOF (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000176715). As such, this disorder has been asserted to be a benign metabolic phenotype in the literature (PMIDs: 21841779, 30740739). Functional studies into the effects of these variants in vitro or to determine any residual enzyme activity have not yet been performed.\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with disruption of the encoded mitochondrial malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase causing a backup in intramitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and resulting buildup of malonic and methylmalonic acid in urine and tissues. \nThis gene-disease association is supported by functional studies performed on patient tissue, with MMA production significantly lowered in patient fibroblasts compared to controls and the expression of WT ACSF3 cDNA, but not GFP, rescuing the metabolic phenotype and returning the production levels to near the controls. A natural canine model exhibiting the deficency also exists with homozygous variants in this gene, although there are other unexplained severe neurological symptoms in the line as well.\nIn summary, ACSF3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive combined malonic and methylmalonic acidemia (CMAMMA). Although more functional data examining the residual activity of variants and more experimental data could be acquired, the evidence currently provided is sufficent and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b215e20c-7781-49a0-b473-9219cb07e0b9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
