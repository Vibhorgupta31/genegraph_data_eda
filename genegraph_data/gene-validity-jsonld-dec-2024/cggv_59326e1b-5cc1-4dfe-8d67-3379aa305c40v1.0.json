While recessive mutations in δ-sarcoglycan cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2F, dominant mutations in δ-sarcoglycan have been linked to inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The purpose of this study was to investigate functional cellular defects present in adult cardiac myocytes expressing mutant δ-sarcoglycans harboring the dominant inherited DCM mutations R71T or R97Q. This study demonstrates that DCM mutant δ-sarcoglycans can be stably expressed in adult rat cardiac myocytes and traffic similarly to wild-type δ-sarcoglycan to the plasma membrane, without perturbing assembly of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. However, expression of DCM mutant δ-sarcoglycan in adult rat cardiac myocytes is sufficient to alter cardiac myocyte plasma membrane stability in the presence of mechanical strain. Upon cyclical cell stretching, cardiac myocytes expressing mutant δ-sarcoglycan R97Q or R71T have increased cell-impermeant dye uptake and undergo contractures at greater frequencies than myocytes expressing normal δ-sarcoglycan. Additionally, the R71T mutation creates an ectopic N-linked glycosylation site that results in aberrant glycosylation of the extracellular domain of δ-sarcoglycan. Therefore, appropriate glycosylation of δ-sarcoglycan may also be necessary for proper δ-sarcoglycan function and overall dystrophin-glycoprotein complex function.

A p.S151A missense mutation in exon 6 of the Sgcd gene was reported to cause severe isolated autosomal dominant DCM without affecting skeletal muscle. This is controversial to our previous findings in a large consanguineous family where this p.S151A mutation showed no relevance for cardiac disease. In this study, the potential of the p.S151A mutation to cause DCM was investigated by using two different approaches: (1) engineering and characterization of heterozygous knock-in (S151A-) mice carrying the p.S151A mutation and (2) evaluation of the potential of adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9-based cardiac-specific transfer of p.S151A-mutated Sgcd cDNA to rescue the cardiac phenotype in Sgcd-deficient (Sgcd-null) mice as it has been demonstrated for intact, wild-type Sgcd cDNA. Heterozygous S151A knock-in mice developed a rather mild phenotype of cardiomyopathy. Increased heart to body weight suggests cardiac enlargement in 1-year-old S151A knock-in mice. However, at this age cardiac function, assessed by echocardiography, is maintained and histopathology completely absent. Myocardial expression of p.S151A cDNA, similar to intact Sgcd cDNA, restores cardiac function, although not being able to prevent myocardial histopathology in Sgcd-null mice completely. Our results suggest that the p.S151A mutation causes a mild, subclinical phenotype of cardiomyopathy, which is prone to be overseen in patients carrying such sequence variants.

A breakpoint causing genomic deletion was found to be located at 6.1 kb 5' upstream of the second exon of delta-SG gene, and its 5' upstream region of more than 27.4 kb, including the authentic first exon of delta-SG gene, was deleted. This deletion included the major transcription initiation site, resulting in a deficiency of delta-SG transcripts with the consequent loss of delta-SG protein in all the CM hamsters, despite the fact that the protein coding region of delta-SG starting from the second exon was conserved in all the CM hamsters. We elucidated the molecular interaction of dystrophin-associated glycoproteins including delta-SG, by using an in vitro pull-down study and ligand overlay assay, which indicates the functional role of delta-SG in stabilizing sarcolemma.

Hypothesizing that DCM is a disease of the cytoskeleton and sarcolemma, we have focused on candidate genes whose products are found in these structures. Here we report the screening of the human delta-sarcoglycan gene, a member of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, by single-stranded DNA conformation polymorphism analysis and by DNA sequencing in patients with DCM. Mutations affecting the secondary structure were identified in one family and two sporadic cases, whereas immunofluorescence analysis of myocardium from one of these patients demonstrated significant reduction in delta-sarcoglycan staining. No skeletal muscle disease occurred in any of these patients.

We detected a novel mutation, Arg71Thr, in the delta-sarcoglycan gene in two members of a small DCM family. One of the mutation carriers fulfills diagnostic criteria for DCM and is also symptomatic. The other mutation carrier has slightly dilated left ventricle and well preserved systolic function. Therefore carriers of the Arg71Thr mutation had a relatively mild phenotype and a late onset of the disease. Disease-associated mutations were not found in the desmin gene or the metavinculin-specific exon of the vinculin gene.

From 1072 serial autopsy subjects, cases with unexplained minimal inflammatory foci, the extent of which was under 1% of the whole examined ventricle, were extracted to exclude cases with borderline/focal myocarditis resulting from local, systemic infection, or autoimmune mechanisms. Immunohistochemistry and genetic analysis targeting viral genomes and heart disease-related genes using next generation sequencing were performed. We detected 10 cases with unexplained minimal inflammatory foci (five males, five females, aged 15-68 years). The cause and/or manner of death were sudden unexpected death (6 cases, 60%), sudden unexpected death with epilepsy (1 case, 10%), drowning in a hot bath (1 case, 10%), and suicide (2 cases, 20%). In none of these cases was pathogen-derived DNA or RNA detected. In 8 of the 10 cases (80%), 17 possible pathogenic genetic variants causative for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy; DSP was the most frequently involved gene (three cases with two different variants), followed by LAMA4 and MYBPC3 (two cases, two variants for each gene), LDB3 (two cases, one variant), and the remaining 10 variants occurred in seven cases (DSC2, RYR2, SOS1, SCN5A, SGCD, LPL, PKP2, MYH11, GATA6, and DSG2). All mutations were missense mutations. DSP_Lys1581Glu and DSC2_p.Thr275Met were classified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics consensus statement guidelines as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in three patients (30%). The remaining 15 variants were classified as potentially pathogenic variants. Unexplained minimal inflammatory foci may be an early sign of inherited cardiomyopathy, and such cases might already have arrhythmogenic potential that can lead to sudden unexpected death. Detection of minimal inflammatory foci by careful pathological examination may indicate the value of conducting comprehensive genetic analysis, even if significant structural abnormalities are not evident.","dc:creator":"Hata Y","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Minimal inflammatory foci of unknown etiology may be a tentative sign of early stage inherited cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31024045","rdfs:label":"Case 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No DCM Phenotype.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least 10 (6 missense variants, one deletion and three intronic polymorphisms) have been reported in humans. Though all but one of these variants (R71T) are found too commonly to explain disease. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 7 publications (Tsubata et al, 2000, PMID: 10974018; Karkkainen et al, 2003, PMID: 14564412;  Sylvius et al, 2003, PMID: 12794684; Baydar et al, 2016, PMID: 27488758; Bauer et al, 2009, PMID: 19259135; Chen et al, 2015, PMID: 26720722; Hata et al, 2019, PMID: 31024045). A variant (S151A) in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. However, the S151A variant occurs too frequently to explain disease and alternative genetic causes of disease in the family were not ruled out. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least one case-control study (Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID: 31983221) at the aggregate variant level. There was no enrichment of SGCD found in the DCM cohort compared to controls (p=0.74). In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by multiple animal models (hamster, mouse and drosophila), expression studies, and rescue studies in two mouse models. SGCD has also been implicated in autosomal recessive Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) which has been assessed separately (definitive, April 14, 2020). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of SGCD with autosomal dominant DCM.
