TUBG1 encodes gamma-tubulin that forms the gamma-tubulin ring complex (g-TuRC) along with other protein to serve as a scaffold for formation of microtubules by alpha and beta tubulin. TUBA1A and TUBB2B have been associated with pachygyria. Therefore, the function of TUBG1 is shared with other known genes in the disease of interest.

Recent structural work has shed light on the mechanism of γTuRC-based microtubule nucleation, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that the γTuRC functions as a microtubule template. The first crystallographic analysis of a non-γ-tubulin γTuRC component (γ-tubulin complex protein 4 (GCP4)) has resulted in a new appreciation of the relationships among all γTuRC proteins, leading to a refined model of their organization and function. The structures have also suggested an unexpected mechanism for regulating γTuRC activity via conformational modulation of the complex component GCP3. New experiments on γTuRC localization extend these insights, suggesting a direct link between its attachment at specific cellular sites and its activation.","dc:creator":"Kollman JM","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Microtubule nucleation by γ-tubulin complexes."},"rdfs:label":"TUBG1 and Predominant Pachygyria/Agyria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c39a9dbc-0983-4918-a7c3-2886050a1f7a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae08d063-37b0-4672-a939-b6168d09eee2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Same phenotype in human disease (lissencephaly)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23603762","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The genetic causes of malformations of cortical development (MCD) remain largely unknown.

We found a frequent recurrence of mutations in DYNC1H1, implying that this gene is a major locus for unexplained MCD. We further show that the mutations in KIF5C, KIF2A and DYNC1H1 affect ATP hydrolysis, productive protein folding and microtubule binding, respectively. In addition, we show that suppression of mouse Tubg1 expression in vivo interferes with proper neuronal migration, whereas expression of altered γ-tubulin proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupts normal microtubule behavior. Our data reinforce the importance of centrosomal and microtubule-related proteins in cortical development and strongly suggest that microtubule-dependent mitotic and postmitotic processes are major contributors to the pathogenesis of MCD.","dc:creator":"Poirier K","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in TUBG1, DYNC1H1, KIF5C and KIF2A cause malformations of cortical development and microcephaly."},"rdfs:label":"Gamma tubulin synthesis (in vitro)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:f773acb3-c59f-4c34-90f7-b5396b2dbfac_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d3106d2d-eb93-479a-bc89-1f3d8ccc19b3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f54f779-1f6f-483f-b866-51e9ae5e2d4c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Plus end binding protein EB3-GFP constructs demonstrated decreased polymerization rate for disease causing mutants.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31086189","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"De novo heterozygous missense variants in the γ-tubulin gene TUBG1 have been linked to human malformations of cortical development associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy.

Pathogenic variants in TUBG1 related to malformation of cortical development was first reported in 2013 in relation to autosomal dominant lissencephaly or pachygyria with microcephaly or dysgenesis of corpus callosum (PMID: 23603762). \n\nSince then at least ten missense variants, including one recurrent variant, have been reported in 15 individuals in five publications (PMIDs: 23603762, 29706637, 31151415, 33728335, 33453472) with latest one from 2021. In absence of truncating variants, the mechanism of disease is dominant negative. \n\nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (PMIDs: 21993292, 23603762, 31086189). In formation of microtubules, *TUBG1* interacts with *TUBA1A* and *TUBB2A* that are associated with complex brain malformation including lissencephaly. Additional mice models have shown association of *TUBG1* to cortical migration abnormalities that underlies pathophysiology of lissencephaly. As experiment evidence under model and rescue category exceeded the maximum of four points, variant specific experimental evidence from mouse model (PMID: 31086189) were used to provide additional support for functional evidence under genetic evidence. \n\nIn summary, *TUBG1* is definitely associated with autosomal dominant lissencephaly, supported by clinical and experimental evidence demonstrated over time.
