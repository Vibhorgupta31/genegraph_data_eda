We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs.

We generated a knock-in mouse in which a single amino acid residue, which controls desensitization, was mutated in the GluA2 (GluR2) receptor subunit (GluA2(L483Y)). This mutation was homozygous lethal. However, mice carrying a single mutated allele, GluA2(L483Y/wt), survived past birth, but displayed severe and progressive neurological deficits including seizures and, ultimately, increased mortality. The expression of the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 was decreased, whereas NMDA receptor protein expression was increased in GluA2(L483Y/wt) mice. Despite this, basal synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus were largely unaffected, suggesting that neurons preferentially target receptors to synapses to normalize synaptic weight. We found no gross neuroanatomical alterations in GluA2(L483Y/wt) mice. Moreover, there was no accumulation of AMPA receptor subunits in intracellular compartments, suggesting that folding and assembly of AMPA receptors are not affected by this mutation. Interestingly, EPSC paired pulse ratios in the CA1 were enhanced without a change in synaptic release probability, demonstrating that postsynaptic receptor properties can contribute to facilitation. The dramatic phenotype observed in this study by the introduction of a single amino acid change demonstrates an essential role in vivo for AMPA receptor desensitization.","dc:creator":"Christie LA","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"AMPA receptor desensitization mutation results in severe developmental phenotypes and early postnatal lethality."},"rdfs:label":"Conditional knockin mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Altered channel missense mouse model leads to partial phenotype overlap, score reduced as the the mechanism of disease for L483Y is distinct from the loss of function seen in the GRIA2-clinical cases.

In GluR2 mutants, LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices was markedly enhanced (2-fold) and nonsaturating, whereas neuronal excitability and paired-pulse facilitation were normal. The 9-fold increase in Ca2+ permeability, in response to kainate application, suggests one possible mechanism for enhanced LTP. Mutant mice exhibited increased mortality, and those surviving showed reduced exploration and impaired motor coordination.

GRIA2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder with language impairment and behavioral abnormalities in 2019 (Salpietro et al., PMID: 31300657), and is characterized by intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder, speech impairment, developmental regression, Rett syndrome-like features such as head growth deceleration and stereotyped hand movements, and seizures or developmental epileptic encephalopathy. Other reported features include gait disturbances and inability to walk; dystonia; spasticity; joint laxity; hypotonia; ocular concerns; behavioral concerns including obsessive-compulsive behaviors, head banging, and self-injury; sleep disturbances; and cerebellar atrophy and other brain abnormalities. Onset of features occurs in infancy or childhood, and early development may be normal. Ten variants, including seven missense variants, one in-frame deletion and two frameshift variants that have been reported in 12 probands in three publications are included in this curation (PMID: 31300657; Zhou et al., 2021, PMID: 34899870; Latsko et al., 2022, PMID: 35534222). All of these variants occurred de novo and were absent from gnomAD. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression, biochemical function, and mouse models. There is neuronal expression of GRIA2 in brain regions. The glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunits encoded by GRIA1, GRIA3 and GRIA4 have also been associated with autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorders. Both homozygous knock-out mice and gain of function knock-in mice expressing a non-desensitising gria2 variant partially recapitulate some aspects of the clinical features (Uhlen et al., 2015, PMID: 25613900; Jia et al., 1996, PMID: 8938126; Christie et al., 2010, PMID: 20439731). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between GRIA2 and autosomal dominant GRIA2-neurodevelopmental disorder with language impairment and behavioral abnormalities. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 11.18.2022 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fd72c9ed-0236-406f-a18e-8d743c7f5827"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
