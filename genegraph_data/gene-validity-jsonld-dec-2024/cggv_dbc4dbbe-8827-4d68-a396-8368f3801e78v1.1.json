The cause for this variability is not understood. We report two patients from one family with highly divergent clinical course, one presenting neonatally with a fatal form and the other at age 45 with benign diet-responsive disease. The patients are compound heterozygous for two mutations of the CPS1 gene, c.3558 + 1G > C and c.4101 + 2T > C. The haplotypes containing each mutation are identical between the two patients, as are the sequences of CPS1 exons and flanking introns. Transcriptional experiments show that the abnormal CPS1 transcripts generated by both mutations are identical in these two patients. We characterize promoter and enhancer sequences of the CPS1 gene and find also in these regions no sequence differences between patients. Finally, we perform cloning experiments and find that in the neonatal-onset case, clones of messenger RNA (mRNA) expressed from the allele carrying the c.4101 + 2T > C mutation are threefold more than clones of mRNA from the allele with the c.3558 + 1G > C mutation, whereas in the adult-onset case the two types of clones are equal, indicating skewed expression towards the c.4101 + 2T > C allele in the neonatal case. Although we are yet to understand the mechanism of this differential expression, our work suggests that allelic imbalance may explain clinical variability in CPS1 deficiency in some families.","dc:creator":"Klaus V","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Highly variable clinical phenotype of carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 deficiency in one family: an effect of allelic variation in gene expression?"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19793055","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The patient is a compound heterozygote for two canonical splice site variants, both predicted to impact CPS1 function.

Various missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations occur in the CPS1 gene. In neonatal patients with homozygous CPS1 deficiency (CPS1D), urea cycle defects with resulting severe hyperammonemia can be fatal, though liver transplantation provides a complete cure for CPS1D. We performed Hep Par 1 immunostaining in the explanted livers of 10 liver transplant patients with CPS1D. Seven were negative for Hep Par 1 in the hepatocytes and the other three showed normal diffuse granular cytoplasmic staining. As expected, all three Hep Par 1-positive patients had at least one missense mutation, and all four patients who had only nonsense or frameshift mutations were Hep Par 1-negative. The other three patients were unexpectedly negative for Hep Par 1, even though each had one missense mutation. These results suggest that CPS1D can be related to the loss of Hep Par 1 reactivity due to the loss of protein production, a one amino acid substitution resulting in an abortive protein product, or both.

In treated males, plasma ammonia was well-controlled to day 100 (257.2 ± 5.1 μM), having only mildly increased from baseline day (114.5 ± 31.0); plasma ALT was not statistically different from the wild type mice.

Bi-allelic mutations of the CPS1 gene result in a urea cycle disorder presenting with hyperammonemia, often with reduced citrulline, and without orotic aciduria. CPS1 deficiency is particularly challenging to treat and lack of early recognition typically results in early neonatal death. Therapeutic interventions have limited efficacy and most patients develop long-term neurologic sequelae. Using transgenic techniques, we generated a conditional Cps1 knockout mouse. By loxP/Cre recombinase technology, deletion of the Cps1 locus was achieved in adult transgenic animals using a Cre recombinase-expressing adeno-associated viral vector. Within four weeks from vector injection, all animals developed hyperammonemia without orotic aciduria and died. Minimal CPS1 protein was detectable in livers. To investigate the efficacy of gene therapy for CPS deficiency following knock-down of hepatic endogenous CPS1 expression, we injected these mice with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAd) expressing the large murine CPS1 cDNA under control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. Liver-directed HDAd-mediated gene therapy resulted in survival, normalization of plasma ammonia and glutamine, and 13% of normal Cps1 expression. A gender difference in survival suggests that female mice may require higher hepatic CPS1 expression. We conclude that this conditional murine model recapitulates the clinical and biochemical phenotype detected in human patients with CPS1 deficiency and will be useful to investigate ammonia-mediated neurotoxicity and for the development of cell- and gene-based therapeutic approaches.","dc:creator":"Khoja S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Conditional disruption of hepatic carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 in mice results in hyperammonemia without orotic aciduria and can be corrected by liver-directed gene therapy."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue in conditional CPS1 knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2060b9ed-5e41-42bd-9cff-bad9d6c7dad4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:354141f0-6a98-43ea-a0ab-a57ae2a9c5a7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Human patients with CPS1 deficiency and knockout mice show marked elevations of plasma ammonia.

Variants in CPS1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1993 (Roshide et al., PMID 8486760). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in more than 20 probands in 8 publications (Hoshide et al, 1993, PMID 8486760; Haberle et al, 2003, PMID 12655559; Wakutani et al, 2004, PMID 15617192; Eeds et al, 2006, PMID 16737834; Klaus et al, 2009, PMID 19793055; Funghini et al, 2012, PMID 22173106; Yamaguchi et al, 2016, PMID 27150549; Choi et al, 2017, PMID 27834067). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for the disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (which catalyzes the first step of the urea cycle) (Jackson et al, 1986, PMID 3545062), knock out and conditional knockout mouse models (Schofield et al, 1999, PMID 9862865; Khoja et al, 2018, PMID 29801986), and gene therapy rescue in mouse models (Khoja et al, 2018, PMID 29801986). In summary, CPS1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dbc4dbbe-8827-4d68-a396-8368f3801e78"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
