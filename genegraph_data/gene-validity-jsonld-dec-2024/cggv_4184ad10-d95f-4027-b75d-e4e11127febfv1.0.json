HIGM1 has been suggested to result from ineffective T-cell help for B cells. We and others have identified a novel, TNF-related activation protein (TRAP) that is exclusively expressed on the surface of stimulated T cells. TRAP, a type II transmembrane protein of M(r) 33,000, is the physiological ligand for CD40 (refs 5-8). Crosslinking of CD40 on B cells induces, in the presence of lymphokines, immunoglobulin class switching from IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE. Mapping of the TRAP gene to the X-chromosomal location q26.3-q27.1 (ref. 6) suggested a causal relationship to HIGM1, which had previously been assigned to Xq26 (refs 12-14). Here we present evidence that point mutations in the TRAP gene give rise to nonfunctional or defective expression of TRAP on the surface of T cells in patients with HIGM1.

The physiological importance of CD40L has been demonstrated by the fact that expression of defective CD40L protein causes an immunodeficiency state characterized by high IgM and low IgG serum levels, indicating faulty T-cell dependent B-cell activation. To understand the structural basis for CD40L/CD40 association, we have used a combination of molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The structure of the extracellular region of CD40L was determined by protein crystallography, while the CD40 receptor was built using homology modeling based upon a novel alignment of the TNF receptor superfamily, and using the X-ray structure of the TNF receptor as a template. The model shows that the interface of the complex is composed of charged residues, with CD40L presenting basic side chains (K143, R203, R207), and CD40 presenting acidic side chains (D84, E114, E117). These residues were studied experimentally through site-directed mutagenesis, and also theoretically using electrostatic calculations with the program Delphi. The mutagenesis data explored the role of the charged residues in both CD40L and CD40 by switching to Ala (K143A, R203A, R207A of CD40L, and E74A, D84A, E114A, E117A of CD40), charge reversal (K143E, R203E, R207E of CD40L, and D84R, E114R, E117R of CD40), mutation to a polar residue (K143N, R207N, R207Q of CD40L, and D84N, E117N of CD40), and for the basic side chains in CD40L, isosteric substitution to a hydrophobic side chain (R203M, R207M). All the charge-reversal mutants and the majority of the Met and Ala substitutions led to loss of binding, suggesting that charged interactions stabilize the complex. This was supported by the Delphi calculations which confirmed that the CD40/CD40L residue pairs E74-R203, D84-R207, and E117-R207 had a net stabilizing effect on the complex. However, the substitution of hydrophilic side chains at several of the positions was tolerated, which suggests that although charged interactions stabilize the complex, charge per se is not crucial at all positions. Finally, we compared the electrostatic surface of TNF/TNFR with CD40L/CD40 and have identified a set of polar interactions surrounded by a wall of hydrophobic residues that appear to be similar but inverted between the two complexes.","dc:creator":"Singh J","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"The role of polar interactions in the molecular recognition of CD40L with its receptor CD40."},"rdfs:label":"Singh protein interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downgrading from default of 0.5 pt to 0.25 pt as we have not yet curated the CD40 gene."},{"id":"cggv:78cd7eb6-be9c-4dec-a167-3f792bd8adfb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf29472e-f2c8-4cd3-b8cc-577dfbdbc5c3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"CD40 Ligand (CD40L) is transiently expressed on the surface of T-cells and binds to CD40, which is expressed on the surface of B-cells.

The binding site of CD40 is located in a crevice formed between two CD154 subunits. Charge complementarity plays a critical role in the CD40-CD154 interaction. Some of the missense mutations found in hereditary hyper-IgM syndrome can be mapped to the CD40-CD154 interface. The CD40 interaction area of one of the CD154 subunits is twice as large as that of the other subunit forming the binding crevice. This is because cysteine-rich domain 3 (CRD3) of CD40 has a disulfide bridge in an unusual position that alters the direction of the ladder-like structure of CD40. The Ser(132) loop of CD154 is not involved in CD40 binding but its substitution significantly reduces p38- and ERK-dependent signaling by CD40, whereas JNK-dependent signaling is not affected.

Finally, we demonstrate that the defects in antigen priming are likely due to the lack of CD154 expression and insufficient costimulation of T cells by CD80/CD86 interactions. Taken together, this study offers a basis for the increased susceptibility of patients with XHIM to certain opportunistic infections.","dc:creator":"Jain A","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Defects of T-cell effector function and post-thymic maturation in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Jain IL-12 secretion assays"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:4184ad10-d95f-4027-b75d-e4e11127febf_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d38e05d-26c3-4c13-9ab9-c01f43309001","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c5b4172-deee-4abf-985e-a09b6683dfb1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Cells obtained from 5 patients with X-HIGM with different pathogenic variants were used for rescue.

Previous attempts using retroviral gene transfer to correct murine CD40L expression restored immune function; however, treated mice developed lymphoproliferative disease, likely due to viral-promoter-dependent constitutive CD40L expression. These observations highlight the importance of preserving endogenous gene regulation in order to safely correct this disorder. Here, we report efficient, on-target, homology-directed repair (HDR) editing of the CD40LG locus in primary human T cells using a combination of a transcription activator-like effector nuclease-induced double-strand break and a donor template delivered by recombinant adeno-associated virus. HDR-mediated insertion of a coding sequence (green fluorescent protein or CD40L) upstream of the translation start site within exon 1 allowed transgene expression to be regulated by endogenous CD40LG promoter/enhancer elements. Additionally, inclusion of the CD40LG 3'-untranslated region in the transgene preserved posttranscriptional regulation. Expression kinetics of the transgene paralleled that of endogenous CD40L in unedited T cells, both at rest and in response to T-cell stimulation. The use of this method to edit X-HIGM patient T cells restored normal expression of CD40L and CD40-murine IgG Fc fusion protein (CD40-muIg) binding, and rescued IgG class switching of naive B cells in vitro. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineered nuclease-directed gene repair to restore endogenously regulated CD40L, and the potential for its use in T-cell therapy for X-HIGM syndrome.","dc:creator":"Hubbard N","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Targeted gene editing restores regulated CD40L function in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Hubbard rescue assays"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:9428dbb1-1655-4c1b-9081-e975178d9bf9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dfe372cb-2952-4b60-92fc-f8581d28be99","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"T cells derived from XHIM patients were rescued by inserting cDNA downstream of the endogenous CD40L promoter via TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9.

These mice exhibited no gross developmental deficiencies or health abnormalities and contained normal percentages of B and T cell subpopulations. CD40L-deficient mice did display selective deficiencies in humoral immunity; basal serum isotype levels were significantly lower than observed in normal mice, and IgE was undetectable. Furthermore, the CD40L-deficient mice failed to mount secondary antigen-specific responses to immunization with a thymus-dependent antigen, trinitrophenol-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (TNP-KLH). By contrast, the CD40L-deficient mice produced antigen-specific antibody of all isotypes except IgE in response to the thymus-independent antigen, DNP-Ficoll. These results underscore the requirement of CD40L for T cell-dependent antibody responses. Moreover, Ig class switching to isotypes other than IgE can occur in vivo in the absence of CD40L, supporting the notion that alternative B cell signaling pathways regulate responses to thymus-independent antigens.","dc:creator":"Renshaw BR","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Humoral immune responses in CD40 ligand-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Renshaw mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading from default score of 2 points to 1 point as this mouse model is said to exhibit \"no gross developmental deficiencies or health abnormalities.\" Therefore, the immunological phenotype matches, but they did not demonstrate a match of clinical phenotype."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2433,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:08d2f9b7-c289-4524-8342-3d5e5cb28442","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010626","gene":"hgnc:11935","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CD40LG was first reported in relation to X-linked hyper IgM (HIGM) syndrome in 1993 by multiple groups independently (Korthauer et al., PMID: 7679206; DiSanto et al., PMID: 8094231; Allen et al., PMID: 7679801; Aruffo et al., PMID: 7678782). CD40LG encodes the protein CD40 ligand, a transmembrane molecule found on T cells. HIGM syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by defective immunoglobulin class switch recombination. It is characterized by decreased levels of certain immunoglobulins including IgG, IgA, and IgE with normal or increased levels of IgM. These deficiencies increase susceptibility to severe and opportunistic infections that can be recurrent and life threatening. HIGM syndrome due to CD40 ligand deficiency occurs almost exclusively in males. Heterozygous females typically are asymptomatic with normal levels of immunoglobulins (PMID: 7518839), although rare cases of clinically affected female carriers have been reported when X chromosome inactivation is skewed (PMID: 9933119, 16311023). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 16 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc.) have been reported in at least 16 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 7679206, 8094231, 7679801, 7678782, 9933119, 15358621, 15997875). Many are loss of function variants, establishing this as the molecular mechanism of the condition. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, animal models, and rescue assays (PMID: 1280226, 7964465, 7882172, 26903548, 29847792, 33475257, 21285457). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (18 pts.) has been reached. In summary, CD40LG is definitively associated with X-linked recessive hyper IgM syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID Working Group on DATE (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4184ad10-d95f-4027-b75d-e4e11127febf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
