NFAT proteins share two well-conserved regions, the regulatory domain and the DNA binding domain. The N- and C-terminal ends are transactivation sites and show less sequence similarity, whereas their molecular functions remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a transcriptional repressor, interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2 (IRF-2BP2), which specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain of NFAT1 among the NFAT family members. IRF-2BP2 was described as a corepressor by inhibiting both enhancer-activated and basal transcription. Gene reporter assays demonstrated that IRF-2BP2 represses the NFAT1-dependent transactivation of NFAT-responsive promoters. The ectopic expression of IRF-2BP2 in CD4 T cells resulted in decreased interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 production, supporting a repressive function of IRF-2BP2 for NFAT target genes. Furthermore, NFAT1 and IRF-2BP2 colocalized in the nucleus in activated cells, and the mutation of a newly identified nuclear localization signal in the IRF-2BP2 rendered it cytoplasmic, abolishing its repressive effect on NFAT1 activity. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IRF-2BP2 is a negative regulator of the NFAT1 transcription factor and suggest that NFAT1 repression occurs at the transcriptional level.","dc:creator":"Carneiro FR","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2 is a new NFAT1 partner and represses its transcriptional activity."},"rdfs:label":"transcriptional co-repressor "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Demonstrated that IRF2BP2 is a partner of NFAT1, an important regulator of T cells activation and differentiation.

CVID is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous entity, primarily presenting as an antibody deficiency with low levels of serum IgG, IgA, and/or IgM, functional antibody deficiency, and recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections. In addition, non-infectious complications linked to underlying immune dysregulation are present in a subset of patients. One missense variant (Ser551Asn) has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 27016798), segregating in two additional affected family members. An additional patient with the IRF2BP2 c.1180A>C; p.Thr394Pro variant has been reported in an individual affected with CIVD in an abstract for the American college of allergy, asthma & immunology 2018 annual scientific meeting (Joseph 2018; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2018.09.308). This gene-disease association is supported by its role as a transcriptional corepressor, participating in the adaptive immune response by influencing the maintenance, production, and secretion of cytokines (PMID: 21576369), and the alteration of B-cell maturation found in patient cells (PMID: 27016798). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:025487e5-9447-4c7b-88ad-f650103e09cf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
