Here, we report the clinical, genetic, and functional characterization of four TNNC1 rare variants (Y5H, M103I, D145E, and I148V), all previously reported by us in association with DCM (Hershberger, R. E., Norton, N., Morales, A., Li, D., Siegfried, J. D., and Gonzalez-Quintana, J. (2010) Circ. Cardiovasc. Genet. 3, 155-161); in the previous study, two variants (Y5H and D145E) were identified in subjects who also carried MYH7 and MYBPC3 rare variants, respectively. Functional studies using the recombinant human mutant cTnC proteins reconstituted into porcine papillary skinned fibers showed decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development (Y5H and M103I). Furthermore, the cTnC mutants diminished (Y5H and I148V) or abolished (M103I) the effects of PKA phosphorylation on Ca(2+) sensitivity. Only M103I decreased the troponin activation properties of the actomyosin ATPase when Ca(2+) was present. CD spectroscopic studies of apo (absence of divalent cations)-, Mg(2+)-, and Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-bound states indicated that all of the cTnC mutants (except I148V in the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) condition) decreased the α-helical content. These results suggest that each mutation alters the function/ability of the myofilament to bind Ca(2+) as a result of modifications in cTnC structure. One variant (D145E) that was previously reported in association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that produced results in vivo in this study consistent with prior hypertrophic cardiomyopathy functional studies was found associated with the MYBPC3 P910T rare variant, likely contributing to the observed DCM phenotype. We conclude that these rare variants alter the regulation of contraction in some way, and the combined clinical, molecular, genetic, and functional data reinforce the importance of TNNC1 rare variants in the pathogenesis of DCM.","dc:creator":"Pinto JR","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Functional characterization of TNNC1 rare variants identified in dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21832052","rdfs:label":"C.4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Authors provide evidence in support of the variant having a functional impact (significantly increased Ca2+ myofilament sensitivity and decreased alpha-helical content).

Of the 19 mutations identified in 12 families, mutations in TPM1 (32%) and TNNT2 (21%) were the most commonly found.

Genetic mutations have long been considered to be associated with this disease. At present, mutations in over 50 genes related to DCM have been documented. This study was carried out to elucidate the characteristics of gene mutations in patients with DCM. The candidate genes that may cause DCM include MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, LMNA, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYPN, MYL3, TPM1, SCN5A, DES, ACTC1 and RBM20. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subsequent mutation confirmation with traditional capillary Sanger sequencing analysis, possible causative non-synonymous mutations were identified in ~57% (12/21) of patients with DCM. As a result, 7 novel mutations (MYPN, p.E630K; TNNT2, p.G180A; MYH6, p.R1047C; TNNC1, p.D3V; DES, p.R386H; MYBPC3, p.C1124F; and MYL3, p.D126G), 3 variants of uncertain significance (RBM20, p.R1182H; MYH6, p.T1253M; and VCL, p.M209L), and 2 known mutations (MYH7, p.A26V and MYBPC3, p.R160W) were revealed to be associated with DCM. The mutations were most frequently found in the sarcomere (MYH6, MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNC1, TNNT2 and MYL3) and cytoskeletal (MYPN, DES and VCL) genes.

Expression of recombinant TnC((E59D,D75Y)) in isolated rat cardiomyocytes induced a marked decrease in contractility despite normal intracellular calcium homeostasis in intact cardiomyocytes and resulted in impaired myofilament calcium responsiveness in Triton-permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Expression of the individual mutants in cardiomyocytes showed that TnC(D75Y) was able to recapitulate the TnC((E59D,D75Y)) phenotype, whereas TnC(E59D) was functionally benign.

Furthermore, computational analysis of TnC showed the Ca(2+)-binding pocket as an active region of concerted motions, which are decreased markedly by mutation D75Y. We conclude that D75Y interferes with proper concerted motions within the regulatory Ca(2+)-binding pocket of TnC that hinders the relay of the thin filament calcium signal, thereby providing a primary stimulus for impaired cardiomyocyte contractility.

Here, we evaluated the pathogenicity of a previously unreported sarcomeric gene variant identified in a pediatric patient with sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy, and we determined a molecular mechanism. Trio whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo missense variant in TNNC1 that encodes a p.I4M substitution in the N-terminal helix of cardiac troponin C (cTnC). Reconstitution of this human cTnC variant into permeabilized porcine cardiac muscle preparations significantly decreases the magnitude and rate of isometric force generation at physiological Ca2+-activation levels. Computational modeling suggests that this inhibitory effect can be explained by a decrease in the rates of cross-bridge attachment and detachment. For the first time, we show that cardiac troponin T (cTnT), in part through its intrinsically disordered C terminus, directly binds to WT cTnC, and we find that this cardiomyopathic variant displays tighter binding to cTnT. Steady-state fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy studies suggest that this variant propagates perturbations in cTnC structural dynamics to distal regions of the molecule. We propose that the intrinsically disordered C terminus of cTnT directly interacts with the regulatory N-domain of cTnC to allosterically modulate Ca2+ activation of force, perhaps by controlling the troponin I switching mechanism of striated muscle contraction.

The D73N mutation was engineered into the regulatory N-domain of cTnC in order to reduce Ca(2+) sensitivity of reconstituted thin filaments by increasing the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation. In addition, the D73N mutation drastically blunted the extent of Ca(2+) desensitization of reconstituted thin filaments induced by cTnI pseudo-phosphorylation. Compared to wild-type mice, heterozygous knock-in mice carrying the D73N mutation exhibited a substantially decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development in skinned ventricular trabeculae. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that median survival time for knock-in mice was 12 weeks. Echocardiographic analysis revealed that knock-in mice exhibited increased left ventricular dimensions with thinner walls. Echocardiographic analysis also revealed that measures of systolic function, such as ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), were dramatically reduced in knock-in mice. In addition, knock-in mice displayed electrophysiological abnormalities, namely prolonged QRS and QT intervals. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes isolated from knock-in mice did not respond to β-adrenergic stimulation.

The role of TNNC1 as a key component of the troponin complex has been demonstrated multiple times since the early 1970s (e.g., Spudich and Watt, 1971, PMID 4254541; Ebashi, 1972, PMID 4634985). The high expression levels of TNNC1 in the cardiac muscle have also been highlighted in several studies (e.g., Schreier et al., 1990, PMID 2250022), as is the case for the direct protein-protein interaction with Troponin I (encoded by TNNI3) and Troponin T (encoded by TNNT2) (e.g., Mogensen et al., 2004, PMID 15542288; Baryshnikova et al., 2008, PMID 18803402). Human evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, case-control and segregation data. At least 15 distinct variants have been reported in humans with DCM in the literature, and a significant case-control enrichment of rare non-truncating variants in TNNC1 was demonstrated using the Exome Aggregation Consortium cohort as a control cohort (Mazzarotto et al., 2020, PMID 31983221). The p.G159D variant was observed to segregate with DCM in a 5-generation family (Kaski et al., 2007, PMID 17977476), and the variant was studied functionally in human cardiomyocytes using the explanted heart from the proband of the Kaski et al. paper (Dyer et al., 2009, PMID 19808376) and from other carrier patients (Vikhorev et al., 2017, PMID 29093449). Functional evidence in support of the impact of p.G159D was presented in a large number of studies that used different types of in vitro assays between 2004 and 2013 (Mogensen et al., 2004, PMID 15542288; Mirza et al., 2005, PMID 15923195; Preston et al., 2006, PMID 17021793; Biesadecki et al., 2007, PMID 17446435, Robinson et al., 2007, PMID 17932326; Baryshnikova et al., 2008, 18803402; Memo et al., 2013, 23539503) and in one study entirely relying on in silico modeling (Dewan et al., 2016, PMID 27133568). Results obtained in these studies collectively demonstrate that the variant abolishes the relationship between the phosphorylation status of Troponin I and several properties that regulate myofilament function. Segregation and functional evidence using recombinant human mutant Troponin C were published also for p.Y5H, p.D145E, p.M103I and p.I148V (Pinto et al., 2011, PMID 21832052). These variants had previously been identified in 4/312 DCM patients by the same group (Hershberger et al., 2010, PMID 20215591). The p.Y5H variant was de novo in the DCM patient and observed to alter several myofilament function properties, and also p.I148V and p.M103I variants were shown to exert similar effects on myofilament properties. Conversely, the p.D145E variant was characterized by properties more typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, e.g. increased activation of the ATPase activity), and had also previously been studied in the context of HCM by the same group. In 2019, p.D145E was found in two siblings with DCM in compound heterozygosity with p.D132N, with each variant inherited from a parent and both parents being healthy (Landim-Vieira, 2019, PMID 32038292). The two variants p.E59D and p.D75Y were found in compound heterozygosity in a DCM patient, and functionally characterized together as well as in isolation (Lim et al., 2008, PMID 18212018). In all the analyzed contractility-related properties (Calcium sensitivity, % cell shortening, molecular motions), the p.D75Y variant had effects comparable to those observed in presence of both variants, while p.E59D was functionally benign and was later proposed as a modifier that exacerbates the effect of p.D75Y (Dweck et al., 2009, PMID 20371872). The variant p.Q50R was identified in multiple affected members of the family of a 30-year old proband with peripartum cardiomyopathy (van Spaendonck-Zwarts, 2010, PMID 20458010; van Spaendonck-Zwarts, 2014, PMID 24558114), and p.D3V was found in 1/21 patients in a small Chinese cohort (Zhao et al., 2015, PMID 26458567). The p.I4M variant was found to be de novo in a pediatric DCM patient sequenced with whole-exome sequencing alongside her parents, and was functionally characterized showing significant alterations to several myofilament properties compatible with DCM causation (Johnston et al., 2019, PMID 31748410). In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by additional in vitro functional assays and animal models. In a study from 2010, authors generated 20 TNNC1 variants — not clinically observed — that, based on their predicted effects on Calcium sensitivity were likely to result in different cardiomyopathies. The two variants p.E40A and p.I61Q resulted in having DCM properties, with myofilaments recapitulating the functional phenotype of clinically observed variants (Parvatiyar et al., 2010, PMID 20566645). Animal models comprise a knock-out Zebrafish recapitulating human DCM with high mortality and reduced heart rate (Ho et al., 2009, PMID 19609041), two models of mice carrying the p.D73N variant (not clinically observed but engineered to reduce myofilament Calcium sensitivity), where heterozygous mice recapitulate human DCM with ECG anomalies, sudden cardiac death and (in 25% mice) atrial thrombosis (McConnell et al., 2015, PMID 26379556; Shettigar et al., 2016, PMID 26908229), and knock-out tadpoles with severe DCM and almost imperceptible cardiac motion that the authors failed to rescue (Landim-Vieira, 2019, PMID 32038292). Previously mentioned human evidence in this last study (compound heterozygosity of p.D145E and p.D132N) was judged to be insufficient to demonstrate the existence of TNNC1-related autosomal recessive DCM. In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between TNNC1 and autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. In conclusion, TNNC1 is definitively associated with DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on July 10, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\nMultiple lines of evidence replicated over time","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6ad71467-74c0-4a7c-932d-c5ca5747e59e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
