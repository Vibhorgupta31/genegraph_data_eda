The autosomal recessive forms (LGMD2) constitute a genetically heterogeneous group with LGMD2A mapping to chromosome 15q15.1-q21.1. The gene encoding the muscle-specific calcium-activated neutral protease 3 (CANP3) large subunit is located in this region. This cysteine protease belongs to the family of intracellular calpains. Fifteen nonsense, splice site, frameshift, or missense calpain mutations cosegregate with the disease in LGMD2A families, six of which were found within La RÃ©union island patients. A digenic inheritance model is proposed to account for the unexpected presence of multiple independent mutations in this small inbred population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enzymatic rather than a structural protein defect causing a muscular dystrophy, a defect that may have regulatory consequences, perhaps in signal transduction.","dc:creator":"Richard I","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Mutations in the proteolytic enzyme calpain 3 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:86925075-3fea-401c-90b3-6b40b2b045ca_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:86925075-3fea-401c-90b3-6b40b2b045ca_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63e6f9ca-0c4f-448c-b0d2-31b87b79e634","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6fe3f375-8384-406b-840d-7d792c5c8c99","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"CAPN3 mRNA was detected in skeletal muscle by in situ hybridizations (multiple probes) during development stages and semi-RT-PCR in skeletal muscle.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9521867","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The developmental expression pattern of four human genes, three of which are involved in progressive muscular dystrophies, was investigated. The rationale for these experiments is that these patterns might provide useful information on the pathophysiology underlying these myopathies. Despite the presence of overlapping clinical signs, the spatiotemporal expression profiles of the corresponding genes differed widely. Transcripts of alpha-sarcoglycan (SGCA) were visible as soon as myotomes were formed, and constitute, together with titin transcripts, precocious muscular system landmarks. beta-sarcoglycan (SGCB) was initially transcribed in a ubiquitous manner, and, toward the second part of the embryonic period, became specific to striated muscle, heart, and the central nervous system. Whereas titin (TTN) transcription and translation seem to be coupled, for the sarcoglycans, translation seemed restricted to skeletal muscle. Calpain3 (CAPN3) RNA was found in only skeletal muscles during the fetal period. It was, however, present earlier in the whole heart, where it selectively disappeared. Finally, evidence for differentially spliced calpain3 variants in smooth muscles was also seen.

Most pathogenic missense mutations in LGMD2A affect CAPN3's proteolytic activity; however, two mutations, D705G and R448H, retain activity but nevertheless cause muscular dystrophy. Previously, we showed that D705G and R448H mutations reduce CAPN3s ability to bind to titin in vitro. In this investigation, we tested the consequence of loss of titin binding in vivo and examined whether this loss can be an underlying pathogenic mechanism in LGMD2A. To address this question, we created transgenic mice that express R448H or D705G in muscles, on wild-type (WT) CAPN3 or knock-out background. Both mutants were readily expressed in insect cells, but when D705G was expressed in skeletal muscle, it was not stable enough to study. Moreover, the D705G mutation had a dominant negative effect on endogenous CAPN3 when expressed on a WT background. The R448H protein was stably expressed in muscles; however, it was more rapidly degraded in muscle extracts compared with WT CAPN3. Increased degradation of R448H was due to non-cysteine, cellular proteases acting on the autolytic sites of CAPN3, rather than autolysis. Fractionation experiments revealed a significant decrease of R448H from the myofibrillar fraction, likely due to the mutant's inability to bind titin. Our data suggest that R448H and D705G mutations affect both CAPN3s anchorage to titin and its stability. These studies reveal a novel mechanism by which mutations that spare enzymatic activity can still lead to calpainopathy.","dc:creator":"Ermolova N","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Pathogenity of some limb girdle muscular dystrophy mutations can result from reduced anchorage to myofibrils and altered stability of calpain 3."},"rdfs:label":"CAPN3 R448H tg"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6f3ccab3-b6ca-428c-8be2-250e0373ef53","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:70badf4e-f2fc-4b55-8b3d-baa6543415bb","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Loss of CAPN3 D705G mutant protein expression and decreased wild-type CAPN3 protein in skeletal muscle.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21624972","rdfs:label":"CAPN3 D705G transgene"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e6535c43-0e00-4230-8078-4eccfe4371fd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57ca86de-527d-463e-aee2-2fe03c310931","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Elevation of IKBA staining in LGMD2A muscle and correlation with elevated apoptosis; transient IKBA overexpression induced apoptosis in control muscle cells.

Analyses of the segregation of markers flanking the LGMD2A locus and a search for CANP3 mutations were performed for 21 LGMD2 pedigrees from various origins. In addition to the 16 mutations described previously, we report 19 novel mutations.

The mutations are distributed along the entire length of the CAPN3 gene. Thus far, most mutations identified represent private variants, although particular mutations have been found more frequently.

The *CAPN3*  gene is located on chromosome 15q15.q and encodes multiple transcript variants. The longest transcript (NM_000070.3) is 3.5 kb long with 24 exons encoding an 821-amino acid protein. Additional transcripts, derived from alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoter have also been identified. More than 250 pathogenic variants reported in patients with autosomal recessive LGMD are recorded in ClinVar, more than 150 of them being predicted loss of function variants. Limb girdle muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive weakness in muscles including but not limited to the proximal muscles and affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdle which can lead to difficulty walking or complete loss of ambulation requiring wheelchair use. It is also accompanied by elevated serum creatine kinase and dystrophic and myopathic features.\nSummary of case level data (12 points): Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 7720071, 9150160,10330340). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 24 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, biochemical function, protein interaction, animal models, and rescue evidence. Calpain 3 (*CAPN3*) is a muscle-specific member of the calpain family Ca2+ dependent cysteine proteases and localizes to sarcomere in skeletal muscle (PMID: 9521867, 9777948,15138196, 10229226). Calpain 3 is activated by autolysis. Calpain 3 interacts with multiple skeletal muscle sarcomere and sarcolemma proteins, and many of which are cleaved by active Calpain 3 (PMID: 15138196, 15827562). While the known Calpain 3 substrate list is likely incomplete, Calpine 3 plays important functions in muscle calmodulin pathway, skeletal mTORC1 signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and apoptosis (PMID: 10229226, 25389288, 33308300). A number of mouse models by targeted knockout and gene trapping of *CAPN3*  are reported with phenotype and muscle histological defects similar to human patients with AR-LGMD (PMID: 33308300, 15138196). And rescue in mouse models are also reported (PMID: 16290124, 34514031).\nIn summary, the *CAPN3* -autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene-disease relationship is definitive. This is demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:86925075-3fea-401c-90b3-6b40b2b045ca"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
