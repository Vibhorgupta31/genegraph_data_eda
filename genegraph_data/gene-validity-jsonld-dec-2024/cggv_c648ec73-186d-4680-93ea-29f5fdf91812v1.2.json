By autozygosity mapping, we identified null mutations in the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 9 (ADAM9) gene in four consanguineous families with recessively inherited early-onset CRD. We also found reduced photoreceptor responses in Adam9 knockout mice, previously reported to be asymptomatic. In 12-month-old knockout mice, photoreceptors appear normal, but the apical processes of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells are disorganized and contact between photoreceptor outer segments (POSs) and the RPE apical surface is compromised. In 20-month-old mice, there is clear evidence of progressive retinal degeneration with disorganized POS and thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in addition to the anomaly at the POS-RPE junction. RPE basal deposits and macrophages were also apparent in older mice. These findings therefore not only identify ADAM9 as a CRD gene but also identify a form of pathology wherein retinal disease first manifests at the POS-RPE junction.","dc:creator":"Parry DA","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Loss of the metalloprotease ADAM9 leads to cone-rod dystrophy in humans and retinal degeneration in mice."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c648ec73-186d-4680-93ea-29f5fdf91812_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc2b6e8d-2247-43f2-8803-464ba47cb45d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc2b6e8d-2247-43f2-8803-464ba47cb45d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":48,"allele":{"id":"cggv:28664a8f-24e6-4779-a46f-2079bbda7d51","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003816.3(ADAM9):c.1130+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212861"}},"detectionMethod":"The proband and his family have been initially genotyped by linkage mapping using short tandem repeat markers across the genome.

In the present study myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, were shown to bind to immobilised, recombinantly expressed MDC-9 disintegrin domain (A9dis). Binding was divalent cation-dependent, being supported by Mn(2+) and Ca(2+). Adhesion of myeloma cells to A9dis was completely inhibited by an antibody to the alpha(v)beta(5) integrin but not by antibodies to other subunits. RGD-containing peptides had no effect on binding, suggesting that MDC-9 interacts with alpha(v)beta(5) in an RGD-independent manner. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, expressed alpha(v)beta(5) on the cell membrane.

Here we used oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) to assess the contribution of the metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM9 to ocular neovascularization in mice. Pathological neovascularization in both the OIR and CNV models was significantly reduced in Adam9(-/-) mice compared to wild-type controls. In addition, the level of ADAM9 expression was strongly increased in endothelial cells in pathological vascular tufts in the OIR model. Moreover, tumor growth from heterotopically injected B16F0 melanoma cells was reduced in Adam9(-/-) mice compared to controls. In cell-based assays, the overexpression of ADAM9 enhanced the ectodomain shedding of EphB4, Tie-2, Flk-1, CD40, VCAM, and VE-cadherin, so the enhanced expression of ADAM9 could potentially affect pathological neovascularization by increasing the shedding of these and other membrane proteins from endothelial cells. Finally, we provide the first evidence for the upregulation of ADAM9-dependent shedding by reactive oxygen species, which in turn are known to play a critical role in OIR. Collectively, these results suggest that ADAM9 could be an attractive target for the prevention of proliferative retinopathies, CNV, and cancer.","dc:creator":"Guaiquil V","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"ADAM9 is involved in pathological retinal neovascularization."},"rdfs:label":"ADAM9 enhances protelysis of membrane protein ectodomains"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This evidence has been scored separately from the other form of biochemical evidence as it shows a different aspect of Adam9 function that is potentially relevant to the disease process."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:c648ec73-186d-4680-93ea-29f5fdf91812_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:855fc65a-1fe3-45f6-8c84-2016aaf040c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46fcf572-89b6-49e4-b6c1-0c63aa39f0db","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The affected mice exhibit an abnormal gap between the RPE and the photoreceptor outer segment, which would normally be in contact (Figure 5B).

By genome-wide homozygosity mapping using SNP arrays and fine mapping of candidate regions, we assigned the gPRA candidate locus in this breed to canine chromosome 16. The respective region is syntenic with human chromosome 8 comprising the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 9 (ADAM9) gene. ADAM9 represents a strong candidate gene for canine retinal disease because mutations have previously been shown to cause autosomal recessively inherited human cone-rod dystrophy, a retinal disorder affecting photoreceptor function. Sequence analysis of ADAM9 in affected and carrier GITs revealed a deletion of exons 15 and 16 which alters the reading frame leading to a premature stop codon. This mutation was absent from 34 other dog breeds. A variable and, at times, very late onset of gPRA was confirmed in GITs by a relatively mild retinal degeneration at an advanced age. Hence, the identification of the genetic defect underlying gPRA in the GIT represents a suitable model for cone-rod dystrophy of humans, with superior potential to elucidate functional consequences of the recently described null mutations in the human ADAM9 gene.","dc:creator":"Kropatsch R","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Generalized progressive retinal atrophy in the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier is associated with a deletion in the ADAM9 gene."},"rdfs:label":"Canine model of Adam9 loss-of-function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"The model recapitulates the progressive visual loss of the human disease state and matches the mode of inheritance, while revealing the underlying pathology at the microscopic level."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5659,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d60ec125-a9c3-43ae-8b31-0f892f45e5aa","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0800398","gene":"hgnc:216","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"The *ADAM9* gene was first reported in relation to an inherited retinal dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, in 2009 (Parry et al., PMID: 19409519). Affected individuals with causal variants in *ADAM9* have since been identified in a second publication (PMID: 25091951), with cases generally showing onset in the first decade of life. Presenting phenotypes include a combination of reduced visual acuity, retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities, and decreased amplitude of both the rod- and cone-based electroretinogram responses. Additional features can include macular atrophy, attenuation of retinal blood vessels, optic disc pallor, peripheral retinal degeneration, subcapsular cataracts, and/or myopia. These cases with causal variants in *ADAM9* are specifically diagnosed with cone-rod dystrophy 9. To account for a spectrum of retinal phenotypes that may be caused by variants in this gene, and in accordance with the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, the disease entity used for this curation is ADAM9-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800398).\n\nSix suspected deleterious variants in *ADAM9* were scored as part of this curation (three nonsense and three affecting splicing), which have been collectively reported in six probands in three publications (PMID: 19409519, PMID: 25091951, PMID: 23661369). All probands were members of consanguineous families and were homozygous for the variant of interest. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function in *ADAM9*, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of the gene product. One large family with co-segregation of the genotype and phenotype among affected members was scored as part of this curation, (PMID: 11581183), while other segregation evidence was not included in this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression evidence that retinal pigment epithelium is one of the tissue types with highest levels of *ADAM9* mRNA (PMID: 30239781). Biochemical data similarly support a structural function in the retina by showing that the ADAM9 protein mediates cell adhesion through interaction with integrins (PMID: 11162558) and regulates ocular vascularization by enhancing proteolytic shedding of the ectodomains of membrane proteins involved in angiogenesis (PMID: 19273593). A canine model of biallelic *ADAM9* loss-of-function recapitulates the visual defects, retinal atrophy, and progressive nature of the human disease state (PMID: 20691256). A murine model of biallelic *Adam9* loss-of-function further recapitulates the reduced amplitudes of both cone- and rod-based electroretinogram responses (PMID: 19409519) and indicates an underlying adhesion defect at the interface between the retina pigment epithelium and the photoreceptor outer segment.\n\nIn summary, *ADAM9* is definitively associated with ADAM9-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on September 1st, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c648ec73-186d-4680-93ea-29f5fdf91812"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
