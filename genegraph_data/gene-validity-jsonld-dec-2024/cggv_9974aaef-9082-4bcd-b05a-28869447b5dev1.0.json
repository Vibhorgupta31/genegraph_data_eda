Cilia motility defects cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, MIM244400), a disorder affecting 1:15,000-30,000 births. Cilia motility requires the assembly of multisubunit dynein arms that drive ciliary bending. Despite progress in understanding the genetic basis of PCD, mutations remain to be identified for several PCD-linked loci. Here we show that the zebrafish cilia paralysis mutant schmalhans (smh(tn222)) encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 103 protein (Ccdc103), a foxj1a-regulated gene product. Screening 146 unrelated PCD families identified individuals in six families with reduced outer dynein arms who carried mutations in CCDC103. Dynein arm assembly in smh mutant zebrafish was rescued by wild-type but not mutant human CCDC103. Chlamydomonas Ccdc103/Pr46b functions as a tightly bound, axoneme-associated protein.

CCDC103 is an oligomeric outer dynein arm assembly factor that is tightly integrated within the ciliary axoneme (PMID: 25572396). Also, CCDC103 binds purified microtubules and, thus, participates in microtubule stabilization that facilitates dynein arm attachment and ciliary motility (PMID: 25572396).\n\nFive (missense and frameshift) variants that have been reported in four publications (PMIDs: 22581229, 25877373, 31273583 and 28790179) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. The variant c.31G>C (p.Ala11Pro) was detected in heterozygous state in one proband (PMID: 22581229). Therefore, we didn't give it any points for this gene-disease relationship. The CCDC103 p.His154Pro substitution is relatively common in the South Asian community and causes PCD that can be difficult to diagnose using pathology-based clinical tests (PMID: 28790179). ​​The disease consistently segregates in three consanguineous Pakistani families from a UK-based genetic isolate, providing two additional points for the genetic evidence.\n\nExperimental evidence also supports this gene-disease relationship. Immunofluorescence analyses of CCDC103 mutant human respiratory epithelial cells could detect mislocalization of the outer dynein arm heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9 as well as the outer dynein arm intermediate chain DNAI2. Instead of their localization along the entire length of the ciliary axonemes of healthy controls, DNAH5 and DNAI2 appeared restricted to the proximal part of the axoneme. Moreover, DNAH5 showed mis-localization to subapical cytoplasm and the perinuclear region. In a proband carrying *CCDC103* loss of function mutations, DNAH9 was completely missing, consistent with altered assembly of type-2 ODA complexes (PMID: 22581229). The mutant cells exhibit variable reduction in EM ODA arm structure ranging from apparently normal to complete ODA/IDA loss. Consistently, high speed video microscopic analysis showed variable degrees of ciliary paralysis, reduced ciliary beat amplitude, or loss of beat coordination. Western blot analysis revealed high expression levels of CCDC103 in sperm cells (PMID: 31273583). The ultrastructure of testicular sperms of an infertile patient carrying *CCDC103* biallelic mutations showed the absence of DA and DRC (PMID: 25601002). Fractionation of Chlamydomonas flagella demonstrates that Ccdc103/Pr46b is present in the flagella and remains tightly associated with NaCl extracted axonemes (PMID: 22581229). In Zebrafish schmalhans (smhtn222) mutants, injection of wild-type ccdc103 mRNA could rescue axis curvature, left-right asymmetry defects, and kidney cyst phenotypes, and also restored cilia motility. Mutant Ccdc103 mRNA not only failed to rescue but also increased the frequency of axis curvature defects (PMID: 22581229).\n\nIn summary, *CCDC103* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 17. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld overtime. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on December 8, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9974aaef-9082-4bcd-b05a-28869447b5de"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
