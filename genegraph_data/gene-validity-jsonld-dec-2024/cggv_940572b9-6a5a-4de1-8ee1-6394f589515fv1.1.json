Neither siRNA-mediated Stac3 knockdown nor plasmid-mediated Stac3 overexpression affected the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes as evidenced by increased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA and protein expression of myogenic markers including myogenin and myosin heavy chain. In contrast, Stac3 overexpression inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes as evidenced by decreased fusion index, decreased number of nuclei per myotube, and decreased mRNA and protein expression of myogenic markers. Compared to wild-type myoblasts, myoblasts from Stac3 knockout mouse embryos showed accelerated differentiation into myotubes in culture as evidenced by increased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA expression of myogenic markers. Collectively, these data suggest an inhibitory role of endogenous Stac3 in myoblast differentiation.

(2013) previously reported a homozygous p.Trp284Ser variant in STAC3 as the cause of Native American myopathy (NAM) in 5 Lumbee Native American families with congenital hypotonia and weakness, cleft palate, short stature, ptosis, kyphoscoliosis, talipes deformities, and susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). Here we present two non-Native American families, who were found to have STAC3 pathogenic variants. The first proband and her affected older sister are from a consanguineous Qatari family with a suspected clinical diagnosis of Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome (CFZS) based on features of hypotonia, myopathic facies with generalized weakness, ptosis, normal extraocular movements, cleft palate, growth delay, and kyphoscoliosis. We identified the homozygous c.851G>C;p.Trp284Ser variant in STAC3 in both sisters. The second proband and his affected sister are from a non-consanguineous, Puerto Rican family who was evaluated for a possible diagnosis of Moebius syndrome (MBS). His features included facial and generalized weakness, minimal limitation of horizontal gaze, cleft palate, and hypotonia, and he has a history of MH. The siblings were identified to be compound heterozygous for STAC3 variants c.851G>C;p.Trp284Ser and c.763_766delCTCT;p.Leu255IlefsX58. Given the phenotypic overlap of individuals with CFZS, MBS, and NAM, we screened STAC3 in 12 individuals diagnosed with CFZS and in 50 individuals diagnosed with MBS or a congenital facial weakness disorder. We did not identify any rare coding variants in STAC3. NAM should be considered in patients presenting with facial and generalized weakness, normal or mildly abnormal extraocular movement, hypotonia, cleft palate, and scoliosis, particularly if there is a history of MH.","dc:creator":"Telegrafi A","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Identification of STAC3 variants in non-Native American families with overlapping features of Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome and Moebius syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28777491","rdfs:label":"Older brother"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The proband is compound heterozygous for the recurrent Trp284Ser variant and a novel frameshift variant Leu255fs that generates a premature stop codon in exon 10 predicted to result in NMD.

At least nine unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, and intronic) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 20 probands in four publications (PMIDs:28411587, 23736855, 28777491, 30168660). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in eight additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function in myoblast differentiation (PMID: 24788338), its expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 23626854), and animal models in both zebrafish (PMID: 23736855) and mice (PMID: 23626854).
