The CREB binding protein (CBP) is an essential transcriptional coactivator for many different transcription factors. CBP has the intrinsic ability to acetylate histones and other proteins, which is regarded as an important step in transcription activation. In vitro studies have shown that this enzymatic activity critically depends on the integrity of a plant homeodomain (PHD)-type zinc finger in the HAT domain of CBP. We therefore investigated whether PHD finger mutations are present in RTS patients. Mutational analysis of 39 patients revealed eight novel heterozygous mutations in the HAT domain of CBP, one of which alters a conserved PHD finger amino acid (E1278K), while a second mutation deletes exon 22, which encodes the central region of the PHD finger. Functional analysis of these RTS-associated PHD finger mutants showed that they lacked in vitro acetyltransferase activity towards histones and CBP itself and displayed reduced coactivator function for the transcription factor CREB. Importantly, in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from the exon 22 deletion patient we found approximately 50% less endogenous CBP HAT activity. These findings therefore underscore the functional importance of the PHD finger in vivo and imply that reduction of CBP HAT activity, as exemplified here by disruption of the PHD finger, is sufficient to cause RTS.","dc:creator":"Kalkhoven E","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Loss of CBP acetyltransferase activity by PHD finger mutations in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Luciferase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The luciferase assay has been performed also with 911 cells stably transfected with a 5\u0003x Gal4-E1BTATA-Luc reporter (30), transfected with expression vectors for Gal4DBD fusions with full-length CBP (FL-CBP) and the other mutants (Figure 3)."},{"id":"cggv:5f1ab9c9-6045-4f36-8385-aa7c4007c886","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ba2f0af-a5d7-47a0-bbdd-3c8ad5e2b157","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Regulation of transcription is the central mechanism by which cells respond to developmental and environmental cues.

CBP is the causative gene of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS). To investigate the relationships between CBP HAT activity and RTS, we analyzed 16 RTS patients. A microdeletion was identified in one patient by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Heteroallelic mutations were identified in five patients by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing. These included a 2 bp deletion between nucleotides 4319 and 4320, an 11 bp deletion between nucleotides 4898 and 4908, a 14 bp insertion (CCTCGGTCCTGCAC) between nucleotides 5212 and 5213, a 2 bp deletion between nucleotides 5222 and 5223, and a missense mutation from guanine (G) to cytosine (C) at nucleotide 4951 that changed codon 1378 from CGG (arginine) to CCG (proline). The identical missense mutation was introduced into the recombinant mouse CBP. It abolished the HAT activity of CBP and the ability of CBP to transactivate cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB), in HAT assays and in microinjection experiments, respectively. These results suggest that the loss of the HAT activity of CBP may cause RTS, as the first example of a defect of HAT activity in a human disease. Our findings raise the possibility that treatment of RTS patients with histone deacetylase inhibitors might have beneficial effects.","dc:creator":"Murata T","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Defect of histone acetyltransferase activity of the nuclear transcriptional coactivator CBP in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Histone Acetyl Transferase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8280b2cc-951e-4950-a631-b924933a6cfe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b943e526-920f-4404-8c5f-70edf0578a80","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Regulation of transcription is the central mechanism by which\ncells respond to developmental and environmental cues.

RTS patients suffer from mental retardation, whereas long-term memory formation is defective in mutant CBP mice. A critical role for cAMP signaling during CREB-dependent long-term memory formation appears to be evolutionarily conserved. From this observation, we reasoned that drugs that modulate CREB function by enhancing cAMP signaling might yield an effective treatment for the memory defect(s) of CBP+/- mice. To this end, we designed a cell-based drug screen and discovered inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) to be particularly effective enhancers of CREB function. We extend previous behavioral observations by showing that CBP+/- mutants have impaired long-term memory but normal learning and short-term memory in an object recognition task. We demonstrate that the prototypical PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram, and a novel one (HT0712) abolish the long-term memory defect of CBP+/- mice. Importantly, the genetic lesion in CBP acts specifically to shift the dose sensitivity for HT0712 to enhance memory formation, which conveys molecular specificity on the drug's mechanism of action. Our results suggest that PDE4 inhibitors may be used to treat the cognitive dysfunction of RTS patients.","dc:creator":"Bourtchouladze R","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"A mouse model of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: defective long-term memory is ameliorated by inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4."},"rdfs:label":"PDE4 Inihibitors Ameliorate the Long-Term Memory Deficit"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5eb54a4f-e116-444f-867a-5a6382ccb4bf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c765f33-1149-4c11-adca-900373127473","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The most pronounced phenotype was delayed ossification of frontal bones (Fig. 2 A and B): an enlarged anterior frontanel was observed in two-thirds (14/21) of the heterozygous mutants, whereas this abnormality occurred in only one of 30 wild-type fetuses.
