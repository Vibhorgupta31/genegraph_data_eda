Depending on additional symptoms, WS is classified into four types: WS1, WS2, WS3 and WS4. WS1 and WS3 are caused by mutations in PAX3, whereas WS2 is heterogenous, being caused by mutations in the microphthalmia (MITF) gene in some but not all affected families. The identification of Slugh, a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed in migratory neural crest cells, as the gene responsible for pigmentary disturbances in mice prompted us to analyse the role of its human homologue SLUG in neural crest defects. Here we show that two unrelated patients with WS2 have homozygous deletions in SLUG which result in absence of the SLUG product. We further show that Mitf is present in Slug-deficient cells and transactivates the SLUG promoter, and that Slugh and Kit genetically interact in vivo. Our findings further define the locus heterogeneity of WS2 and point to an essential role of SLUG in the development of neural crest-derived human cell lineages: its absence causes the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in at least some individuals with WS2.","dc:creator":"Sánchez-Martín M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"SLUG (SNAI2) deletions in patients with Waardenburg disease."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c01d8d8-40a4-4b11-ad9c-8283bb937c55_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c01d8d8-40a4-4b11-ad9c-8283bb937c55_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:6dabbaa4-df1a-4ab8-be2b-79f55204e7b8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6dabbaa4-df1a-4ab8-be2b-79f55204e7b8","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:af80e817-1cf5-41cc-a0b6-74589448ab54","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NG_012130.1:g.(?_5165)_(7623_?)del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7503"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:dafec80f-db6d-415f-b810-5832d3515840_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:af80e817-1cf5-41cc-a0b6-74589448ab54"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12444107"},"rdfs:label":"Proband D"},{"id":"cggv:dafec80f-db6d-415f-b810-5832d3515840","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dafec80f-db6d-415f-b810-5832d3515840_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Same variant previously scored"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4c37daab-e5fa-4c67-9a83-63e577f47b49_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c37daab-e5fa-4c67-9a83-63e577f47b49","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:af80e817-1cf5-41cc-a0b6-74589448ab54"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:b42e8293-dbf6-436a-bf97-e538105abbb6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:af80e817-1cf5-41cc-a0b6-74589448ab54"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12444107"},"rdfs:label":"Proband B"},{"id":"cggv:b42e8293-dbf6-436a-bf97-e538105abbb6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b42e8293-dbf6-436a-bf97-e538105abbb6_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded 0.5 points for homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:9c01d8d8-40a4-4b11-ad9c-8283bb937c55_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c01d8d8-40a4-4b11-ad9c-8283bb937c55_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e09bb6e5-595f-4f64-bfdc-ce3f1cede0cd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f041e28-2b20-4889-98d2-ea9141c25006","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"Coexpression of MITF with SLUG promoter in front of luciferase reporter gene resulted in approximately three-fold increase in luciferase compared to empty vector, suggesting MITF interacts with SLUG promoter.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12444107","rdfs:label":"Sanchez-Martin Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9c01d8d8-40a4-4b11-ad9c-8283bb937c55_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:843ee511-24ec-414c-b6c6-7984352889c6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2449e703-0536-400d-870a-7749bfb93f96","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Slugh null mice had white spots on back.

A homozygous whole gene deletion has been reported in 2 probands in one study (PMIDs:12444107). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model demonstrating abnormalities in the vestibular organ and cochlea of Slug-null mice, and a luciferase assay suggesting that MITF interacts with the SNAI2 promoter (PMID: 12444107). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 12/19/2017 as per SOP v5. It was reevaluated on 10/31/2024 using SOP v11. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent an update in scoring to be consistent with SOP v11. New case level evidence has been reviewed but was not scorable, and the classification did not change (PMID: 30936914).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9c01d8d8-40a4-4b11-ad9c-8283bb937c55"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
