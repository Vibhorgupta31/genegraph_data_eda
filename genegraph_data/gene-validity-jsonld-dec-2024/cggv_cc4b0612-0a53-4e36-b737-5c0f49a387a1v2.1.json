Elevated platelet serotonin (5-HT) in 20%-25% of cases and efficacy of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating anxiety, depression, and repetitive behaviors points to the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT; SERT) as a strong candidate gene. Association studies involving the functional insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter (5-HTTLPR) and a polymorphism in intron 2 are inconclusive, possibly because of phenotypic heterogeneity. Nonetheless, mounting evidence for genetic linkage of autism to the chromosome 17q11.2 region that harbors the SERT locus (SLC6A4) supports a genetic effect at or near this gene. We confirm recent reports of sex-biased genetic effects in 17q by showing highly significant linkage driven by families with only affected males. Association with common alleles fails to explain observed linkage; therefore, we hypothesized that preferential transmission of multiple alleles does explain it. From 120 families, most contributing to linkage at 17q11.2, we found four coding substitutions at highly conserved positions and 15 other variants in 5' noncoding and other intronic regions transmitted in families exhibiting increased rigid-compulsive behaviors. In the aggregate, these variants show significant linkage to and association with autism. Our data provide strong support for a collection of multiple, often rare, alleles at SLC6A4 as imposing risk of autism.","dc:creator":"Sutcliffe JS","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Allelic heterogeneity at the serotonin transporter locus (SLC6A4) confers susceptibility to autism and rigid-compulsive behaviors."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15995945","rdfs:label":"Ile425Leu"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Missense variant without supporting functional evidence.

Here, we document functional perturbations of three of these variants: Ile425Leu; Phe465Leu; and Leu550Val. In transiently transfected HeLa cells, the three variants confer a gain of 5-HT transport phenotype.

Unlike Gly56Ala, mutants Ile425Leu, Phe465Leu and Leu550Val retain a capacity for acute PKG and p38 MAPK regulation. However, both Gly56Ala and Ile425Leu demonstrate markedly reduced sensitivity to PP2A antagonists, suggesting that deficits in trafficking and catalytic modulation may derive from a common basis in perturbed phosphatase regulation.

Although SSRIs elevate brain serotonergic neurotransmission acutely, their full therapeutic effects involve neurochemical adaptations that emerge following chronic drug administration. The adaptive downregulation of SERT has recently been implicated in the therapeutic response of SSRIs. Interestingly, studies using SERT-knockout mice reveal somewhat paradoxical depression-related effects, probably specific to the downregulation of SERT during early development. However, the behavioral significance of SSRI-mediated downregulation of SERT during adulthood is still unknown. We investigated whether somatic gene manipulation, triggered by infusing short interfering RNA (siRNA) into the ventricular system, would enable the downregulation of SERT in the adult mouse brain. Infusing the SERT-targeting siRNA, for 2 weeks, significantly reduced the mRNA levels of SERT in raphe nuclei. Further, a significant, specific and widespread downregulation of SERT-binding sites was achieved in the brain. In contrast, 2-week infusion of the SSRI, citalopram, produced a widespread downregulation of SERT-binding sites, independent of any alterations at the mRNA level. Irrespective of their mechanisms for downregulating SERT in the brain, infusions of SERT-siRNA or citalopram elicited a similar antidepressant-related behavioral response in the forced swim test. These results signify a role for the downregulation of SERT in mediating the antidepressant action of SSRIs in adults. Further, these data demonstrate that siRNA-induced widespread knockdown of gene expression serves as a powerful tool for assessing the function of endogenous genes in the adult brain.","dc:creator":"Thakker DR","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"siRNA-mediated knockdown of the serotonin transporter in the adult mouse brain."},"rdfs:label":"siRNA knock down"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"NA, knock down model with gain of function mutant, somewhat paradoxical depression-related effects,"},{"id":"cggv:4caffd34-22d8-4420-9379-9e712e1bb552","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:25fb8c1c-aa28-40cd-997a-9e2e188333ac","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"change of anxiety level","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16943551","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"A commonly occurring polymorphic variant of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter (5-HTT) gene that increases 5-HTT expression has been associated with reduced anxiety levels in human volunteer and patient populations.

Here we test this hypothesis by measuring the neurochemical and behavioral characteristics of a mouse genetically engineered to overexpress the 5-HTT. Transgenic mice overexpressing the human 5-HTT (h5-HTT) were produced from a 500 kb yeast artificial chromosome construct. These transgenic mice showed the presence of h5-HTT mRNA in the midbrain raphe nuclei, as well as a twofold to threefold increase in 5-HTT binding sites in the raphe nuclei and a range of forebrain regions. The transgenic mice had reduced regional brain whole-tissue levels of 5-HT and, in microdialysis experiments, decreased brain extracellular 5-HT, which reversed on administration of the 5-HTT inhibitor paroxetine. Compared with wild-type mice, the transgenic mice exhibited a low-anxiety phenotype in plus maze and hyponeophagia tests. Furthermore, in the plus maze test, the low-anxiety phenotype of the transgenic mice was reversed by acute administration of paroxetine, suggesting a direct link between the behavior, 5-HTT overexpression, and low extracellular 5-HT.
