MIB1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes endocytosis of the NOTCH ligands DELTA and JAGGED. Notch signaling is a key player in endocardium–myocardium communication. Notch is required for the expression of signaling pathways required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation during trabeculation (D’Amato et al, 2016, 27260948). In total 8 variants have been published in HGMD professional (As of November 2019) in patients with cardiomyopathy (noncompaction cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and isolated left ventricular dysfunction) but without clear signs of dilated cardiomyopathy (Luxan et al, 2013, PMID: 23314057; van Velzen et al, 2017, PMID: 28794111; van Velzen et al, 2018, PMID: 29661763; van Waning et al, 2018, PMID: 29447731; Hazebroek et al, 2018, PMID: 29540472). Seven of them were potential loss of function (LoF) variants (i.e. non-sense, frameshift or potential splice site) and in 4 of them the index patient also carried a second variant (3x LoF in TTN and 1x MYH7 missense) (van Velzen et al, 2017, PMID: 28794111; van Velzen et al, 2018, PMID: 29661763; van Waning et al, 2018, PMID: 29447731). Luxan et al showed co-segregation with the noncompaction phenotype in two families (NM_020774.2(MIB1):c.2827G>T; p.(Val943Phe) and NM_020774.3(MIB1):c.1588C>T; p.(Arg530*), respectively) (2013, PMID: 23314057). Both variants were functionally analyzed in HEK292 cells and zebrafish embryos and showed clear aberrations. However, the missense and the nonsense variant were found 45 and 13 times in about 282000 gnomAD alleles. In addition, LoF variants occur relatively often in gnomAD (more often that you would predict by change) (http://gnomAD.broadinstitute.org). The gnomAD data make the causal relation between variants in MIB1 and cardiomyopathy questionable. So far no disease association with DCM has been published. Therefore, there is no supporting human genetic evidence demonstrating this gene-disease relationship in the literature at this time.  However, this gene-disease association has some supporting experimental expression data and animal model data. The MIB1 mRNA and protein are expressed in the heart (Jin et al, 2002, PMID: 12351649). In the mouse Luxán G et al used in situ hybridization to show that Mib1 is expressed in mouse endocardium and myocardium at embryonic day 9.5 (Luxan et al,2013, PMID: 23314057). Two cardiac specific Mib1 knock-out mouse models both had dilated heart with a thin compact myocardium and large, noncompacted trabeculae protruding toward the ventricular lumen. For the first model Nkx2.5-cre mice were used to knock out the Mib1flox/flox allele. In these mice cre is active in the endocardium and myocardium from E7.5 onward and they died at birth from valve dysfunction. For the second model cTnT-cre (also known as Tnnt2-cre) mice were used. In these mice cre is active from E8.0 onward in the myocardium. In addition, Mib1flox; cTnT-cre mice survive but showed a dilated heart with noncompaction and a significantly reduced ejection fraction (Luxan et al, 2013, PMID: 23314057, Captur et al, 2016, PMID: 27020702).\n. No convincing evidence for a casual role for MIB1  and autosomal dominant DCM has been reported. Although this gene-disease assertion is supported by experimental evidence, no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans   This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on November 8, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\nno reported evidence that variants in MIB1 can cause DCM","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d97cecce-b9a7-42fb-bc2d-034468094949"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
