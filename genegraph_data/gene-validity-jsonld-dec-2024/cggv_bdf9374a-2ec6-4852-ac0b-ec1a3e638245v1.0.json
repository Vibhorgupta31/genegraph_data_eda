Here we report defects in a third member of this biochemical pathway in still other patients with this disease. We screened 94 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant RP and 173 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive RP for mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. Five mutant sequences cosegregated with disease among four unrelated families with autosomal recessive RP. Two of these were nonsense mutations early in the reading frame (Glu76End and Lys139End) and one was a deletion encompassing most if not all of the transcriptional unit; these three alleles would not be expected to encode a functional channel. The remaining two mutations were a missense mutation (Ser316Phe) and a frameshift [Arg654(1-bp del)] mutation truncating the last 32 aa in the C terminus. The latter two mutations were expressed in vitro and found to encode proteins that were predominantly retained inside the cell instead of being targeted to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the absence or paucity of functional cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane is deleterious to rod photoreceptors and is an uncommon cause of RP.","dc:creator":"Dryja TP","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated channel in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdf9374a-2ec6-4852-ac0b-ec1a3e638245_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdf9374a-2ec6-4852-ac0b-ec1a3e638245_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:593a82be-ff74-4551-aff0-f6bf75462f8d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:99df84c1-e2fa-4519-9c1b-65d0e8c25cb7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The mice homozygous for p.Tyr509Cys were reported to show progressive retinal degeneration and photoreceptor loss from 8 weeks onwards.

Because of the broad spectrum of potential phenotypes, these cases with causal variants in *CNGA1* have been curated under the inclusive disease name *CNGA1*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800405).\n\nEight variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 06 probands (and their families) in 5 publications (PMIDs: 7479749, 23462753, 12362048, 15570217, 36115851) are included in this curation.
