Mutations in at least 14 genes underlie the various forms of NCL. One of these genes, CLN8, encodes an intrinsic membrane protein of unknown function that appears to be localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum. Most CLN8 mutations in people result in a form of NCL with a late infantile onset and relatively rapid progression. A mixed breed dog with Australian Shepherd and Blue Heeler ancestry developed neurological signs characteristic of NCL starting at about 8months of age. The signs became progressively worse and the dog was euthanized at 21months of age due to seizures of increasing frequency and severity. Postmortem examination of the brain and retinas identified massive accumulations of intracellular autofluorescent inclusions characteristic of the NCLs. Whole genome sequencing of DNA from this dog identified a CLN8:c.585G>A transition that predicts a CLN8:p.Trp195* nonsense mutation. This mutation appears to be rare in both ancestral breeds. All of our 133 archived DNA samples from Blue Heelers, and 1481 of our 1488 archived Australian Shepherd DNA samples tested homozygous for the reference CLN8:c.585G allele. Four of the Australian Shepherd samples tested heterozygous and 3 tested homozygous for the mutant CLN8:c.585A allele. All 3 dogs homozygous for the A allele exhibited clinical signs of NCL and in 2 of them NCL was confirmed by postmortem evaluation of brain tissue. The occurrence of confirmed NCL in 3 of 4 CLN8:c.585A homozygous dogs, plus the occurrence of clinical signs consistent with NCL in the fourth homozygote strongly suggests that this rare truncating mutation causes NCL. Identification of this NCL-causing mutation provides the opportunity for identifying dogs that can be used to establish a canine model for the CLN8 disease (also known as late infantile variant or late infantile CLN8 disease).

Therefore, the identification of DNA sequence variations in genes involved in this pathway and their association with human diseases would have a significant impact on health. To this aim, we developed Lysoplex, a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach, which allowed us to obtain a uniform and accurate coding sequence coverage of a comprehensive set of 891 genes involved in lysosomal, endocytic, and autophagic pathways. Lysoplex was successfully validated on 14 different types of LSDs and then used to analyze 48 mutation-unknown patients with a clinical phenotype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a genetically heterogeneous subtype of LSD. Lysoplex allowed us to identify pathogenic mutations in 67% of patients, most of whom had been unsuccessfully analyzed by several sequencing approaches. In addition, in 3 patients, we found potential disease-causing variants in novel NCL candidate genes. We then compared the variant detection power of Lysoplex with data derived from public whole exome sequencing (WES) efforts. On average, a 50% higher number of validated amino acid changes and truncating variations per gene were identified. Overall, we identified 61 truncating sequence variations and 488 missense variations with a high probability to cause loss of function in a total of 316 genes. Interestingly, some loss-of-function variations of genes involved in the ALP pathway were found in homozygosity in the normal population, suggesting that their role is not essential. Thus, Lysoplex provided a comprehensive catalog of sequence variants in ALP genes and allows the assessment of their relevance in cell biology as well as their contribution to human disease.

A variant form of late infantile NCL (vLINCL) present in Turkish patients has been considered a distinct clinical and genetic entity among the NCL, the underlying gene (CLN7) being unknown. Recently, we reported homozygosity over the Northern epilepsy CLN8 gene region on 8p23 in four out of five Turkish vLINCL families studied. However, no common mutation in CLN8 was found in these families. We have now extended the Turkish vLINCL family panel to 18 families, of which only one is nonconsanguineous. Nine families were excluded from CLN8 by lack of homozygosity. In the remaining families, four CLN8 gene mutations were identified indicating that in a subset of patients with Turkish vLINCL, the disorder is allelic to Northern epilepsy. There is no apparent genotype-phenotype correlation among the Turkish patients with CLN8 mutations, although their phenotype is distinct from that of Finnish Northern epilepsy patients.

neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), the most common neurodegenerative disorders of childhood, are characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material mainly in neurons. Although clinically rather uniform, variant late-infantile onset NCL (vLINCL) is genetically heterogeneous with four major underlying genes identified so far. We evaluated the genetic background underlying vLINCL in 119 patients, and specifically analysed the recently reported CLN7/MFSD8 gene for mutations in 80 patients. Clinical data were collected from the CLN7/MFSD8 mutation positive patients. Eight novel CLN7/MFSD8 mutations and seven novel mutations in the CLN1/PPT1, CLN2/TPP1, CLN5, CLN6 and CLN8 genes were identified in patients of various ethnic origins. A significant group of Roma patients originating from the former Czechoslovakia was shown to bear the c.881C>A (p.Thr294Lys) mutation in CLN7/MFSD8, possibly due to a founder effect. With one exception, the CLN7/MFSD8 mutation positive patients present a phenotype indistinguishable from the other vLINCL forms. In one patient with an in-frame amino acid substitution mutation in CLN7/MFSD8, the disease onset was later and the disease course less aggressive than in variant late-infantile NCL. Our findings raise the total number of CLN7/MFSD8 mutations to 14 with the majority of families having private mutations. Our study confirms that CLN7/MFSD8 defects are not restricted to the Turkish population, as initially anticipated, but are a relatively common cause of NCL in different populations. CLN7/MFSD8 should be considered a diagnostic alternative not only in variant late-infantile but also later onset NCL forms with a more protracted disease course. A significant number of NCL patients in Turkey exist, in which the underlying genetic defect remains to be determined.","dc:creator":"Kousi M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in CLN7/MFSD8 are a common cause of variant late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19201763","rdfs:label":"19201763_N3003"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a1c0fe6c-9054-41a9-b13f-f644ed493382_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d7f6f83-aca7-4611-8b37-b6d8d92a31f5","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000572","obo:HP_0033044","obo:HP_0001249"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a1c0fe6c-9054-41a9-b13f-f644ed493382_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6d307b53-f758-4252-a171-0094dfeebffa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018941.3(CLN8):c.789G>C (p.Trp263Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252416"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15024724"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15024724","rdfs:label":"15024724_Family1_Patient23"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:d196db3e-a638-4f41-9db4-4522e379930f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb7f4625-872f-407f-ac78-08b03d9c2fea","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0033044","obo:HP_0000572"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"\"Mutations in CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, CLN7 or CLN10 had already been excluded by enzymatic and molecular analyses.\"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:d196db3e-a638-4f41-9db4-4522e379930f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:11fbbdee-bd04-4066-b10b-df0e066ddf9c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018941.3(CLN8):c.709G>A (p.Gly237Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA274121"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19807737"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19807737","rdfs:label":"19807737_Patient2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1187,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e55e5ec4-d9d2-4cfe-8d2a-71bb74fc6f00","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016295","gene":"hgnc:2079","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CLN8 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) in 1999 (Ranta et al., PMID: 10508524). At least 50 variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 unrelated probands in 5 publications (PMID: 10508524, 15024724, 19201763, 19807737, 26075876). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. Of note, the founder variant c.70C>G p.R24G in CLN8 has been implicated in the Northern epilepsy variant of NCL, a slightly more mild and protracted presentation of NCL. Since these patients have intraneuronal brain pathology similar to other patients with classic NCLs (PMID: 10764041), we have “lumped” the conditions for curation. This gene-disease association is supported by a spontaneous non-human animal (dog) model with vision loss, ataxia, and spontaneous seizures (PMID: 24953404). In summary, CLN8 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive NCL. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Working Group on 9/1/20 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:68775ed0-576e-4ee7-90f2-d16329ecd7c1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
