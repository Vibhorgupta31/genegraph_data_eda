Although it is well established that sclerostin is an osteocyte-secreted bone formation inhibitor, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We identified in tandem affinity purification proteomics screens LRP4 (low density lipoprotein-related protein 4) as a sclerostin interaction partner. Biochemical assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that sclerostin LRP4 interaction is direct. Interestingly, in vitro overexpression and RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments revealed that LRP4 specifically facilitates the previously described inhibitory action of sclerostin on Wnt1/β-catenin signaling. We found the extracellular β-propeller structured domain of LRP4 to be required for this sclerostin facilitator activity. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP4 protein is present in human and rodent osteoblasts and osteocytes, both presumed target cells of sclerostin action. Silencing of LRP4 by lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery blocked sclerostin inhibitory action on in vitro bone mineralization. Notably, we identified two mutations in LRP4 (R1170W and W1186S) in patients suffering from bone overgrowth. We found that these mutations impair LRP4 interaction with sclerostin and its concomitant sclerostin facilitator effect. Together these data indicate that the interaction of sclerostin with LRP4 is required to mediate the inhibitory function of sclerostin on bone formation, thus identifying a novel role for LRP4 in bone.","dc:creator":"Leupin O","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Bone overgrowth-associated mutations in the LRP4 gene impair sclerostin facilitator function."}},"rdfs:label":"Leupin and Itin Proband"},{"id":"cggv:d8cf5441-fd06-475d-9c18-559743409729","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8cf5441-fd06-475d-9c18-559743409729_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d8cf5441-fd06-475d-9c18-559743409729_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Completely inactive sclerostin enhancer function in Wnt signaling; Sclerostin LRP4 interaction ELISA demonstrated conditioned medium-containing secreted versions of the variants were impaired in interactions with sclerostin."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Scoring at 0.5 due to homozygosity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0ca7ef0e-eaee-4c66-a338-452e79cd9af1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ca7ef0e-eaee-4c66-a338-452e79cd9af1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"cggv:1f31379a-6927-4869-b520-cdd883c17cae","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002334.4(LRP4):c.316+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5970549"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Unrecognizable fingers, acromesomelic forearms, carpals/metacarpals synostosis, radioulnar synostosis, hypoplastic elbow joint, prominent clavicle and hypoplastic shoulder joint, short feet, oligodactylous feet (3 toes bilaterally), synostosis of tarsals, metatarsals, broad forehead/frontal bossing, high hair-line, deformed left pinna, antevert/short nose, depressed nasal bridge, cleft-lip, hypoplastic frontal teeth, thoracic scoliosis, height <-3SD, OFC 5SD, Right kidney: L=7.9cm W=3.1cm / Left Kidney: L=6.5cm W=3.3cm","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002007","obo:HP_0009890","obo:HP_0100266","obo:HP_0002943","obo:HP_0001849","obo:HP_0001773","obo:HP_0000685","obo:HP_0000463","obo:HP_0100265","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0001167","obo:HP_0003196","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0000337","obo:HP_0002974","obo:HP_0410030","obo:HP_0004322"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:fd3b8fa6-fc6d-418e-8f8f-b1db1b55d3b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1f31379a-6927-4869-b520-cdd883c17cae"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28559208","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; MIM-212780) is a rare autosomal recessive limb malformation characterized by complete osseous fusion of all fingers and toes, disorganization of phalangeal elements and severe shortening of the radius and ulna.

LRP4 gene encodes the highly conserved low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), which acts as a co-receptor for sclerostin. Sclerostin and LRP4 negatively regulate WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and lack of their inhibitory activity leads to constant osteoblastic differentiation. Consequently, increased bone formation occurs, which in the case of LRP4 mutations results in sclerosteosis type 2 (SOST2). Alterations within the LRP4 may also cause Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (CLSS), congenital myasthenia or isolated syndactyly. Here, we have reported a patient, in whom we found a novel homozygous splice-site variant c.1048+6T>C in LRP4 using whole exome sequencing. The patient was initially misdiagnosed with isolated CLSS-like or Malik-Percin-like syndactyly. However, we have finally refined the diagnosis after comprehensive radiological examination and molecularly confirmed SOST2. Additionally, we have pointed here to the splicing variants as important causative alterations that may be overlooked in the molecular analysis due to the lack of advanced, reliable algorithms, built-into the standard diagnostic pipelines. Using advanced in silico prediction tools of splice-site alterations, including Alamut Visual software, we have demonstrated that the c.1048+6T>C LRP4 variant affects the native donor site and impairs an SC35 enhancer activity. Based on our experience, we recommend comprehensive radiological imaging, including X-ray of the skull in each case of isolated syndactyly resulting from pathogenic variants of LRP4. We suggest that all previously reported patients carrying biallelic LRP4 mutations, who were diagnosed with isolated syndactyly, could actually present with SOST2 that had been unrecognized due to the incomplete clinical and radiological assessment.","dc:creator":"Bukowska-Olech E","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"A novel biallelic splice-site variant in the LRP4 gene causes sclerosteosis 2."}},"rdfs:label":"Bukowska-Olech Proband"},{"id":"cggv:40c363ff-f632-4eeb-b8f7-a8e8256a96fa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40c363ff-f632-4eeb-b8f7-a8e8256a96fa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Upgraded score due to predicted splicing effect."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:725d13e2-a182-4e1e-8359-3c35a2ca46e9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:725d13e2-a182-4e1e-8359-3c35a2ca46e9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d10590b3-759f-40bb-9ac3-3316d6d5a4a4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c92eba2d-b432-4019-9076-8aa7399a3034","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunohistochemistry of human femoral neck samples and mouse femora confirmed that the protein is present in osteoblasts and osteocytes, both presumed target cells of sclerostin action","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21471202","rdfs:label":"Bone expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1cdc98de-b260-409e-baf1-007623b64fa1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8fea67e-03f9-4af6-a4e6-2b8ee7969c82","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"LRP4 was identified through Western blotting and tandem mass spectrometry of various complexes as a potential binding partner.

Initially, we and others reported that sclerosteosis was caused by loss-of-function mutations in SOST, encoding sclerostin. More recently, we identified disease-causing mutations in LRP4, a binding partner of sclerostin, in three sclerosteosis patients. Upon binding to sclerostin, LRP4 can inhibit the canonical WNT signaling that is known to be an important pathway in the regulation of bone formation. To further investigate the role of LRP4 in the bone formation process, we generated an Lrp4 mutated sclerosteosis mouse model by introducing the p.Arg1170Gln mutation in the mouse genome. Extensive analysis of the bone phenotype of the Lrp4R1170Q/R1170Q knock-in (KI) mouse showed the presence of increased trabecular and cortical bone mass as a consequence of increased bone formation by the osteoblasts. In addition, three-point bending analysis also showed that the increased bone mass results in increased bone strength. In contrast to the human sclerosteosis phenotype, we could not observe syndactyly in the forelimbs or hindlimbs of the Lrp4 KI animals. Finally, we could not detect any significant changes in the bone formation and resorption markers in the serum of the mutant mice. However, the serum sclerostin levels were strongly increased and the level of sclerostin in the tibia was decreased in Lrp4R1170Q/R1170Q mice, confirming the role of LRP4 as an anchor for sclerostin in bone. In conclusion, the Lrp4R1170Q/R1170Q mouse is a good model for the human sclerosteosis phenotype caused by mutations in LRP4 and can be used in the future for further investigation of the mechanism whereby LRP4 regulates bone formation. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","dc:creator":"Boudin E","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"The Lrp4R1170Q Homozygous Knock-In Mouse Recapitulates the Bone Phenotype of Sclerosteosis in Humans."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This mouse model was scored conservatively at 1 point due to the sole presentation of sclerosteosis."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7945,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:78beef21-287f-4546-a00d-783c7caa8b51","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008931","gene":"hgnc:6696","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.3","dc:description":"The LRP4 gene is located on chromosome 11 at 11p11.2, encodes a receptor for agrin and is critical for the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. LRP4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome in 2010 (Li et al., PMID: 20381006). Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome is characterized by syndactyly and/or oligodactyly and commonly presents with kidney anomalies. Some patients present with sclerosteosis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, congenital myasthenic syndrome 17 (OMIM:616304) has been split into a separate disease entity,\nCenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (OMIM:212780) and sclerosteosis 2 (OMIM:614305) have been lumped together. The split curation for autosomal recessive congenital myasthenic syndrome 17 has been curated separately. Sixteen variants (missense, canonical splice site, and frameshift) that have been reported in 14 probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 20381006, 21471202, 28559208, 29524275, 32286743, 33179409, 35052419) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function, causing increased WNT signaling. This gene-disease relationship\nis also supported by animal models, expression studies, biochemical function, and in vitro\nfunctional assays (PMIDs: 21471202, 28477420, 30327840, 34857885). The homozygous knockin mouse model displayed increased bone mass (PMID: 28477420) and the homozygous knockdown of Zebrafish lrp4 resulted in syndactyly (PMID: 30327840). Multiple variants showed impaired ability to inhibit WNT signaling (PMIDs: 30327840, 34857885). LRP4 is expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, is a facilitator of SOST inhibition of Wnt1/β-catenin signaling, and binds with SOST which is associated with recessive forms of sclerosteosis per ClinGen’s Dosage Sensitivity Working Group. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between LRP4 and autosomal recessive Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has\nbeen upheld over time.
