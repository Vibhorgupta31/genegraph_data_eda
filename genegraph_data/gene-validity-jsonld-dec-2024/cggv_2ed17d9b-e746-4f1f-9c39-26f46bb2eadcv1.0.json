Additionally, we found that the frameshift mutations resulting in protein truncation closer to the C-terminus are not associated with better disease prognosis.

Mature Surf-1 protein (Surf-1p) is a 30 kDa hydrophobic polypeptide whose function is still unknown. Using antibodies against a recombinant, hemagglutinin-tagged Surf-1p, we have demonstrated that this protein is imported into mitochondria as a larger precursor, which is then processed into the mature product by cleaving off an N-terminal leader polypeptide of approximately 40 amino acids. By using western blot analysis with specific antibodies, we showed that Surf-1p is localized in and tightly bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane. The same analysis revealed that no protein is present in cell lines harboring loss-of-function mutations of SURF-1, regardless of their type and position. Northern blot analysis showed the virtual absence of specific SURF-1 transcripts in different mutant cell lines. This result suggests that several mutations of SURF-1 are associated with severe mRNA instability. To understand better whether and which domains of the protein are essential for function, we generated several constructs with truncated or partially deleted SURF-1 cDNAs. None of these constructs, expressed into Surf-1p null mutant cells, were able to rescue the COX phenotype, suggesting that different regions of the protein are all essential for function. Finally, experiments based on blue native two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that assembly of COX in Surf-1p null mutants is blocked at an early step, most likely before the incorporation of subunit II in the nascent intermediates composed of subunit I alone or subunit I plus subunit IV.

SURF1 encodes an inner membrane mitochondrial protein involved in COX assembly. We established a Drosophila melanogaster model of LS based on the post-transcriptional silencing of CG9943, the Drosophila homolog of SURF1. Knockdown of Surf1 was induced ubiquitously in larvae and adults, which led to lethality; in the mesodermal derivatives, which led to pupal lethality; or in the central nervous system, which allowed survival. A biochemical characterization was carried out in knockdown individuals, which revealed that larvae unexpectedly displayed defects in all complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and in the F-ATP synthase, while adults had a COX-selective impairment. Silencing of Surf1 expression in Drosophila S2R(+) cells led to selective loss of COX activity associated with decreased oxygen consumption and respiratory reserve. We conclude that Surf1 is essential for COX activity and mitochondrial function in D. melanogaster, thus providing a new tool that may help clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of LS.

Mutations in SURF1, a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial protein involved in COX assembly, are among the most common causes of LS. LSSURF1 patients display severe, isolated COX deficiency in all tissues, including cultured fibroblasts and skeletal muscle. Recombinant, constitutive SURF1-/- mice show diffuse COX deficiency, but fail to recapitulate the severity of the human clinical phenotype. Pigs are an attractive alternative model for human diseases, because of their size, as well as metabolic, physiological and genetic similarity to humans. Here, we determined the complete sequence of the swine SURF1 gene, disrupted it in pig primary fibroblast cell lines using both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems, before finally generating SURF1-/- and SURF1-/+ pigs by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT). SURF1-/- pigs were characterized by failure to thrive, muscle weakness and highly reduced life span with elevated perinatal mortality, compared to heterozygous SURF1-/+ and wild type littermates. Surprisingly, no obvious COX deficiency was detected in SURF1-/- tissues, although histochemical analysis revealed the presence of COX deficiency in jejunum villi and total mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) showed that several COX subunit-encoding genes were significantly down-regulated in SURF1-/- skeletal muscles. In addition, neuropathological findings, indicated a delay in central nervous system development of newborn SURF1-/- piglets. Our results suggest a broader role of sSURF1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics.","dc:creator":"Quadalti C","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"SURF1 knockout cloned pigs: Early onset of a severe lethal phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"Knockout cloned pigs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Per MitoGCEP guidance: 1/3 for neuropathological evidence; 0/2 for MRI evidence; 0.5/1 for biochem/mito dysfunction; 0.5/1 for neurocognitive/developmental differences = 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":493,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5a28b51c-5838-44fa-bc25-16a16957d055","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:11474","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between SURF1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of January 14, 2019. 21 articles were reviewed. SURF1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1998 (Tiranti et al., PMID 9837813). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs 9837813, 10443880, 22488715, 27756633). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by the known biochemical function, expression, rescue studies, and animal models. The mechanism for disease is complex IV deficiency. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SURF1 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. More than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 14, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2ed17d9b-e746-4f1f-9c39-26f46bb2eadc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
