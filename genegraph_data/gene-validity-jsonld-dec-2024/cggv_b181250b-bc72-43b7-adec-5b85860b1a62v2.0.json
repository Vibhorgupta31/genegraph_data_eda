Also similarly to those with fish-odor syndrome, the metabolism of choline is prematurely terminated and a significant increase of the intermediary, in this case N,N-dimethylglycine, was detected. It is likely that either this compound or its excess degradation into the known cause trimethylamine is the root of the odor.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9398858","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Individuals with primary trimethylaminuria exhibit a body odour reminiscent of rotting fish, due to excessive excretion of trimethylamine (TMA; refs 1-3). The disorder, colloquially known as fish-odour syndrome, is inherited recessively as a defect in hepatic N-oxidation of dietary-derived TMA and cannot be considered benign, as sufferers may display a variety of psychosocial reactions, ranging from social isolation of clinical depression and attempted suicide. TMA oxidation is catalyzed by flavin-containing mono-oxygenase (FMO; refs 7,8), and tissue localization and functional studies have established FMO3 as the form most likely to be defective in fish-odour syndrome. Direct sequencing of the coding exons of FMO3 amplified from a patient with fish-odour syndrome identified two missense mutations. Although one of these represented a common polymorphism, the other, a C-->T transition in exon 4, was found only in an affected pedigree, in which it segregated with the disorder. The latter mutation predicts a proline-->leucine substitution at residue 153 and abolishes FMO3 catalytic activity. Our results indicate that defects in FMO3 underlie fish-odour syndrome and that the Pro 153-->Leu 153 mutation described here is a cause of this distressing condition.","dc:creator":"Dolphin CT","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Missense mutation in flavin-containing mono-oxygenase 3 gene, FMO3, underlies fish-odour syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Choline Metabolism in FMO3 and DMGDH"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This biochemical evidence supports the abnormal choline metabolism being a cause for the main symptom of dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency.

Only this one homozygous missense variant with functional evidence to support pathogenicity has been reported in humans, with the phenotypes consisting of a distinctive fish-like odor, increased serum CK, muscle fatigue, and increased levels of N,N-dimethylglycine in urine. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes only this case-level data and biochemical function data which implicates the DMGDH mutant's decrease in choline metabolism as potentially causal for these phenotypes.\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, particularly due to the lack of reported variants in humans. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 06/28/19 (SOP Version 6).
