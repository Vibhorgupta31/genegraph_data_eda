However, at present very little is known about the genetic heterogeneity underlying the non-syndromic form of ID (NS-ID). To investigate the genetic basis of NS-ID we analyzed 43 trios and 22 isolated NS-ID patients using a targeted sequencing (TS) approach. 71 NS-ID genes have been selected and sequenced in all subjects. We found putative pathogenic mutations in 7 out of 65 patients. The pathogenic role of mutations was evaluated through sequence comparison and structural analysis was performed to predict the effect of alterations in a 3D computational model through molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, a deep patient clinical re-evaluation has been performed after the molecular results. This approach allowed us to find novel pathogenic mutations with a detection rate close to 11% in our cohort of patients. This result supports the hypothesis that many NS-ID related genes still remain to be discovered and that NS-ID is a more complex phenotype compared to syndromic form, likely caused by a complex and broad interaction between genes alterations and environment factors.

Clinical features frequently associated with MR were microcephaly and/or short stature. The predominant mutations detected so far affect a stretch of six AG dinucleotides in the polar-amino-acid-rich domain (PRD), causing frameshifts in the fourth coding exon. We searched for PQBP1 exon 4 frameshifts in 57 mentally retarded males in whom initial referral description indicated at least one of the following criteria: microcephaly, short stature, spastic paraplegia or family history compatible with XLMR, and in 772 mentally retarded males not selected for specific clinical features or family history. We identified a novel frameshift mutation (23 bp deletion) in two half-brothers with specific clinical features, and performed prenatal diagnosis in this family. We also found two different 21 bp in-frame deletions (c.334-354del(21 bp) and c.393-413del(21 bp)) in four unrelated probands from various ethnic origins, each deleting one of five copies of an imperfect seven amino-acid repeat. Although such deletions have not been detected in 1180 X chromosomes from European controls, the c. 334-354del(21 bp) was subsequently found in two of 477 Xs from Indian controls. We conclude that pathogenic frameshift mutations in PQBP1 are rare in mentally retarded patients lacking specific associated signs and that the 21 bp in-frame deletions may be non-pathogenic, or alternatively could act subtly on PQBP1 function. This touches upon a common dilemma in XLMR, that is, how to distinguish between mutations and variants that may be non-pathogenic or represent risk factors for cognitive impairment.","dc:creator":"Cossée M","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Exonic microdeletions in the X-linked PQBP1 gene in mentally retarded patients: a pathogenic mutation and in-frame deletions of uncertain effect."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16493439","rdfs:label":"Family 5 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"present in 118/19114 (0.6%) South Asian alleles"},{"id":"cggv:4dac81d4-eed7-47a9-adec-9a22d3c8934e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d99de342-c3d9-487e-b194-6f6cca1e445b","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"PQBP1 sequenced","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0000752"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4dac81d4-eed7-47a9-adec-9a22d3c8934e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ae1ba2bc-ef26-4c90-a781-b55157dbeb41","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001032382.1(PQBP1):c.586C>T (p.Arg196Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/545093"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30244542"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30244542","rdfs:label":"Family 1 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant seen in Germanaud 2011 proband, so scored again but downgraded."},{"id":"cggv:0326dfde-6791-427e-9b77-3ae61585516d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:86e77d31-32da-4144-bc5a-050ba4cbc977","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008734","obo:HP_0002025","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001264","obo:HP_0000248","obo:HP_0000252"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:0326dfde-6791-427e-9b77-3ae61585516d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c3ce1755-2a89-4dae-8708-87d7bde291fe","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001032383.1(PQBP1):c.461_462dupAG (p.Arg155Serfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/10979"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14634649","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We found mutations in the gene PQBP1 in 5 of 29 families with nonsyndromic (MRX) and syndromic (MRXS) forms of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR).

The predominant clinical findings are microcephaly, long narrow face, short stature with lean body build, and small testes. Mental retardation, usually of severe degree, occurs in 95% of cases. Less than 20% of cases have major malformations, the most common being cardiac defects and cleft palate. Subsequent to the description of mutations in the polyglutamine tract binding protein 1 (PQBP1) in Sutherland-Haan syndrome, Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, MRX55, and two small XLMR families, a single nucleotide insertion has been found in the original family with Renpenning syndrome and an AGAG deletion in a second family with the Renpenning syndrome. Mutations have also been found in Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome, Porteous syndrome, and an additional small family. It is now demonstrated that five named XLMR syndromes (Sutherland-Haan, Hamel cerebropalatocardiac, Golabi-Ito-Hall, Porteous, and Renpenning), one nonsyndromic family (MRX55), and three small XLMR families have PQBP1 mutations and are thus allelic XLMR entities.

In this study, 13 PQBP1-mutated French patients were subjected to a standardized clinical, cognitive and behavioral assessment. Physical measurements of their relatives were also collected.

Three new clinical features are described: upper back progressive muscular atrophy, metacarpophalangeal ankylosis of the thumb and velar dysfunction. The specific facial dysmorphic features included at least four of the following signs: long triangular face, large ridged nose, half-depilated eyebrows, dysplastic or protruding ears and rough slightly sparse hair. An over-aged appearance was noticed in elderly patients. Cortical gyrification was normal based on available magnetic brain imaging of six patients.

Variants in SETD5, ATRX, CUL4B, MECP2, and ARID1B were the most common causes of ID. This study assessed the value of sequencing a cohort of probands to provide a molecular diagnosis of ID, without the availability of DNA from both parents for de novo sequence analysis. This modeling is clinically relevant as 28% of all UK families with dependent children are single parent households. In conclusion, to diagnose patients with ID in the absence of parental DNA, we recommend investigation of all LoF variants in known genes that cause ID and assessment of a limited list of proven pathogenic missense variants in these genes.

Little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of the various mutations that cause the notable variability in patients. In this study, we examine the cellular and synaptic functions of the most common mutations found in the patients: c.461_462delAG, c.459_462delAGAG and c.463_464dupAG in an AG hexamer in PQBP1 exon 4. We discovered that PQBP1 c.459_462delAGAG and c.463_464dupAG mutations encode a new C-terminal epitope that preferentially binds non-phosphorylated fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

PQBP1 is associated with many splicing factors, including the key U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) component SF3B1 (subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3B [SF3B] protein complex). Loss of functional PQBP1 reduced SF3B1 substrate mRNA association and led to significant changes in AS patterns.

Disease-linked PQBP1 mutants were deficient in splicing factor associations and could not complement neurite outgrowth defects.

PQBP-1 is one of these factors and it has been shown to interact with the spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1) disease gene product, ataxin-1. Our previous data suggested that relatively high expression of PQBP-1 in the cerebellum might explain the selective neuronal degeneration of SCA1. To further test whether PQBP-1 expression level regulates neuronal death, we generated transgenic mice of human PQBP-1 driven by a regulatory element for ubiquitous gene expression. The mice showed a late-onset and gradually progressive motor neuron disease-like phenotype, which might be related to neurogenic muscular atrophy observed in SCA1 patients. Ataxia could not be discriminated from predominant progressive weakness. Pathological examinations of the transgenic mice revealed loss of Purkinje and granular cells in the cerebellum as well as that of spinal motor neurons, corresponding to the pathology of human SCA1. These findings show that excessive action of PQBP-1 causes neuronal dysfunction and support PQBP-1 being involved in the pathology of SCA1.","dc:creator":"Okuda T","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"PQBP-1 transgenic mice show a late-onset motor neuron disease-like phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"Okuda Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because the mouse phenotypes are not very consistent with human phenotype"},{"id":"cggv:d1e3850c-1428-4d7a-aa19-7417d9bccaa9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:962c9ae3-2372-467c-92ce-2f2d58839762","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"conditional knockout mouse of PQBP1 in neural stem cells using nestin-Cre.

Examination of a conditional Pqbp1-knockout (cKO) mouse with microcephaly failed to reveal either abnormal centrosomes or mitotic spindles, increased neurogenesis from the neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) pool or increased cell death in vivo. Instead, we observed an increase in the length of the cell cycle, particularly for the M phase in NSPCs. Corresponding to the developmental expression of Pqbp1, the stem cell pool in vivo was decreased at E10 and remained at a low level during neurogenesis (E15) in Pqbp1-cKO mice. The expression profiles of NSPCs derived from the cKO mouse revealed significant changes in gene groups that control the M phase, including anaphase-promoting complex genes, via aberrant transcription and RNA splicing. Exogenous Apc4, a hub protein in the network of affected genes, recovered the cell cycle, proliferation, and cell phenotypes of NSPCs caused by Pqbp1-cKO. These data reveal a mechanism of brain size control based on the simple reduction of the NSPC pool by cell cycle time elongation.

Variants in PQBP1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Kalscheuer et al.​). At least 7 frameshift variants, and additional missense and nonsense variants, have been reported in at least 9 male probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 14634649, 15782410, 15024694, 16493439, 16740914, 20950397, 26411299, 25167861). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 28 additional male family members, as well as unaffected female carriers. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for \"predicted or proven null variants\" for genetic evidence (10 pts) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by a conditional knockout mouse model with significantly reduced brain weight (PMID: 25070536) as well as functional studies demonstrating the pathogenicity of loss-of-function variants (PMIDs: 23512658, 24781215, 28073926).
