Human complex I comprises seven subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA and 38 nuclear-encoded subunits that are assembled together in a process that is only partially understood. To date, mutations causing complex I deficiency have been described in all 14 core subunits, five supernumerary subunits, and four assembly factors. We describe complex I deficiency caused by mutation of the putative complex I assembly factor C20orf7. A candidate region for a lethal neonatal form of complex I deficiency was identified by homozygosity mapping of an Egyptian family with one affected child and two affected pregnancies predicted by enzyme-based prenatal diagnosis. The region was confirmed by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, and 11 candidate genes encoding potential mitochondrial proteins were sequenced. A homozygous missense mutation in C20orf7 segregated with disease in the family. We show that C20orf7 is peripherally associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and that silencing its expression with RNAi decreases complex I activity. C20orf7 patient fibroblasts showed an almost complete absence of complex I holoenzyme and were defective at an early stage of complex I assembly, but in a manner distinct from the assembly defects caused by mutations in the assembly factor NDUFAF1. Our results indicate that C20orf7 is crucial in the assembly of complex I and that mutations in C20orf7 cause mitochondrial disease.","dc:creator":"Sugiana C","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Mutation of C20orf7 disrupts complex I assembly and causes lethal neonatal mitochondrial disease."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:90482ccc-5a6c-40d1-a7ea-d8a78971ac44_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1852ca09-f53e-4018-9e65-5a9f491b9df0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1852ca09-f53e-4018-9e65-5a9f491b9df0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7d273066-79d7-441e-b13c-fdebefd2a210","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024120.5(NDUFAF5):c.1004_1007del (p.Asn335ThrfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA311400261"}},"detectionMethod":"parents were carriers for the NDUFAF5 (c.1004_1007del, p.N335Tfs*37) mutation\nreplaces the last 10 amino acids with 10 different amino acids and results in truncation 27 additional amino acids downstream\n\nGnomAD v4.0 0.000003718 (6 alleles no homyzgotes)","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0100543","obo:HP_0001138"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Mitochondrial DNA sequencing methodology not specified ","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:5bde4198-5353-4533-a501-23d7ee73510f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7d273066-79d7-441e-b13c-fdebefd2a210"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36580434","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Chen J","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Cognitive Impairment in Phenotypic Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy Caused by Mutation in Nuclear Gene NDUFAF5."}},"rdfs:label":"Chen et al 2022"},{"id":"cggv:5bde4198-5353-4533-a501-23d7ee73510f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5bde4198-5353-4533-a501-23d7ee73510f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Default score for variant without functional evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ab55c2f1-dcbf-42ea-afff-5ba093e1ded9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab55c2f1-dcbf-42ea-afff-5ba093e1ded9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:455f476a-bce7-495a-ad74-67aa3bee8b48","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024120.5(NDUFAF5):c.749G>T (p.Gly250Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9767862"}},"detectionMethod":"In this family we identified a 2.91 Mb genomic region spanning chr. 20:12.656-15.571 Mb (supplementary data).

This study is to investigate the performance characteristics of trio whole exome sequencing (Trio-WES) in a pediatric setting by presenting our patient cohort and displaying the diagnostic yield. A total of 31 pediatric patients showing neurodevelopmental delay accompanied unexplained dyspnea were admitted to our hospital and referred for molecular genetic testing using Trio-WES. Eight genes namely MMACHC, G6PC, G6PT, ETFDH, OTC, NDUFAF5, SLC22A5, and MAGEL2 were suspected to be responsible for the onset of the clinical symptoms and 6 variants were novel. Standard interpretation according to ACMG guideline showed that the variants were pathogenic.

Trio-WES is an effective means for molecular diagnosis of infantile neurodevelopmental delay accompanied unexplained dyspnea. As for molecular etiology identification, when routine potential monogenetic inheritance patterns including de novo, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and X-linked recessive inheritance analysis is negative, physicians should take into account imprinted genes.","dc:creator":"Tong W","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Whole-exome Sequencing Helps the Diagnosis and Treatment in Children with Neurodevelopmental Delay Accompanied Unexplained Dyspnea."}},{"id":"cggv:994b691b-b6ec-46c7-909a-d07ede01884a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ef951840-00cb-4686-8056-7565b0d7bcae"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29581464"}],"rdfs:label":"Tong et al 2018, Patient 16"},{"id":"cggv:994b691b-b6ec-46c7-909a-d07ede01884a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:994b691b-b6ec-46c7-909a-d07ede01884a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:8d81ad7d-1137-4757-904f-e177034c8ea1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d81ad7d-1137-4757-904f-e177034c8ea1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:90482ccc-5a6c-40d1-a7ea-d8a78971ac44_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:90482ccc-5a6c-40d1-a7ea-d8a78971ac44_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc540023-2995-4a1b-bb49-5a098409e10f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:581fe3cd-74d3-4a50-8bcb-493722ed6179","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"See protein atlas database","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613900","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease.

Mutations in the genes encoding subunits and assembly factors lead to complex I deficiency, which can manifest as mitochondrial disease. The current model of complex I assembly suggests that the enzyme is built by the association of a set of smaller intermediate modules containing specific conserved core subunits and additional accessory subunits. Each module must converge in a spatially and temporally orchestrated fashion to allow assembly of the mature holoenzyme to occur.

Little is known about the function of the protein and the cytopathological consequences of the mutations. Disruption of Dictyostelium Ndufaf5 leads to CI deficiency and defects in growth and development. The predicted sequence of Ndufaf5 contains a putative methyltransferase domain. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the methyltransferase motif is essential for its function. Pathological mutations were recreated in the Dictyostelium protein and expressed in the mutant background. These proteins were unable to complement the phenotypes, which further validates Dictyostelium as a model of the disease. Chronic activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed to play a role in Dictyostelium and human cytopathology in mitochondrial diseases. However, inhibition of the expression of AMPK gene in the Ndufaf5-null mutant does not rescue the phenotypes associated with the lack of Ndufaf5, suggesting that novel AMPK-independent pathways are responsible for Ndufaf5 cytopathology. Of interest, the Ndufaf5-deficient strain shows an increase in autophagy. This phenomenon was also observed in a Dictyostelium mutant lacking MidA (C2orf56/PRO1853/Ndufaf7), another CI assembly factor, suggesting that autophagy activation might be a common feature in mitochondrial CI dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Carilla-Latorre S","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Ndufaf5 deficiency in the Dictyostelium model: new roles in autophagy and development."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of growth deficit in slime mold"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score one point (0.5 for growth defect + 0.5 for rescue with WT, but not with mutant variants)"},{"id":"cggv:c0d129e1-d722-43f3-b98f-f6093248c10e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c108f205-0163-483a-b8be-24564ef969ad","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The activities of complexes I and IV were assessed first by immunocapture-based activity assays, which showed that both C20orf7 and NDUFAF1 hairpins caused a similar gross decrease in complex I activity, with a more modest inhibition of complex IV activity (Figure 6A). \n\nSDS-PAGE immunoblotting confirmed that the C20orf7 hairpin caused a gross decrease in the steady-state level of the 8 kDa complex I subunit but no obvious effect on the levels of VDAC or the MTCO2 complex IV subunit (Figure 6B).

The *NDUFAF5* gene (previously known as C20orf7) encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor 5, an arginine hydroxylase involved in the assembly of complex I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\n*NDUFAF5* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18940309). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFAF5*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFAF5* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFAF5* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on February 3, 2021 (SOP v7), with a final classification of Definitive. The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 11 variants (eight unique missense variants including an Ashkenazi founder variant c.749G>T; p.Gly250Val; ClinVar Variation ID: 372253; two intronic variants, and a four-nucleotide deletion expected to result in protein truncation) in 11 probands from eight publications (PMIDs: 18940309, 19542079, 21607760, 29581464, 34797029, 36580434, 30473481). The condition was first described in a patient with neonatal lactic acidosis and agenesis of the corpus callosum who died of cardiopulmonary arrest. Subsequent reported patients also had Leigh syndrome, optic atrophy, and myopathy, and some individuals had clinical features consistent with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and intellectual disability (PMIDs: 19542079, 21607760, 29581464, 34797029, 36580434, 30473481). Additional cases are reported in the literature, but maximum case scoring was reached. \n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function in mitochondrial complex I shared by more than 10 other genes also associated with primary mitochondrial disease, expression of *NDUFAF5* in brain tissue, and model studies in *Dictyostelium* and in MCH58 Cells (PMIDs: 28797839, 25613900, 23536703, 18940309).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFAF5* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 18, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:90482ccc-5a6c-40d1-a7ea-d8a78971ac44"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
