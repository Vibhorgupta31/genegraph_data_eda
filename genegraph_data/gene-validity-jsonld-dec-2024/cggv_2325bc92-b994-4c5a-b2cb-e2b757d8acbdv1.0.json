Congenital hyperinsulinism has been associated with specific genes in monogenic forms and also with other diseases with a yet unknown genetic cause. In 2017, Rubio Cabezas et¬†al. described the association of HH and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) with a promoter mutation in the PMM2 gene. They found that all the patients carried a promoter mutation (c-167G>T) in PMM2, either homozygous or in trans with a second PMM2 coding mutation. Methods We performed the study of the PMM2 gene in six patients from four unrelated families, previously diagnosed with ARPKD and HH. Results All these patients had in common the heterozygous variant c-167G>T in the promoter region for PMM2. Additionally, each patient carried a compound heterozygote for a second missense mutation in this gene (p.Arg141His, p.Asp148Asn or p.Phe157Ser), previously reported as pathogenic for congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia, with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Unlike the previous published article, two of our patients showed altered type 1 pattern and one of them with rectal bleeding that could be a sign of PMM2-congenital disorders of glycosylation. Conclusion We propose the study of this gene when carrying out the diagnosis of patients with HH, especially in the neonatal period and when a recessive polycystic kidney disease without alterations in PKDH1 is diagnosed.","dc:creator":"Moreno Maci√°n F","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Mutations in PMM2 gene in four unrelated Spanish families with polycystic kidney disease and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia."}},"rdfs:label":"2nd case: promoter variant and p.Phe157Ser in trans (2 sibs)"},{"id":"cggv:67218ced-5de5-4c6a-b66f-6f57534b6e4a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67218ced-5de5-4c6a-b66f-6f57534b6e4a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:67218ced-5de5-4c6a-b66f-6f57534b6e4a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Mutation significantly reduced residual activity of PMM2 in prokaryotic expression system compared to wild type (WT) (PMID: 21541725).

PKD1 and PKD2, encoding polycystin (PC)1 and 2, are the two major genes associated with ADPKD; other genes include IFT140, GANAB, DNAJB11, and ALG9. Genetic testing remains inconclusive in ‚àº7% of the families. We performed whole-exome sequencing in a large multiplex genetically unresolved (GUR) family affected by ADPKD-like symptoms and identified a monoallelic frameshift variant (c.703_704delCA) in ALG5. ALG5 encodes an endoplasmic-reticulum-resident enzyme required for addition of glucose molecules to the assembling N-glycan precursors. To identify additional families, we screened a cohort of 1,213 families with ADPKD-like and/or autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial kidney diseases (ADTKD), GUR (n¬†= 137) or naive to genetic testing (n¬†= 1,076), by targeted massively parallel sequencing, and we accessed Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project data. Four additional families with pathogenic variants in ALG5 were identified. Clinical presentation was consistent in the 23 affected members, with non-enlarged cystic kidneys and few or no liver cysts; 8 subjects reached end-stage kidney disease from 62 to 91 years of age. We demonstrate that ALG5 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to alter the synthesis of the N-glycan chain in renal epithelial cells. We also show that ALG5 is required for PC1 maturation and membrane and ciliary localization and that heterozygous loss of ALG5 affects PC1 maturation. Overall, our results indicate that monoallelic variants of ALG5 lead to a disorder of the ADPKD-spectrum characterized by multiple small kidney cysts, progressive interstitial fibrosis, and kidney function decline.","dc:creator":"Lemoine H","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Monoallelic pathogenic ALG5 variants cause atypical polycystic kidney disease and interstitial fibrosis."},"rdfs:label":"Glycosylation and polycystic kidney disease association"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:2325bc92-b994-4c5a-b2cb-e2b757d8acbd_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf5aef2a-57d4-4fc6-b871-f47ebba50c28","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1325277-d21d-4efc-bdeb-24941074624d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Luciferase assay activity was significantly reduced in both cell types with the deletion, just like in both types of the cells with the promoter mutant. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28373276","rdfs:label":"Luciferase assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":8439,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":7.6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d7fc2324-49b7-4897-adb3-ad0105fc41eb","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_1030000","gene":"hgnc:9115","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*PMM2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with polycystic kidney disease (HIPKD) in 2017 (Cabezas et al., 2017; PMID: 28373276). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found sufficient differences in molecular mechanism and phenotype to consider HIPKD separately. The HIPKD phenotype is caused specifically by the *PMM2* promoter variant c.-167G>T, either in a homozygous state or in trans with another pathogenic variant in *PMM2*, while congenital disorder of glycosylation, type 1A (CDG1A) is caused by other recessive mutant genotypes in *PMM2*. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities: autosomal recessive HIPKD and autosomal recessive congenital disorders of glycosylation, type 1A (CDG1A; OMIM: 212065); CDG1A has been curated separately. Eight variants (1 promoter; c.-167G>T and 7 missense) that have been reported in over 20 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 28373276, 32841164, 33532864, 34055813, 36412659; Fundaci√≥n Puigvert internal data) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be decreased transcriptional activity in patient kidney cells and impaired binding of the transcription factor ZNF143. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence, biochemical functional evidence, functional alteration evidence; GTEx/Humphrey‚Äôs Lab Expression data, PMIDs: 28373276, 35896117). \nIn summary, there is Moderate evidence supporting the relationship between the *PMM2* c.-167G>T promoter variant and autosomal recessive HIPKD. There is limited evidence supporting the relationship of any other variant causing a kidney-specific phenotype. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 2/28/2024 (SOP Version 10). \nGenetic evidence should total 5.2 pts., due to not being able to enter the exact score in one case desired, as noted in the data for that case. Thus, total score should be 6.7 pts., and the score was rounded up to 7 pts. for a moderate classification, after discussion.
