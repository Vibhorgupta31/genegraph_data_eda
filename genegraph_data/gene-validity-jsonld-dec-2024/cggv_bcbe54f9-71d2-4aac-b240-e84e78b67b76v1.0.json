Comparative mapping suggested that the locus on 19p13.3 associated with Cayman ataxia might be homologous to the locus on mouse chromosome 10 associated with the recessive ataxic mouse mutant jittery. Screening genes in the region of overlap identified mutations in a novel predicted gene in three mouse jittery alleles, including the first mouse mutation caused by an Alu-related (B1 element) insertion. We found two mutations exclusively in all individuals with Cayman ataxia. The gene ATCAY or Atcay encodes a neuron-restricted protein called caytaxin. Caytaxin contains a CRAL-TRIO motif common to proteins that bind small lipophilic molecules. Mutations in another protein containing a CRAL-TRIO domain, alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTPA), cause a vitamin E-responsive ataxia. Three-dimensional protein structural modeling predicts that the caytaxin ligand is more polar than vitamin E. Identification of the caytaxin ligand may help develop a therapy for Cayman ataxia.","dc:creator":"Bomar JM","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in a novel gene encoding a CRAL-TRIO domain cause human Cayman ataxia and ataxia/dystonia in the jittery mouse."}},"rdfs:label":"Highly Inbred Cayman Island family"},{"id":"cggv:34c8f5fd-34b3-481a-8bb2-bc286eae3817","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34c8f5fd-34b3-481a-8bb2-bc286eae3817_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:34c8f5fd-34b3-481a-8bb2-bc286eae3817_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Bomar et al. reported that individuals with Cayman ataxia have two homozygous variants in ATCAY, one the missense variant S301R, and the other a splice site on intron 9.

Mutations in Atcay/ATCAY have been identified as causative of cerebellar disorders such as the rare hereditary disease Cayman ataxia in humans, generalized dystonia in the dystonic (dt) rat, and marked motor defects in three ataxic mouse lines. While several lines of evidence suggest that Caytaxin plays a critical role in maintaining nervous system processes, the physiological function of Caytaxin has not been fully characterized. In the study presented here, we generated novel specific monoclonal antibodies against full-length Caytaxin to examine endogenous Caytaxin expression in wild type and Atcay mutant mouse lines. Caytaxin protein is absent from brain tissues in the two severely ataxic Atcay(jit) (jittery) and Atcay(swd) (sidewinder) mutant lines, and markedly decreased in the mildly ataxic/dystonic Atcay(ji-hes) (hesitant) line, indicating a correlation between Caytaxin expression and disease severity. As the expression of wild type human Caytaxin in mutant sidewinder and jittery mice rescues the ataxic phenotype, Caytaxin's physiological function appears to be conserved between the human and mouse orthologs. Across multiple species and in several neuronal cell lines Caytaxin is expressed as several protein isoforms, the two largest of which are caused by the usage of conserved methionine translation start sites. The work described in this manuscript presents an initial characterization of the Caytaxin protein and its expression in wild type and several mutant mouse models. Utilizing these animal models of human Cayman Ataxia will now allow an in-depth analysis to elucidate Caytaxin's role in maintaining normal neuronal function.","dc:creator":"Sikora KM","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Expression of Caytaxin protein in Cayman Ataxia mouse models correlates with phenotype severity."},"rdfs:label":"Human ATCAY DNA rescue ataxic ATCAY mouse mutants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:8ec647a6-d421-4355-a001-52b87ddc59a9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:efee3571-79c8-45b1-83d3-9919e1559884","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Ataxia occurs in both mice and humans affected by biallelic variants in the ATCAY gene","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14556008","rdfs:label":"Jittery mice model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6263,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f6b02529-894d-4983-b90b-795003ca79f9","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0000437","gene":"hgnc:779","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"ATCAY encodes for Caytaxin, a neuronally restricted protein that is expressed specifically in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb (PMID: 17157273), where it recruits cholinergic machinery to neurite terminals to promote acetylcholine signaling and neuritogenesis (PMID: 26343454).\n\nATCAY was first reported in relation to Cayman Ataxia, due a high frequency of this disorder in a highly inbred area of Grand Cayman Island (PMID: 14556008).  It is characterized by prominent cerebellar dysfunction (ataxia, nystagmus, intention tremor, dysarthria), psychomotor retardation, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Genomic variants in this gene have been reported outside of the Cayman Island (PMIDs: 29449188, 33624863), therefore, all phenotypes listed above have been grouped as one disease entity: Cerebellar ataxia (MONDO: 0000437). \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental evidence. Summary of Case Level Data: 8 POINTS. This curation has 2 non-sense variants and one splice site variant in 3 unrelated probands from 3 publications (PMIDs: 14556008, 29449188, 33624863 ). This gene-disease association is supported by mouse models harboring ATCAY variants (jittery, sidewinder) that display an early onset ataxia that can be rescued with the expression of wild type human caytaxin (PMID: 23226316). \n\nIn summary, there is DEFINITIVE evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
