Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Review"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"1.5 pt (6-9 genes)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:fc7c6e4d-1a22-4ab4-b1d5-8de6bcc3b961_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc7b8f02-36fc-4b57-a1a5-be660664f617","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f79fe09f-75ed-4d90-8786-cc5f6299233f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"MPV17-deficient human fibroblasts, comparison of proliferating cells and quiescent cells. mtDNA levels were depleted and dNTP levels reduced in quiescent patient fibroblasts.  \nThis mtDNA depletion phenotype was rescued with dNTP supplementation.

Perturbations of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools are a recognized cause of mitochondrial genomic instability; therefore, we determined DNA copy number and dNTP levels in mitochondria of two models of MPV17 deficiency. In Mpv17 ablated mice, liver mitochondria showed substantial decreases in the levels of dGTP and dTTP and severe mitochondrial DNA depletion, whereas the dNTP pool was not significantly altered in kidney and brain mitochondria that had near normal levels of DNA. The shortage of mitochondrial dNTPs in Mpv17-/- liver slows the DNA replication in the organelle, as evidenced by the elevated level of replication intermediates. Quiescent fibroblasts of MPV17-mutant patients recapitulate key features of the primary affected tissue of the Mpv17-/- mice, displaying virtual absence of the protein, decreased dNTP levels and mitochondrial DNA depletion. Notably, the mitochondrial DNA loss in the patients' quiescent fibroblasts was prevented and rescued by deoxynucleoside supplementation. Thus, our study establishes dNTP insufficiency in the mitochondria as the cause of mitochondrial DNA depletion in MPV17 deficiency, and identifies deoxynucleoside supplementation as a potential therapeutic strategy for MPV17-related disease. Moreover, changes in the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial deoxynucleotide homeostasis indicate a remodeling of nucleotide metabolism in MPV17 disease models, which suggests mitochondria lacking functional MPV17 have a restricted purine mitochondrial salvage pathway.","dc:creator":"Dalla Rosa I","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"MPV17 Loss Causes Deoxynucleotide Insufficiency and Slow DNA Replication in Mitochondria."},"rdfs:label":"Patient fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"These data provide evidence that limited precursor availability for DNA synthesis is the underlying cause of the mtDNA depletion in MPV17 deficiency.

In 2006, pathogenic variants in MPV17 were first reported to cause infantile-onset hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion syndrome and Navajo neurohepatopathy. To date, 75 individuals with MPV17-related mtDNA maintenance defect have been reported with 39 different MPV17 pathogenic variants. In this report, we present an additional 25 affected individuals with nine novel MPV17 pathogenic variants. We summarize the clinical features of all 100 affected individuals and review the total 48 MPV17 pathogenic variants. The vast majority of affected individuals presented with an early-onset encephalohepatopathic disease characterized by hepatic and neurological manifestations, failure to thrive, lactic acidemia, and mtDNA depletion detected mainly in liver tissue. Rarely, MPV17 deficiency can cause a late-onset neuromyopathic disease characterized by myopathy and peripheral neuropathy with no or minimal liver involvement. Approximately half of the MPV17 pathogenic variants are missense. A genotype with biallelic missense variants, in particular homozygous p.R50Q, p.P98L, and p.R41Q, can carry a relatively better prognosis.","dc:creator":"El-Hattab AW","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"MPV17-related mitochondrial DNA maintenance defect: New cases and review of clinical, biochemical, and molecular aspects."}},"rdfs:label":"El-Hattab 2018:Family 12,, subject 14"},{"id":"cggv:bd8fb4af-1303-4d10-8b87-dda616c04258","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd8fb4af-1303-4d10-8b87-dda616c04258_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:bd8fb4af-1303-4d10-8b87-dda616c04258_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"exon 5/8, NMD expected"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:16e85aba-5e90-4ab0-b792-f9b7b11f3c82_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16e85aba-5e90-4ab0-b792-f9b7b11f3c82","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:b3899d29-110e-49c1-8273-2ed70b8b4f32","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002437.5(MPV17):c.122G>A (p.Arg41Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1575667"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"sensorimotor axonal neuropathy without hepatocerebral affection: Normal early motor and pubertal development.

The *MPV17* gene encodes a putative channel-forming protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in mitochondrial deoxynucleotide homeostasis and the maintenance of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). \n\nWhile various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MPV17*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the MPV17 phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nThe *MPV17* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2006 (PMID: 16582910) in an infant from a consanguineous family with liver failure and severe depletion of liver mtDNA.  Subsequent publications have reported over eighty families with *MPV17* variants. Most cases are characterised by an early onset, severe and often fatal liver failure with liver specific mtDNA depletion, although variability in the age of onset and severity has been reported. The Navajo founder variant, c.149A>G (p.Arg50Gln), has been associated with a phenotype spectrum of disease, even within families. Affected individuals homozygous for c.149A>G (p.Arg50Gln) may have either an infant or childhood onset of disease characterised by a spectrum of severe to moderate liver disease and progressive neuropathy. Additional features may include corneal ulcerations, acral mutilation, poor somatic development with sexual infantilism, and serious systemic infections. More than 100 variants have been associated with disease, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, indels, and splice variant, all of which are predicted or have been shown to lead to a loss of MPV17 function. \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included fourteen unique variants reported in fourteen cases from seven publications (PMIDs: 16582910, 29282788, 1690939, 29318572, 26437932, 30298599, 22508001). Variants included three frameshift, two nonsense, two splice variants and six missense variants. Two founder variants were curated: c.149A>G (p.Arg50Gln) in the Navajo population and c.106C>T (p.Gln36Ter) in the Black South African population. More evidence is available in the literature, but cases scored reached a maximum of 12 points. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mtDNA maintenance) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease. Mouse and zebrafish models recapitulate aspects of the liver phenotype associated with disease, together with altered mtDNA depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction (PMIDs: 1696177, 26760297, 24247928, 30833296). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MPV17* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 21, 2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fc7c6e4d-1a22-4ab4-b1d5-8de6bcc3b961"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
