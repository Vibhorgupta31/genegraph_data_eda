Using whole exome sequencing we identified four novel SLC25A22 mutations in six children from three families. Five patients presented clinical features similar to those in the literature including hypotonia, refractory neonatal-onset seizures and developmental delay. However, the sixth patients presented atypically with isolated developmental delay, developing late-onset (absence) seizures only at 7 years of age. Abnormal metabolite levels have not been documented in the nine patients described previously. One patient in our series was referred to the metabolic clinic because of persistent hyperprolinaemia and another three had raised plasma proline when tested. Analysis of the post-prandial plasma amino acid response in one patient showed abnormally high concentrations of several amino acids. This suggested that, in the fed state, when amino acids are the preferred fuel for the liver, trans-deamination of amino acids requires transportation of glutamate into liver mitochondria by SLC25A22 for deamination by glutamate dehydrogenase; SLC25A22 is an important mitochondrial glutamate transporter in liver as well as in brain. Electron microscopy of patient fibroblasts demonstrated widespread vacuolation containing neutral and phospho-lipids as demonstrated by Oil Red O and Sudan Black tinctorial staining; this might be explained by impaired activity of the proline/pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) shuttle if SLC25A22 transports pyrroline-5-carboxylate/glutamate-γ-semialdehyde as well as glutamate.","dc:creator":"Reid ES","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations in SLC25A22: hyperprolinaemia, vacuolated fibroblasts and presentation with developmental delay."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28255779","rdfs:label":"Patient 6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Two missense variants in trans in a proband, identified by WES.

Here, we report the genetic mapping of an autosomal recessive form of this condition to chromosome 11p15.5 and the identification of a missense mutation (p.Pro206Leu) in the gene encoding one of the two mitochondrial glutamate/H(+) symporters (SLC25A22, also known as \"GC1\").

Functional analyses showed that glutamate oxidation in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients was strongly defective. Further studies in reconstituted proteoliposomes showed defective [(14)C]glutamate uniport and [(14)C]glutamate/glutamate exchange by mutant protein. Moreover, expression studies showed that, during human development, SLC25A22 is specifically expressed in the brain, within territories proposed to contribute to the genesis and control of myoclonic seizures.

The interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) shows a \"suppression burst\" (SB) pattern. The prognosis is usually poor and most children die within the first two years or survive with very severe intellectual disabilities. EIEE type 3 is caused by variants affecting function, in SLC25A22, which is also responsible for epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS). We report a family with a less severe phenotype of EIEE type 3. We performed exome sequencing and identified two unreported variants in SLC25A22 in the compound heterozygous state: NM_024698.4: c.[813_814delTG];[818 G>A] (p.[Ala272Glnfs*144];[Arg273Lys]). Functional studies in cultured skin fibroblasts from a patient showed that glutamate oxidation was strongly defective, based on a literature review. We clustered the 18 published patients (including those from this family) into three groups according to the severity of the SLC25A22-related disorders. In an attempt to identify genotype-phenotype correlations, we compared the variants according to the location depending on the protein domains. We observed that patients with two variants located in helical transmembrane domains presented a severe phenotype, whereas patients with at least one variant outside helical transmembrane domains presented a milder phenotype. These data are suggestive of a continuum of disorders related to SLC25A22 that could be called SLC25A22-related disorders.

Two methods were used to isolate brain mitochondria. One method excludes synaptosomes and the organelles may therefore be enriched in astrocytic mitochondria. The other method isolates mitochondria derived from all regions of the brain. Immunological and enzymatic methods were used to measure enzymes and carriers in the different preparations, in addition to studying transport kinetics. Immunohistochemistry was also employed using brain slices to confirm cell type specificity of enzymes and carriers. The data suggest that the aspartate/glutamate carriers (AGC) are expressed predominantly in neurons, not astrocytes, and that one of two glutamate/hydroxyl carriers is expressed predominantly in astrocytes. The GABA carrier and the oxoglutarate carrier appear to be equally distributed in astrocytes and neurons. As expected, pyruvate carboxylase and branched-chain aminotransferase were predominantly astrocytic. Insofar as the aspartate/glutamate exchange carriers are required for the malate/aspartate shuttle and for reoxidation of cytosolic NADH, the data suggest a compartmentation of glucose metabolism in which astrocytes catalyze glycolytic conversion of glucose to lactate, whereas neurons are capable of oxidizing both lactate and glucose to CO(2) + H(2)O.","dc:creator":"Berkich DA","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Mitochondrial transport proteins of the brain."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in astrocytic mitochondria using rat brain tissue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Per discussion with ClinGen Epilepsy Expert Group - upgrade to 1 point because the expression is specific to a subcellular location within the relevant tissue and results show expected functional effect on glutamate transport into mitochrondria of the astrocytes"},{"id":"cggv:a1159e26-4f80-4a6a-bb35-b908ae99f566","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:896e265c-8d13-4b19-8e94-e1178a2cae2d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Mutations in the SLC25A12, which encodes the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform 1 (AGC1), were identified in patients presenting a developmental delay, hypotonia and intractable seizures associated with a global hypomyelination in the brain.

Mutations of the mitochondrial glutamate carrier SLC25A22 (also named GC1) have been identified in early epileptic encephalopathy (EEE) and migrating partial seizures in infancy (MPSI) but the pathophysiological mechanism of GC1 deficiency is still unknown, hampered by the absence of an in vivo model. This carrier is mainly expressed in astrocytes and is the principal gate for glutamate entry into mitochondria. A sufficient supply of energy is essential for the proper function of the brain and mitochondria have a pivotal role in maintaining energy homeostasis. In this work, we wanted to study the consequences of GC1 absence in an in vitro model in order to understand if glutamate catabolism and/or mitochondrial function could be affected. First, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to specifically silence GC1 were validated in rat C6 glioma cells. Silencing GC1 in C6 resulted in a reduction of the GC1 mRNA combined with a decrease of the mitochondrial glutamate carrier activity. Then, primary astrocyte cultures were prepared and transfected with shRNA-GC1 or mismatch-RNA (mmRNA) constructs using the Neon® Transfection System in order to target a high number of primary astrocytes, more than 64%. Silencing GC1 in primary astrocytes resulted in a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (Phosphate) (NAD(P)H) formation upon glutamate stimulation. We also observed that the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) was functional after glucose stimulation but not activated by glutamate, resulting in a lower level of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in silenced astrocytes compared to control cells. Moreover, GC1 inactivation resulted in an intracellular glutamate accumulation. Our results show that mitochondrial glutamate transport via GC1 is important in sustaining glutamate homeostasis in astrocytes.
