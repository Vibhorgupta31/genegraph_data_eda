Unlike the more common dominant and sporadic forms of aniridia, there has been no significant association with PAX6 mutations in individuals with GS and the mode of inheritance of the disease had long been regarded as uncertain. Using a combination of trio-based whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing in five simplex GS-affected families, we found homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations (c.4672C>T [p.Gln1558(∗)], c.2182C>T [p.Arg728(∗)], c.6366+3A>T [p.Gly2102Valfs5(∗)], and c.6664+5G>T [p.Ala2221Valfs23(∗)]) and de novo heterozygous mutations (c.7687_7689del [p.Lys2563del] and c.7659T>G [p.Phe2553Leu]) in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 gene (ITPR1). ITPR1 encodes one of the three members of the IP3-receptors family that form Ca(2+) release channels localized predominantly in membranes of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. The truncation mutants, which encompass the IP3-binding domain and varying lengths of the modulatory domain, did not form functional channels when produced in a heterologous cell system. Furthermore, ITPR1 p.Lys2563del mutant did not form IP3-induced Ca(2+) channels but exerted a negative effect when co-produced with wild-type ITPR1 channel activity. In total, these results demonstrate biallelic and monoallelic ITPR1 mutations as the underlying genetic defects for Gillespie syndrome, further extending the spectrum of ITPR1-related diseases.

All causative variants to date affect the central or the 3'-terminal domains of ITPR1 gene and exhibit autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance pattern. We investigated by exome sequencing the molecular cause of GLSP in a family composed by consanguineous healthy parents, two affected siblings and one healthy son. We found the novel splice site variant c.278_279 + 2delACGT located at the 5'-end of ITPR1. The affected siblings were homozygotes, their parents heterozygous carriers and the variant was absent in the healthy son, indicating a recessive inheritance pattern. The deletion abolished the splice-donor site at exon 5/intron 5 junction, causing the skipping of exon 5 and the generation of a premature STOP codon. The mutation is predicted to result in the synthesis of a 64-amino acids nonfunctional protein. The mutant transcript comprised >96% of ITPR1 mRNA in the affected siblings, indicating that a small amount of wild-type transcript was still present. The novel autosomal recessive mutation here reported is the first variant affecting the ITPR1 N-terminal suppressor domain, thus extending the spectrum of the pathogenetic variants in GLSP and the range of the associated clinical manifestations.","dc:creator":"Paganini L","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"A novel splice site variant in ITPR1 gene underlying recessive Gillespie syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"II-1"},{"id":"cggv:181fa543-7e28-4e3f-a214-a3c723d09283","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:181fa543-7e28-4e3f-a214-a3c723d09283_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"+0.5 phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d05cb7a9-bded-4b60-9465-80941585d474_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d05cb7a9-bded-4b60-9465-80941585d474","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c1717273-3c48-4831-bdb2-0a5a24eebe4e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001378452.1(ITPR1):c.4699C>T (p.Gln1567Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10581491"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0001290","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0000526"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:be4c6d41-1260-4549-8884-07ae90aa2492_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c1717273-3c48-4831-bdb2-0a5a24eebe4e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27108797"},"rdfs:label":"F1"},{"id":"cggv:be4c6d41-1260-4549-8884-07ae90aa2492","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be4c6d41-1260-4549-8884-07ae90aa2492_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e43bc1b6-656e-4f8e-aeed-5c39fac10624_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:f785d3d2-9eb8-4251-a406-3996989ef54d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f785d3d2-9eb8-4251-a406-3996989ef54d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:33d239e5-50c6-48e5-a883-cf96695eae82","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000257.4(MYH7):c.4588C>G (p.Arg1530Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA042978"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0000526","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0002080","obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0002342"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:984d7e46-e819-4267-a6a8-1ef7b0352b39_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:33d239e5-50c6-48e5-a883-cf96695eae82"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29169895","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Gillespie syndrome (GS) [MIM: 206700] is a very rare condition characterized by bilateral iris defect, congenital hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia and intellectual disability.

(PMID: 27108797) and McEntagart et al. (PMID: 27108798). Clinical features include iris aniridia/hypoplasia, congenital hypotonia, progressive cerebellar ataxia, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. The proposed mechanism of disease for both forms of Gillespie Syndrome is a dominant-negative effect of variants located within the transmembrane and ion transport domains of ITPR1 (PMID: 27108798). As per the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting criteria, autosomal dominant and recessive forms of aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-intellectual disability syndrome were assessed separately due to different molecular mechanisms (i.e., missense vs. predicted null variants, respectively; PMID: 27108797). There is case-level data evidence supporting the association between autosomal recessive aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-intellectual disability syndrome and *ITPR1*. This curation includes six variants in seven individuals across three publications (PMIDs: 27108797, 29169895, 29663667) for a score of 12 points for genetic evidence.\n\nOf note, point mutations in the ligand transferase, IP3 binding, and RyR & IP3R homology domains of ITPR1 have been definitively associated with autosomal dominant Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 29 (PMID: 27108798, 28620721). Spinocerebellar Ataxia 29 presents with congenital cerebellar ataxia, infantile-onset hypotonia, dysarthria, gross motor development, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and was first implicated with ITPR1 in 2012 by Huang et al. (PMID: 22986007).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence of the relationship between *ITPR1* and autosomal recessive aniridia-cerebellar ataxia-intellectual disability syndrome. This has been demonstrated in multiple research and clinical settings and has been validated over time.
