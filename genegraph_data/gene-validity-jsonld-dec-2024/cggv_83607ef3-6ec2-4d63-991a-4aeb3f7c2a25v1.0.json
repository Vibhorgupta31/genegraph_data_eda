The main goals of this study were to screen for novel mutations and to analyze mutations for effects on protein structure and function. We screened 464 subjects including 76 probands by direct sequencing or conformation-sensitive capillary electrophoresis. We analyzed the effects of all known and novel mutations using a combination of splice site recognition, evolutionary conservation, secondary and tertiary structure predictions, PolyPhen, and pMut and sift. We identified a total of 26 novel mutations in PRKCSH (n = 14) and SEC63 (n = 12), including four splice site mutations, eight insertions/ deletions, six non-sense mutations, and eight missense mutations. Out of 48 PCLD mutations, 13 were predicted to affect splicing. Most mutations were located in highly conserved regions and homology modeling for two domains of Sec63p showed severe effects of the residue substitutions. In conclusion, we identified 26 novel mutations associated with PCLD and we provide in silico analysis in order to delineate the role of these mutations.","dc:creator":"Waanders E","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Secondary and tertiary structure modeling reveals effects of novel mutations in polycystic liver disease genes PRKCSH and SEC63."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20095989","rdfs:label":"p.R139H"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This variant is found in 450/282872 alleles in gnomAD.

The causative genes are known for fewer than 40% of PCLD index cases. Here, we have used whole exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 102 unrelated patients who were excluded for mutations in the 2 most common PCLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, to identify heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in 3 additional genes, ALG8, GANAB, and SEC61B. Similarly to PRKCSH and SEC63, these genes encode proteins that are integral to the protein biogenesis pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. We inactivated these candidate genes in cell line models to show that loss of function of each results in defective maturation and trafficking of polycystin-1, the central determinant of cyst pathogenesis. Despite acting in a common pathway, each PCLD gene product demonstrated distinct effects on polycystin-1 biogenesis. We also found enrichment on a genome-wide basis of heterozygous mutations in the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease gene PKHD1, indicating that adult PKHD1 carriers can present with clinical PCLD.

We previously studied two large kindreds and reported localization of a gene for ADPLD to an approximately 8-Mb region, flanked by markers D19S586/D19S583 and D19S593/D19S579, on chromosome 19p13.2-13.1. Expansion of these kindreds and identification of an additional family allowed us to define flanking markers CA267 and CA048 in an approximately 3-Mb region containing >70 candidate genes. We used a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing to screen a panel of 15 unrelated affected individuals for mutations in genes from this interval. We found sequence variations in a known gene, PRKCSH, that were not observed in control individuals, that segregated with the disease haplotype, and that were predicted to be chain-terminating mutations. In contrast to PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1, PRKCSH encodes a previously described human protein termed \"protein kinase C substrate 80K-H\" or \"noncatalytic beta-subunit of glucosidase II.\" This protein is highly conserved, is expressed in all tissues tested, and contains a leader sequence, an LDLa domain, two EF-hand domains, and a conserved C-terminal HDEL sequence. Its function may be dependent on calcium binding, and its putative actions include the regulation of N-glycosylation of proteins and signal transduction via fibroblast growth-factor receptor. In light of the focal nature of liver cysts in ADPLD, the apparent loss-of-function mutations in PRKCSH, and the two-hit mechanism operational in dominant polycystic kidney disease, ADPLD may also occur by a two-hit mechanism.","dc:creator":"Li A","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in PRKCSH cause isolated autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12529853","rdfs:label":"II:9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Additional family found with variant in PMID 20095989"},{"id":"cggv:45b03dc6-3a9d-4f3a-88b9-37d85d189dbf_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9b02109-8071-447b-bea9-e399ffc85015","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Clinically defined PCLD in which each proband had at least 10 liver cysts and did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for ADPKD.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000006","obo:HP_0006557","obo:HP_0000113"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:45b03dc6-3a9d-4f3a-88b9-37d85d189dbf_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b6e0a280-48fe-466d-ba5b-8e7d8408f68e"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28375157"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28375157","rdfs:label":"FINN63"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Variant already curated under PMID 12529853"},{"id":"cggv:25668e5c-312c-4103-9365-b64aad051cce_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2819810d-6803-4d4b-a127-1c9193887aa8","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Fine linkage mapping was used to define exon region.\nExon screening was carried out for 677 exons in the region defined by linkage analysis.\nPRKCH variants were confirmed by segregation and also restriction digest using Ban1 for Families 1-3 and  Dde1 for family 4.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"PCLD was diagnosed in those who exhibited at least four hepatic cysts on ultrasonography.

Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease due to PRKCSH mutations (ADPLD-PRKCSH) is diagnosed in adults with a family history of liver cysts, under age 40 with any number of liver cysts and individuals over the age of 40 with four or more liver cysts. Kidney cysts are present in approximately 28-35% of cases with absent to mild kidney disease and no association with progression to end stage renal disease (PMID 12529853, PMID 15057895, PMID 29038287). At least nine unique variants (e.g. nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data , population data and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least nine probands and in at least 5 publications (PMID 12529853, PMID 12577059, PMID 15057895, PMID 20095989, PMID 28375157). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 109 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous loss of function (PMID 12529853) with a secondary somatic hit resulting in loss of heterozygosity suggested (PMID 21856269). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies in cell models, patient derived samples, and mouse models. In summary, PRKCSH is definitively associated with AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT POLYCYSTIC LIVER DISEASE. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on July 8th 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:83607ef3-6ec2-4d63-991a-4aeb3f7c2a25"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
