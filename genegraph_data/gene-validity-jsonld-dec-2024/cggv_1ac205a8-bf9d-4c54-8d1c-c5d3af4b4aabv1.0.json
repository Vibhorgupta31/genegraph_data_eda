Although five BBS genes have been cloned, the molecular basis of this syndrome remains elusive. Here we show that BBS is probably caused by a defect at the basal body of ciliated cells. We have cloned a new BBS gene, BBS8, which encodes a protein with a prokaryotic domain, pilF, involved in pilus formation and twitching mobility. In one family, a homozygous null BBS8 mutation leads to BBS with randomization of left-right body axis symmetry, a known defect of the nodal cilium. We have also found that BBS8 localizes specifically to ciliated structures, such as the connecting cilium of the retina and columnar epithelial cells in the lung. In cells, BBS8 localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies and interacts with PCM1, a protein probably involved in ciliogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that all available Caenorhabditis elegans BBS homologues are expressed exclusively in ciliated neurons, and contain regulatory elements for RFX, a transcription factor that modulates the expression of genes associated with ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport.","dc:creator":"Ansley SJ","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Basal body dysfunction is a likely cause of pleiotropic Bardet-Biedl syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Ansley_BB12_II:1"},{"id":"cggv:16b12109-6ed9-4bb1-bd80-ef50cf91c747","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16b12109-6ed9-4bb1-bd80-ef50cf91c747_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:16b12109-6ed9-4bb1-bd80-ef50cf91c747_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT_PCR of BBS8 was performed using renal tubular cells and skin fibroblasts from patients BB12-04 and -05 and their unaffected sister BB12-06—who is heterozygous for the mutation.

To date, mutations in 21 genes have been linked to BBS. The products of eight of these BBS genes form a stable octameric complex termed the BBSome. Mutations in BBS8, a component of the BBSome, cause early vision loss, but the role of BBS8 in supporting vision is not known. To understand the mechanisms by which BBS8 supports rod and cone photoreceptor function, we generated animal models lacking BBS8. The loss of BBS8 protein led to concomitant decrease in the levels of BBSome subunits, BBS2 and BBS5 and increase in the levels of the BBS1 and BBS4 subunits. BBS8 ablation was associated with severe reduction of rod and cone photoreceptor function and progressive degeneration of each photoreceptor subtype. We observed disorganized and shortened photoreceptor outer segments (OS) at post-natal day 10 as the OS elaborates. Interestingly, loss of BBS8 led to changes in the distribution of photoreceptor axonemal proteins and hyper-acetylation of ciliary microtubules. In contrast to properly localized phototransduction machinery, we observed OS accumulation of syntaxin3, a protein normally found in the cytoplasm and the synaptic termini. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate the requirement for BBS8 in early development and elaboration of ciliated photoreceptor OS, explaining the need for BBS8 in normal vision. The findings from our study also imply that early targeting of both rods and cones in BBS8 patients is crucial for successful restoration of vision.","dc:creator":"Dilan TL","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome-8 (BBS8) protein is crucial for the development of outer segments in photoreceptor neurons."},"rdfs:label":"Dilan_MouseModel"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:07151c1c-69f8-4fc0-9b17-1332dac273ab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b8f20eb-b0bd-4c0e-a1ab-7c1210a1a4c6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"BBS8-deficient retina degenerate rapidly and the mice are mostly blind after less than 6 months of age.

BBS is a rare genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy, characterized by rod-cone dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, genital anomalies, renal anomalies, and intellectual disabilities.\n\nThis curation includes four variants (three disrupting splicing and one frameshift) that have been reported in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 14520415, 16308660, 19797195). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies from Ansley et. al. showing that *TTC8* is expressed in the basal body of cilium, as BBS is known to be caused by dysfunction of primary cilia (PMID: 14520415). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that TTC8 protein co-localizes with PCM1 and BBS4, which are encoded by two genes that have previously been implicated in BBS. Finally, two *Ttc8* knockout mouse models by Kretschmer et. al. and Dilan et. al. show that absence of the Ttc8 protein in mice results in rapid and severe retinal degeneration as seen in human BBS patients (PMIDs: 30901771, 29126234).\n\nIn summary, *TTC8* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive TTC8-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
