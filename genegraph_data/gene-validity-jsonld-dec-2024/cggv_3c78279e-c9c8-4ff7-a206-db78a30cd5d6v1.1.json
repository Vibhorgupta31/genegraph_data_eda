OI type 2 is a lethal type of osteogenesis imperfecta, characterized by increased bone fragility, with many perinatal fractures, severe bowing of long bones, under mineralization, and death in the perinatal period. *COL1A2* has been noted to be associated with multiple disease entities. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities,  osteogenesis imperfecta type II (OMIM:166210), osteogenesis imperfecta type III (OMIM:259420), osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV (OMIM:166220), Combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 2\t(OMIM:619120), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 2 (OMIM:617821), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cardiac valvular type (OMIM:225320), and Osteoporosis, postmenopausal.  At least 15 variants (missense, small deletion) that have been reported in 14 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 1301191, 1284475, 8424758, 11668615, 31299979, 9923651, 7906591, 7959683, 7891382) are included in this curation. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, *COL1A2* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 2/7/22 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3c78279e-c9c8-4ff7-a206-db78a30cd5d6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
