Five multi-subunit complexes in the inner membrane of the organelle are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation required for ATP production.

For this reason, the expression of mtDNA is vital for the assembly and functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Defects of the mechanisms regulating mtDNA gene expression have been associated with deficiencies in assembly of these complexes, resulting in mitochondrial diseases. Recently, numerous factors involved in these processes have been identified and characterized leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie mitochondrial diseases.","dc:creator":"D'Souza AR","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial transcription and translation: overview."},"rdfs:label":"Overview of mitochondrial transcription and translation "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"13 OXPHOS polypeptides in mtDNA which is >10 genes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d035d0c2-f0c9-4767-b833-99be610d3e46_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c953a754-206f-48b8-9aa4-8318a43e9654","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13556486-0063-4586-b1eb-7bd3f1696e2b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Notes: A22G = (T5874C),  G15A (C5877T), U54C = (A5843G)\n\nTyrosylation studies compared to wild type\nA22G (T5874C)= 600 fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km)\nG15A  (C5877T)= 40 fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km)\nU54C (A5843G) = roughly wild type (1.8 fold reduction)\n\nStructural probing with S1 and T1 Nucleases and PB2+cleavage\n\nU54C (A5843G) and wild-type patterns are globally similar (cf.

Here, we report biochemical investigations on three mt-tRNA(Tyr) molecules with point substitutions associated with diseases. The mutations occur in the atypical T- and D-loops at positions homologous to those involved in the tertiary interaction network of canonical tRNAs. They do not correspond to tyrosine identity positions and likely do not contact the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase during the aminoacylation process. The impact of these substitutions on mt-tRNA(Tyr) tyrosylation and structure was investigated using the corresponding tRNA transcripts. In vitro tyrosylation efficiency is decreased 600-fold for mutant A22G (mitochondrial gene mutation T5874C), 40-fold for G15A (C5877T), and is without significant effect on U54C (A5843G). Comparative solution probings with lead and nucleases on mutant and wild-type tRNA(Tyr) molecules reveal a greater sensitivity to single-strand specific probes for mutants G15A and A22G. For both transcripts, the mutation triggers a structural destabilization in the D-loop that propagates toward the anticodon arm and thus hinders efficient tyrosylation. Further probing analysis combined with phylogenetic data support the participation of G15 and A22 in the tertiary network of human mt-tRNA(Tyr) via nonclassical Watson-Crick G15-C48 and G13-A22 pairings. In contrast, the pathogenic effect of the tyrosylable mutant U54C, where structure is only marginally affected, has to be sought at another level of the tRNA(Tyr) life cycle.","dc:creator":"Bonnefond L","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Decreased aminoacylation in pathology-related mutants of mitochondrial tRNATyr is associated with structural perturbations in tRNA architecture."},"rdfs:label":"In vitro tyrosylation assays of  T5874C, C5877T, A5843G"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score additional 1 point (0.5 for impressive reduction in tyrosylation for m.5874T>C + 0.5 for structural probing differences)\n\nm.5877T>C data is included here but will be scored with case data "},{"id":"cggv:4cb5a871-8fa3-463b-9928-1b7306479a95","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67101a30-78e1-4fd5-a802-449731d76bbf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"BN PAGE in muscle : decreased assembly of fully assembled complex I, normal assembly complex II, III, IV, V \n(score 0.5 in Experimental (patient cells0 data)\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32684384","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-related diseases often pose a diagnostic challenge and require rigorous clinical and laboratory investigation.

We used a quantitative oligonucleotide ligation assay to establish the degree of heteroplasmy in blood and tissue samples from affected dogs and controls. Affected dogs and their first to fourth degree relatives had 0-11% wild-type (wt) sequence, while more distant relatives ranged between 5% and 60% wt sequence and all unrelated golden retrievers had 100% wt sequence.

Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n\n*MT-TY* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 2000 (PMID:11071502), in a 36-year-old woman with exercise intolerance, mild muscle weakness, and ptosis. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TY*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TY* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven unique variants including two deletions (m.5835G>A, m.5860_5861del, m.5865T>C, m.5874T>C, m.5877C>T, m.5888del, m.5889A>G) observed in seven probands across seven publications (PMIDs: 11071502, 11756614, 11594340, 33279411, 30643656, 32684384, 32485333). Of note, the m.5843A>G variant was excluded from scoring given its population frequency and lack of impact on tyrosylation (PMIDs: 14598342, 18268021). Age of onset in affected individuals is variable and clinical features seen include myopathy with or without ophthalmoplegia. There is at least one case report with a more severe phenotype with neuropathy, ataxia, seizures, myoclonus, sensorineural hearing loss, and pigmentary retinopathy (PMID:33279411). Muscle biopsy in affected individuals has shown COX-negative and ragged red fibers, with variable mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies. The variants in affected individuals are often present at highest heteroplasmy levels in muscle and may be undetectable in other tissues such as blood and buccal tissue. Multiple single fiber studies were performed in these patients and supportive of variant pathogenicity (PMIDs: 11071502, 11756614, 32684384). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.  This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in patient cells and non-patient cells, and models (PMIDs: 30030363, 18268021, 32684384, 3295486, 19492087). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 16, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
