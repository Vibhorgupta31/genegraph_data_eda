By combining the results of diagnostic testing of 49,684 individuals, we identified 24 microdeletions that affect at least one exon of AUTS2, as well as one translocation and one inversion each with a breakpoint within the AUTS2 locus. Comparison of 17 well-characterized individuals enabled identification of a variable syndromic phenotype including ID, autism, short stature, microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and facial dysmorphisms. The dysmorphic features were more pronounced in persons with 3'AUTS2 deletions. This part of the gene is shown to encode a C-terminal isoform (with an alternative transcription start site) expressed in the human brain. Consistent with our genetic data, suppression of auts2 in zebrafish embryos caused microcephaly that could be rescued by either the full-length or the C-terminal isoform of AUTS2. Our observations demonstrate a causal role of AUTS2 in neurocognitive disorders, establish a hitherto unappreciated syndromic phenotype at this locus, and show how transcriptional complexity can underpin human pathology. The zebrafish model provides a valuable tool for investigating the etiology of AUTS2 syndrome and facilitating gene-function analysis in the future.","dc:creator":"Beunders G","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Exonic deletions in AUTS2 cause a syndromic form of intellectual disability and suggest a critical role for the C terminus."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332918","rdfs:label":"Case 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c86faea8-d62e-490e-bd1f-68a4e93e4575_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:484ca497-678d-4c60-95b8-8af8b8b81e13","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":32,"detectionMethod":"Array platform: Agilent, 105k; confirmed by MLPA","firstTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:c86faea8-d62e-490e-bd1f-68a4e93e4575_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:98fae507-1c4f-4fb3-83b4-951a729a5f1c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000007.14:g.(70435782_70698569)_(70766334_70768023)del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/133344"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332918"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332918","rdfs:label":"Case 9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:582999f6-b3b4-46de-90a0-8f44e22df469_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6349fe98-0341-4df6-9782-ef9b738fa18b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cdd7ccff-3523-4476-8aaf-e6eabbea8044","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"Array Platform: custom Agilent, 105k; confirmed by FISH","firstTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","phenotypeFreeText":"tight heel cords","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0100021","obo:HP_0000431","obo:HP_0000286","obo:HP_0007018","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000160","obo:HP_0000252"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6349fe98-0341-4df6-9782-ef9b738fa18b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:d10c26ca-5da5-47b0-8929-48acf9925e28","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000007.13:g.69955482_70217682del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/183400"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332918"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332918","rdfs:label":"Case 7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantNullVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:582999f6-b3b4-46de-90a0-8f44e22df469_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:557c557b-195f-448d-b9b8-faf8fe227f04_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f89beaf-cdfa-4864-8b00-d3ed75928f4b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"Array platform: SignatureChipOS®\nv2.0 12-plex; confirmation by FISH.

Although AUTS2 is often disrupted in patients with neuronal disorders, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis is unclear. We investigated the role of AUTS2 as part of a previously identified PRC1 complex (PRC1-AUTS2), and in the context of neurodevelopment. In contrast to the canonical role of PRC1 in gene repression, PRC1-AUTS2 activates transcription. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the CK2 component of PRC1-AUTS2 neutralizes PRC1 repressive activity, whereas AUTS2-mediated recruitment of P300 leads to gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that AUTS2 regulates neuronal gene expression through promoter association. Conditional targeting of Auts2 in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) leads to various developmental defects. These findings reveal a natural means of subverting PRC1 activity, linking key epigenetic modulators with neuronal functions and diseases.

Affected individuals present with intellectual disability, microcephaly, feeding problems, and mild dysmorphic features. Numerous variants including genomic rearrangements, whole-gene deletions, intragenic deletions and duplications, and loss of function sequence variants have been described (PMID: 22872102, 23650183, 26545289, and 24459036). The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, rescue experiments, and expression studies. In summary, AUTS2 is definitively associated with syndromic intellectual disability.
