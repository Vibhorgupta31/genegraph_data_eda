Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"MT-TR Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Score upgraded for the shared number of genes with shared function (as per MD-GCEP guidelines).

The full mtDNA genome for each cybrid line was determined and compared to detect variants, taking C57BL/6J as their reference. This revealed two variants in the NIH3T3 mtDNA: m.9461T>C, which results in a synonymous substitution in mt-Nd3, and mt-Tr m.9821insAA. ND3 transcript levels were not affected by the synonymous variant (Fig. S3), suggesting that any functional differences observed are due to the dinucleotide insertion in mt-Tr. \n\nThe authors found that the NIH3T3 cybrids generated significantly higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than their reference strain (Fig. 2A). This was accompanied by increases in catalase activity (a proxy for ROS protective genes, Fig. 2B) and the mtDNA/nDNA ratio (Fig. 2C). Given that ROS are known to induce mitochondrial proliferation, they treated cells with one of two antioxidants (NAC or Tiron), and found that H2O2 production and the mtDNA/nDNA ratio were equivalent across all strains. \n\nThey also tested MRC enzyme activity and O2 consumption rates across their lines. No significant differences of MRC enzyme activity were observed (Figs. 1B, 4), nor were any differences observed for O2 consumption (Fig. 1A). However, when treated with NAC or Tiron, the O2 consumption rates dropped in the NIH3T3 cells compared to the reference. This suggests that an underlying respiratory defect was being masked by increased proliferation of mitochondria in response to ROS. \n\nFurther evidence for this comes from differences in growth rates on glucose vs galactose medium. Under normal conditions, there were no significant differences in cell doubling time for NIH3T3 cells grown in either media (Fig. 1C, panel 1). However, when NAC was added to the media, the doubling time was ~2.5-fold longer; the addition of Tiron abolished growth on galactose (Fig. 1C, panels 2, 3). No similar effect was observed for the reference strain, suggesting that cells carrying the m.9821insAA variant require ROS-induced mt proliferation to survive on galactose. \n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17013393","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes in humans and mice have been associated with various phenotypes, including learning performance and disease penetrance.

Here, using cell lines carrying four different common mouse mtDNA haplotypes in an identical nuclear background, we show that the similar level of respiration among the cell lines is only apparent and is a consequence of compensatory mechanisms triggered by different production of reactive oxygen species. We observe that the respiration capacity per molecule of mtDNA in cells with the NIH3T3 or NZB mtDNA is lower than in those with the C57BL/6J, CBA/J or BALB/cJ mtDNA. In addition, we have determined the genetic element underlying these differences.

The *MT-TR* gene encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) for arginine. Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n\n*MT-TR* was first reported in relation to maternally inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 2004 in an individual with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (PMID: 15286228). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TR*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TR* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-TR* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants (m.10406G>A, m.10437G>A, m.10438A>G, m.10450A>G) in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 15286228, 17588757, 19809478, 22781096). Cybrid studies (PMID: 19809478) and single fiber testing (PMID: 22781096) further supported the pathogenicity of several of these variants. Age of onset was in childhood and features seen in affected individuals included muscle weakness, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, global developmental delay and regression, pigmentary retinopathy, optic atrophy, renal insufficiency, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers and COX-negative fibers and variable respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function due to altered RNA secondary structure. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function and in vitro functional assays demonstrating reduced rates of mitochondrial translation as a result of variants in *MT-TR* (PMIDs: 19809478, 33340416).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *MT-TR* and primary mitochondrial disease. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 4, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
