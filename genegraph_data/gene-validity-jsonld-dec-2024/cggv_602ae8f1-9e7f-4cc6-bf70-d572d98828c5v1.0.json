Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we have screened 100 hypopigmentation genes in OCA or OA patients and identified four HPS-1, one HPS-3, one HPS-4, one HPS-5, and three HPS-6. The HPS-4 case is the first report in the Chinese population. Among these 20 mutational alleles, 16 were previously unreported alleles (6 in HPS1, 1 in HPS3, 2 in HPS4, 2 in HPS5, and 5 in HPS6). BLOC-2 and BLOC-3 were destabilized due to the mutation of these HPS genes which are so far the only reported causative genes in Chinese HPS patients, in which HPS-1 and HPS-6 are the most common subtypes.

In this paper, we exploit melanocytes from mouse HPS models to place BLOC-2 within a cargo transport pathway from recycling endosomal domains to maturing melanosomes. In BLOC-2-deficient melanocytes, the melanosomal protein TYRP1 was largely depleted from pigment granules and underwent accelerated recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane and to the Golgi. By live-cell imaging, recycling endosomal tubules of wild-type melanocytes made frequent and prolonged contacts with maturing melanosomes; in contrast, tubules from BLOC-2-deficient cells were shorter in length and made fewer, more transient contacts with melanosomes. These results support a model in which BLOC-2 functions to direct recycling endosomal tubular transport intermediates to maturing melanosomes and thereby promote cargo delivery and optimal pigmentation.

The mutant phenotype can be initially observed in tadpoles after stage 39/40, when mutant embryos display markedly reduced pigmentation in the retina and the trunk. By tadpole stage 50 almost all pigmented melanophores have disappeared. Most interestingly, those embryos fail entirely to make pigmented iridophores. The combined reduction/absence of both pigmented iridophores and melanophores renders these embryos virtually transparent, permitting one to easily observe both the developing internal organs and nervous system; accordingly, we named this mutant no privacy (nop). We identified the causative genetic lesion as occurring in the Xenopus homolog of the human Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome 6 (HPS6) gene, combining several approaches that utilized conventional gene mapping and classical and modern genetic tools available in Xenopus (gynogenesis, BAC transgenesis and TALEN-mediated mutagenesis). The nop allele contains a 10-base deletion that results in truncation of the Hps6 protein. In humans, HPS6 is one of the genes responsible for the congenital disease HPS, pathological symptoms of which include oculocutaneous albinism caused by defects in lysosome-related organelles required for pigment formation. Markers for melanin-producing neural crest cells show that the cells that would give rise to melanocytes are present in nop, though unpigmented. Abnormalities develop at tadpole stages in the pigmented retina when overall pigmentation becomes reduced and large multi-melanosomes are first formed. Ear development is also affected in nop embryos when both zygotic and maternal hsp6 is mutated: otoliths are often reduced or abnormal in morphology, as seen in some mouse HPS mutations, but to our knowledge not described in the BLOC-2 subset of HPS mutations nor described in non-mammalian systems previously. The transparency of the nop line suggests that these animals will aid studies of early organogenesis during tadpole stages. In addition, because of advantages of the Xenopus system for assessing gene expression, cell biological mechanisms, and the ontogeny of melanosome and otolith formation, this should be a highly useful model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of the HPS phenotype and the underlying biology of lysosome-related organelle function.","dc:creator":"Nakayama T","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"no privacy, a Xenopus tropicalis mutant, is a model of human Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome and allows visualization of internal organogenesis during tadpole development."},"rdfs:label":"nop Frogs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"An ENU screen identified a mutation in the Xenopus homolog of HPS6; the nop allele contains a 10-base deletion resulting in truncation of the Hps6 protein.

HPS is characterized by platelet dysfunction and oculocutaneous albinism, with diffuse hypopigmentation of the hair, skin, iris, and retina that leads to reduced visual acuity and nystagmus. Due to impaired platelet function, patients with HPS frequently suffer epistaxis or easy bruising, but might also experience more severe bleeding episodes, especially menorrhagia or postpartum bleeding. At least 39 unique variants including missense, nonsense, splice site, frameshift and large deletions have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been curated for 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 12548288, 30387913, 19843503, 27917594). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member (PMID: 27917594). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its interaction with HPS5 in the BLOC-2 complex (PMID: 12548288), which has a biochemical function in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes (PMID: 26008744), as well as the functional alteration observed in patient cells (PMID: 19843503). Additionally the nop frog model (PMID: 27595926) and ruby-eye mouse model (PMID: 12548288) both recapitulate phenotypes of human HPS. In summary, HPS6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 6. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:602ae8f1-9e7f-4cc6-bf70-d572d98828c5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
