The course is chronic-progressive with additional episodes of rapid deterioration following febrile infection or minor head trauma. We have identified mutations in EIF2B5 and EIF2B2, encoding the epsilon- and beta-subunits of the translation initiation factor eIF2B and located on chromosomes 3q27 and 14q24, respectively, as causing VWM. We found 16 different mutations in EIF2B5 in 29 patients from 23 families. We also found two distantly related individuals who were homozygous with respect to a missense mutation in EIF2B2, affecting a conserved amino acid. Three other patients also had mutations in EIF2B2. As eIF2B has an essential role in the regulation of translation under different conditions, including stress, this may explain the rapid deterioration of people with VWM under stress. Mutant translation initiation factors have not previously been implicated in disease.","dc:creator":"Leegwater PA","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Subunits of the translation initiation factor eIF2B are

It is a hereditary human disease resulting from the direct defects during protein synthesis, with the gene defects in EIF2B1-5 (identified in 2001-2002) encoding the five subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF2B alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon), respectively. Most of the published studies were carried out in the white population. The analysis of clinical features and EIF2B mutation screening were performed in 11 Chinese patients for the first time. Mutations were identified exclusively in EIF2B5 and EIF2B3 in these patients, with six novel mutations, including five missense mutations (EIF2B5: c.185A>T, p.D62V; c.1004G>C, p.C335S; c.1126A>G, p.N376D; EIF2B3: c.140G>A, p.G47E; c.1037T>C, p.I346T) and one deletion leading to amino-acid deletion (EIF2B5: c.1827-1838del, p.S610-D613del). EIF2B3 mutation, accounting for 20% of the total number of mutations found in this study, is more prevalent than expected according to an earlier report (7%). A hot spot mutation in EIF2B3 was identified in this study. A unique EIF2B mutation spectrum in Chinese VWM patients was shown. A systemic study to assess mutation spectrum in different populations needs to be carried out.","dc:creator":"Wu Y","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Identification of novel EIF2B mutations in Chinese patients with vanishing white matter disease."}},{"id":"cggv:d7eb019a-00f8-48c0-8707-324f7d654bf8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2615445c-6606-4e75-b213-0b97f4291127"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19158808"}],"rdfs:label":"Wu Patient 3"},{"id":"cggv:02f73720-5d19-429d-b2f8-11cab19dd8c7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02f73720-5d19-429d-b2f8-11cab19dd8c7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:d7eb019a-00f8-48c0-8707-324f7d654bf8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d7eb019a-00f8-48c0-8707-324f7d654bf8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:09b3bc7b-30f4-4ea9-9640-2502b6206503_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:09b3bc7b-30f4-4ea9-9640-2502b6206503","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:03ac207b-b625-49f6-af5a-f78a14b15ab9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003907.3(EIF2B5):c.1264C>T (p.Arg422Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA88843349"}},{"id":"cggv:44ec5405-9b93-438a-8857-bbf8fa945977"}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"motor signs; diffuse cavitation on MRI","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:5b348549-f1f1-4e74-85e1-6be47e31c130_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:44ec5405-9b93-438a-8857-bbf8fa945977"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15136673"},{"id":"cggv:aaf9266b-9afc-4efc-ba5e-2dd39f191927_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:03ac207b-b625-49f6-af5a-f78a14b15ab9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15136673"}],"rdfs:label":"Individual 435"},{"id":"cggv:5b348549-f1f1-4e74-85e1-6be47e31c130","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b348549-f1f1-4e74-85e1-6be47e31c130_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recurrent Variant"},{"id":"cggv:aaf9266b-9afc-4efc-ba5e-2dd39f191927","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aaf9266b-9afc-4efc-ba5e-2dd39f191927_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0b36ba33-176b-4f6a-91c8-96225cb5d1e7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b36ba33-176b-4f6a-91c8-96225cb5d1e7","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a7042510-add0-43ae-bfbe-fa7573b3d99e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003907.3(EIF2B5):c.808G>C (p.Asp270His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA343821"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"adult onset; progressive gait disturbance, sometimes in a phased manner after a minor trauma.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:cf03cb6c-5e4b-4a6f-9603-e2d2a243043b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a7042510-add0-43ae-bfbe-fa7573b3d99e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21484434","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Matsukawa T","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Adult-onset leukoencephalopathies with vanishing white matter with novel missense mutations in EIF2B2, EIF2B3, and EIF2B5."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 2"},{"id":"cggv:cf03cb6c-5e4b-4a6f-9603-e2d2a243043b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf03cb6c-5e4b-4a6f-9603-e2d2a243043b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cf03cb6c-5e4b-4a6f-9603-e2d2a243043b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Analyzed activities of eIF2B GEF-containing mutant EIF2B subunits.

Mutations in any of its five subunits lead to leucoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, an inherited chronic-progressive fatal brain disease with unknown aetiology, which is among the most prevalent childhood white matter disorders. We generated the first animal model for the disease by introducing a point mutation into the mouse Eif2b5 gene locus, leading to R132H replacement corresponding to the clinically significant human R136H mutation in the catalytic subunit. In contrast to human patients, mice homozygous for the mutant Eif2b5 allele (Eif2b5(R132H/R132H) mice) enable multiple analyses under a defined genetic background during the pre-symptomatic stages and during recovery from a defined brain insult. Time-course magnetic resonance imaging revealed for the first time the delayed development of the brain white matter due to the mutation. Electron microscopy demonstrated a higher proportion of small-calibre nerve fibres. Immunohistochemistry detected an abnormal abundance of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the brain of younger animals, as well as an abnormal level of major myelin proteins. Most importantly, mutant mice failed to recover from cuprizone-induced demyelination, reflecting an increased sensitivity to brain insults. The anomalous development of white matter in Eif2b5(R132H/R132H) mice underscores the importance of tight translational control to normal myelin formation and maintenance.","dc:creator":"Geva M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A mouse model for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B-leucodystrophy reveals abnormal development of brain white matter."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9507,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:97f10614-b0ad-428f-a13c-c867f31a552e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0957873","gene":"hgnc:3261","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"EIF2B5 was first associated with autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter in 2001 (Leegwater et al., PMID: 11704758). Affected individuals present with gait dysfunction, spasticity, cognitive decline, and white matter abnormalities on MRI.  Some individuals develop ovarian failure. Onset is variable from infancy to adulthood, and progression of disease is often in the setting of fever, trauma, or stress. Vanishing white matter disease has also been referred to as Childhood Ataxia with Central Nervous System Hypomyelination (CACH) and Cree leukoencephalopathy. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found that a phenotypic spectrum exists and there is no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, we chose to curate this gene-disease relationship under the disease term leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter 5 (OMIM:603945, MONDO:0957873). \n\nTwelve variants (missense, nonsense) that have been reported in 8 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 19158808, 15136673, 21484434 30014503, 17646634) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, (PMIDs: 33300869, 20826436). The mouse model of EIF2B5 related leukoencephalopathy exhibits motor deficits, myelin degeneration, abnormal density of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and increased sensitivity to brain insult, which recapitulates the human disease. The zebrafish model is associated with impaired motor behavior and myelin defects.  In summary, definitive evidence supports the relationship between EIF2B5 and leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter 5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date July 22, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d6cf3226-04b0-4709-bc55-b97ca4bea8d7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
