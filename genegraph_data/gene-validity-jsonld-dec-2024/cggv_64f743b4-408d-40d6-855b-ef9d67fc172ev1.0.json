The GABRA1, GABRG2, and GABRD genes provide instructions for making α1, ϒ2, and δ subunits of GABAA receptor protein respectively. GABAA is considered as one of the most important proteins and has found to play an important role in many neurological disorders. We explored the association of GABAA receptor gene mutation/SNPs in JME and LGS patients in Indian population. A total of 100 epilepsy syndrome patients (50 JME and 50 LGS) and 100 healthy control subjects were recruited and analyzed by AS-PCR and RFLP-PCR techniques. In our study, GABRA1 965 C > A mutation and 15 A > G polymorphism gene may play an important role in modulating the drug efficacy in LGS patients. The GABRA1 15 A > G polymorphism may also play an important role in the susceptibility of LGS and the inheritance of GG genotype of this polymorphism may provide an increased risk of development of LGS. The GABRG2 588 C > T polymorphism may decrease the duration of seizures in JME patients. The GABRD 659 G > A polymorphism may play an important role in the susceptibility of JME and LGS and this polymorphism may also increase the duration of postictal period in JME patients but may decrease the duration of seizure in LGS patients.","dc:creator":"Bhat MA","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Association of GABAA Receptor Gene with Epilepsy Syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Population Study-Arg220His"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:af31f075-cced-4356-8b4f-97bf4f65e61f","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af31f075-cced-4356-8b4f-97bf4f65e61f_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","caseCohort":{"id":"cggv:4256e712-d015-44f5-9f6f-9f92b7ce4573","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":562,"alleleFrequency":1,"detectionMethod":"Genotyping of the c.659G>A single nucleotide polymorphism (Arg220His) in exon 6 of the GABRD gene","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af31f075-cced-4356-8b4f-97bf4f65e61f_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":562,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0005027"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"cggv:301f8c4a-5c1d-428b-b53a-8bd21f06162e","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":664,"alleleFrequency":1,"detectionMethod":"Genotyping of the c.659G>A single nucleotide polymorphism (Arg220His) in exon 6 of the GABRD gene","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af31f075-cced-4356-8b4f-97bf4f65e61f_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":664},"method":{"id":"cg:SingleVariantAnalysis"},"statisticalSignificanceType":"","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16023832","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutation analysis of the gene encoding the GABA delta subunit (GABRD) identified a common missense variation (c.659G>A; Arg220His) of which the His220 allele displayed decreased GABA(A) alpha(1)beta(2)delta receptor current amplitudes.

In 2022, variants in *GABRD* were also reported in individuals with phenotypes other than seizures,  including developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability (PMID:34633442). Of note, some of these individuals had seizures, while others did not. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in phenotypic variability between these cases and therefore have chosen to split this evidence into multiple disease entities: epilepsy (MONDO:0005027) (for those individuals presenting solely with seizures) and complex neurodevelopmental disorder (MONDO:0100038) (for those individuals with neurodevelopmental phenotypes alone, or with neurodevelopmental disorders in addition to epilepsy). The split curation for complex neurodevelopmental disorder has been evaluated separately.\n\nThree missense variants reported in three probands in three publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 29924869, 33391346, 15115768). To date, many individuals with epilepsy have been reported with the p.Arg220His variant: at least 16 in case-control studies (PMIDs: 29785705, 16023832) and at least two case reports (PMIDs: 16023832, 29785705). Individuals with the p.Arg220His variant were not awarded points as a part of this curation, as there is currently conflicting evidence of pathogenicity according in small case-control studies (PMIDs: 29785705, 16023832), and there is a high allele frequency of 1.74x10-2 in gnomAD v2.1.1 with 55 homozygotes. It is possible that this variant is a risk allele and therefore does not support a relationship with Mendelian disease. Additionally, the p.Thr401Met variant reported in Lee et al. (2018, PMID:29924869) was not scored due to high allele frequency in gnomAD v.2.1.1, with 554 homozygotes.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between *GABRD* and epilepsy (MONDO:0005027). Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date July 18, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:64f743b4-408d-40d6-855b-ef9d67fc172e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
