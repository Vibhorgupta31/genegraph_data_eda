TRAPPC4, like its yeast Trs23 orthologue, is a core component of the TRAPP complexes and one of the essential subunits for guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Rab1 GTPase. Pathogenic variants in specific TRAPP subunits are associated with neurological disorders. We undertook exome sequencing in three unrelated families of Caucasian, Turkish and French-Canadian ethnicities with seven affected children that showed features of early-onset seizures, developmental delay, microcephaly, sensorineural deafness, spastic quadriparesis and progressive cortical and cerebellar atrophy in an effort to determine the genetic aetiology underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. All seven affected subjects shared the same identical rare, homozygous, potentially pathogenic variant in a non-canonical, well-conserved splice site within TRAPPC4 (hg19:chr11:g.118890966A>G; TRAPPC4: NM_016146.5; c.454+3A>G). Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis revealed there was no haplotype shared between the tested Turkish and Caucasian families suggestive of a variant hotspot region rather than a founder effect. In silico analysis predicted the variant to cause aberrant splicing. Consistent with this, experimental evidence showed both a reduction in full-length transcript levels and an increase in levels of a shorter transcript missing exon 3, suggestive of an incompletely penetrant splice defect. TRAPPC4 protein levels were significantly reduced whilst levels of other TRAPP complex subunits remained unaffected. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography demonstrated a defect in TRAPP complex assembly and/or stability. Intracellular trafficking through the Golgi using the marker protein VSVG-GFP-ts045 demonstrated significantly delayed entry into and exit from the Golgi in fibroblasts derived from one of the affected subjects. Lentiviral expression of wild-type TRAPPC4 in these fibroblasts restored trafficking, suggesting that the trafficking defect was due to reduced TRAPPC4 levels. Consistent with the recent association of the TRAPP complex with autophagy, we found that the fibroblasts had a basal autophagy defect and a delay in autophagic flux, possibly due to unsealed autophagosomes. These results were validated using a yeast trs23 temperature sensitive variant that exhibits constitutive and stress-induced autophagic defects at permissive temperature and a secretory defect at restrictive temperature. In summary we provide strong evidence for pathogenicity of this variant in a member of the core TRAPP subunit, TRAPPC4 that associates with vesicular trafficking and autophagy defects. This is the first report of a TRAPPC4 variant, and our findings add to the growing number of TRAPP-associated neurological disorders.","dc:creator":"Van Bergen NJ","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Deficiencies in vesicular transport mediated by TRAPPC4 are associated with severe syndromic intellectual disability."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband C, Van Bergen et al."},{"id":"cggv:a884b42d-878a-4d5e-b5b2-0c508b0a5a6a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a884b42d-878a-4d5e-b5b2-0c508b0a5a6a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a884b42d-878a-4d5e-b5b2-0c508b0a5a6a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR analysis in patient fibroblasts indicated that mutation results in skipping of exon 3 (only 6 % of transcripts were normally spliced).

TRAPPII (named for transport protein particle II) is a highly conserved tethering complex that functions in the late Golgi apparatus and consists of all of the subunits of TRAPPI and three additional, specific subunits. We have purified native yeast TRAPPII and characterized its structure and subunit organization by single-particle EM. Our data show that the nine TRAPPII components form a core complex that dimerizes into a three-layered, diamond-shaped structure. The TRAPPI subunits assemble into TRAPPI complexes that form the outer layers. The three TRAPPII-specific subunits cap the ends of TRAPPI and form the middle layer, which is responsible for dimerization. TRAPPII binds the Ypt1 GTPase and probably uses the TRAPPI catalytic core to promote guanine nucleotide exchange. We discuss the implications of the structure of TRAPPII for coat interaction and TRAPPII-associated human pathologies.","dc:creator":"Yip CK","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Molecular architecture of the TRAPPII complex and implications for vesicle tethering."},"rdfs:label":"TRAPPC4 complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:bae9eb72-6303-492e-824f-74e5540efeb9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93096bf6-6214-4959-a634-7f9a35c1f0f4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Autophagy is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (do we feel that this evidence is sufficient to score?).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31794024","rdfs:label":"Functional alteration of autophagy"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:51f66c13-6d48-48c0-b8d7-2ba58dd7a09d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4746a9ae-7060-4a7c-8f29-7f7417518bcd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8d77e51-e950-4d75-9f88-a9f933eae2d0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Patient cells without transduced TRAPPC4 had delayed Golgi trafficking.

TRAPPC4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with epilepsy, spasticity, and brain atrophy (NEDESBA) in 2020 (Van Bergen et al., PMID: 31794024). NEDESBA has features of severe global developmental delay evident in infancy, with early-onset seizures, and hypotonia. Some individuals may present with hearing loss and vision issues. The condition is mainly caused by a splicing variant; eight affected probands from eight families with this variant are included in this curation (PMIDs: 31794024, 32901138). Two missense variants more recently found in three probands in two affected families are also included in this curation (PMID: 34878169). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including rescue, interaction, and functional alteration evidence (PMIDs: 20972447, 31794024). The splicing variant was shown to inhibit autophagy through a functional alteration study in patient fibroblasts, and function in patient fibroblasts cells could be rescued by introducing TRAPPC4. In addition, a study in yeast demonstrated that the protein is essential for a TRAPP complex, which contains nine subunits and is associated with intellectual disability. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TRAPPC4 and autosomal recessive NEDESBA. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 12/6/23 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:51f66c13-6d48-48c0-b8d7-2ba58dd7a09d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
