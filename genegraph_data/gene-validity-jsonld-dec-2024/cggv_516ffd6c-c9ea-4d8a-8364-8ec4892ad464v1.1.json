Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of COL6A2 on chromosome 21q22 have recently been shown to cause UCMD. We performed a genomewide screening with microsatellite markers in a consanguineous family with three sibs affected with UCMD. Linkage of the disease to chromosome 2q37 was found in this family and in two others. We analyzed COL6A3, which encodes the alpha3 chain of collagen VI, and identified one homozygous mutation per family. In family I, the three sibs carried an A-->G transition in the splice-donor site of intron 29 (6930+5A-->G), leading to the skipping of exon 29, a partial reduction of collagen VI in muscle biopsy, and an intermediate phenotype. In family II, the patient had an unusual mild phenotype, despite a nonsense mutation, R465X, in exon 5. Analysis of the patient's COL6A3 transcripts showed the presence of various mRNA species-one of which lacked several exons, including the exon containing the nonsense mutation. The deleted splice variant encodes collagen molecules that have a shorter N-terminal domain but that may assemble with other chains and retain a functional role. This could explain the mild phenotype of the patient who was still ambulant at age 18 years and who showed an unusual combination of hyperlaxity and finger contractures. In family III, the patient had a nonsense mutation, R2342X, causing absence of collagen VI in muscle and fibroblasts, and a severe phenotype, as has been described in patients with UCMD. Mutations in COL6A3 are described in UCMD for the first time and illustrate the wide spectrum of phenotypes which can be caused by collagen VI deficiency.","dc:creator":"Demir E","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mutations in COL6A3 cause severe and mild phenotypes of Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:516ffd6c-c9ea-4d8a-8364-8ec4892ad464_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:225b7682-4173-44f0-9644-31c436bdb568_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:225b7682-4173-44f0-9644-31c436bdb568","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"allele":{"id":"cggv:e2735670-14c5-4493-b1fc-de3717b1d08d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004369.4(COL6A3):c.76C>T (p.Gln26Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2189961"}},"detectionMethod":"Coding regions were amplified from cDNA and sequenced.

We describe clinical and genetic characteristics of 97 individuals with glycine substitutions in the TH domain of COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 and add a review of 97 published cases, for a total of 194 cases. Clinical findings include severe, INT, and mild phenotypes even from patients with identical mutations. INT phenotypes were most common, accounting for almost half of patients, emphasizing the importance of INT phenotypes to the overall phenotypic spectrum. Glycine substitutions in the TH domain are heavily clustered in a short segment N-terminal to the 17th Gly-X-Y triplet, where they are acting as dominants. The most severe cases are clustered in an even smaller region including Gly-X-Y triplets 10-15, accounting for only 5% of the TH domain.

We also present two additional cases characterized by severe prenatal/neonatal myopathy. Prior extensive genetic testing and histology of these cases did not reveal the genetic etiology of disease. Here, we applied whole exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics to identify likely causal pathogenic variants in each pedigree. In two cases, we identified novel pathogenic variants in COL6A3. In a third case, we identified novel likely pathogenic variants in COL6A6 and COL6A3. We identified a novel splice variant in EMD in a fourth case. Finally, we classify two cases as calcium channelopathies with identification of novel pathogenic variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S.

Mutations in any of the three collagen VI genes cause congenital muscular dystrophy types Bethlem and Ullrich as well as intermediate phenotypes characterized by muscle weakness and connective tissue abnormalities. The α3(VI) collagen α chain has much larger N- and C-globular domains than the other two chains. Its most C-terminal domain can be cleaved off after assembly into microfibrils, and the cleavage product has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis and progression.

The mutant mice are deficient in extracellular collagen VI microfibrils and exhibit myopathic features, including decreased muscle mass and contractile force. Ultrastructurally abnormal collagen fibrils were observed in tendon, but not cornea, of the mutant mice, indicating a distinct tissue-specific effect of collagen VI on collagen I fibrillogenesis. Overall, the mice lacking normal α3(VI) collagen chains displayed mild musculoskeletal phenotypes similar to mice deficient in the α1(VI) collagen α chain, suggesting that the cleavage product of the α3(VI) collagen does not elicit essential functions in normal growth and development.

The protein's basic structural unit is a heterotrimer of the alpha1(VI), alpha2(VI), and alpha3(VI) chains additionally encoded by the genes *COL6A1* and *COL6A2* to form the triple helical structural element common to collagens. Mutations in Collagen VI have historically been reported in relation to two different conditions. The first, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, was first described in a series of papers in the 1930s by Otto Ullrich and was notable due to occurrence of both weakness and joint hypermobility (Kongenitale atonisch-sklerotische Muskeldystrophie, 1930) and was classically considered a recessive condition. The second, Bethlem myopathy, was reported by Bethlem and van Wijngaarden in 1976 as a dominant myopathy with development of joint contractures (PMID: 963533). Genetic analysis in patients with each of these disorders revealed both dominant and recessive defects in one of the *COL6A1*, *COL6A2*, or *COL6A3* genes that affect the final Collagen VI protein. On the basis of clinical as well as genetic findings, Ullrich CMD and Bethlem myopathy can justifiably be regarded as being positioned at the flanking ends of a continuous spectrum of disease, rather than as distinct clinical entities (PMID: 21496625). As such *COL6A3* was curated in relation to a combined disease entity: collagen 6-related Myopathy. Of note, *COL6A3* is also related to autosomal recessive dystonia which has assessed separately based on differences in molecular mechanism and phenotype. \n\nCollagen 6-related Myopathy illustrates the important role that collagen VI has in skeletal muscle. In addition to progressive muscle weakness and wasting, patients have skin and tendon abnormalities that reflect a more generalized connective tissue disorder. Dominant and recessive variants are found in patients across the clinical disease spectrum of collagen 6-related Myopathy. Distinct variants are associated with dominant and recessive inheritance and have been curated separately by the Congenital Myopathies GCEP. Dominant inheritance occurs with dominant negative mutations in the collagen VI triple helical regions, including glycine substitution and exon skip mutations. In contrast, recessive inheritance occurs with loss of function variants; heterozygous carriers of *COL6A3* null variants have no obvious phenotype but patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous null variants completely lack collagen VI and tend to have severe disease.\n\nMore than 100 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans by ClinVar. Evidence supporting the relationship between *COL6A3* and autosomal recessive collagen 6-related myopathy includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants included in this curation have been reported in at least seven probands in five publications (PMIDs: 11992252, 24038877, 26247046, 17785673, 20976770). Many other cases are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease association is additionally supported by several pieces of experimental evidence, including its interaction with additional disease-causing genes *COL6A1* and *COL6A2* (PMID: 7768905), its function in the basement membrane surrounding muscle fibers (PMID: 9334230), which is disrupted in patient cells with altered expression in the extracellular matrix (PMID: 17785673), and a knockdown mouse model (PMID: 23564457). In summary, *COL6A3* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive collagen 6-related myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
