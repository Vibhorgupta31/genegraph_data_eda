Both genetic and environmental etiologies have been determined for holoprosencephaly; however, a genetic etiology is not found in most cases. In this report, we present two unrelated individuals with semilobar holoprosencephaly who have the identical de novo missense variant in the gene CCR4-NOT transcription complex, subunit 1 (CNOT1). The variant (c.1603C>T [p.Arg535Cys]) is predicted to be deleterious and is not present in public databases. CNOT1 has not been previously associated with holoprosencephaly or other brain malformations. In situ hybridization analyses of mouse embryos show that Cnot1 is expressed in the prosencephalic neural folds at gestational day 8.25 during the critical period for subsequent forebrain division. Combining human and mouse data, we show that CNOT1 is associated with incomplete forebrain division.","dc:creator":"Kruszka P","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A CCR4-NOT Transcription Complex, Subunit 1, CNOT1, Variant Associated with Holoprosencephaly."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse in situ hybridization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":7017,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":4,"subject":{"id":"cggv:548c0ccc-71de-48c4-9496-868a173f4adb","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0032787","gene":"hgnc:7877","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*CNOT1* was originally reported in cases of holoprosencephaly and/or pancreatic agenesis/insufficiency in 2019 (PMID: 31006513, 31006510). One of the papers included 3 individuals with heterozygous p.Arg535Cys (PMID: 31006513), confirmed to be de novo in 2 individuals. One of these individuals was not scored due to a lack of documentation of holoprosencephaly. The other paper included 2 individuals with de novo p.Arg535Cys, both of whom with holoprosencephaly. A knock-in mouse model of this variant showed neurological and pancreatic abnormalities at E14.5, and this evidence was used to augment the genetic evidence. A mouse brain expression study (PMID: 31006510) was scored as functional evidence. In total, there is Limited evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between *CNOT1* and holoprosencephaly with or without pancreatic agenesis. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Vissers-Bodmer syndrome, which is characterized by global developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities apparent from infancy. As the condition is clinically distinct from holoprosencephaly and/or pancreatic agenesis/insufficiency, lacks specific structural brain anomalies, and likely has different molecular mechanisms, this will be/have been assessed separately. This curation was approved by the Brain Malformation Panel on 2/14/2023.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:91d394c9-60fe-40cb-918b-9790a08873d9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
