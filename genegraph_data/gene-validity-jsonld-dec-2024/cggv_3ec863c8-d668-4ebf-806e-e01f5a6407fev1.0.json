Here, we report the identification of biallelic truncating LIG4 mutations in 11 patients with microcephalic primordial dwarfism presenting with restricted prenatal growth and extreme postnatal global growth failure (average OFC -10.1 s.d., height -5.1 s.d.). Subsequently, most patients developed thrombocytopenia and leucopenia later in childhood and many were found to have previously unrecognized immunodeficiency following molecular diagnosis. None have yet developed malignancy, though all patients tested had cellular radiosensitivity. A genotype-phenotype correlation was also noted with position of truncating mutations corresponding to disease severity. This work extends the phenotypic spectrum associated with LIG4 mutations, establishing that extreme growth retardation with microcephaly is a common presentation of bilallelic truncating mutations.

A fibroblast line from the patient was further investigated and identified mutated DNA LIG4 in relation to autosomal recessive SCID in 1999(Riballo et al., PMID 10395545). Since this first case was described, 27 further cases have been published with a broad spectrum of clinical features ranging from Microcephaly, developmental delay, lymphopenia, and other features. LIG4 is part of a end joining mechanism required in repairing DNA double stranded breaks. It is universally expressed and required to avert apoptosis and mutagenesis. DNA LIG4 also is involved in repairing programmed DNA double stranded breaks during lymphocyte receptor development. \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants have been reported in 12 cases globally with combined immunodeficiency with T- and B- Lymphocytopenia, in at least 7 publications(PMID: 31604460, PMID 11779494, PMID 17224058, PMID 16088910, PMID 27063650, PMID 16358361, PMID 24123394).  Probands described range in age of onset between 3 months to 48  years. The clinical manifestation of immunodeficiency may be due to a accumulation of DNA double-strand break which would lead to progressive apoptosis in lymphocyte progenitors of LIG4 patients based on the reduction of lymphocytes over time(PMID: 23722522). A family with three affected siblings showed varying cellular and molecular phenotypes with only one truly affected sibling suggesting the phenotype can dramatically vary(PMID: 27063650). This gene-disease association is supported by mouse models, functional alteration, and expression studies(PMID: 2013615, PMID:24889605, PMID: 109119933, PMID:11779494). Complete knockout of LIG4 in mice is embryological lethal and mutations described in humans are hypomorphic, leading to significantly impaired Non-homologous end joining but still maintaining some activity( PMID: 10911993). \n \nIn summary, LIG4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive, severe combined immunodeficiency disease and combined immunodeficiency.
