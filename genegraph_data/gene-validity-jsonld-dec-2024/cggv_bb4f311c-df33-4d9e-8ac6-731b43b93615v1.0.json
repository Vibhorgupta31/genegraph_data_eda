We report the results of a moderate-scale sequencing study aimed at increasing the number of genes known to contribute to predisposition for ALS. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 2869 ALS patients and 6405 controls. Several known ALS genes were found to be associated, and TBK1 (the gene encoding TANK-binding kinase 1) was identified as an ALS gene. TBK1 is known to bind to and phosphorylate a number of proteins involved in innate immunity and autophagy, including optineurin (OPTN) and p62 (SQSTM1/sequestosome), both of which have also been implicated in ALS. These observations reveal a key role of the autophagic pathway in ALS and suggest specific targets for therapeutic intervention.

Genetic association studies have established ALS as a multifactorial disease with heritability estimated at ~61%, and recent studies show a prominent role for rare variation in its genetic architecture. To identify rare variants associated with disease onset we performed exome array genotyping in 4,244 cases and 3,106 controls from European cohorts. In this largest exome-wide study of rare variants in ALS to date, we performed single-variant association testing, gene-based burden, and exome-wide individual set-unique burden (ISUB) testing to identify single or aggregated rare variation that modifies disease risk. In single-variant testing no variants reached exome-wide significance, likely due to limited statistical power. Gene-based burden testing of rare non-synonymous and loss-of-function variants showed NEK1 as the top associated gene. ISUB analysis did not show an increased exome-wide burden of deleterious variants in patients, possibly suggesting a more region-specific role for rare variation. Complete summary statistics are released publicly.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability between this disease and ALS type 24. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities: ALS type 24 (OMIM: 617892) and short-rib thoracic dysplasia 6 with or without polydactyly (OMIM:263520). The association between *NEK1* and ALS was first established in an exome-wide gene burden analysis that identified an association between loss of function rare variants in the gene and the phenotype based on the exome sequencing of 2874 ALS cases and 6405 controls (Cirulli et al., PMID: 25700176). This curation also includes an additional 13 case-control analyses from 11 publications (PMIDs: 25700176, 26945885, 27455347, 28935222, 29149916, 30940688, 30976013, 31768050, 32920598, 34544842, 31475037). Additionally, 40 variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants, reported in 40 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 26945885, 28935222, 30093141, 31108397, 31475037, 32462798, 32772750, 32920598, 33445179, 34564799) are included in this curation. Based on this curation, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, although missense variants have also been reported in ALS probands. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence describing physical interaction with other known ALS associated genes and functional alterations in mutated patient cells (PMIDs: 30992335, 29929116, 25700176), although experimental evidence remains marginal overall. In summary, *NEK1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ALS type 24. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings as shown by the genetic evidence and has been upheld over time. Although, we believe that more experimental evidence is needed to gain a greater understanding of the involvement of *NEK1* in ALS pathophysiology. It is important to understand that in the clinical diagnostic setting the identification of missense variants of uncertain significance may be common and variant interpretation must be completed with caution.
