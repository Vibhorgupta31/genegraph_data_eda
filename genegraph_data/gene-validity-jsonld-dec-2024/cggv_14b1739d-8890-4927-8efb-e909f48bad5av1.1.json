In total, twenty-nine variants (27 missense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splice-site) that have been reported in 29 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs:30354297, 32934261, and 31727138) are included in this curation. Sixteen cases were not scored due to diagnoses outside the scope of the PH GCEP (i.e. heritable and idiopathic PAH, not PAH associated with other diseases) (PMIDs:32934261, 31727138). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies. Bohnen et al. showed that ABCC8 mRNA was regularly expressed in the lungs of both PH patient cells and controls. Additionally, Bonhen et al. showed the presence of ABCC8 protein in proximal pulmonary arteries and alveolar macrophages (PMID:30354297). \n\nIn summary, ABCC8 is moderately associated with autosomal dominant PAH. Evidence from both clinical observations and laboratory research has contributed to this gene-disease relationship receiving a “moderate” classification. In the future, additional reports of PAH patients with ABCC8 variants, experiments showing biochemical function, and model organisms demonstrating the PAH phenotypes could help strengthen the relationship between ABCC8 and PAH.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Pulmonary Hypertension Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 09/06/2021 (SOP Version #8) and revised on 8/30/2022 (SOP Version #9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:14b1739d-8890-4927-8efb-e909f48bad5a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
