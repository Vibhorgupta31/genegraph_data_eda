We describe a whole-genome siRNA-based reverse genetics screen for defects in biogenesis and/or maintenance of the primary cilium, obtaining a global resource. We identify 112 candidate ciliogenesis and ciliopathy genes, including 44 components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, 12 G-protein-coupled receptors, and 3 pre-mRNA processing factors (PRPF6, PRPF8 and PRPF31) mutated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The PRPFs localize to the connecting cilium, and PRPF8- and PRPF31-mutated cells have ciliary defects. Combining the screen with exome sequencing data identified recessive mutations in PIBF1, also known as CEP90, and C21orf2, also known as LRRC76, as causes of the ciliopathies Joubert and Jeune syndromes. Biochemical approaches place C21orf2 within key ciliopathy-associated protein modules, offering an explanation for the skeletal and retinal involvement observed in individuals with C21orf2 variants. Our global, unbiased approaches provide insights into ciliogenesis complexity and identify roles for unanticipated pathways in human genetic disease.","dc:creator":"Wheway G","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"An siRNA-based functional genomics screen for the identification of regulators of ciliogenesis and ciliopathy genes."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf72e5f0-a64d-4fb9-9a9b-07fef481bf56_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf72e5f0-a64d-4fb9-9a9b-07fef481bf56_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95b20cae-b4c3-43c7-bb4a-e5882c5ece62","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:df3fe5b4-7358-44ad-940d-e708e775e9f6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"PIBF1 was expressed in both the cell and tissue levels of the embryos of the Xenopus","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30858804","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Joubert syndrome (JS) is a congenital autosomal-recessive or-in rare cases-X-linked inherited disease.

CEP90 physically interacts with PCM-1 at centriolar satellites, and this interaction is essential for centrosomal accumulation of the centriolar satellites and eventually for primary cilia formation.

Using proteomics and superresolved imaging, we identify a module that we term DISCO (distal centriole complex). The DISCO components CEP90, MNR, and OFD1 underlie human ciliopathies. This complex localizes to both distal centrioles and centriolar satellites, proteinaceous granules surrounding centrioles. Cells and mice lacking CEP90 or MNR do not generate cilia, fail to assemble distal appendages, and do not transduce Hedgehog signals. Disrupting the satellite pools does not affect distal appendage assembly, indicating that it is the centriolar populations of MNR and CEP90 that are critical for ciliogenesis. CEP90 recruits the most proximal known distal appendage component, CEP83, to root distal appendage formation, an early step in ciliogenesis. In addition, MNR, but not CEP90, restricts centriolar length by recruiting OFD1. We conclude that DISCO acts at the distal centriole to support ciliogenesis by restraining centriole length and assembling distal appendages, defects in which cause human ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Kumar D","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A ciliopathy complex builds distal appendages to initiate ciliogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Genetic studies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:bf72e5f0-a64d-4fb9-9a9b-07fef481bf56_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb12d209-95d2-482f-be2d-4a29ff744b6b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb12d209-95d2-482f-be2d-4a29ff744b6b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:3a66ce41-40cb-45cb-a4e9-57b3d2b0a8d8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006346.4(PIBF1):c.1974_1977del (p.Asn658fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/2396608"}},{"id":"cggv:2d21b79b-3e83-4622-b869-c99c63a73900","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006346.4(PIBF1):c.1214G>A (p.Arg405Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210261"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0001332","obo:HP_0002104","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002419","obo:HP_0001251"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:127461c7-fa4b-44c0-8143-270b9198ecb8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2d21b79b-3e83-4622-b869-c99c63a73900"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34592808","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare syndrome characterized by ataxia and the molar tooth sign (MTS) on imaging.

Pibf1 is induced by the steroid hormone progesterone and overexpressed in highly proliferating cells. Pibf1 is a core component of the centrosome and encodes a centrosomal protein crucial for the accumulation of centriolar satellites, eventually forming the primary cilia. Depletion of Pibf1 is known to cause mitotic arrest, misaligned chromosomes, and spindle pole fragmentation. Pibf1 is expressed in many organs, including the brain, kidney, and liver, with the highest expression in the testis and thyroid. Additionally, the protein regulates the immune system to maintain a normal pregnancy. \n\nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease Joubert Syndrome (JBST) MIM 617767, the mode of inheritance being autosomal recessive. *PIBF1* was first reported in relation to JBST, a classic ciliopathy, in 2015 with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, by Wheway et al., PMID: 26167768. The mechanism of pathogenicity reported is loss of function. *PIBF1* is associated with marked phenotypic variability. JBST is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by malformation in the cerebellum and brainstem, recognizable on axial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a “molar tooth sign”, the diagnostic hallmark. Patients typically present as infants with hypotonia, abnormal eye movement, respiratory problems, and ataxia. JBST is manifested in multiple body systems including the eyes, kidney, liver, and skeleton. \n\nTen variants (missense (5), nonsense (1), frameshift (3), insertion (1) have been reported in 5 families (11 individuals) in 5 publications (PMIDs: 26167768, 29695797,30858804, 33004012, 34592808) included in this curation. A total of 7.4/12 pts. genetic evidence was reached, considering case-level and segregation data.This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional and expression \nstudies, in vitro assays of non-patient cells, animal models, and rescue assays. Wheway, et al, (PMID: 26167768) used siRNA knockdown to screen for ciliogenesis genes across the genome. They demonstrated that exogenous expression of human wild-type *PIBF1* rescued ciliogenesis defects in mIMCD3 cells following siRNA knockdown of endogenous Pibf1, while expression of *PIBF1* containing the p.Asp637Ala Hutterite variant was unable to rescue normal ciliogenesis. Ott et al., 2019 (PMID: 30858804) conducted functional analysis of wildtype and mutant pidf1 alleles in Xenopus embryos demonstrating no rescue with the nonsense variant, p.Gln485Ter but partial rescue with the missense variant, p.Tyr503Cys. Their analysis of *pibf1* alleles demonstrated a role of Pibf1 in motile cilia of larval skin in the Xenopus, and generating a phenotype consistent with that seen in human JBST. Additionally, Ott et al., demonstrated Pibf1protein was expressed in both cells and tissue (motile cilia cells of the larval skin).  Kim and Rhee, 2019 (PMID 23110211) examined the biological function of *PIBF1* in interphase cells, by performing rescue experiments and demonstrated that *PIBF1* physically interacts with PCM-1 at centriolar satellites; The interaction of *PIBF1* with PCM-1 is important for centrosomal accumulation of the centriolar satellites, which is essential for primary cilia formation. Finally, a mouse model (PMID: 3421634) was reported with several phenotypes that overlap with JBST, including abnormal neural tube closure, abnormal lens morphology, embryonic growth retardation, and abnormal sleep behaviors. A total of 3.5/6 pts. experimental evidence was reached. \n\nIn summary, there is Moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *PIBF1* and autosomal recessive JBST 33. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic GCEP on the meeting date 09/27/2023(SOP Version 9). \nThe curation score completed is discrepant to how the GCI scored this when I entered the evidence. For the curation the total genetic evidence scored was 7.1 yet due to the inability to find the variants in ClinVar for Hebbar, this was not included in in the evidence put into the GCI, there fore you can  see the discrepancy. The GCI placed the experimental evidence for the Ott paper into experimental rather than genetic which is the other discrepancy I see.
