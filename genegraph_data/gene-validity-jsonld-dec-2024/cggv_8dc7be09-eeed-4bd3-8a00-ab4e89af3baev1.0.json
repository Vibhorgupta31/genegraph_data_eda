However, knowledge of the role of ACs in hearing is limited. Previously, a novel autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus DFNB44 was mapped to chromosome 7p14.1-q11.22 in a consanguineous family from Pakistan. Through whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples from hearing-impaired family members, a nonsense mutation c.3112C>T (p.Arg1038*) within adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) was identified. This stop-gained mutation segregated with hearing impairment within the family and was not identified in ethnically matched controls or within variant databases. This mutation is predicted to cause the loss of 82 amino acids from the carboxyl tail, including highly conserved residues within the catalytic domain, plus a calmodulin-stimulation defect, both of which are expected to decrease enzymatic efficiency. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation had symmetric, mild-to-moderate mixed hearing impairment. Zebrafish adcy1b morphants had no FM1-43 dye uptake and lacked startle response, indicating hair cell dysfunction and gross hearing impairment. In the mouse, Adcy1 expression was observed throughout inner ear development and maturation. ADCY1 was localized to the cytoplasm of supporting cells and hair cells of the cochlea and vestibule and also to cochlear hair cell nuclei and stereocilia. Ex vivo studies in COS-7 cells suggest that the carboxyl tail of ADCY1 is essential for localization to actin-based microvilli. These results demonstrate that ADCY1 has an evolutionarily conserved role in hearing and that cAMP signaling is important to hair cell function within the inner ear.","dc:creator":"Santos-Cortez RL","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) mutations cause recessive hearing impairment in humans and defects in hair cell function and hearing in zebrafish."}},"rdfs:label":"Santos-cortez proband VI:3"},{"id":"cggv:1792a902-7bf2-49ed-a235-6f01141f1bb2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1792a902-7bf2-49ed-a235-6f01141f1bb2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1792a902-7bf2-49ed-a235-6f01141f1bb2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged ADCY1 constructs.

A nonsense variant that has been reported in a proband in 1 publication is included in this curation (PMID: 24482543). The variant segregated with disease in 7 additional family members. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an expression study and a zebrafish model (PMID: 24482543). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 05/10/2017 as per SOP v4. It was reevaluated on 10/31/2024 using SOP v11. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent an update in scoring to be consistent with SOP v11.
