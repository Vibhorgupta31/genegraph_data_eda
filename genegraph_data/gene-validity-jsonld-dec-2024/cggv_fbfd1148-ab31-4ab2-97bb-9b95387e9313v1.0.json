The role of CIITA in MHC class two expression has been well characterized by CIITA serving as a trans activator. CIITA acts as a trans activator by binding to RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP. Mutations in CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5, RFXAP are associated with MHC class two deficiency, with individuals with CIITA deficiency belonging to complementation group A, while individuals with RFXANK deficiency belong to group B, and individuals with RFXAP deficiency belonging to group D (PMID: 28676232). This experiment demonstrates that RFXANK binds to CIITA both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, RFXANK bound to CIITA in a GST pull down assay.

The regulatory factor X with ankyrin repeats (RFXANK) is a subunit of a tripartite RFX complex that assembles on promoters of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes. Although it is known that RFXANK plays a central role in the nucleation of RFX, it was not clear how its ankyrin repeats mediate the interactions within the complex and with other proteins. To answer this question, we modeled the RFXANK protein and determined the variable residues of the ankyrin repeats that should contact other proteins. Site-directed alanine mutagenesis of these residues together with in vitro and in vivo binding studies elucidated how RFXAP and CIITA, which simultaneously interact with RFXANK in vivo, bind to two opposite faces of its ankyrin repeats. Moreover, the binding of RFXAP requires two separate surfaces on RFXANK. One of them, which is located in the ankyrin groove, is severely affected in the FZA patient with the bare lymphocyte syndrome. This genetic disease blocks the expression of MHC II molecules on the surface of B cells. By pinpointing the interacting residues of the ankyrin repeats of RFXANK, the mechanism of this subtype of severe combined immunodeficiency was revealed.","dc:creator":"Nekrep N","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Analysis of ankyrin repeats reveals how a single point mutation in RFXANK results in bare lymphocyte syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"RFXANK interaction with CIITA and RFXAP"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upscored to 1 point given the amount of evidence illustrating the interaction between CIITA and RFXANK both from a pull down assay and immunoprecipitation assay."},{"id":"cggv:5b544aa5-b21c-499d-a2be-15f1b82721fa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:549629a2-efe0-4e0f-9f2c-01a7247d23d8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"As mentioned above, RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXANK assemble into the RFX complex, and bind to the regulatory region of the MHC class two promotor with the highest affinity when they are associated together.

The RFXANK gene encodes one subunit of the heterotrimeric RFX complex that is involved in the assembly of several transcription factors on MHC II promoters. Seven different RFXANK mutations have previously been reported in 26 unrelated patients. The most frequent mutation, a 26-bp deletion (752delG-25), has been identified in 21 patients. The other mutations are all nonsense or splice-site mutations, leading to proteins lacking all or part of the RFXANK ankyrin repeat region. We report two novel missense mutations, D121V and R212X, resulting in loss of function of the gene. We investigated the in vivo effects of these mutations and of three other point mutations on the expression of the RFXANK RNA and protein. The number of RFXANK transcripts was severely reduced in all patients except one. The RFXANK protein was barely detected in two cases. In addition, guided by a structural model of RFXANK, we investigated experimental mutants of the C-terminal tyrosine 224. Substitution Y224A, but not Y224F, led to the loss of function of RFXANK. Two null mutants, D121V and Y224A, were tested in protein interaction and DNA binding assays. The D121V mutant was unable to form the RFX complex, indicating that D121 is required for RFXAP binding. The Y224A mutant formed an RFX complex that bound normally to the MHC II promoter, but did not lead to MHC class II expression, whereas Y224F RFXANK retained the wild-type function. This indicates that an aromatic ring, but not the phenyl chain of tyrosine, is necessary at position 224 for normal RFXANK function. Studies on the Y224A mutant suggest that, in addition to the RFX subunits and CIITA, another protein is essential for MHC class II expression. This protein appears to interact with the fourth ankyrin repeat of RFXANK.","dc:creator":"Wiszniewski W","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Novel mutations in the RFXANK gene: RFX complex containing in-vitro-generated RFXANK mutant binds the promoter without transactivating MHC II."}},"rdfs:label":"Wiszniewski et al.

Autosomal-recessive mutations in the RFXANK gene account for two-thirds of all cases of MHC class II deficiency. We describe here the genetic, clinical, and immunologic features of 35 patients from 30 unrelated kindreds from North Africa sharing the same RFXANK founder mutation, a 26-bp deletion called I5E6-25_I5E6 + 1), and date the founder event responsible for this mutation in this population to approximately 2250 years ago (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1750-3025 years). Ten of the 23 patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were cured, with the recovery of almost normal immune functions. Five of the patients from this cohort who did not undergo HSCT had a poor prognosis and eventually died (at ages of 1-17 years). However, 7 patients who did not undergo HSCT (at ages of 6-32 years) are still alive on Ig treatment and antibiotic prophylaxis. RFXANK deficiency is a severe, often fatal CID for which HSCT is the only curative treatment. However, some patients may survive for relatively long periods if multiple prophylactic measures are implemented.","dc:creator":"Ouederni M","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Major histocompatibility complex class II expression deficiency caused by a RFXANK founder mutation: a survey of 35 patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Ouederni et al.

Mutations in four genes CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP are responsible for the primary immunodeficiency. At least 19 total variants, including (nonsense, missense, and splice site) have been reported. Affected individuals typically present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections, diarrhea, failure to thrive, low levels of CD4+ T cells, and undetectable HLA-DR expression on monocytes and B cells. Heterozygous carriers of RFXANK variants are reportedly unaffected clinically. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nOne variant, c.752delG26bp, has been reported in over 50 individuals (PMID:32875002). Individuals who are homozygous for the variant display combined immudeficiency, MHC class two defieincy, and die early in life if left untreated. Nearly all probands reported with the mutation are from the Maghreb region in North Africa. One paper, PMID:21908431, estimated that the variant originated with a founder from â¼2250 years ago (95% CI: 1700-3025 years) in what was most likely an ancient Berber civilization. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence including RFXANK co-immunoprecipitation with CIITA (PMID:11463838), rescue of function in patient cells (PMID:11313409), and biochemical function (PMID:18723135).\n\nIn summary, RFXANK is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MHC class II deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time. Classification approved by SCID-CID GCEP on 11/17/2022.
