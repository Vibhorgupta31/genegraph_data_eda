The overall fold of T-protein is similar to that of the C-terminal tetrahydrofolate-binding region (residues 421-830) of Arthrobacter globiformis dimethylglycine oxidase. Tetrahydrofolate (or folinic acid) is bound near the center of the tripartite T-protein. Lipoic acid is bound adjacent to the tetrahydrofolate binding pocket, thus defining the interaction surface for H-protein binding.

Biallelic variants in the genes GLDC and AMT are responsible for most cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia.

The H-protein encoded by GCSH has a dual role in protein lipoylation required for bioenergetic enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and in the one-carbon metabolism through its involvement in glycine cleavage enzyme system, intersecting two vital roles for cell survival. Here we report six patients with biallelic pathogenic variants in GCSH and a broad clinical spectrum ranging from neonatal fatal glycine encephalopathy to an attenuated phenotype of developmental delay, behavioral problems, limited epilepsy, and variable movement problems. The mutational spectrum includes one insertion c.293-2_293-1insT, one deletion c.122_(228 + 1_229-1) del, one duplication of exons 4 and 5, one nonsense variant p.Gln76*and four missense p.His57Arg, p.Pro115Leu, and p.Thr148Pro and the previously described p.Met1?. Via functional studies in patient's fibroblasts, molecular modelling, expression analysis in GCSH knock-down COS7 cells and yeast, and in vitro protein studies, we demonstrate for the first time that most variants identified in our cohort produced a hypomorphic effect on both mitochondrial activities, protein lipoylation and glycine metabolism, causing combined deficiency whereas some missense variants affect primarily one function only. The clinical features of the patients reflect the impact of the GCSH changes on any of the two functions analyzed. Our analysis illustrates the complex interplay of functional and clinical impact when pathogenic variants affect a multifunctional protein involved in two metabolic pathways and emphasizes the value of the functional assays to select the treatment and investigate new personalized options.","dc:creator":"Arribas-Carreira L","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Pathogenic variants in GCSH encoding the moonlighting H-protein cause combined Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia and Lipoate Deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Arribas-Carreira et al.

Glycine encephalopathy is characterized by elevated levels of glycine in the cerebrospinal fluid and elevated glycine CSF/plasma ratios. Patients with classic glycine encephalopathy or nonketotic hyperglycinemia often present in the first few days of life with apneic epileptic encephalopathy, which progresses to coma and death or leads to absent  psychomotor development, cortical blindness, intractable epilepsy, peripheral spasticity, and central hypotonia. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 7 variants (frameshift, nonsense, and missense) have been reported in 7 probands from 2 publications (PMID:33890291, PMID:36190515). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. \n\nThe gene *GCSH* encodes the \"H-protein\" that is crucial to both mitochondrial one carbon metabolism, as well as essential bioenergetic enzymes. Specifically, the H protein is involved in the glycine cleavage system, which is the primary pathway for the catabolism of the amino acid glycine. Additionally, the H protein is involved in the lipoylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. This gene-disease association is further supported by its biochemical function in the glycine cleavage system (PMID:36190515), bulk tissue expression (PMID:23715323), functional alteration in COS7 cells (PMID:36190515), and a knockout mouse model (PMID:33569080), for which homozygous knock outs are embryonic lethal by E10.5. The gene-disease relationship is also supported by interaction with the protein products of *AMT* and *GLDC* (PMID:15355973). Biallelic variants in *AMT* and *GLDC* have been well documented in association with glycine encephalopathy. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the UNC Biocuration core on xxx. The original classification was disputed due to the absence of human genetic evidence at the time. A classification of strong was reached on 1/27/2022 by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d360db9d-24e7-415e-b4bc-59a2c6231189"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
