Dysfunction of two specific sensory modalities, vision and proprioception, characterizes the phenotype of the rare, autosomal-recessive disorder posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Using targeted DNA capture and high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the entire 4.2 Mb candidate sequence on chromosome 1q32 to find the gene mutated in PCARP in a single family. Employing comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and filtering, we identified a single-nucleotide coding variant in the feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1), a gene encoding a heme-transporter protein. Sanger sequencing confirmed the FLVCR1 mutation in this family and identified different homozygous missense mutations located within the protein's transmembrane channel segment in two other unrelated families with PCARP. To determine whether the selective pathologic features of PCARP correlated with FLVCR1 expression, we examined wild-type mouse Flvcr1 mRNA levels in the posterior column of the spinal cord and the retina via quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. The Flvcr1 mRNA levels were most abundant in the retina, followed by the posterior column of the spinal cord and other brain regions. These results suggest that aberrant FLVCR1 causes a selective degeneration of a subpopulation of neurons in the retina and the posterior columns of the spinal cord via dysregulation of heme or iron homeostasis. This finding broadens the molecular basis of sensory neural signaling to include common mechanisms that involve proprioception and vision.","dc:creator":"Rajadhyaksha AM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in FLVCR1 cause posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e53e1a9-b1b9-4617-be3a-012399a06ef6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11225350-185e-454d-8f86-43ceaf688f68_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11225350-185e-454d-8f86-43ceaf688f68","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":33,"allele":{"id":"cggv:1ce74e98-aa0e-4c0d-a472-f9e93545dca3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014053.4(FLVCR1):c.661C>T (p.Pro221Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1385924"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"HSAN","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:39042278-84c4-4bb4-8463-986203e4c379_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1ce74e98-aa0e-4c0d-a472-f9e93545dca3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28766925","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"FLVCR1 encodes for a ubiquitous heme exporter, whose recessive mutations cause posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Recently, FLVCR1 recessive mutations were also found in two sporadic children with hereditary sensory-autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). We report the unique case of a 33-year-old Italian woman with a combination of typical PCARP, sensory-autonomic neuropathy with sensory loss to all modalities and multiple autonomic dysfuctions, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Molecular analysis demonstrated homozygosity for the previously identified FLVCR1 p.Pro221Ser variation. The same variation, in combination with a frameshift mutation, was previously identified in an Italian child with HSAN. Functional studies carried out on patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines showed decreased FLVCR1a transcript, increased reactive oxygen species, excessive intracellular heme accumulation, and increased number of Annexin V positive cells. This indicates that the homozygous p.Pro221Ser FLVCR1 variation compromises the ability of FLVCR1a to export heme leading to enhanced susceptibility to programmed cell death. Our study demonstrates the existence of a phenotypic continuum among the discrete disorders previously linked to FLVCR1 mutations, and suggests that the related alteration of heme metabolism may lead to the degeneration of specific neuronal cell populations.","dc:creator":"Castori M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa coexisting with sensory-autonomic neuropathy and leukemia due to the homozygous p.Pro221Ser FLVCR1 mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"28766925_P1"},{"id":"cggv:39042278-84c4-4bb4-8463-986203e4c379","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:39042278-84c4-4bb4-8463-986203e4c379_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:39042278-84c4-4bb4-8463-986203e4c379_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional studies in patient-derived lumphoblasts scored under functional alteration."}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Scored reduced because functional studies in patient cells are not included here but scored under functional alteration."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3ee1a9d1-8d72-409d-afb9-cc5a2c6510cd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ee1a9d1-8d72-409d-afb9-cc5a2c6510cd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:e9f9892c-d3ef-4fd1-a3ad-c0826e49b4be","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014053.4(FLVCR1):c.1092+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1386046"}},{"id":"cggv:54b0307a-24c4-4e03-b0fa-588a54e7a7c9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014053.4(FLVCR1):c.755del (p.Gly252fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/872563"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:578b72a9-ad8c-4e35-ab93-8956cda6dbbb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:54b0307a-24c4-4e03-b0fa-588a54e7a7c9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30656474","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP) is a rare form of syndromic RP associated with mutations in the FLVCR1 gene.

Recently, the FLVCR1-associated phenotype has been expanded with sporadic reports of hereditary sensory-autonomic neuropathy or non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we report a 23-year- old female with early onset hypomyelinating sensory-autonomic neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa. Both features were present since childhood. The patient developed signs of advanced retinitis pigmentosa by the age of 10 years leading to legal blindness after the age of 18. Following candidate gene panel testing, which was negative, whole exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous pathogenic FLVCR1 variants: NM_014053.3: c.3G > T; p.(Met1?) and NM_014053.3: c.730G > A; p.(Gly244Ser), the latter variant is novel. In this report we highlight the association of retinitis pigmentosa with hypomyelinating sensory-autonomic neuropathy, which could be underdiagnosed due to variable severity.

Previous studies of PCARP in two families showed a linkage to 1q31-q32. However, detailed investigations on the clinical presentations as well as molecular genetics of PCARP have been limited. Here, we describe a Japanese consanguineous family with PCARP. Two affected siblings suffered from childhood-onset retinitis pigmentosa and slowly progressive sensory ataxia. They also showed mild mental retardation, which has not been described in patients with PCARP. Parametric linkage analysis using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays supported a linkage to the same locus. Target capture and high-throughput sequencing technologies revealed a novel homozygous c.1477G>C (G493R) mutation in FLVCR1, which cosegregated with the disease. A recent study has identified three independent mutations in FLVCR1 in the original and other families.

This condition is characterized by childhood onset retinal dystrophy and progressive sensory ataxia. At least 321 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported in humans (ClinVar database). \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. \nThis curation includes 12 variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, intronic) from 11 probands from 5 publications (Rajadhyaksha et al, 2010, PMID: 21070897; Ishiura et al, 2011, PMID: 21267618; Castori et al, 2017, PMID: 28766925; Kuehlewein et al, 2019, PMID 30656474; Grudzinska Pechhacker et al, 2020, PMID: 32822874) in addition to segregation data (Rajadhyaksha et al, 2010, PMID: 21070897). More data is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nExperimental evidence included qPCR expression data in mice (Rajadhyaksha et al, 2010, PMID: 21070897), functional studies in patient cells, and a homology model of the protein (Grudzinska Pechhacker et al, 2020, PMID: 32822874).\nIn summary, FLVCR1 has a definitive relationship with FLVCR1-related retinopathy with or without ataxia.
