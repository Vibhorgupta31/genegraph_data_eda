It is developmentally regulated and is expressed exclusively in the pancreatic beta-cell. This restricted expression is directed by a tissue-specific enhancer, within the promoter, which contains an E-box sequence. The insulin E-box binds an islet-specific protein complex, termed 3a1. E-boxes bind proteins belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. The bHLH proteins function as potent transcriptional activators of tissue-specific genes by forming heterodimers between ubiquitous and cell-restricted family members. In addition, the cell-restricted bHLH members play an important role in specifying cell fate. To isolate the tissue-specific bHLH factor controlling insulin gene expression and study its role in islet cell differentiation, a modified yeast two-hybrid system was utilized to clone a novel bHLH factor, BETA2 (beta-cell E-box trans-activator 2), from a hamster insulin tumor (HIT) cell cDNA library. Northern analysis demonstrates that high-level expression of the BETA2 gene is restricted to pancreatic alpha- and beta-cell lines. As expected of tissue-specific bHLH members, BETA2 binds to the insulin E-box sequence with high affinity as a heterodimer with the ubiquitous bHLH factor E47. More importantly, antibody supershift experiments clearly show that BETA2 is a component of the native insulin E-box-binding complex. Transient transfection assays demonstrate that the BETA2/E47 heterodimer synergistically interacts with a neighboring beta-cell-specific complex to activate an insulin enhancer. In contrast, other bHLH factors such as MyoD and E47, which can bind to the insulin E-box with high affinity, fail to do so. Thus, a unique, cooperative interaction is the basis by which the insulin E-box enhancer discriminates between various bHLH factors to achieve tissue-specific activation of the insulin gene.","dc:creator":"Naya FJ","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Tissue-specific regulation of the insulin gene by a novel basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor."},"rdfs:label":"INS interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"NeuroD1 shown to heterodimerize with the ubiquitous helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein E47 and then bind the INS gene promotor to regulate its transcription through yeast two-hybrid assays and transient transfection assays in HIT cells to measure transcriptional activity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:9ace1b58-44d4-4479-9328-0871a8fb0e9f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cccc2d2a-a4a0-4619-a486-4f6900da5321","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb4af7e5-8037-423b-be8d-410a0f80fce5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice homozygous for disruption of BETA2 developed hyperglycemia by 2 days of age with ketonuria, suggesting severe diabetes and insulin deficiency.

To understand the importance of BETA2 in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, mice lacking a functional BETA2 gene were generated by gene targeting experiments. Mice carrying a targeted disruption of the BETA2 gene developed severe diabetes and died perinatally. Homozygous BETA2 null mice had a striking reduction in the number of insulin-producing beta cells and failed to develop mature islets. Islet morphogenesis appeared to be arrested between E14.5 and E17.5, a period characterized by major expansion of the beta cell population. The presence of severe diabetes in these mice suggests that proper islet structure plays an important role in blood glucose homeostasis. In addition, secretin- and cholecystokinin-producing enteroendocrine cells failed to develop in the absence of BETA2. The absence of these two pancreatic secretagogs may explain the abnormal cellular polarity and inability to secrete zymogen granules in pancreatic acinar exocrine cells.

To clarify the role of these mutations in the pathogenesis of late-onset diabetes, we examined the insulin secretion and sensitivity in diabetic patients carrying the homozygous mutation in the NeuroD1 gene or Pax4 gene. We screened for the polymorphisms in NeuroD1 and Pax4 genes in 296 late-onset diabetic patients and 177 unrelated control subjects over 60 years of age. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) followed by direct sequencing. Acute insulin secretion was evaluated using a 2-compartment model analysis of C-peptide kinetics after intravenous glucose load (CS1). Insulin sensitivity was estimated by the insulin-modified minimal model analysis (Si). Four diabetic patients carried the homozygous mutation (Thr/Thr) in the NeuroD1 gene and 3 patients carried the homozygous mutation (Trp/Trp) in the Pax4 gene, while both homozygous mutations were not detected in the control subjects. In patients A, B, C, and D with homozygous mutations in NeuroD1, CS1 (normal range, 6.8 to 18.5 ng/mL/min) was 0.508, 1.481, 1.223, and 1.584 ng/mL/min, respectively, and Si (normal range, 2.6 to 7.6 x 10(-4)/min/[microU/mL]) was 0.727, 3.31, 3.79, and 0.00 x 10(-4)/min/(microU/mL), respectively.

Since acute insulin secretion in response to glucose was markedly impaired and insulin resistance was varied in the patients carrying the homozygous mutations in the NeuroD1 and Pax4 genes, the mutations are ones of the factors involved in the beta-cell dysfunction and do not relate to the insulin resistance.

At least 5 variants (missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans in association with a phenotype consisting of neonatal diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, sensorineural deafness, visual impairment, and intellectual disability. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level data: 5.25 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 29521454, 20573748, 12200761, 30259503). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015967), which is being assessed separately. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays, expression studies, and animal models. BETA2 (encoded by NEUROD1) was shown to heterodimerize with the ubiquitous helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein E47 and then bind the INS gene promotor to regulate its transcription through yeast two-hybrid assays and transient transfection assays in HIT cells to measure transcriptional activity (PMID: 7774807). Mice homozygous for disruption of BETA2 developed hyperglycemia by 2 days of age with ketonuria, suggesting severe diabetes and insulin deficiency, with abnormal pancreatic islet morphology, reduction in insulin producing cells, and lack of mature (PMID: 9308961). NEUROD1 expression has been confirmed in pancreatic tissue (PMID: 24309898). In summary, NEUROD1 is moderately associated with autosomal recessive monogenic diabetes with a neurologic phenotype as described above. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9ace1b58-44d4-4479-9328-0871a8fb0e9f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
