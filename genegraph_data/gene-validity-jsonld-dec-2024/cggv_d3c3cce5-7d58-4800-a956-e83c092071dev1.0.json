MSH6 heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form a mismatch recognition complex functioning as a bidirectional molecular switch that exchanges ADP and ATP as DNA mismatches are bound and dissociated. Defective MMR pathway is responsible for microsatellite instability, a type of genomic instability that is characteristic for tumor cells. MSH6 has been linked to Lynch Syndrome (autosomal dominant) and mismatch repair cancer syndrome (autosomal recessive), which were curated separately. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed. This curation focuses on disputing the association with breast cancer. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 4 points**\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 5 case-control or cohort studies at the single or aggregate variant level. \n\nThere is evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship. BCAC, a large case-control study published in 2021 (PMID: 33471991), showed a significant association with moderate odds ratio (=1.96) of aggregated pathogenic *MSH6* variants with breast cancer (3 point). Another case-control study reported by Lu et al. (PMID: 30128536) also demonstrated a significant association (Odds Ratio=2.59). However, the case population Lu et al. study includes breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer; therefore, the strength of this evidence is limited (1 point).\n\nEvidence did not support the gene-disease relationship also reported. In 2021, a large case-control study [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *MSH6* and breast cancer. Likewise, another two large case-control studies published in 2017 screened breast cancer cases from commercial laboratories and did not find significant association of pathogenic mutations in *MSH6* with breast cancer (PMID: 28418444, 35172496).\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nIn summary, given that case-control studies show either a modest effect of increased risk, or no increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic *MSH6* variant carriers, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *MSH6* plays in autosomal dominant breast cancer. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 7/26/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\nGiven that case-control studies show either a modest effect of increased risk, or no increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MSH6 variant carriers, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d3c3cce5-7d58-4800-a956-e83c092071de"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
