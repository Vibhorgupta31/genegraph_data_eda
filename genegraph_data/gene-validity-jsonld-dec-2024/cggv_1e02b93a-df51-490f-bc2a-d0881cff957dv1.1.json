It underlies much of embryonic development and numerous pathologies. Convergent extension (CE) of the axial mesoderm of vertebrates is an intensively studied model for morphogenetic processes that rely on cell rearrangement. It involves the intercalation of polarized cells perpendicular to the antero-posterior (AP) axis, which narrows and lengthens the tissue. Several genes have been identified that regulate cell behaviour underlying CE in zebrafish and Xenopus. Many of these are homologues of genes that control epithelial planar cell polarity in Drosophila. However, elongation of axial mesoderm must be also coordinated with the pattern of AP tissue specification to generate a normal larval morphology. At present, the long-range control that orients CE with respect to embryonic axes is not understood. Here we show that the chordamesoderm of Xenopus possesses an intrinsic AP polarity that is necessary for CE, functions in parallel to Wnt/planar cell polarity signalling, and determines the direction of tissue elongation. The mechanism that establishes AP polarity involves graded activin-like signalling and directly links mesoderm AP patterning to CE.","dc:creator":"Ninomiya H","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Antero-posterior tissue polarity links mesoderm convergent extension to axial patterning."},"rdfs:label":"Ninomiya_Biochemical"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1e02b93a-df51-490f-bc2a-d0881cff957d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1e02b93a-df51-490f-bc2a-d0881cff957d_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"cggv:def69a63-d5e1-45c6-acb8-8a89cedaf087_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:def69a63-d5e1-45c6-acb8-8a89cedaf087","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:84630f4f-12ac-4236-906e-7b5f885e16b4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003741.4(CHRD):c.1586C>T (p.Ala529Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2735701"}},{"id":"cggv:d206e91e-5156-41fe-a69b-2e1b1976ac0e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003741.4(CHRD):c.2459C>T (p.Thr820Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2736018"}}],"detectionMethod":"Performed exome sequencing on a multi-institutional cohort diagnosed with atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)\n","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0006695","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:1954190e-deb5-4ce5-9bf7-b99c1b835efa_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d206e91e-5156-41fe-a69b-2e1b1976ac0e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27058611","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital heart disease (CHD) has a complex genetic etiology, and recent studies suggest that high penetrance de novo mutations may account for only a small fraction of disease. In a multi-institutional cohort surveyed by exome sequencing, combining analysis of 987 individuals (discovery cohort of 59 affected trios and 59 control trios, and a replication cohort of 100 affected singletons and 533 unaffected singletons) we observe variation at novel and known loci related to a specific cardiac malformation the atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD). In a primary analysis, by combining developmental coexpression networks with inheritance modeling, we identify a de novo mutation in the DNA binding domain of NR1D2 (p.R175W). We show that p.R175W changes the transcriptional activity of Nr1d2 using an in vitro transactivation model in HUVEC cells. Finally, we demonstrate previously unrecognized cardiovascular malformations in the Nr1d2tm1-Dgen knockout mouse. In secondary analyses we map genetic variation to protein-interaction networks suggesting a role for two collagen genes in AVSD, which we corroborate by burden testing in a second replication cohort of 100 AVSDs and 533 controls (p = 8.37e-08). Finally, we apply a rare-disease inheritance model to identify variation in genes previously associated with CHD (ZFPM2, NSD1, NOTCH1, VCAN, and MYH6), cardiac malformations in mouse models (ADAM17, CHRD, IFT140, PTPRJ, RYR1 and ATE1), and hypomorphic alleles of genes causing syndromic CHD (EHMT1, SRCAP, BBS2, NOTCH2, and KMT2D) in 14 of 59 trios, greatly exceeding variation in control trios without CHD (p = 9.60e-06). In total, 32% of trios carried at least one putatively disease-associated variant across 19 loci,suggesting that inherited and de novo variation across a heterogeneous group of loci may contribute to disease risk.","dc:creator":"Priest JR","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"De Novo and Rare Variants at Multiple Loci Support the Oligogenic Origins of Atrioventricular Septal Heart Defects."}},{"id":"cggv:bdb77fe1-0c31-4129-bfd0-0b6af9c5bd66_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:84630f4f-12ac-4236-906e-7b5f885e16b4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27058611"}],"rdfs:label":"Priest_7952"},{"id":"cggv:1954190e-deb5-4ce5-9bf7-b99c1b835efa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1954190e-deb5-4ce5-9bf7-b99c1b835efa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:bdb77fe1-0c31-4129-bfd0-0b6af9c5bd66","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdb77fe1-0c31-4129-bfd0-0b6af9c5bd66_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.2}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":7487,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":0.7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:2fa0c706-b0e1-4124-b1c2-a4764e8dc922","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:1949","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*CHRD* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive congenital heart disease in 2016 (Priest et al. 2016; PMID: 27058611).
