The first report of IKAROS deficiency was described in 2012 in a patient suffering pancytopenia (Goldman et al, 2012; PMID: 21548011). This report described the ​importance of ​the IKZF1 gene as a crucial transcription factor for hematopoiesis with relevance in immune development. IKAROS deficiency is a heterogeneous disease characterized by lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, immune dysregulation, and depending on the mechanism of disease, it can confer common variable immunodeficiency, combined immunodeficiency, or immune dysregulation. According to the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, ​the molecular mechanism of this disease can be described as loss of function, gain of function, or somatic. Furthermore, the loss of function and gain of function mutations have been split into two disease entities, pancytopenia due to IKZF1 mutations (MONDO: 0014810) and autoimmune diseases (MONDO:0007179), respectively. . The somatic mutations that have been associated with leukemias were not considered for this curation because they are beyond the scope of the Immunology Clinical Domain Working Group. Autoimmune diseases (MONDO:0007179) ​have been associated with gain of function variants in ​the IKZF1 gene. To date, two gain of function variants have been described, p.R183H and p.R183C, found in eight patients (PMID: 35333544). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be gain of function, which was determined by the increased DNA binding activity of the mutated IKAROS protein. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including normal expression, protein interaction, biochemical function, and cell phenotype description in patients' cells (PMID: 3533544). IKZF1 gain of function variants R183H and R183C were proven to be expressed in T lymphocytes ​and display increased DNA binding activity. They are capable of forming homodimers with the WT protein and its elevated DNA binding activity causes the increased transcription of genes important for late T cell differentiation leading to a skewed Th2 cell phenotype. In summary, IKZF1 gain of function variants show a moderate association with autoimmune diseases.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a839a0c3-f5c6-4286-9d04-cd9347fefb00"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
