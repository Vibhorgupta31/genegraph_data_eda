Especially in the milder forms, sandwich vertebrae are an easily recognizable and reliable radiological hallmark. We report on four patients from three families presenting with sandwich vertebrae and platyspondyly. The long bone phenotypes were discordant with one patient showing modeling defects and patchy osteosclerosis, while the second displayed only metaphyseal sclerotic bands, and the third and fourth had extreme metaphyseal flaring with uniform osteosclerosis. Two of the four patients had experienced pathological fractures, two had developmental delay, but none showed cranial nerve damage, hepatosplenomegaly, or bone marrow failure. According to these clinical features the diagnoses ranged between intermediate autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and dysosteosclerosis. After exclusion of mutations in CLCN7 we performed gene panel and exome sequencing. Two novel mutations in SLC29A3 were found in the first two patients. In the third family a TCIRG1 C-terminal frameshift mutation in combination with a mutation at position +4 in intron 2 were detected. Our study adds two cases to the small group of individuals with SLC29A3 mutations diagnosed with dysosteosclerosis, and expands the phenotypic variability. The finding that intermediate autosomal recessive osteopetrosis due to TCIRG1 splice site mutations can also present with platyspondyly further increases the molecular heterogeneity of dysosteosclerosis-like sclerosing bone dysplasias.","dc:creator":"Howaldt A","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Sclerosing bone dysplasias with hallmarks of dysosteosclerosis in four patients carrying mutations in SLC29A3 and TCIRG1."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:510894e0-bd9e-4929-aae1-ac548138ab6c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:510894e0-bd9e-4929-aae1-ac548138ab6c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1234bd5-c528-4268-ba80-4495c4e8f0ef","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af59bd88-0228-4096-ab1a-60c18ddc3fc9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"TCIRG1 encodes a subunit of the vacuolar proton pump that aids in pH regulation of osteoclasts (PMID: 30837952).

Dysosteosclerosis is a rare genetic primary bone dysplasia disease characterized by sandwich vertebrae, progressive osteosclerosis and platyspondyly. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in phenotypic spectrum of the disease assertions with this gene. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: Autosomal Recessive Osteopetrosis 1 (MONDO:0009815) and Dysosteosclerosis (ORPHA: 1782). The split curation for autosomal recessive Osteopetrosis 1 (OMIM:259700) has been curated separately. This curation is for autosomal recessive Dysosteosclerosis.\nTwo variants (1 frameshift, 1 splice region) that have been reported in a family consisting of 2 affected siblings in 1 publication (PMID: 30537558) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is presumed to be loss of function though more evidence is required. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression data.\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 12/4/23 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:510894e0-bd9e-4929-aae1-ac548138ab6c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
