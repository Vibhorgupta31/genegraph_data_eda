Using a combination of microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, homozygosity mapping, and transcript profiling, we mapped the gene defect to chromosome 12 and identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.88G>A) in C12orf62. C12orf62 was not detectable by immunoblot analysis in subject fibroblasts, and retroviral expression of the wild-type C12orf62 cDNA rescued the biochemical phenotype. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of C12orf 62 recapitulated the biochemical defect in control cells and exacerbated it in subject cells. C12orf62 is apparently restricted to the vertebrate lineage. It codes for a very small (6 kDa), uncharacterized, single-transmembrane protein that localizes to mitochondria and elutes in a complex of ∼110 kDa by gel filtration. COX I, II, and IV coimmunoprecipated with an epitope-tagged version of C12orf62, and 2D blue-native-polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis analysis of newly synthesized mitochondrial COX subunits in subject fibroblasts showed that COX assembly was impaired and that the nascent enzyme complex was unstable. We conclude that C12orf62 is required for coordination of the early steps of COX assembly with the synthesis of COX I.","dc:creator":"Weraarpachai W","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in C12orf62, a factor that couples COX I synthesis with cytochrome c oxidase assembly, cause fatal neonatal lactic acidosis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:b2773e19-233e-476e-ad77-198e497fedd3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b2773e19-233e-476e-ad77-198e497fedd3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Hours","ageValue":24,"allele":{"id":"cggv:8d64ca1a-7af9-49ee-8f7c-ed108d3df899","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032901.4(COX14):c.57G>A (p.Met19Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129740"}},"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping and focused on largest region of LOH, followed by RNA sequencing and focused on transcripts in this region with low expression, followed by C12orf62 sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Fatal neonatal lactic acidosis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002490","obo:HP_0000954","obo:HP_0003128","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001639","obo:HP_0002098","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0000601","obo:HP_0000568","obo:HP_0008221","obo:HP_0001942","obo:HP_0002415","obo:HP_0000089"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:289abfe0-70d0-4cb9-ba02-08100a36f40e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8d64ca1a-7af9-49ee-8f7c-ed108d3df899"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22243966"},"rdfs:label":"Case"},{"id":"cggv:289abfe0-70d0-4cb9-ba02-08100a36f40e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:289abfe0-70d0-4cb9-ba02-08100a36f40e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Scoring at default for missense variant (0.1) + CIV deficiency (0.4) + CIV assembly defect (0.4)\n\nComplex IV deficiency in patient fibroblast cell line (30-40% of controls) and other causes of complex IV deficiency were excluded as fully as possible given the time by genetic testing (transduced fibroblasts from the subject with retroviral vectors that express the cDNAs for several known COX-assembly factors, i.e., COX11, COX16, COX17, OXA1, SCO2, PET191, SURF1, OXA2, COX10, COX15.1, COX19, COX15.2, SCO1, and COX23;

The *COX14* gene encodes a Complex IV, or cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly factor and is also involved in translation of *MT-CO1*, the gene encoding the COX1 subunit of the enzyme.\n\nThe *COX14* gene has been reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in a single family in a single publication in 2012 (PMID: 22243966). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX14*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX14* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. While segregation data were considered, the LOD score (1.68) did not meet criteria to be scored per the ClinGen Gene Curation SOP V8 (PMID: 22243966). This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one proband in one publication (PMID: 22243966). Affected individuals in this family had a severe lactic acidosis and died shortly after birth.  Loss of function is suspected to be the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMID: 22243966).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 21, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
