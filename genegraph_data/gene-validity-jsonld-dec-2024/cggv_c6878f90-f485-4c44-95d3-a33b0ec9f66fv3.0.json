How post-transcriptional methylation contributes to the human disease is currently unknown. By comparing gene expression data with global cytosine-5 RNA methylomes in patient fibroblasts and NSun2-deficient mice, we find that loss of cytosine-5 RNA methylation increases the angiogenin-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNA) leading to an accumulation of 5' tRNA-derived small RNA fragments. Accumulation of 5' tRNA fragments in the absence of NSun2 reduces protein translation rates and activates stress pathways leading to reduced cell size and increased apoptosis of cortical, hippocampal and striatal neurons. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that angiogenin binds with higher affinity to tRNAs lacking site-specific NSun2-mediated methylation and that the presence of 5' tRNA fragments is sufficient and required to trigger cellular stress responses. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity of NSun2-deficient brains to oxidative stress can be rescued through inhibition of angiogenin during embryogenesis. In conclusion, failure in NSun2-mediated tRNA methylation contributes to human diseases via stress-induced RNA cleavage.","dc:creator":"Blanco S","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Aberrant methylation of tRNAs links cellular stress to neuro-developmental disorders."},"rdfs:label":"NSun2 deletion causes neurodevelopmental defects in mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This same mouse model was reported in Blanco et al.

Particularly, autosomal-recessive forms of the disorder have a very heterogeneous molecular basis, and genes with an increased number of disease-causing mutations are not common. Here, we report on three different mutations (two nonsense mutations, c.679C>T [p.Gln227(∗)] and c.1114C>T [p.Gln372(∗)], as well as one splicing mutation, g.6622224A>C [p.Ile179Argfs(∗)192]) that cause a loss of the tRNA-methyltransferase-encoding NSUN2 main transcript in homozygotes. We identified the mutations by sequencing exons and exon-intron boundaries within the genomic region where the linkage intervals of three independent consanguineous families of Iranian and Kurdish origin overlapped with the previously described MRT5 locus. In order to gain further evidence concerning the effect of a loss of NSUN2 on memory and learning, we constructed a Drosophila model by deleting the NSUN2 ortholog, CG6133, and investigated the mutants by using molecular and behavioral approaches. When the Drosophila melanogaster NSUN2 ortholog was deleted, severe short-term-memory (STM) deficits were observed; STM could be rescued by re-expression of the wild-type protein in the nervous system. The humans homozygous for NSUN2 mutations showed an overlapping phenotype consisting of moderate to severe ID and facial dysmorphism (which includes a long face, characteristic eyebrows, a long nose, and a small chin), suggesting that mutations in this gene might even induce a syndromic form of ID. Moreover, our observations from the Drosophila model point toward an evolutionarily conserved role of RNA methylation in normal cognitive development.","dc:creator":"Abbasi-Moheb L","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in NSUN2 cause autosomal-recessive intellectual disability."},"rdfs:label":"Nsun2 Drosophila model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because non-mammalian model, as per ID/ASD GCEP."},{"id":"cggv:e69245e7-ce39-4b7d-8d6d-5c4b3f869ed0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7de5072d-a8e8-4ffd-8f84-a34bd851f420","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice with conditional ablation of Nsun2 in excitatory neurons (CamK-Cre+,Nsun22lox/2lox mutant mice) exhibited a decrease in tRNA cytosine methylation in the adult cortex and glycine codon-specific defects in translational efficiency.

However, now that genome-wide approaches can be applied to single multiplex consanguineous families, the identification of genes harboring disease-causing mutations by autozygosity mapping is expanding rapidly. Here, we have mapped a disease locus in a consanguineous Pakistani family affected by ID and distal myopathy. We genotyped family members on genome-wide SNP microarrays and used the data to determine a single 2.5 Mb homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) locus in region 5p15.32-p15.31; we identified the missense change c.2035G>A (p.Gly679Arg) at a conserved residue within NSUN2. This gene encodes a methyltransferase that catalyzes formation of 5-methylcytosine at C34 of tRNA-leu(CAA) and plays a role in spindle assembly during mitosis as well as chromosome segregation. In mouse brains, we show that NSUN2 localizes to the nucleolus of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The effects of the mutation were confirmed by the transfection of wild-type and mutant constructs into cells and subsequent immunohistochemistry. We show that mutation to arginine at this residue causes NSUN2 to fail to localize within the nucleolus. The ID combined with a unique profile of comorbid features presented here makes this an important genetic discovery, and the involvement of NSUN2 highlights the role of RNA methyltransferase in human neurocognitive development.","dc:creator":"Khan MA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutation in NSUN2, which encodes an RNA methyltransferase, causes autosomal-recessive intellectual disability."}},"rdfs:label":"MR14 II:3"},{"id":"cggv:e4324a13-1f3b-425c-baa8-ba6adf8fef17","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e4324a13-1f3b-425c-baa8-ba6adf8fef17_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e4324a13-1f3b-425c-baa8-ba6adf8fef17_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant was shown to impair proper cellular localization of the NSUN2 protein; p.Gly679Arg mutant failed to localize to the nucleoli in most transfected Human Breast Cancer Cell Line HCC1954, and accumulated in the nucleoplasm in 80% of transfected cells."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded to 0.5 points due to presence of homozygous variant in a consanguineous family"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:fe330182-0c0c-41e1-92df-4e3cd49301ac_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe330182-0c0c-41e1-92df-4e3cd49301ac","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:1fa57c7d-cfee-4a68-afa4-a66dfe90e595","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017755.6(NSUN2):c.1020del (p.Gly341ValfsTer15)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658820839"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Bilateral ptosis, hypotonia, and facial features suggestive of Zellweger syndrome.

The clinical presentation includes global developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, short stature, delayed puberty, infertility, dysmorphic facial features and a wide-range of ocular-related abnormalities. \n\nTwelve *NSUN2* variants (splice site, nonsense, frameshift, missense) that have been reported in 11 probands are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 14 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Both consanguineous and non-consanguineous families from different ethnicities have been reported. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. \n\nOf note, an individual with a homozygous frameshift variant in *NSUN2*, scored here, was described as having facial features reminiscent of Noonan syndrome (PMID: 24102521). This assertion was assessed separately by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel and the relationship between *NSUN2* and RASopathies was disputed. \n\n*NSUN2* encodes an RNA methyltransferase that modifies transfer RNAs crucial for protein synthesis. Experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes knockout models in mice (PMIDs: 22144916, 25063673, 3438972) and drosophila (PMID: 22541559). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NSUN2* and syndromic intellectual disability. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 6, 2019. It was re-evaluated on October 18, 2023.
