The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical validity of various diagnostic tools in confirming MRC disorder in LS and Leigh-like syndrome (LL). The results of enzyme assays, molecular analysis, and cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements were examined. Of 106 patients, 41 were biochemically and genetically verified, and 34 had reduced MRC activity but no causative mutations. Seven patients with normal MRC complex activities had mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene. Five further patients with normal activity in MRC were identified with causative mutations. Conversely, 12 out of 60 enzyme assays performed for genetically verified patients returned normal results. No biochemical or genetic background was confirmed for 19 patients. OCR was reduced in ten out of 19 patients with negative enzyme assay results. Inconsistent enzyme assay results between fibroblast and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were observed in 33% of 37 simultaneously analyzed cases. These data suggest that highest diagnostic rate is reached using a combined enzymatic and genetic approach, analyzing more than one type of biological materials where suitable.

By homologous recombination, a point mutation TÂ >Â G within 55th codon of the Ndufa1 gene was introduced. The resulting allele Ndufa1S55A introduced systemic serine-55-alanine (S55A) mutation within the MWFE protein, which is essential for Complex I assembly and stability. The S55A mutation caused systemic partial Complex I deficiency of âˆ¼50% in both sexes. The mutant males (Ndufa1S55A/Y) displayed reduced respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and produced less body heat. They were also hypoactive and ate less. They showed age-dependent Purkinje neurons degeneration. Metabolic profiling of brain, liver and serum from males showed reduced heme levels in mutants, which correlated with altered expressions of Fech and Hmox1 mRNAs in tissues. This is the first genuine X-chromosome linked mouse model for systemic partial Complex I deficiency, which shows age-dependent neurodegeneration.

NDUFA1 was first reported in association with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2007 (Fernandez-Moreira et al., PMID 17262856 ). Only three pathogenic variants in affected males (n=4, all inherited from unaffected mothers) predicted to cause a loss of function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting hemizygous NDUFA1 loss of function resulting in Complex I deficiency is the disease mechanism for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data (PubMed: 17262856, 25356405, 28429146, 29506883) to reach a case-level evidence score of 5.5 pts. This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product, complex I alterations in patient cell lines, expression studies, and animal models reaching a maximal experimental score (6 points). In summary, NDUFA1 is definitively associated with X-linked recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Although the total score was 11.5, the experts concluded that moderate level was more appropriate given the limited number of proven cases reported in the literature.
