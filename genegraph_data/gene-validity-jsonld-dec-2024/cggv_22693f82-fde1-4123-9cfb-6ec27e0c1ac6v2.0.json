We analyzed 1007 consecutive index cases for whom GS was performed in a diagnostic setting over a 2-year period. We reported pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants that explain the patients' phenotype in 212 of the 1007 cases (21.1%). In 245 additional cases (24.3%), a variant of unknown significance (VUS) related to the phenotype was reported. We especially investigated patients which had had ES with no genetic diagnosis (n = 358). For this group, GS diagnostic yield was 14.5% (52 patients with P/LP out of 358). GS should be especially indicated for ES-negative cases since up to 29.6% of them  could benefit from GS testing (14.5% with P/LP, n = 52 and 15.1% with VUS, n = 54). Genetic diagnoses in most of the ES-negative/GS-positive cases were determined by technical superiority of GS, i.e., access to noncoding regions and more uniform coverage. Importantly, we reported 79 noncoding variants, of which, 41 variants were classified as P/LP. Interpretation of noncoding variants remains challenging, and in many cases, complementary methods based on direct enzyme assessment, biomarker testing and RNA analysis are needed for variant classification and diagnosis. We present the largest cohort of patients with GS performed in a clinical setting to date. The results of this study should direct the decision for GS as standard second-line, or even first-line stand-alone test.","dc:creator":"Bertoli-Avella AM","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Successful application of genome sequencing in a diagnostic setting: 1007 index cases from a clinically heterogeneous cohort."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 GS"},{"id":"cggv:9a04ea69-8730-488e-a50e-8ba1f1091a63","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a04ea69-8730-488e-a50e-8ba1f1091a63_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7c39eccb-4265-4b63-9a05-2add1b338bf5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c39eccb-4265-4b63-9a05-2add1b338bf5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:93adeb7d-8862-4fa4-9898-c566b27eb844","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007327.4(GRIN1):c.394-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA375713805"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0003121","obo:HP_0000505","obo:HP_0001250"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:146daaf2-7b6d-4fc1-9066-00d3e16399db_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:93adeb7d-8862-4fa4-9898-c566b27eb844"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34611970","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Pathogenic variants in glutamate receptor, ionotropic, NMDA-1 (GRIN1) cause an autosomal dominant or recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with global developmental delay, with or without seizures (AD or AR GRIN1-NDD).

Although acquired causes for CVI are well known, genetic causes underlying CVI are largely unidentified. DNAs of 25 patients with CVI and intellectual disability, but without acquired (eg, perinatal) damage, were investigated by whole-exome sequencing. The data were analyzed for de novo, autosomal-recessive, and X-linked variants, and subsequently classified into known, candidate, or unlikely to be associated with CVI. This classification was based on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, literature reports, variant characteristics, and functional relevance of the gene. After classification, variants in four genes known to be associated with CVI (AHDC1, NGLY1, NR2F1, PGAP1) in 5 patients (20%) were identified, establishing a conclusive genetic diagnosis for CVI.

Although N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is also implicated in schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether NMDAR hypofunction leads to dopamine release abnormalities. We previously demonstrated schizophrenia-like phenotypes in GABAergic neuron-specific NMDAR hypofunctional mutant mice, in which Ppp1r2-Cre dependent deletion of indispensable NMDAR channel subunit Grin1 is induced in corticolimbic GABAergic neurons including parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons, in postnatal development, but not in adulthood. Here, we report enhanced dopaminomimetic-induced locomotor activity in these mutants, along with bidirectional, site-specific changes in in vivo amphetamine-induced dopamine release: nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine release was enhanced by amphetamine in postnatal Ppp1r2-Cre/Grin1 knockout (KO) mice, whereas dopamine release was dramatically reduced in the medial PFC (mPFC) compared to controls. Basal tissue dopamine levels in both the NAc and mPFC were unaffected. Interestingly, the magnitude and distribution of amphetamine-induced c-Fos expression in dopamine neurons was comparable between genotypes across dopaminergic input subregions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). These effects appear to be both developmentally and cell-type specifically modulated, since PV-specific Grin1 KO mice could induce the same effects as seen in postnatal-onset Ppp1r2-Cre/Grin1 KO mice, but no such abnormalities were observed in somatostatin-Cre/Grin1 KO mice or adult-onset Ppp1r2-Cre/Grin1 KO mice.

These animals (Cre+/(fGrin1+)) were compared with littermates lacking Cre expression (Cre-/(fGrin1+)). Following cue discrimination fear conditioning, male Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice showed increased fear expression to the tone paired with a foot shock (CS+) while still discriminating the CS+ from a tone never paired with a foot shock (CS-). In contrast to males, female mice learned and discriminated fear cues equivalently across the genotypes. Similarly, no genotype differences in sociability or social novelty were observed in female mice, but Cre+/(fGrin1+) males displayed greater naive sociability and preference for social novelty than Cre-/(fGrin1+) littermates. Furthermore, the level of social withdrawal exhibited by male Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice susceptible to social defeat stress relative to same genotype controls was significantly more pronounced than that displayed by susceptible Cre-/(fGrin1+) mice compared to control Cre-/(fGrin1+) mice. Together, these results demonstrate increased fear, social, and stress responsiveness specifically in male Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice.

Supportive evidence come from examination of genetically modified mice where the obligatory NMDAR-subunit GluN1 (also known as NR1) has been deleted from PV interneurons by Cre-mediated knockout of the corresponding gene Grin1 (Grin1(ΔPV) mice). Notably, such PV-specific GluN1 ablation has been reported to blunt the induction of hyperlocomotion (a surrogate for psychosis) by pharmacological NMDAR blockade with the non-competitive antagonist MK-801. This suggests PV-NMDARs as the site of the psychosis-inducing action of MK-801. In contrast to this hypothesis, we show here that Grin1(ΔPV) mice are not protected against the effects of MK-801, but are in fact sensitized to many of them. Compared with control animals, Grin1(ΔPV)mice injected with MK-801 show increased stereotypy and pronounced catalepsy, which confound the locomotor readout. Furthermore, in Grin1(ΔPV)mice, MK-801 induced medial-prefrontal delta (4 Hz) oscillations, and impaired performance on tests of motor coordination, working memory and sucrose preference, even at lower doses than in wild-type controls.

To determine the direct contribution of NMDAR dysfunction to disease phenotypes, a mouse model with constitutively reduced expression of the obligatory NR1 subunit has been developed and extensively investigated. Adult NR1(neo-/-) mice show multiple abnormal behaviors, including reduced social interactions, locomotor hyperactivity, self-injury, deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) and sensory hypersensitivity, among others. Whereas such phenotypes have largely been interpreted in the context of schizophrenia, these behavioral abnormalities are rather non-specific and are frequently present across models of diseases characterized by negative symptom domains. This study investigated auditory electrophysiological and behavioral paradigms relevant to autism, to determine whether NMDAR hypofunction may be more consistent with adult ASD-like phenotypes. Indeed, transgenic mice showed behavioral deficits relevant to all core ASD symptoms, including decreased social interactions, altered ultrasonic vocalizations and increased repetitive behaviors. NMDAR disruption recapitulated clinical endophenotypes including reduced PPI, auditory-evoked response N1 latency delay and reduced gamma synchrony. Auditory electrophysiological abnormalities more closely resembled those seen in clinical studies of autism than schizophrenia. These results suggest that NMDAR hypofunction may be associated with a continuum of neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and autism. Neural synchrony abnormalities suggest an imbalance of glutamatergic and GABAergic coupling and may provide a target, along with behavioral phenotypes, for preclinical screening of novel therapeutics.","dc:creator":"Gandal MJ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mice with reduced NMDA receptor expression: more consistent with autism than schizophrenia?"},"rdfs:label":"Gandal Mouse Model, Autism-like Phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Because autism spectrum disorder is only part of the phenotypic spectrum for individuals with biallelic GRIN1 variants, we have decided to score this model at one point."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6929,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":12.2,"subject":{"id":"cggv:91a91938-9dfc-41ed-89ad-8bc87eafec42","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100038","gene":"hgnc:4584","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"*GRIN1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive (AR) complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2016 (Bosch et al., PMID: 26350515). Phenotypic features in individuals with biallelic *GRIN1* variants include intellectual disability, hypotonia, autism spectrum disorder, stereotypic movements, feeding difficulties and brain abnormalities. Seizures and early death have been reported in individuals with homozygous nonsense variants (PMID 27164704, 35393335). Of note, there have also been many reported cases of individuals with heterozygous missense variants in *GRIN1* and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and molecular mechanism, with the AR presentation being primarily loss of function variants and the AD presentation being primarily missense variants. Therefore, the curations for AD and AR complex neurodevelopmental disorder have been split, and cases with AD *GRIN1* variants have been curated separately by the Epilepsy GCEP.\n\nSix homozygous variants reported in six probands in five publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 34611970, 35393335, 28051072, 27164704, 26350515). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function (PMID: 27164704). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models (PMIDs: 19794189, 22726567). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *GRIN1* and AR complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date April 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:22693f82-fde1-4123-9cfb-6ec27e0c1ac6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
