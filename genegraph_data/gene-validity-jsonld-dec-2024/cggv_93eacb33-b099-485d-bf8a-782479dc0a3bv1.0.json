However, with the exception of the peroxisome-targeting signal receptors and the receptor docking proteins, the function of most of these proteins, called peroxins, remains largely unknown. One step toward elucidating the function of a protein is to identify its interacting partners. We have used a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid system to analyze the interactions among a set of 12 mammalian peroxins and a yeast protein three-hybrid system to investigate whether proteins that interact with the same peroxin and have overlapping binding sites cooperate or compete for this site. Here we report a detailed interaction map of these peroxins and demonstrate that (i) farnesylation, and not the CAAX motif, of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex13p; (ii) the CAAXmotif, and not farnesylation, of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex11pbeta; and (iii) the C(3)HC(4) RING (really interesting new gene) finger domain of Pex12p does not alter the binding properties of Pex5p for the C-terminal peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1. Finally, we show that the Pex5p-Pex13p interaction is bridged by Pex14p and that the latter molecule exists predominantly as a dimer in vivo. Collectively, as demonstrated in this work with peroxins, these results indicate that the bacterial two-hybrid system is an attractive complementary approach to the conventional transcription-based yeast two-hybrid system for studying protein-protein interactions.","dc:creator":"Fransen M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Analysis of mammalian peroxin interactions using a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid assay."},"rdfs:label":"Fransen_PI_PEX11B/PEX19"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2ff8fc53-8de7-4adf-aa0c-96bf88dd7220","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2fee12db-a16d-4e42-9db9-a813d947a508","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"In patients with mild forms of PBDs, a small number of import-competent, enlarged peroxisomes are observed (from PMID: 20647552)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21669930","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Human peroxisome biogenesis disorders are lethal genetic diseases in which abnormal peroxisome assembly compromises overall peroxisome and cellular function.

We also demonstrate the relevance of Drosophila as a genetic model for the early developmental defects associated with the human peroxisome biogenesis disorders.

Inherited mutations in Drosophila Pex1 correlate with reproducible defects during early development. Notably, Pex1 mutant larvae exhibit abnormalities that are analogous to those exhibited by Zellweger syndrome patients, including developmental delay, poor feeding, severe structural abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems, and early death.

The resulting defects in peroxisome metabolism and the accumulation of peroxisomal substrates are thought to cause the other Zellweger syndrome phenotypes, including neuronal migration defects, hypotonia, a developmental delay, and neonatal lethality. These phenotypes are also manifested in mouse models of Zellweger syndrome generated by disruption of the PEX5 or PEX2 gene. Here we show that mice lacking peroxisomal membrane protein PEX11 beta display several pathologic features shared by these mouse models of Zellweger syndrome, including neuronal migration defects, enhanced neuronal apoptosis, a developmental delay, hypotonia, and neonatal lethality. However, PEX11 beta deficiency differs significantly from Zellweger syndrome and Zellweger syndrome mice in that it is not characterized by a detectable defect in peroxisomal protein import and displays only mild defects in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation and peroxisomal ether lipid biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that the neurological pathologic features of Zellweger syndrome can occur without peroxisomal enzyme mislocalization and challenge current models of Zellweger syndrome pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Li X","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"PEX11 beta deficiency is lethal and impairs neuronal migration but does not abrogate peroxisome function."},"rdfs:label":"Li_Pex11B Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The evidence is scored default points as the model recapitulates the phenotype associated with PEX11B mutations in humans.

PEX11B encodes an integral peroxisome membrane protein involved in peroxisome elongation and division. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by defects in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or peroxisome biogenesis, involving at least 14 PEX genes. The PEX11 protein family comprises three isoforms, PEX11α, PEX11β and PEX11γ, encoded by PEX11A, PEX11B and PEX11G genes, respectively (Waterham and Ebberink 2012, PMID 22871920). While PEX11A and PEX11G have not been reported in relation to PBDs in humans, a few patients with mild PBD phenotype have been described with PEX11B mutations. A common feature observed in all affected individuals has been bilateral congenital cataracts.\n\nPEX11B was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder in 2012. (Ebberink  et al, 2012; PMID: 22581968). At least 5 nonsense or deletion variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (7 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 22581968, 28129423, 31724321). The mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (4.5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays (PMIDs 22581968, 21669930, 24234511) and a mouse model (PMID: 12024045). PEX11B interacts with PEX19 (PMID: 12096124). \n  \nIn summary, PEX11B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peroxisome biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on January 17, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:93eacb33-b099-485d-bf8a-782479dc0a3b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
