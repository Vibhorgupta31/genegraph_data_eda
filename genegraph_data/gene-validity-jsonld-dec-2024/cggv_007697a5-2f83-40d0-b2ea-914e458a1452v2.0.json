Mutations in MYH14 lead to a DFNA4-type hearing impairment. Further evidence also shows that MYH14 is a candidate noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) susceptible gene. However, the specific roles of MYH14 in auditory function and NIHL are not fully understood. In the present study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to establish a Myh14 knockout mice line in CBA/CaJ background (now referred to as Myh14(-/-) mice) and clarify the role of MYH14 in the cochlea and NIHL. We found that Myh14(-/-) mice did not exhibit significant hearing loss until five months of age. In addition, Myh14(-/-) mice were more vulnerable to high intensity noise compared to control mice. More significant outer hair cell loss was observed in Myh14(-/-) mice than in wild type controls after acoustic trauma. Our findings suggest that Myh14 may play a beneficial role in the protection of the cochlea after acoustic overstimulation in CBA/CaJ mice.","dc:creator":"Fu X","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Loss of Myh14 Increases Susceptibility to Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in CBA/CaJ Mice."},"rdfs:label":"Cochlear expression of MYH14 in mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:69c0e92f-5c72-4609-9619-7f26e8bc0ca7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8e86cc9-ee20-44c8-9d1b-bcab1ef5e2ab","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RT-PCR of the Myh14 gene in mouse cochlea revealed high levels of expression.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15015131","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Myosins have been implicated in various motile processes, including organelle translocation, ion-channel gating, and cytoskeleton reorganization. Different members of the myosin superfamily are responsible for syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing impairment in both humans and mice. MYH14 encodes one of the heavy chains of the class II nonmuscle myosins, and it is localized within the autosomal dominant hearing impairment (DFNA4) critical region. After demonstrating that MYH14 is highly expressed in mouse cochlea, we performed a mutational screening in a large series of 300 hearing-impaired patients from Italy, Spain, and Belgium and in a German kindred linked to DFNA4. This study allowed us to identify a nonsense and two missense mutations in large pedigrees, linked to DFNA4, as well as a de novo allele in a sporadic case. Absence of these mutations in healthy individuals was tested in 200 control individuals. These findings clearly demonstrate the role of MYH14 in causing autosomal dominant hearing loss and further confirm the crucial role of the myosin superfamily in auditive functions.","dc:creator":"Donaudy F","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Nonmuscle myosin heavy-chain gene MYH14 is expressed in cochlea and mutated in patients affected by autosomal dominant hearing impairment (DFNA4)."},"rdfs:label":"RT-PCR of MYH14 in Mouse Cochlea"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:007697a5-2f83-40d0-b2ea-914e458a1452_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6ddf155c-850f-4cb3-b3ca-f0b461851336","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97249dd3-bb13-4d4d-a401-f5cacf107072","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Used Auditory brainstem response to find that the auditory thresholds were increased in the MYH14 KO mice.

For many decades, linkage analysis and candidate gene approaches have been the main tools to elucidate the genetics of hearing loss. However, this associated study design is costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for small families. This is mainly due to the inadequate numbers of available affected individuals, locus heterogeneity, and assortative mating. Exome sequencing has now become technically feasible and a cost-effective method for detection of disease variants underlying Mendelian disorders due to the recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In the present study, we have combined both the Deafness Gene Mutation Detection Array and exome sequencing to identify deafness causative variants in a large Chinese composite family with deaf by deaf mating. The simultaneous screening of the 9 common deafness mutations using the allele-specific PCR based universal array, resulted in the identification of the 1555A>G in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 12S rRNA in affected individuals in one branch of the family. We then subjected the mutation-negative cases to exome sequencing and identified novel causative variants in the MYH14 and WFS1 genes. This report confirms the effective use of a NGS technique to detect pathogenic mutations in affected individuals who were not candidates for classical genetic studies.","dc:creator":"Qing J","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing to decipher the genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss in a Chinese family with deaf by deaf mating."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25289672","rdfs:label":"IIIB:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Did not score this because there are several causes of HL in this family including this de novo variant p.T865M and therefore it is not convincing evidence that it is causing the hearing loss.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. MYH14 is thought to play a beneficial role in the protection of the cochlea after acoustic over-stimulation and that loss of function leads to progressive hearing loss (PMID: 28101381). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 8/31/2020.
