The majority of cases are sporadic. Although multiple genetic loci have been tentatively implicated in HLHS, no gene or pathway seems to be specifically associated with the disease. To elucidate the genetic basis of HLHS, we analyzed 53 well-characterized patients with isolated HLHS using an integrated genomic approach that combined DNA sequencing of five candidate genes (NKX2-5, NOTCH1, HAND1, FOXC2 and FOXL1) and genome-wide screening by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. In 30 patients, we identified two novel de novo mutations in NOTCH1, 23 rare patients inherited gene variants in NOTCH1, FOXC2 and FOXL1, and 33 rare patients mostly inherited copy-number variants. Some of the identified variations coexisted in the same patient. The biological significance of such rare variations is unknown, but our findings strengthen the role of NOTCH pathway in cardiac valve development, indicating that HLHS is, at least in part, a 'valve' disease. This is the first report of de novo mutations associated with isolated HLHS. Moreover, the coexistence of multiple rare variants suggests in some cases a cumulative effect, as shown for other complex disease.","dc:creator":"Iascone M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Identification of de novo mutations and rare variants in hypoplastic left heart syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e6540a7-3e81-47b1-a74f-7d0328f34ce1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:7e6540a7-3e81-47b1-a74f-7d0328f34ce1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":7527,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4b570326-e2d7-4827-bc15-80ad1ed41310","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:3817","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*FOXL1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2012 (Iascone et al., PMID: 21457232). Five unique variants (missense, duplication, regulatory and gross duplication) in five individuals with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were reported in three publications (PMIDs: 21457232, 28473349, 29368431), but none of them were scored due to high minor allele frequency in gnomAD v.4. No experimental evidence has been reported in the literature supporting this gene-disease relationship. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *FOXL1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *FOXL1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 11/27/2023 (SOP Version 10)\nMore evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *FOXL1* plays in congenital heart disease.
