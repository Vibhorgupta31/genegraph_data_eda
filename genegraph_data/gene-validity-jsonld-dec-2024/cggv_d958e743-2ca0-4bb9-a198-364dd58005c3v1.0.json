Clinical phenotypes of OD include brachy-turricephaly, midface hypoplasia, short stature, short/broad hands and feet, and failure to thrive due to feeding and respiratory difficulties in some cases. The mechanism of disease is dominant-positive gain of function variants, causing increased signalling of the FGFR1 protein (PMID: 15625620). At least 5 unique missense variants have been reported in the literature. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, of 8 probands from 5 publications (PMIDs: 15625620, 31319224, 29147600, 20236123, 16470795).

Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
