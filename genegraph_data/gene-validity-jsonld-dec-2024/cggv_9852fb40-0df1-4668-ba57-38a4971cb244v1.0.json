In yeast, homologs of OPA1 (Mgm1) and MFN2 (Fzo1) work in concert with Ugo1, for which no human equivalent has been identified thus far. By whole-exome sequencing of patients with optic atrophy and CMT2, we identified four families with recessive mutations in SLC25A46. We demonstrate that SLC25A46, like Ugo1, is a modified carrier protein that has been recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with the inner membrane remodeling protein mitofilin (Fcj1). Loss of function in cultured cells and in zebrafish unexpectedly leads to increased mitochondrial connectivity, while severely affecting the development and maintenance of neurons in the fish. The discovery of SLC25A46 strengthens the genetic overlap between optic atrophy and CMT2 while exemplifying a new class of modified solute transporters linked to mitochondrial dynamics.

mitochondrial fusion and fission have been linked to various neurodegenerative disorders. In siblings from two unrelated families who died soon after birth with a profound neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by pontocerebellar hypoplasia and apnoea, we discovered a missense mutation and an exonic deletion in the SLC25A46 gene encoding a mitochondrial protein recently implicated in optic atrophy spectrum disorder. We performed functional studies that confirmed the mitochondrial localization and pro-fission properties of SLC25A46. Knockdown of slc24a46 expression in zebrafish embryos caused brain malformation, spinal motor neuron loss, and poor motility. At the cellular level, we observed abnormally elongated mitochondria, which was rescued by co-injection of the wild-type but not the mutant slc25a46 mRNA. Conversely, overexpression of the wild-type protein led to mitochondrial fragmentation and disruption of the mitochondrial network. In contrast to mutations causing non-lethal optic atrophy, missense mutations causing lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia markedly destabilize the protein. Indeed, the clinical severity appears inversely correlated with the relative stability of the mutant protein.

SLC25A46 belongs to the mitochondrial transporter family, but it is not known to have transport function. Apart from this possible function, SLC25A46 forms molecular complexes with proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and cristae remodeling. We demonstrate that the patient's mutation directly affects the SLC25A46 interaction with MIC60. Furthermore, we mapped all of the reported substitutions in the protein onto a 3D model and found that half of them fall outside of the signature carrier motifs associated with transport function. We thus suggest that there are two distinct molecular mechanisms in SLC25A46-associated pathogenesis, one that destabilizes the protein while the other alters the molecular interactions of the protein.

We utilized a mouse model carrying a knockout of the mitochondrial fusion-fission-related gene solute carrier family 25 member 46 (Slc25a46) and treated them with neurotrophic AAV-PHP.B vector carrying the mouse Slc25a46 coding sequence. Thereafter, we used immunofluorescence staining and western blot to test the transduction efficiency of this vector. Toluidine blue staining and electronic microscopy were utilized to assess the morphology of optic and sciatic nerves following treatment, and the morphology and respiratory chain activity of mitochondria within these tissues were determined as well. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector effectively transduced in the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, liver and sciatic nerves. AAV-Slc25a46 treatment was able to rescue the premature death in the mutant mice (Slc25a46-/-). The treatment-improved electronic conductivity of the peripheral nerves increased mobility and restored mitochondrial complex activities. Most notably, mitochondrial morphology inside the tissues of both the central and peripheral nervous systems was normalized, and the neurodegeneration, chronic neuroinflammation and loss of Purkinje cell dendrites observed within the mutant mice were alleviated. Overall, our study shows that AAV-PHP.B's neurotrophic properties are plausible for treating conditions where the central nervous system is affected, such as many mitochondrial diseases, and that AAV-Slc25a46 could be a novel approach for treating SLC25A46-related mitochondrial disorders.","dc:creator":"Yang L","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Systemic administration of AAV-Slc25a46 mitigates mitochondrial neuropathy in Slc25a46-/- mice."},"rdfs:label":"AAV-SLC25a46 treatment"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Patients variants were not tested."},{"id":"cggv:2cbd6853-1da1-4e15-9215-2652e8fee73e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be8e512f-b701-4491-99ff-44d709e10eff","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"A Slc25a46 knock-out mouse model resulted in enhanced hind limb clasping reflex and muscle atrophy.

Mice lacking SLC25A46 displayed severe ataxia, mainly caused by degeneration of Purkinje cells. Increased numbers of small, unmyelinated and degenerated optic nerves as well as loss of retinal ganglion cells indicated optic atrophy. Compound muscle action potentials in peripheral nerves showed peripheral neuropathy associated with degeneration and demyelination in axons. Mutant cerebellar neurons have large mitochondria, which exhibit abnormal distribution and transport.

Although human SLC25A46 is a well-known transporter that acts through the mitochondrial outer membrane, the relationship between neurodegeneration in these diseases and the loss-of-function of SLC25A46 remains unclear. Two Drosophila genes, CG8931 (dSLC25A46a) and CG5755 (dSLC25A46b) have been identified as candidate homologs of human SLC25A46. We previously characterized the phenotypes of pan-neuron-specific dSLC25A46b knockdown flies. In the present study, we developed pan-neuron-specific dSLC25A46a knockdown flies and examined their phenotypes. Neuron-specific dSLC25A46a knockdown resulted in reduced mobility in larvae as well as adults. An aberrant morphology for neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), such as a reduced synaptic branch length and decreased number and size of boutons, was observed in dSLC25A46a knockdown flies. Learning ability was also reduced in the larvae of knockdown flies. In dSLC25A46a knockdown flies, mitochondrial hyperfusion was detected in NMJ synapses together with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and reductions in ATP. These phenotypes were very similar to those of dSLC25A46b knockdown flies, suggesting that dSLC25A46a and dSLC25A46b do not have redundant roles in neurons. Collectively, these results show that the depletion of SLC25A46a leads to mitochondrial defects followed by an aberrant synaptic morphology, resulting in locomotive defects and learning disability. Thus, the dSLC25A46a knockdown fly summarizes most of the phenotypes in patients with mitochondrial diseases, offering a useful tool for studying these diseases.","dc:creator":"Ali MS","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Neuron-specific knockdown of solute carrier protein SLC25A46a induces locomotive defects, an abnormal neuron terminal morphology, learning disability, and shortened lifespan."},"rdfs:label":"Drosophila dSLC25A46a knockdown"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1003,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:22479881-0f2a-4d44-a939-4475d1d7c03c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014671","gene":"hgnc:25198","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"SLC25A46 was first reported in 2015 associated to an autosomal recessive axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with a Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype combined with optic atrophy (HMSN6) and, to a variable extent, to further central nervous system manifestations including cerebellar ataxia and spasticity (Abrams et al., PMID: 26168012). The clinical pattern is heterogeneous. In contrast to optic atrophy, single cases have been reported without a detectable neuropathy at the date of examination (PMIDs: 32259769, 28369803). The age at onset varies from congenital to childhood manifestations. 12 missense, 2 nonsense, 2 frameshift, and 2 splice variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 20 probands in 11 separate publications (PMIDs: 26168012, 30178502, 27430653, 27543974, 28653766, 28558379, 28637197, 26951855, 27390132, 32259769, 28369803). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and animal models. SLC25A46 is a modified carrier protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. It plays a major role in mitochondrial dynamics (fission) (Abrams et al., PMID: 26168012). In HeLa cells, SLC25A46 knockdown resulted in mitochondrial elongation, which was found to be associated to fission defects (electron microscopy, Abrams et al., PMID: 26168012). In a zebrafish model, motor neurons had significantly shorter axons tracts (Abrams et al., PMID: 26168012). In sciatic nerve of Slc25a46-/- mice, mitochondria clumped together with disorganized or abolished cristae (Li et al., PMID: 28934388), whereas AAV–Slc25a46 rescued the abnormal distribution of mitochondria in mice sciatic nerves accordingly improving nerve conduction studies as well (Li Yang et al., PMID:31943007). In summary, SLC25A46 is definitively associated with an autosomal recessive syndrome including axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, optic atrophy, and variable central nervous system manifestations. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nEvidence has been replicated over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9852fb40-0df1-4668-ba57-38a4971cb244"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
