In this report, immunohistochemical and Western blot techniques, using different anti-CD10 monoclonal antibodies, were utilized to demonstrate that CD10 is also expressed by myelin sheaths of the human peripheral nervous system (PNS), but not of the central nervous system. CD10-positive immunoreactivity appeared to be localized in the outer and inner borders of myelinated fibers, in nodes of Ranvier and in the Schmidt-Lantermann clefts, thus showing a distribution pattern very similar to that of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). The above findings suggest that CD10 antigen, through its enzymatic activity, may have a functional role in the assembly and maintenance of PNS myelin. In addition, it is not known whether CD10, similarly to MAG, may be a target antigen in some PNS immune-mediated disorders.","dc:creator":"Cadoni A","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Expression of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CD 10) by myelinated fibers of the peripheral nervous system."},"rdfs:label":"CD10 expression in peripheral nerve by WB and histochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6d426d95-70b5-4537-809f-9f2520fc39e9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9941d80-baae-4639-b94f-dd1a0081ee56","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1e9705cc-6dea-44bc-80b8-47e057e76aa3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"there is little, if not none similarity","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19084065","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by enhanced neurogenic inflammation, mediated by neuropeptides. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is a key enzyme in neuropeptide catabolism. We used NEP knock out (ko) mice to investigate whether NEP deficiency leads to increased pain behavior and signs of neurogenic inflammation after soft tissue trauma with and without nerve injury. After chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the right sciatic nerve, NEP ko mice were more sensitive to heat, to mechanical stimuli, and to cold than wild type mice. Tissue injury without nerve injury produced no differences between genotypes. After CCI, NEP ko mice showed increased hind paw edema but lower skin temperatures than wild type mice. Substance P (SP) and endothelin 1 (ET 1) determined by enzyme immuno assay (EIA) were increased in sciatic nerves from NEP ko mice after CCI. Tissue CGRP content did not differ between the genotypes. The results provide evidence that pain behavior and neurogenic inflammation are enhanced in NEP ko mice after nerve injury. These findings resemble human 'cold' CRPS and suggest that ET 1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CRPS with nerve injury.","dc:creator":"Krämer HH","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Increased pain and neurogenic inflammation in mice deficient of neutral endopeptidase."},"rdfs:label":"NEP ko mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"the phenotype described does not correspond to the human clinical picture"},{"id":"cggv:84643b85-3685-470c-94f5-57a62bd59c54","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23ba1485-b0a9-4167-8543-41cd26c81210","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"the model system provide histological evidence for peripheral nervous system abnormalities in Mme-/mme- condition\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27588448","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Axonal polyneuropathies are a frequent cause of progressive disability in the elderly. Common etiologies comprise diabetes mellitus, paraproteinaemia, and inflammatory disorders, but often the underlying causes remain elusive. Late-onset axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT2) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited condition that manifests in the second half of life and is genetically largely unexplained. We assumed age-dependent penetrance of mutations in a so far unknown gene causing late-onset CMT2. We screened 51 index case subjects with late-onset CMT2 for mutations by whole-exome (WES) and Sanger sequencing and subsequently queried WES repositories for further case subjects carrying mutations in the identified candidate gene. We studied nerve pathology and tissue levels and function of the abnormal protein in order to explore consequences of the mutations. Altogether, we observed heterozygous rare loss-of-function and missense mutations in MME encoding the metalloprotease neprilysin in 19 index case subjects diagnosed with axonal polyneuropathies or neurodegenerative conditions involving the peripheral nervous system. MME mutations segregated in an autosomal-dominant fashion with age-related incomplete penetrance and some affected individuals were isolated case subjects. We also found that MME mutations resulted in strongly decreased tissue availability of neprilysin and impaired enzymatic activity. Although neprilysin is known to degrade β-amyloid, we observed no increased amyloid deposition or increased incidence of dementia in individuals with MME mutations. Detection of MME mutations is expected to increase the diagnostic yield in late-onset polyneuropathies, and it will be tempting to explore whether substances that can elevate neprilysin activity could be a rational option for treatment.","dc:creator":"Auer-Grumbach M","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Rare Variants in MME, Encoding Metalloprotease Neprilysin, Are Linked to Late-Onset Autosomal-Dominant

report a consanguineous family with a homozygous and heterozygous membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME) mutation (c.467delC) and two clinical conditions: fetomaternal alloimmune membranous glomerulopathy (FMG) and hereditary motor and sensory axonal neuropathy. The penetrance of both phenotypes was variable. Some individuals experienced unusually fast neurological degradation. Pain and vasomotor signs were frequent complaints, possibly due to a loss of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP, the MME gene product) function and its subsequent inability to degrade substance P and vasomotor peptides. Electrophysiological and nerve biopsy findings were consistent with predominantly axonal neuropathy. This specific clinical phenotype was attributed to a c.467delC MME gene mutation. Diagnosis of such a mutation is important but can be challenging, due to allele dropout. Heterozygous subjects who had already reached the expected age of disease onset had peripheral neuropathy, but also suffered from additional diseases. Neurologists should advise women of childbearing age with MME mutations to seek pre-pregnancy genetic advice and nephrologists should search for neuropathy in patients with FMG.","dc:creator":"Dupuis M","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Hereditary axonal neuropathy related to MME gene mutation in a family with fetomaternal alloimmune glomerulonephritis."}},"rdfs:label":"Dupuis II.2"},{"id":"cggv:4c36c87c-3c38-4d0a-8714-d46a2c1b2576","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c36c87c-3c38-4d0a-8714-d46a2c1b2576_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c74c2d0a-51db-4cc1-8169-2f2c5aeb92d5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c74c2d0a-51db-4cc1-8169-2f2c5aeb92d5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":56,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7ccfd4d3-a799-4aec-b73b-f67e9df7f2c3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007289.4(MME):c.1861T>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10584007"}},"detectionMethod":"WES HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) followed by sanger sequencing confirmation and segregation analysis\n","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"axonal sensorimotor neuropathy in all patients","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002936","obo:HP_0001284","obo:HP_0008944","obo:HP_0009053","obo:HP_0001315","obo:HP_0001288"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"custom MyGeneChip CustomSeq Resequencing Array (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) for exclusion of mutations in 28 genes known to cause CMT or IPN","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:87d456a4-35ce-438e-bde5-ceecec6f8dab_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7ccfd4d3-a799-4aec-b73b-f67e9df7f2c3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26991897"},"rdfs:label":"P4 (family 4 II.1)"},{"id":"cggv:87d456a4-35ce-438e-bde5-ceecec6f8dab","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87d456a4-35ce-438e-bde5-ceecec6f8dab_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:87d456a4-35ce-438e-bde5-ceecec6f8dab_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Immunohistochemical staining with an anti-NEP/CD10 antibody showed a negative and a partial positive reaction in P1 and P4, respectively, compared to myelin of the sural nerve from the control patient"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:07c7d356-ccc6-46c0-9e61-b35d270ae02c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07c7d356-ccc6-46c0-9e61-b35d270ae02c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c5688a7c-01cf-4ecc-be6a-d8f7ed9f94e5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000902.4(MME):c.654+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10584005"}},"detectionMethod":"WES HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) followed by sanger sequencing confirmation and segregation analysis","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"NCSs showed an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy in all patients,","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002936","obo:HP_0001284","obo:HP_0001315","obo:HP_0009053","obo:HP_0001288","obo:HP_0008944"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"custom MyGeneChip CustomSeq Resequencing Array (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) for exclusion of mutations in 28 genes known to cause CMT or IPN\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:79479639-3106-4524-ab97-4179d33406c5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c5688a7c-01cf-4ecc-be6a-d8f7ed9f94e5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26991897"},"rdfs:label":"P2 (family 2 II.2)"},{"id":"cggv:79479639-3106-4524-ab97-4179d33406c5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:79479639-3106-4524-ab97-4179d33406c5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:79479639-3106-4524-ab97-4179d33406c5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"RNA expression analysis: agarose gel electrophoresis of the RT-PCR products obtained with primer pair 1 showed a band smaller than the 350-bp band observed in the healthy normal control;

MME was first reported in relation to Autosomal Recessive CMT2 in 2016 (Higuchi et al., PMID: 26991897), followed by additional reports from Lupo (Lupo et al., 2018 PMID 30415211) and Hong (Hong et al., 2019 PMID 31429185). The described phenotype consisted in a slowly progressive neuropathy with distal weakness and atrophy follower by sensory involvement in the form of superficial and deep sensory loss, and no signs of central nervous system involvement. MME has also been associated with Autosomal Dominant SCA43 (Depondt et al., PMID 27583304) and with Autosomal Dominant CMT2 (Auer-Grumbach et al., 2016 PMID: 27588448) however, some of the variants associated with AD-CMT2 were also present in controls and sometimes showed incomplete penetrance in family studies, suggesting that heterozygous variants may confer susceptibility to the late-onset axonal CMT. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanism(s) AND in the inheritance pattern of AR-CMT2 and SCA43. Therefore, the following disease entities have been Split into multiple disease entities, AD-CMT2T (OMIM: 617017) and SCA43 (OMIM: 617018). Twenty-one variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in twenty-one probands in three publications (PMIDs: 26991897, 30415211, 31429185) are included in this curation. Variants were detected by WES or illumina sequencing or by custom made panels of CMT genes. Segregation with the disease in additional family members was confirmed in all cases and evidence at a variant level include decrease of enzymatic activity of mutant proteins, abnormal RNA transcript analysis and sural nerve MME staining. All the described biallelic variants have been given the default 0.1 score for missense variants or the default 1.5 score for predicted null variants. With the listed genetic evidence, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached and replicated over time. The mechanism of pathogenicity is hypnotized to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, showing expression of MME in the outer surface myelin of normal sural nerve (PMIDs: 8392520) paralleled by decrease or loss of MME expression in the peripheral nerve from affected patients. Homozygous Mme-null mice failed to show any significant phenotype in both behavioral and neurophysiological endpoints. In summary, MME is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive CMT2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6d426d95-70b5-4537-809f-9f2520fc39e9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
