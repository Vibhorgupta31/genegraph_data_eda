We have studied a type 1 vWD family with such a dominant phenotype. The entire coding sequence of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene was analyzed by direct sequencing of DNA fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Only one candidate mutation T(3445)-->C in exon 26 was detected that predicts a replacement of cysteine (C) at position 386 of the mature vWF subunit by arginine (R). Both mutant and normal vWF alleles were expressed as shown by analysis of platelet mRNA. This substitution segregates with vWD in the family and was not found in 100 unrelated individuals. The recombinant mutant vWF(C386R) was characterized by expression in 293T cells. The secretion of vWF(C386R) was greatly impaired due to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. In cotransfections of normal and mutant vWF constructs, the vWF(C386R) subunits caused a dose-dependent decrease in the secretion of vWF. The multimer pattern remained nearly normal and consistent with a dominant vWD type 1 phenotype. The importance of the cysteine residues in the D3 domain of vWF in the pathogenesis of dominant type 1 vWD was further shown by the detection of another cysteine mutation, Cys367-->Phe, in two additional unrelated patients with a similar dominant type 1 vWD phenotype. We conclude that the loss of cysteine pairing in the D3 domain, leaving one free cysteine, can induce a purely quantitative deficiency of vWF by dominantly suppressing the secretion of normal vWF.","dc:creator":"Eikenboom JC","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Dominant type 1 von Willebrand disease caused by mutated cysteine residues in the D3 domain of von Willebrand factor."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8839833","rdfs:label":"Individual III-4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This missense variant, Cys1149Arg, is located in the D3 domain, which is involved in the assembly of pro-vWF dimers into multimers by disulfide bridging at this residue.

There are several (sub)types of VWD that can be classified on the basis of phenotypic characteristics, caused by either quantitative (type 1 and 3) or qualitative (type 2) defects of VWF. The relationship of VWF to autosomal dominant VWD was first determined in 1988 by identification of a gross gene deletion (Ngo et al., 1988; PMID: 3258663) and through linkage analysis (Verweij et al., 1988; PMID: 2895123). In 1989, the first variants were identified in patients by Ginsburg et al. (PMID: 2786201). More than 700 unique variants have been reported in humans (EAHAD Coagulation Factor Variant Databases), consisting of predominantly missense variants as well as nonsense, small deletions or insertions, and splice variants (reviewed in PMID: 28987708). Some patients with type 1 VWD may have heterozygous VWF null alleles, but usually these patients carry heterozygous missense variants. The qualitative VWF defects in type 2 VWD are also mainly caused by missense variants. The severe quantitative VWF deficiency as seen in type 3 VWD is usually caused by genetic defects in the VWF gene leading to homozygous or compound heterozygous VWF null alleles (such autosomal recessive cases have been included in this curation as noted in the scoring explanations). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Twenty-two unique variants from 21 probands in 8 publications were curated (PMIDs: 1415226, 26088471, 8622978, 23496210, 2786201, 8839833, 19566550, 20586924). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 29 additional family members (PMIDs: 1415226, 8839833, 19566550). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by the function of vWF in platelet adhesion, via collagen and platelet binding (PMIDs: 6809414, 108291), which is consistent with the prolonged bleeding associated with VWD. Alteration of this function has been observed in both patient (PMID: 8435340) and non-patient cells (PMID: 20586924) which exhibit loss of platelet adhesion. Further support is provided by several mouse systems, including a null mouse with extensive bleeding, consistent with type 3 VWD (PMID: 9689113), and hydrodynamic expression of VWD variants in the VWF-/- mice (PMIDs: 22372972, 21346256, PMID: 18487513) which recapitulate many features of types 1 and 2 VWD. In summary VWF is definitively associated with autosomal dominant von Willebrand disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nOf note, VWF in relation to type 2B VWD has been described as a distinct form of VWD (PMID: 6767976) and is assessed separately from the additional forms of hereditary von Willebrand disease. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms (gain of function in type 2B versus loss of function in types 1, 2A, 2M, 2N, and 3) and phenotypic variability (type 2B has the unique phenotypes of thrombocytopenia, increased platelet volume, and enhanced ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities hereditary von Willebrand disease and von Willebrand disease type 2B.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4899c76e-7d5e-4b00-a47f-7e1f1b0ba664"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
