The Car2 mRNA level was greatly reduced but not completely abolished in all four tissues from the Car2-/- mice in which no CA II protein was expressed. Sequencing the Car2 cDNA isolated from C57BL6 Car2-/- mice revealed two nucleotide differences from the wild-type C57BL6 mice. One is a silent polymorphism found in Car2 mRNA from wild-type DBA mice, which is the strain that provided the original mutagenized chromosome. The second change is a mutation that causes prematurely terminated translation at codon 155 (Gln155X). Car9 mRNA and CA IX protein expression levels were up-regulated about 2.5- and 3.6-fold, respectively, in the stomach of the Car2-/- mice.

In osteoclast cultures treated with the 16-kD V-ATPase antisense RNA, acidification of an unknown population of intracellular vesicles was highly stimulated. The acidification of these vesicles was not sensitive to amiloride or bafilomycin A1.

anhydrase II (CA II), which has the highest turnover number and widest tissue distribution of any of the seven CA isozymes known in humans, is absent from the red blood cells and probably from other tissues of patients with CA II deficiency syndrome. We have sequenced the CA II gene in a patient from a consanguinous marriage in a Belgian family and identified the mutation that is probably the cause of the CA II deficiency in that family. The change is a C-to-T transition which results in the substitution of Tyr (TAT) for His (CAT) at position 107. This histidine is invariant in all amniotic CA isozymes sequenced to date, as well as the CAs from elasmobranch and algal sources and in a viral CA-related protein. His-107 appears to have a stabilizing function in the structure of all CA molecules, and its substitution by Tyr apparently disrupts the critical hydrogen bonding of His-107 to two other similarly invariant residues, Glu-117 and Tyr-194, resulting in an unstable CA II molecule. We have also completed the intron-exon structure of the normal human CA II gene, which has allowed us to prepare PCR primers for all exons. These primers will facilitate the determination of the mutations in other inherited CA II deficiencies.","dc:creator":"Venta PJ","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Carbonic anhydrase II deficiency syndrome in a Belgian family is caused by a point mutation at an invariant histidine residue (107 His----Tyr): complete structure of the normal human CA II gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Venta Belgian infant"},{"id":"cggv:ea1ba09f-9451-464c-8c8e-939330a51d54","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea1ba09f-9451-464c-8c8e-939330a51d54_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ea1ba09f-9451-464c-8c8e-939330a51d54_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Western blot in E.coli showed destabilizing effect of the substitution"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded for homozygosity and consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:bb253e48-4e3c-4ae3-b173-aee28aea0215_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb253e48-4e3c-4ae3-b173-aee28aea0215","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"allele":{"id":"cggv:941c8e3a-28dd-4794-8391-8d62a850a49c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000067.3(CA2):c.753del (p.Asn252ThrfsTer14)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2687793670"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"limb malformation","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000405","obo:HP_0011002","obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0041143","obo:HP_0012406","obo:HP_0003127","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0008341","obo:HP_0000505","obo:HP_0001942","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002514","obo:HP_0000666","obo:HP_0000689","obo:HP_0006292","obo:HP_0000705","obo:HP_0031846","obo:HP_0009102","obo:HP_0041222"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:50040d88-a33d-4a34-b1df-9b09547025fe_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:941c8e3a-28dd-4794-8391-8d62a850a49c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37662627","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We performed a study to present a phenotypic and genotypic characterization of a patient clinically diagnosed with carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) deficiency syndrome.

Osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis is a rare disorder characterized by osteopetrosis (OPT), renal tubular acidosis (RTA), and neurological disorders related to cerebral calcifications. It is also known as Carbonic anhydrase 2 deficiency, Guibaud-Vainsel syndrome, Marble brain disease, Mixed RTA, and RTA type 3. Eleven unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) that have been reported in 8 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 1928091, 1542674, 7627193, 19556665, 27848944, 33555497, 28509178, 37662627) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated in 4 additional family members (PMIDs: 1542674, 28509178). More proband is reported in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function study, expression data, and a mouse model replicating the phenotype (PMIDs: 8200964, 6405388, 16396925, 3126501, 18175028). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *CA2* and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date June 10th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:55a34937-7d48-45b0-a6c8-8d799f0d5934"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
