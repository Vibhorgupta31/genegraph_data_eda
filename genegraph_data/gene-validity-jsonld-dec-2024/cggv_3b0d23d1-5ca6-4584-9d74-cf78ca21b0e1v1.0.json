Paradoxically, genetic deletion of Dcx in mice does not cause neocortical malformation. We used electroporation of plasmids encoding short hairpin RNA to create interference (RNAi) of DCX protein in utero, and we show that DCX is required for radial migration in developing rat neocortex. RNAi of DCX causes both cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous disruptions in radial migration, and creates two disruptions in neocortical development. First, many neurons prematurely stop migrating to form subcortical band heterotopias within the intermediate zone and then white matter. Second, many neurons migrate into inappropriate neocortical lamina within normotopic cortex. In utero RNAi can therefore be effectively used to study the specific cellular roles of DCX in neocortical development and to produce an animal model of double cortex syndrome.","dc:creator":"Bai

spectrum (LIS) is one of the most severe neuronal migration disorders that ranges from agyria/pachygyria to subcortical band heterotopia. Approximately 80% of patients with the LIS spectrum carry mutations in either the LIS1 or DCX (doublecortin) genes which have an opposite gradient of severity. The aim of the study was to evaluate in detail the phenotype of DCX-associated lissencephaly and to look for genotype-phenotype correlations. Of the 180 male patients with DCX-related lissencephaly, 33 males (24 familial cases and nine cases with de novo mutations) were found with hemizygous DCX mutations and were clinically and genetically assessed here. DCX mutation analysis revealed that the majority of mutations were missense (79.2%), clustered in the two evolutionary conserved domains, N-DC and C-DC, of DCX. The most prominent radiological phenotype was an anteriorly predominant pachygyria or agyria (54.5%) although DCX-associated lissencephaly encompasses a complete range of LIS grades. The severity of neurological impairment was in accordance with the degree of agyria with severe cognitive impairment in all patients, inability to walk independently in over half and refractory epilepsy in more than a third. For genotype-phenotype correlations, patients were divided in two groups according to the location of DCX missense mutations. Patients with mutations in the C-DC domain tended to have a less severe lissencephaly (grade 4-5 in 58.3%) compared with those in the N-DC domain (grade 4-5 in 36.3%) although, in this dataset, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.12). Our evaluation suggests a putative correlation between phenotype and genotype. These data provide further clues to deepen our understanding of the function of the DCX protein and may give new insights into the molecular mechanisms that could influence the consequence of the mutation in the N-DC versus the C-DC domain of DCX.","dc:creator":"Leger PL","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The location of DCX mutations predicts malformation severity in X-linked lissencephaly."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18685874","rdfs:label":"006"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Maternity and paternity are not confirmed."},{"id":"cggv:87a95c2c-2377-482e-a06f-33dfec5a455e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:423a502b-c84b-4374-a823-29dd73b2043f","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:87a95c2c-2377-482e-a06f-33dfec5a455e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6334c5f8-552d-47f7-b3ed-7b5acd35d86d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001195553.2(DCX):c.556C>T (p.Arg186Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA171992"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25140959"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25140959","rdfs:label":"DC-4601"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2033,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:06bdd56a-1072-45d3-825a-481e9e26af7f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018838","gene":"hgnc:2714","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"DCX was FIRST reported in relation to X-linked dominant lissencephaly spectrum disorders in 1998 (Gleeson et al., PMID: 9489700 & des Portes et al., PMID: 9618162).

More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is loss-of-function/haploinsufficiency and a rat model of the disease has been generated using RNAi knockdown of DCX in utero (PMID: 14625554).
