A previously reported LQT9 patient had prominent U waves on ECG, a feature that has been correlated with Kir2.1 loss of function. Our objective was to determine whether caveolin 3 (Cav3) associates with Kir2.1 and whether LQT9-associated CAV3 mutations affect the biophysical properties of Kir2.1. Kir2.1 current (IK1) density was measured using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. WT-Cav3 did not affect IK1. However, F97C-Cav3 and T78M-Cav3 decreased IK1 density significantly by ∼60%, and P104L-Cav3 decreased IK1 density significantly by ∼30% at -60 mV. Immunostained rat heart cryosections and HEK293 cells cotransfected with Kir2.1 and WT-Cav3 both demonstrated colocalization of Kir2.1 and WT-Cav3 by confocal imaging. Cav3 coimmunoprecipitated with Kir2.1 in human ventricular myocytes and in heterologous expression systems. Additionally, FRET efficiency was highly specific, with a molecular distance of 5.6 ± 0.4 nm, indicating close protein location. Colocalization experiments found that Cav3 and Kir2.1 accumulated in the Golgi compartment. On-cell Western blot analysis showed decreased Kir2.1 cell surface expression by 60% when expressed with F97C-Cav3 and by 20% when expressed with P104L-Cav3 compared with WT-Cav3. This is the first report of an association between Cav3 and Kir2.1. The Cav3 mutations F97C-Cav3, P104L-Cav3, and T78M-Cav3 decreased IK1 density significantly. This effect was related to a reduced cell surface expression of Kir2.1.

To date, mutations in 15 LQTS-susceptibility genes have been implicated. However, the genetic cause for approximately 20% of LQTS patients remains elusive. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing analyses on 59 LQTS and 61 unaffected individuals in 35 families and 138 unrelated LQTS cases, after genetic screening of known LQTS genes. Our systematic analysis of familial cases and subsequent verification by Sanger sequencing identified 92 candidate mutations in 88 genes for 23 of the 35 families (65.7%): these included eleven de novo, five recessive (two homozygous and three compound heterozygous) and seventy-three dominant mutations. Although no novel commonly mutated gene was identified other than known LQTS genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed ten new pathogenic candidates that directly or indirectly interact with proteins encoded by known LQTS genes. Furthermore, candidate gene based association studies using an independent set of 138 unrelated LQTS cases and 587 controls identified an additional novel candidate. Together, mutations in these new candidates and known genes explained 37.1% of the LQTS families (13 in 35). Moreover, half of the newly identified candidates directly interact with calmodulin (5 in 11; comparison with all genes; p=0.042). Subsequent variant analysis in the independent set of 138 cases identified 16 variants in the 11 genes, of which 14 were in calmodulin-interacting genes (87.5%).
