The mechanisms by which loss of OCRL1 leads to the phenotypic manifestations of Lowe syndrome are currently unclear, in part, owing to the lack of an animal model that recapitulates the disease phenotype. Here, we describe a zebrafish model for Lowe syndrome using stable and transient suppression of OCRL1 expression. Deficiency of OCRL1, which is enriched in the brain, leads to neurological defects similar to those reported in Lowe syndrome patients, namely increased susceptibility to heat-induced seizures and cystic brain lesions. In OCRL1-deficient embryos, Akt signalling is reduced and there is both increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation, most strikingly in the neural tissue. Rescue experiments indicate that catalytic activity and binding to the vesicle coat protein clathrin are essential for OCRL1 function in these processes. Our results indicate a novel role for OCRL1 in neural development, and support a model whereby dysregulation of phosphoinositide metabolism and clathrin-mediated membrane traffic leads to the neurological symptoms of Lowe syndrome.","dc:creator":"Ramirez IB","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Impaired neural development in a zebrafish model for Lowe syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue experiment in Zebrafish model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Zebrafish cDNA, not human cDNA is used for rescue experiment"},{"id":"cggv:2b77f37e-02bb-4918-bf17-cdd83e63cc27","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd7008cf-4dd3-47cf-a14c-5565ab502953","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Human patients have seizures, ventriculomegaly, and periventricular cysts.

The OCRL1 gene, which, when mutated, is responsible for OCRL, encodes a 105-kD Golgi protein with phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate (PtdIn[4,5]P2) 5-phosphatase activity. We have examined the OCRL1 gene in 12 independent patients with OCRL and have found 11 different mutations. Six were nonsense mutations, and one a deletion of one or two nucleotides that leads to frameshift and premature termination. In one, a 1.2-kb genomic deletion of exon 14 was identified. In four others, missense mutations or the deletion of a single codon were found to involve amino acid residues known to be highly conserved among proteins with PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase activity. All patients had markedly reduced PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase activity in their fibroblasts, whereas the ocrl1 protein was detectable by immunoblotting in some patients with either missense mutations or a codon deletion but was not detectable in those with premature termination mutations. These results confirm and extend our previous observation that the OCRL phenotype results from loss of function of the ocrl1 protein and that mutations are generally heterogeneous. Missense mutations that abolish enzyme activity but not expression of the protein will be useful for studying structure-function relationships in PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatases.","dc:creator":"Lin T","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Spectrum of mutations in the OCRL1 gene in the Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9199559","rdfs:label":"PHL255"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Enzyme activity assay for this individual proves it is a null."},{"id":"cggv:a0974a43-23a6-4f33-b13f-51c9ed8b45d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f4ede7e-ef2b-42f7-8b9e-00817cfaeb95","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Since all of these patients have very specific phenotype and biochemical confirmation of their diagnosis, the evidence strength is high even the analysis method is not genome-wide.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a0974a43-23a6-4f33-b13f-51c9ed8b45d6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:54c0fd38-9172-44ec-b34a-ae27ca8aa79e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000276.4(OCRL):c.1352A>G (p.Asp451Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA266150"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9199559"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9199559","rdfs:label":"XL78-07"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Enzyme activity assay for this individual proves it is a null."},{"id":"cggv:890a5d09-bf09-4ad3-a699-c469692e3eb8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f4278ca0-4402-4750-aa23-f373ebb818ae","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Since all of these patients have very specific phenotype and biochemical confirmation of their diagnosis, the evidence strength is high even the analysis method is not genome-wide.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:890a5d09-bf09-4ad3-a699-c469692e3eb8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:cfe7410e-aae5-41cc-9794-2e1d6fbf7bd2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000276.4(OCRL):c.1102_1104del (p.Thr368del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA923726338"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9199559"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9199559","rdfs:label":"XL59-01"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Enzyme activity assay for this individual proves it is a null."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:5140c756-fac0-435b-8f59-a5d4a0b0adb3_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d25504f-8a17-41ab-9dca-4e24795ead2d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba7d8581-01b6-4444-8e2f-43ebf0be4a56","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"All the patients in this group have the clinical diagnosis of the disease on the basis of classically recognized criteria.

Since then over 200 variants have been reported in patients affected by this disease. More than half of these variants are proven or predicted null alleles and some missense variants have also been confirmed to cause deficient enzyme activity by functional studies, indicating a loss-of-function disease mechanism. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by expression studies, animal models, and rescue experiments. In summary, OCRL is definitively associated with X-linked Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5140c756-fac0-435b-8f59-a5d4a0b0adb3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
