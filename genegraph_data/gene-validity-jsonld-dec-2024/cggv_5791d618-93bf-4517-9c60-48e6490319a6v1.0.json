Recently, mutations in the P-cadherin gene (CDH3) have been shown to cause two inherited diseases in humans: hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome). The common features of both diseases are sparse hair and macular dystrophy of the retina, while only EEM syndrome shows the additional finding of split hand/foot malformation (SHFM). We identified five consanguineous Pakistani families with either HJMD or EEM syndrome, and detected pathogenic mutations in the CDH3 gene of all five families. In order to define the role of P-cadherin in hair follicle and limb development, we performed expression studies on P-cadherin in the mouse embryo, and demonstrated the predominant expression of P-cadherin not only in the hair follicle placode, but also at the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud. Based on the evidence that mutations in the p63 gene also result in hypotrichosis and SHFM, and that the expression patterns of p63 and P-cadherin overlap in the hair follicle placode and AER, we postulated that CDH3 could be a direct transcriptional target gene of p63. We performed promoter assays and ChIP, which revealed that p63 directly interacts with two distinct regions of the CDH3 promoter. We conclude that P-cadherin is a newly defined transcriptional target gene of p63, with a crucial role in hair follicle morphogenesis as well as the AER during limb bud outgrowth in humans, whereas it is not required for either in mice.","dc:creator":"Shimomura Y","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"P-cadherin is a p63 target gene with a crucial role in the developing human limb bud and hair follicle."},"rdfs:label":"Immunostaining"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7c4b72de-4eb3-498f-84c3-3cc3a621657e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0dfb2dbc-e184-4d6f-8490-dfb4bdf35ef1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Figure 2g:  reduced staining for P-cadherin in the patient epidermis (left upper panel) and hair follicle epithelium (right upper panel).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11544476","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital hypotrichosis associated with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD; MIM601553) is an autosomal recessive disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by hair loss heralding progressive macular degeneration and early blindness.

Recently, we identified a frameshift mutation in the CDH3 gene encoding P-cadherin as the proximal cause of hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy in four families. We report here another consanguineous family in which four members were diagnosed with hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed in all patients morphologic hair shaft abnormalities consistent with pili torti. Ocular fundus examination disclosed marked degeneration of the macular pigment epithelium. Electrophysiologic studies were diagnostic for severe retinal dysfunction. DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence of CDH3 revealed in all affected individuals a homozygous missense mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution at position 503 of P-cadherin sequence (R503H). The mutation completely segregated with the hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy phenotype in the family but was not detectable in 83 healthy, unrelated controls. The amino acid substitution affects a highly conserved residue and is predicted to alter a Ca2+ binding domain of P-cadherin. This is the first pathogenic missense mutation reported in CDH3 and the second mutation found to underlie hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy. Our data establish recessive mutations in CDH3 as the molecular cause of hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy and expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of this intriguing disorder.","dc:creator":"Indelman M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"A missense mutation in CDH3, encoding P-cadherin, causes hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband"},{"id":"cggv:d70f1f31-97dd-4d1b-ab2d-b86d44fe2ded","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d70f1f31-97dd-4d1b-ab2d-b86d44fe2ded_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The variant is localized to the DRE motif involved in Ca2+ binding.

Subsequently, it was reported in relation to autosomal recessive ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy (EEM) in 2005 (Kjaer et al., PMID: 15805154). Both HJMD and EEM are rare, and their common features are sparse hair and macular dystrophy of the retina. Only EEM syndrome shows the additional hand/foot malformation. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism AND inheritance pattern. The phenotypic variability of EEM may include JHMD and mild hand/foot malformation is a relative common finding in the general population. Therefore, HJMD (OMIM #601553) and EEM (OMIM #225280) have been lumped into one disease entity represented by EEM. Eight variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, canonical splicing) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies showing P-cadherin encoded by CDH3 in hair follicle placode, pigmented epithelium of the retina, and apical ectodermal ridge in the limb bud (Shimomura et al., PMID: 18199584). In summary, CDH3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy (EEM). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5791d618-93bf-4517-9c60-48e6490319a6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
