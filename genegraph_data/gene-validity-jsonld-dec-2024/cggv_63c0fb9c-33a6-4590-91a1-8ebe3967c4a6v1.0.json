Impaired humoral immunity is also common. Patients have severe infections, autoimmunity, or both. The specific molecular, cellular, and clinical features of many types of combined immunodeficiencies remain unknown. Methods We performed genetic and cellular immunologic studies involving five unrelated children with early-onset invasive bacterial and viral infections, lymphopenia, and defective T-cell, B-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell responses. Two patients died early in childhood; after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, the other three had normalization of T-cell function and clinical improvement. Results We identified biallelic mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene (DOCK2) in these five patients. RAC1 activation was impaired in the T cells. Chemokine-induced migration and actin polymerization were defective in the T cells, B cells, and NK cells. NK-cell degranulation was also affected. Interferon-α and interferon-λ production by peripheral-blood mononuclear cells was diminished after viral infection. Moreover, in DOCK2-deficient fibroblasts, viral replication was increased and virus-induced cell death was enhanced; these conditions were normalized by treatment with interferon alfa-2b or after expression of wild-type DOCK2. Conclusions Autosomal recessive DOCK2 deficiency is a new mendelian disorder with pleiotropic defects of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity. Children with clinical features of combined immunodeficiencies, especially with early-onset, invasive infections, may have this condition.

Among these molecules, Rac is crucial for generating the actin-rich lamellipodial protrusion, a principal part of the driving force for movement. The CDM family proteins, Caenorhabditis elegans CED-5, human DOCK180 and Drosophila melanogaster Myoblast City (MBC), are implicated to mediate membrane extension by functioning upstream of Rac. Although genetic analysis has shown that CED-5 and Myoblast City are crucial for migration of particular types of cells, physiological relevance of the CDM family proteins in mammals remains unknown. Here we show that DOCK2, a haematopoietic cell-specific CDM family protein, is indispensable for lymphocyte chemotaxis. DOCK2-deficient mice (DOCK2-/-) exhibited migration defects of T and B lymphocytes, but not of monocytes, in response to chemokines, resulting in several abnormalities including T lymphocytopenia, atrophy of lymphoid follicles and loss of marginal-zone B cells.

Variants in *DOCK2* were first reported in patients in 2015 (Dobbs K, et al., 2015, PMID: 26083206). *DOCK2* is a major guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) for GTPase-activating proteins, and is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 10559471). It binds and activates Rac through its *DOCK* homology region domain, and subsequently activated Rac serves multiple functions downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and antigen and complement receptors, including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (PMID: 11518968). Sixteen variants, (including frameshift, nonsense, splice altering, and missense) have been reported in 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 26083206, 29204803, 30838481, 30826364). Affected individuals typically present early-onset invasive viral and bacterial infections, naïve T cell lymphopenia with reduced T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and diminished T cell proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin, variable reduction of B cell numbers, with defective antibody responses despite normal immunoglobulin G levels, and impaired NK cell function. Total polymerized filamentous actin was diminished in T-, B-, and NK lymphocytes, and T- and B cell chemotaxis was also impaired by *DOCK2* deficiency (PMID: 26083206). Interferon (IFN)-alpha and -lambda production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from *DOCK2*-deficient patients was reduced after ex vivo exposure to herpes simplex virus 1 or vesicular stomatitis virus. Moreover, *DOCK2* deficient simian virus 40 fibroblasts showed increased viral replication and enhanced virus-induced cell death after exposure to encephalomyocarditis virus. Both treatment with recombinant IFN-α2b and lentiviral-mediated wild-type *DOCK2* expression protected *DOCK2*-deficient fibroblasts from virus-induced cell death. The *DOCK2* mutations may therefore also impair cell-intrinsic, non-hematopoietic immunity, at least in fibroblasts and in response to some viruses (PMID: 26083206). As in humans, DOCK2-deficient mice (DOCK2-/-) exhibited migration defects of T and B lymphocytes, but not of monocytes, in response to chemokines, resulting in several abnormalities including T lymphocytopenia, atrophy of lymphoid follicles and loss of marginal-zone B cells. In *DOCK2*-/- lymphocytes, chemokine-induced Rac activation and actin polymerization were almost totally abolished (PMID: 11518968). In summary, *DOCK2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive *DOCK2* deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time.
