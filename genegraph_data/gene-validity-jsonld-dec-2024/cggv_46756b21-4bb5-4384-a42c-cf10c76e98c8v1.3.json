Rab proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of cellular trafficking and signal transduction. Currently, only few mutations in RAB23 have been reported in patients with Carpenter syndrome. In this paper, we report the clinical features, molecular and functional analysis of 2 children from an Emirati consanguineous family with this syndrome. The affected children exhibit the typical features including craniosynostosis, typical facial appearance, polysyndactyly, and obesity. Molecular analysis of the RAB23 gene revealed a homozygous mutation affecting the first nucleotide of the acceptor splice site of exon 5 (c.482-1G>A). This mutation affects the authentic mRNA splicing and activates a cryptic acceptor site within exon 5. Thus, the erroneous splicing results in an eight nucleotide deletion, followed by a frameshift and premature termination codon at position 161 (p.V161fsX3). Due to the loss of the C-terminally prenylatable cysteine residue, the truncated protein will probably fail to associate with the target cellular membranes due to the absence of the necessary lipid modification. The p.V161fsX3 extends the spectrum of RAB23 mutations and points to the crucial role of prenylation in the pathogenesis of Carpenter syndrome within this family.","dc:creator":"Ben-Salem S","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A Novel Aberrant Splice Site Mutation in RAB23 Leads to an Eight Nucleotide Deletion in the mRNA and Is Responsible for Carpenter Syndrome in a Consanguineous Emirati Family."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23599695","rdfs:label":"IV-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:749180b5-c53e-4c46-9f13-ac3cb0a23263_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:399de0d8-1c66-46f6-b717-73b20bc28314","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008689","obo:HP_0001520","obo:HP_0004442","obo:HP_0011318","obo:HP_0001159","obo:HP_0000405","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002119","obo:HP_0011330","obo:HP_0001829"],"secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:749180b5-c53e-4c46-9f13-ac3cb0a23263_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:08425e2b-b2f8-4b24-b167-e60e1ae34d15","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016277.5(RAB23):c.434T>A (p.Leu145Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116937"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17503333","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Carpenter syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance, the cardinal features of which include craniosynostosis, polysyndactyly, obesity, and cardiac defects.

In 10 patients, the disease was caused by homozygosity for the same nonsense mutation, L145X, that resides on a common haplotype, indicative of a founder effect in patients of northern European descent. Surprisingly, nonsense mutations of Rab23 in open brain mice cause recessive embryonic lethality with neural-tube defects, suggesting a species difference in the requirement for RAB23 during early development.

To identify novel factors that are involved in this process, we carried out mutagenesis of ATDC5 cells through retroviral insertion and isolated two mutant clones incapable of differentiation. Inverse PCR analysis of these clones revealed that the retroviral DNA was inserted into the promoter region of the Rab23 gene, resulting in increased Rab23 expression. To investigate whether an elevated level of Rab23 protein led to inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation, we characterized ATDC5 cells that either overexpress endogenous Rab23 or stably express ectopic Rab23. Our results revealed that up-regulation of Rab23 can indeed inhibit chondrogenic differentiation with a concomitant down-regulation of matrix genes such as type II collagen and aggrecan. In addition, stable small interfering RNA knockdown of Rab23 also resulted in inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation as well as down-regulation of Sox9, a master regulator of chondrogenesis. Interestingly, Sox9 expression has recently been linked to Gli1, and we found that Rab23 knockdown decreased Gli1 expression in chondrocytes. Because the phenotypes of Rab23 mutations in mice and humans include defects in cartilage and bone development, our study suggests that Rab23 is involved in the control of Sox9 expression via Gli1 protein.","dc:creator":"Yang L","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Rab23 regulates differentiation of ATDC5 chondroprogenitor cells."},"rdfs:label":"Knockdown in chondroprogenitors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:46756b21-4bb5-4384-a42c-cf10c76e98c8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e328b9d-207d-416a-9e2d-d3ecb16e06f6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8156c384-2e3e-40d1-9f62-725fc045e756","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The mice had coronal, parietal-temporal, frontonasal, and lambdoid craniosynostosis as well as preaxial polydactyly of the forelimbs and preaxial polysyndactyly of the hindlimbs.
