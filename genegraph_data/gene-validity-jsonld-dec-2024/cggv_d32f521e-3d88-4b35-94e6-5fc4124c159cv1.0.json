We analyzed 12 ARHSP-TCC families, refined the SPG11 candidate interval and identified ten mutations in a previously unidentified gene expressed ubiquitously in the nervous system but most prominently in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and pineal gland. The mutations were either nonsense or insertions and deletions leading to a frameshift, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism.

Hundreds of causative DNA changes have been found, but much of the genetic basis of the disease is still unexplained. Mutations in the ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene are a frequent cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and peripheral axonal neuropathy, and account for ∼ 40% of autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The overlap of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with both diseases, as well as the common autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of thin corpus callosum and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in three related patients, prompted us to analyse the ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene in affected individuals with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We investigated 28 unrelated families with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease defined by clinical, electrophysiological, as well as pathological evaluation. Besides, we screened for all the known genes related to axonal autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2, CMT2B1/LMNA, CMT2B2/MED25, CMT2B5/NEFL, ARCMT2F/dHMN2B/HSPB1, CMT2K/GDAP1, CMT2P/LRSAM1, CMT2R/TRIM2, CMT2S/IGHMBP2, CMT2T/HSJ1, CMTRID/COX6A1, ARAN-NM/HINT and GAN/GAN), for the genes related to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and axonal peripheral neuropathy (SPG7/PGN, SPG15/ZFYVE26, SPG21/ACP33, SPG35/FA2H, SPG46/GBA2, SPG55/C12orf65 and SPG56/CYP2U1), as well as for the causative gene of peripheral neuropathy with or without agenesis of the corpus callosum (SLC12A6). Mitochondrial disorders related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 were also excluded by sequencing POLG and TYMP genes. An additional locus for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2H on chromosome 8q13-21.1 was excluded by linkage analysis. Pedigrees originated in Italy, Brazil, Canada, England, Iran, and Japan. Interestingly, we identified 15 ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 mutations in 12 families (two sequence variants were never reported before, p.Gln198* and p.Pro2212fs*5). No large deletions/duplications were detected in these patients. The novel mutations seemed to be pathogenic since they co-segregated with the disease in all pedigrees and were absent in 300 unrelated controls. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted their pathogenic effect. Our results indicate that ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 is the causative gene of a wide spectrum of clinical features, including autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.","dc:creator":"Montecchiani C","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 mutations cause autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease."}},"rdfs:label":"5080"},{"id":"cggv:35795076-f64b-4cad-8e06-88db3df08326","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:35795076-f64b-4cad-8e06-88db3df08326_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"This nonsense occurs in exon 15 of 40 and is predicted to result in NMD.\n\nIt is homozygous due to consanguinity.\n\nThis variant has also been reported in patients with spatacsin-related spastic paraplegia (PMID: 23438842)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f9865b61-8307-4b1b-91a3-4f58a1008ee5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9865b61-8307-4b1b-91a3-4f58a1008ee5","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3cf65ca5-33b0-4b6b-90e2-9cc31a36dddf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025137.4(SPG11):c.704_705del (p.His235ArgfsTer12)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344392"}},"detectionMethod":"The 40 coding exons of SPG11 and at least 50 base pairs of flanking intronic sequence were PCR-amplified and the purified products were sequenced with respective forward and reverse primers by a 3130 Genetic Analyser.\n\nSegregation analysis was performed using a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosis of ARCMT2 was based on neurological findings, familial history, and neurophysiological characteristics.","previousTestingDescription":"Screened for all the known genes related to axonal autosomal recessive Charcot–Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/ MFN2 , CMT2B1/ LMNA , CMT2B2/ MED25 , CMT2B5/ NEFL , ARCMT2F/dHMN2B/ HSPB1 , CMT2K/ GDAP1 , CMT2P/ LRSAM1 , CMT2R/ TRIM2 , CMT2S/ IGHMBP2 , CMT2T/ HSJ1 , CMTRID/ COX6A1 , ARAN-NM/ HINT and GAN/ GAN ), for the genes related to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and axonal peripheral neuropathy (SPG7/ PGN , SPG15/ ZFYVE26, SPG21/ ACP33 , SPG35/ FA2H , SPG46/ GBA2 , SPG55/ C12orf65 and SPG56/ CYP2U1 ), as well as for the causative gene of peripheral neuropathy with or without agenesis of the corpus callosum (SLC12A6).

mutation of the spatacsin gene is the single most common cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum. Common clinical, pathological and genetic features between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia motivated us to investigate 25 families with autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and long-term survival for mutations in the spatascin gene. The inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to the revised El Escorial criteria. The exclusion criterion was a diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum in line with an established protocol. Additional pathological and genetic evaluations were also performed. Surprisingly, 12 sequence alterations in the spatacsin gene (one of which is novel, IVS30 + 1 G > A) were identified in 10 unrelated pedigrees with autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and long-term survival. The countries of origin of these families were Italy, Brazil, Canada, Japan and Turkey. The variants seemed to be pathogenic since they co-segregated with the disease in all pedigrees, were absent in controls and were associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis neuropathology in one member of one of these families for whom central nervous system tissue was available. Our study indicates that mutations in the spatascin gene could cause a much wider spectrum of clinical features than previously recognized, including autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","dc:creator":"Orlacchio A","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"SPATACSIN mutations cause autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."}},{"id":"cggv:88f3816f-0561-4faa-a8de-bd15d4da824b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f21eec32-83bf-4872-8195-9146383ec340"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20110243"}],"rdfs:label":"3055"},{"id":"cggv:88f3816f-0561-4faa-a8de-bd15d4da824b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:88f3816f-0561-4faa-a8de-bd15d4da824b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This nonsense variant occurs in exon 1 of 40 and could result in NMD, or given it's proximity to the start codon, it may bypass NMD by the re-initiation of translation at a downstream AUG codon.\n\nIt has been observed once in gnomADv2.1.1 non-neuro (1/28052 alleles) at a MAF of 0.00003565 in the South Asian population.\n\nThis variant has also been reported in patients with spatacsin-related spastic paraplegia (PMID: 18067136) and Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (PMID: 26556829)."},{"id":"cggv:be437a60-5ac4-47dd-82c2-99bb9aa5b2f4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be437a60-5ac4-47dd-82c2-99bb9aa5b2f4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This nonsense variant occurs in exon 1 of 40 and could result in NMD.\n\nIt has been observed once in gnomADv2.1.1 non-neuro (1/30604 alleles) at a MAF of 0.00003268 in the South Asian population.\n\nThis variant has also been reported in patients with spatacsin-related spastic paraplegia (PMID: 18067136)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6b271001-1209-424b-8734-7bc5633c2b3d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6b271001-1209-424b-8734-7bc5633c2b3d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f81b34c3-0804-46d5-8e3d-9427990cbe24","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025137.4(SPG11):c.7029dup (p.Val2344CysfsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA277446"}},"detectionMethod":"Amplified all coding exons with at least 50 bp of intronic sequences of 16 genes in the SPG11 candidate interval.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002395","obo:HP_0030890","obo:HP_0007199","obo:HP_0033725","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001268"],"previousTestingDescription":"Mutations in SPG7, SLC12A6, and ACP33 were ruled out.","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0ea85697-be72-4dd9-ab55-852a3616dde4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f81b34c3-0804-46d5-8e3d-9427990cbe24"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17322883"},"rdfs:label":"515-11"},{"id":"cggv:0ea85697-be72-4dd9-ab55-852a3616dde4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ea85697-be72-4dd9-ab55-852a3616dde4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"This frameshift variant occurs in exon 39 of 40 where it creates and premature stop codon upstream of the last 50 nucleotides, and is predicted to result in NMD.

Here, we have demonstrated that the two most common autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia gene products, the SPG15 protein spastizin and the SPG11 protein spatacsin, are pivotal for autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR), a pathway that generates new lysosomes.

Mutations in the same gene are also responsible for rare forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and progressive juvenile-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To elucidate the physiopathological mechanisms underlying these human pathologies, we disrupted the Spg11 gene in mice by inserting stop codons in exon 32, mimicking the most frequent mutations found in patients. The Spg11 knockout mouse developed early-onset motor impairment and cognitive deficits. These behavioral deficits were associated with progressive brain atrophy with the loss of neurons in the primary motor cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus, as well as with accumulation of dystrophic axons in the corticospinal tract. Spinal motor neurons also degenerated and this was accompanied by fragmentation of neuromuscular junctions and muscle atrophy. This new Spg11 knockout mouse therefore recapitulates the full range of symptoms associated with SPG11 mutations observed in HSP, ALS and CMT patients. Examination of the cellular alterations observed in this model suggests that the loss of spatacsin leads to the accumulation of lipids in lysosomes by perturbing their clearance from these organelles. Altogether, our results link lysosomal dysfunction and lipid metabolism to neurodegeneration and pinpoint a critical role of spatacsin in lipid turnover.","dc:creator":"Branchu J","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Loss of spatacsin function alters lysosomal lipid clearance leading to upper and lower motor neuron degeneration."},"rdfs:label":"Spg11 knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"This  knockout mouse recapitulates the full range of symptoms associated with SPG11 mutations observed in HSP, ALS and CMT patients.

HSP11 is clinically characterized by the progressive spasticity of the lower limbs, thin corpus callosum and cognitive impairment. White matter alterations may be part of the clinical phenotype. HSP11 is a complex disorder that occurs along a spectrum of disease including cases with wither slowly progressive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, due to overlapping variants with a loss of function mechanism. As per ClinGen lumping and splitting criteria, these diseases were considered under the lumped entity of HSP11. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Thirty-six variants have been curated (including frameshift, nonsense, and splice variants), from 18 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 17322883, 20110243, 26556829). Cosegregation of variants with disease was reported in at least 26 family members as well. Additional evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function in autophagic lysosome reformation (PMID: 25365221), which it shares with spastizin, another HSP related gene, with similarities in their expression and localization patterns that could account for their overlapping clinical phenotypes (PMID: 21545838), and is disrupted in patient cells (Renvoisé B, et al., 2014, PMID: 24999486). as a prominent guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rab5 (PMID: 12837691).

In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d32f521e-3d88-4b35-94e6-5fc4124c159c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
