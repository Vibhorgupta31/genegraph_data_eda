Nine of them were characterized by mild alterations of cellular cholesterol transport (the \"variant\" biochemical phenotype). The mutations showed a wide distribution to nearly all NPC1 domains, with a cluster (11/32) in a conserved NPC1 cysteine-rich luminal loop. Homozygous mutations in 14 patients and a phenotypically defined allele, combined with a new mutation, in a further 10 patients allowed genotype/phenotype correlations. Premature-termination-codon mutations, the three missense mutations in the sterol-sensing domain (SSD), and A1054T in the cysteine-rich luminal loop all occurred in patients with infantile neurological onset and \"classic\" (severe) cholesterol-trafficking alterations. By western blot, NPC1 protein was undetectable in the SSD missense mutations studied (L724P and Q775P) and essentially was absent in the A1054T missense allele. Our results thus enhance the functional significance of the SSD and demonstrate a correlation between the absence of NPC1 protein and the most severe neurological form. In the remaining missense mutations studied, corresponding to other disease presentations (including two adults with nonneurological disease), NPC1 protein was present in significant amounts of normal size, without clear-cut correlation with either the clinical phenotype or the \"classic\"/\"variant\" biochemical phenotype. Missense mutations in the cysteine-rich luminal loop resulted in a wide array of clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Remarkably, all five mutant alleles (I943M, V950M, G986S, G992R, and the recurrent P1007A) definitively correlated with the \"variant\" phenotype clustered within this loop, providing new insight on the functional complexity of the latter domain.","dc:creator":"Millat G","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Niemann-Pick C1 disease: correlations between NPC1 mutations, levels of NPC1 protein, and phenotypes emphasize the functional significance of the putative sterol-sensing domain and of the cysteine-rich luminal loop."}},"rdfs:label":"15A"},{"id":"cggv:7569ff67-7c78-40a9-9262-aa0d832bdd51","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7569ff67-7c78-40a9-9262-aa0d832bdd51_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7569ff67-7c78-40a9-9262-aa0d832bdd51_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"See notes for the variant for patient P14A."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This variant is one of the most common NPC alleles in Western Europe and USA (PMID: 16126423), there is functional evidence based on detailed studies in patient fibroblasts (PMID: 18216017), and a knock in mouse model recapitulates the clinical and biochemical features of NPC (PMID: 26019327 (note that the mouse is scored in the experimental evidence section)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f47a3dd3-dccc-41dd-9725-b96f43ac9570_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f47a3dd3-dccc-41dd-9725-b96f43ac9570","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2f852515-3bad-45d1-95d2-bf7de46a6ebc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000271.5(NPC1):c.845del (p.Val282GlyfsTer28)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573051021"}},"detectionMethod":"SSCP analysis of NPC1 cDNA followed by sequence analysis of fragments with abnormal mobility using cDNA and genomic DNA.","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"Infantile form (onset of neurological symptoms at age <2 years).

We also found a new NPC2 mutant caused by a change of the first codon (p.M1L). The novel missense mutations were further investigated by two bioinformatics approaches. Panther proein classification system computationally predicted the detrimental effect of all new missense mutations occurring at evolutionary conserved positions. The other bioinformatics approach was based on prediction of structural alterations induced by missense mutations on the NPC1 atomic models. The in silico analysis predicted protein malfunctioning and/or local folding alteration for most missense mutations. Moreover, the effects of the missense mutations (p.Y634C, p.S636F, p.L648H, and p.V780G) affecting the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) were evaluated by docking simulation between the atomic coordinates of SSD model and cholesterol.","dc:creator":"Fancello T","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Molecular analysis of NPC1 and NPC2 gene in 34 Niemann-Pick C Italian patients: identification and structural modeling of novel mutations."}},"rdfs:label":"NP7"},{"id":"cggv:a2345093-ceda-472b-8559-ac6edaf312b2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a2345093-ceda-472b-8559-ac6edaf312b2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b0085127-da82-42b8-91ca-e54f376a1b71_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b0085127-da82-42b8-91ca-e54f376a1b71","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:f16bf7cb-cfd0-4d2a-94ef-ce3f49a492fa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000271.5(NPC1):c.3019C>G (p.Pro1007Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340032"}},{"id":"cggv:466d994a-31ce-416c-98ce-e9d29bcdf247","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000271.5(NPC1):c.3428G>A (p.Trp1143Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA401791221"}}],"detectionMethod":"SSCP analysis of NPC1 cDNA followed by sequence analysis of fragments with abnormal mobility using cDNA and genomic DNA.","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"\"Late infantile\" form.","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"\"Variant\" biochemical phenotype: cholesterol storage may be seen only after challenge with LDL, and the rate of cholesteryl ester formation may not be affected.\nGenetic complementation analysis showed that the patient belonged to the main (NPC1) complementation group.\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:86612754-569f-493b-be2e-8ca4a59d410a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:466d994a-31ce-416c-98ce-e9d29bcdf247"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11333381"},{"id":"cggv:f22ccd3b-6126-429e-9596-05a07dae6f97_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f16bf7cb-cfd0-4d2a-94ef-ce3f49a492fa"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11333381"}],"rdfs:label":"13"},{"id":"cggv:f22ccd3b-6126-429e-9596-05a07dae6f97","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f22ccd3b-6126-429e-9596-05a07dae6f97_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f22ccd3b-6126-429e-9596-05a07dae6f97_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant is reported as one of the most common NPC1 variants in Western Europeans with NPC (PMID: 26981555); up to 10% of alleles in a study from the UK (PMID 26666848).

For these experiments, a soluble NPC1 lumenal domain 2 was engineered by replacing adjacent transmembrane domains with antiparallel coiled-coil sequences.

Binding to NPC1 domain 2 requires the presence of cholesterol on NPC2 protein, a finding that supports directional transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 onto NPC1's N-terminal domain. Finally, human disease-causing mutations in NPC1 domain 2 decrease NPC2 binding, suggesting that NPC2 binding is necessary for NPC1 function in humans.

This process begins with internalization of LDL, and its transport to the lysosome where cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed by lysosomal acid lipase cleaves to free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesterol. Free cholesterol within the lysosomal lumen is bound by the NPC2 protein and transferred to the NPC1 protein localized in the lysosomal membrane. NPC1 then transports cholesterol across the lysosomal membrane into the cytoplasm, where cholesterol can enter other metabolic pathways. \nWhen NPC1 is absent, cholesterol as well as sphingolipids accumulate inside the lysosomes. Previous studies have demonstrated the intracellular accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived, unesterified cholesterol in fibroblasts from patients and in a natural mouse model.

NPC typically presents in childhood with visceral lipid accumulation and complex progressive neurodegeneration characterized by cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia, and dementia, resulting in a shortened lifespan. While cholesterol is widely acknowledged as the principal storage lipid in NPC, multiple species of sphingolipids accumulate as well. This accumulation of sphingolipids led to the initial assumption that NPC disease was caused by a deficiency in a sphingolipid catabolism enzyme, similar to sphingomyelinase deficiencies with which it shares a family name. It took about half a century to determine that NPC was in fact caused by a cholesterol trafficking defect, and still as we approach a century after the initial identification of the disease, the mechanisms by which sphingolipids accumulate remain poorly understood. Here we focus on the defects of sphingolipid catabolism in the endolysosomal compartment and how they contribute to the biology and pathology observed in NPC disease.

In contrast, in cells transfected with NPC1 cDNA about 21 + 2% of the mutant cells showed no lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, indicating a significant (P = 0.002) recovery of the normal phenotype.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9211849","rdfs:label":"Rescue in NPC1 fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:243d8acd-3023-41e8-a0c2-17f32088e535","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f574b3ca-76ec-4c0b-85ba-72c285989806","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"AAV-hNPC1 was injected into both the left lateral ventricle and cisterna magna in Npc1-/- mice at 4 to 5 days after birth.

The most prevalent mutation, NPC1(I1061T), encodes a misfolded protein with a reduced half-life caused by ER-associated degradation. Therapies directed at stabilization of the mutant NPC1 protein reduce cholesterol storage in fibroblasts but have not been tested in vivo because of lack of a suitable animal model. Whereas the prominent features of human NPC1 disease are replicated in the null Npc1(-/-) mouse, this model is not amenable to examining proteostatic therapies. The objective of the present study was to develop an NPC1 I1061T knock-in mouse in which to test proteostatic therapies. Compared with the Npc1(-/-) mouse, this Npc1(tm(I1061T)Dso) model displays a less severe, delayed form of NPC1 disease with respect to weight loss, decreased motor coordination, Purkinje cell death, lipid storage, and premature death. The murine NPC1(I1061T) protein has a reduced half-life in vivo, consistent with protein misfolding and rapid ER-associated degradation, and can be stabilized by histone deacetylase inhibition. This novel mouse model faithfully recapitulates human NPC1 disease and provides a powerful tool for preclinical evaluation of therapies targeting NPC1 protein variants with compromised stability.","dc:creator":"Praggastis M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"A murine Niemann-Pick C1 I1061T knock-in model recapitulates the pathological features of the most prevalent human disease allele."},"rdfs:label":"NPC1 p.I1061T knock-in mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":4,"dc:description":"Npc1 I1061T mice recapitulate the molecular (biallelic knock in of a human NPC1 variant), clinical, and histological features of human Niemann-Pick C caused by variants in NPC1.\nSee PMID: 33256121 for a review of animal models for NPC (includes NPC1 and NPC2)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4031,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:31f1ff6f-6532-4cb2-b6f0-c6f38a13328f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009757","gene":"hgnc:7897","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between NPC1 and Niemann-Pick disease type C1, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 28, 2022. \n\nNPC is characterized by abnormal intracellular accumulation of cholesterol (which can be detected by filipin staining and, more recently by measurement of oxysterols) and glycosphingolipids in various tissues. It typically presents in childhood with hepatosplenomegaly and progressive neurodegeneration characterized by cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia, and dementia, resulting in a shortened lifespan. There are more severe infantile forms, the most severe of which is the neonatal, rapidly progressing cholestatic form. Late-onset forms also occur, presenting with early-onset dementia or psychiatric symptoms (Erikson et al, 2013, PMID: 23292954; Newton et al, PMID 30205941; Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). There is no curative treatment. Miglustat has been approved for the management of neurologic symptoms in some countries (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473).\nAbout 95% of cases of NPC are caused by biallelic variants in NPC1 and 5% by variants in NPC2 (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). NPC1 encodes a an integral membrane protein with at least 13 transmembrane domains and a putative sterol sensing domain, located in the lysosomal membrane and involved in transport of cholesterol from the lysosome to the cytoplasm (Bauer et al, 2002, PMID 11754101).\nBiallelic variants in NPC1 were first reported in patients with NPC in 1997 (Carstea et al, PMID: 9211849). Since then, over 200 disease-associated variants have been reported (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). In this curation, data on 10 unique variants (5 missense – one of which also impacts splicing, 3 nonsense, and 2 frameshift) from 10 probands from 4 publications were collected (Greer et al, 1998, PMID: 9634529; Yamomoto et al, 1999, PMID: 10480349; Millat et al 2001, PMID: 11333381; Fancello et al, 2009, PMID: 19252935). This includes c.3182T>C (p.Ile1061Thr), which is reported to account for 15%-20% of pathogenic variants in Western Europe the USA (PMID: 16126423). In addition, data on c.2974G>T (p.Gly992Trp), a founder variant in the Acadian population of Nova Scotia (Greer et al, 1998, PMID: 9634529) was also curated. This variant was reported to cause a condition originally described as Niemann-Pick disease, type D (NPD), but which now known to be a subtype of NPC. Segregation data was also available from the Nova Scotian population (Greer et al, 1999, PMID: 10361985). The disease mechanism is loss of function. Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of NPC1, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Ifante et al, 2008, PMID: 18772377; Li et al, 2016, PMID: 27551080; Newton et al, 2018, PMID: 30205942), interaction of NPC1 with NPC2, which is encoded by another gene involved in Niemann-Pick C disease (Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011, PMID: 22065762), the biochemical and clinical features of a mouse with a knock-in human variant (Praggastis et al, 2015, PMID: 26019327), rescue of abnormal cholesterol accumulation in NPC fibroblasts by expression of NPC1 cDNA (Carstea et al, 1997; PMID: 9211849) and the impact of gene therapy in a mouse knock out model (Kurokawa et al, 2021, PMID: 33256498). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, NPC1 is definitively associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved the the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on March 1, 2022.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e8459873-2577-43ff-966c-e5180683d4f4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
