It has long been realized that immunohistochemistry can add an important new level of information on top of morphology and that protein expression patterns in a cancer may yield crucial diagnostic and prognostic information. We have generated an immunohistochemistry-based map of protein expression profiles in normal tissues, cancer and cell lines. For each antibody, altogether 708 spots of tissues and cells are analysed and the resulting images and data are presented as freely available in the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org). The new version 4 of the atlas, including more than 5 million images of immunohistochemically stained tissues and cells, is based on 6122 antibodies, representing 5011 human proteins encoded by approximately 25% of the human genome. The gene-centric database includes a putative classification of proteins in various protein classes, both functional classes, such as kinases or transcription factors and project-related classes, such as candidate genes for cancer or cardiovascular diseases. For each of the internally generated antibodies, the exact antigen sequence is presented, together with a visualization of application-specific validation data, including a protein array assay, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and, in most cases, immunofluorescent-based confocal microscopy. The updated version also includes new search algorithms to allow complex queries regarding expression profiles, protein classes and chromosome location. Thus, the presented Human Protein Atlas provides a resource for pathology-based biomedical research, including protein science and biomarker discovery.","dc:creator":"PontÃ©n F","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The Human Protein Atlas--a tool for pathology."},"rdfs:label":"Human Protein Atlas"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Default score for expression in the brain"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:183be314-face-471f-9643-9cc1a302636f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04ec20bb-499a-419c-8809-1b6d9634290b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2ed6bcf5-8f2f-45dd-ad1d-ca11d1272728","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"A series experiments using partial RANBP2 and KIF5B/KIF5C constructs transfected into the mouse non neuronal 3T3 fibroblast cell lines show that the kinesin binding domain of RanBP2 selectively bridges the interaction between the heavy chains of KIF5B/KIF5C, but not KIF5A, and the mitochondria.

Although the contribution of each partner and domain of RanBP2 to its biological functions are not understood, physiological deficits of RanBP2 downregulate glucose catabolism and energy homeostasis and lead to delocalization of mitochondria components in photosensory neurons. The kinesin-binding domain (KBD) of RanBP2 associates selectively in the central nervous system (CNS), and directly, with the ubiquitous and CNS-specific kinesins, KIF5B and KIF5C, respectively, but not with the highly homologous KIF5A. Here, we determine the molecular and biological bases of the selective interaction between RanBP2 and KIF5B/KIF5C. This interaction is conferred by a approximately 100-residue segment, comprising a portion of the coiled-coil and globular tail cargo-binding domains of KIF5B/KIF5C. A single residue conserved in KIF5B and KIF5C, but not KIF5A, confers KIF5-isotype-specific association with RanBP2. This interaction is also mediated by a conserved leucine-like heptad motif present in KIF5s and KBD of RanBP2. Selective inhibition of the interaction between KBD of RanBP2 and KIF5B/KIF5C in cell lines causes perinuclear clustering of mitochondria, but not of lysosomes, deficits in mitochondrial membrane potential and ultimately, cell shrinkage. Collectively, the data provide a rationale of the KIF5 subtype-specific interaction with RanBP2 and support a novel kinesin-dependent role of RanBP2 in mitochondria transport and function. The data also strengthen a model whereby the selection of a large array of cargoes for transport by a restricted number of motor proteins is mediated by adaptor proteins such as RanBP2.","dc:creator":"Cho KI","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Association of the kinesin-binding domain of RanBP2 to KIF5B and KIF5C determines mitochondria localization and function."},"rdfs:label":"Mitochondria subcellular localisation and dispersal"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The kinesin (KBD)of RanBP2 plays a determinant role in maintaining the dispersion and the subcellular localization of mitochondria.

The RANBP2 gene encodes RAN-binding protein 2, a nuclear pore complex component that has been annotated as an E3 SUMO-protein ligase which facilitates SUMO1 and SUMO2 conjugation by UBE2I. The nuclear pore complex spans the nuclear envelope and allows the flow of molecules (proteins, RNA, carbohydrates, lipids and signaling molecules) between the nucleus and cytoplasm.\n\nThe RANBP2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2015 (PMID: 26110162). Pathogenic variants in RANBP2 are more commonly associated with acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), however biochemical testing is typically not pursued in these cases as features arise in the setting of a viral illness. Indeed, RANBP2-related disorders are thought to arise due to a combination of a genetic and viral insult. Furthermore, ANE has distinctive histopathological and imaging features, with lesions that may affect the basal ganglia, brainstem, and, most frequently, the thalamus. Therefore, imaging studies may prompt/indicate a potential overlap with the diagnosis of LSS. However, unlike lesions in LSS, the core of the lesions associated with ANE, particularly those in the thalamus, are usually composed of significant perivascular hemorrhage and necrosis of neurons and glial cells. Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between RANBP2 and LSS includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 26110162). No segregation data were available. The exact mechanism of disease is uncertain. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression data and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 18853439, 17887960). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 17, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:183be314-face-471f-9643-9cc1a302636f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
