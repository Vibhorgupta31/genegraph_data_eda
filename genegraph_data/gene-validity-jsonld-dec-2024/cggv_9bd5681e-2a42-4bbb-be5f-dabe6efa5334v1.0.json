The proteins affected include TUBA1A, a major alpha-tubulin isoform, and microtubule-associated components such as doublecortin, and LIS1. Mutations in these genes are associated with the anatomical abnormality lissencephaly, which is believed to reflect failure of neuronal migration. An important recent observation has been the dependence of cortical neuronal migration upon acetylation of alpha-tubulin at lysine 40 by the histone acetyltransferase Elongator complex. Here, we describe a recognizable autosomal recessive syndrome, characterized by generalized polymicrogyria in association with optic nerve hypoplasia (PMGOH). By autozygosity mapping, we show that the molecular basis for this condition is mutation of the TUBA8 gene, encoding a variant alpha-tubulin of unknown function that is not susceptible to the lysine 40 acetylation that regulates microtubule function during cortical neuron migration. Together with the unique expression pattern of TUBA8 within the developing cerebral cortex, these observations suggest a role for this atypical microtubule component in regulating mammalian brain development.","dc:creator":"Abdollahi MR","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutation of the variant alpha-tubulin TUBA8 results in polymicrogyria with optic nerve hypoplasia."}},"rdfs:label":"Male, Pakistani, consanguineous"},{"id":"cggv:6ca7b0ef-1d16-4c5c-9f29-8b79a282c27e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Contradicts","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6ca7b0ef-1d16-4c5c-9f29-8b79a282c27e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Another homozygous, loss of function variant in SNAP29 (p.Ser163Lysfs*6 (c.487dupA)) was found in the probands utilizing whole exome sequencing.

(PMID: 19896110). This condition is a highly uncommon disease with features of central nervous system anomalies associated with profound developmental delay, low muscle tone in infancy, seizures, and optic nerve hypoplasia. It is also associated with brain structural anomalies like extensive bilateral polymicrogyria and dysplastic or lack of corpus callosum. Three variants (frameshift, missense) that have been reported in 5 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 19896110, 29588952) are included in this curation. None of the variants were scored. The frameshift variant, truncating protein in exon 3 and associated with nonsense mediated decay, was found in a homozygous state in two consanguineous Pakistani families, not known to be related. The probands were found by Diggle et al., 2017 (PMID: 28388629) to also harbor a homozygous frameshift variant in SNAP29, which is associated with autosomal recessive CEDNIK Syndrome, a condition that has features of microcephaly with facial anomalies including elongation of the face, upward-slanting palpebral fissures, and mild hypertelorism. Additionally, in the Diggle et al., 2017 article, mice with a homozygous loss of function variant (associated with exon 3 skipping and nonsense mediated decay) did not have polymicrogyria. Another proband, who had compound heterozygous missense variants in trans in TUBA8, had epilepsy but no brain structural anomalies or optic nerve hypoplasia (Fung et al., 2017; PMID: 29588952). Mouse expression-level evidence, by Diggle et al., 2017, was not scored, because there were not significant differences in expression of TUBA8 within the brain between the homozygous mutant and wild-type mice. There is no other expression level evidence available. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between TUBA8 and autosomal recessive PMGOH has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role TUBA8 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations GCEP on the meeting date October 10th, 2023 (SOP Version # 9).\nThere is a lack of probands with the specific phenotype and recessive mutations in TUBA8. The mouse model of the homozygous mutant does not have polymicrogyria. The expression-level evidence is not specific.
