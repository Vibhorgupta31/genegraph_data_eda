The obstruction or, later in life, constipation arises from the lack of enteric ganglia in the hindgut, thus resulting in poor coordination of peristalsis. Mutations in Hirschsprung patients have so far been reported in five genes associated in two different receptor-ligand systems, RET-GDNF/NTN and EDNRB-EDN-3, and an additional gene with yet unknown precise function, SOX10. We report the results of single-stranded conformation polymorphism screening of the endothelin-3 gene in a Swedish population-based material of 66 sporadic and nine familial Hirschsprung's disease cases. We have found a novel heterozygous mutation in exon 2, c.262insG, in a patient with sporadic short segment Hirschsprung's disease without any Waardenburg features. This frameshift results in a premature stop two codons further on. Because this stop is introduced 5' of the biologically active protein, this mutation can hence be predicted to result in haplo-insufficiency.","dc:creator":"Svensson PJ","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"A heterozygous frameshift mutation in the endothelin-3 (EDN-3) gene in isolated Hirschsprung's disease."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10231870","rdfs:label":"Svensson Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"absent from gnomAD"},{"id":"cggv:276880ef-8f7f-4bfd-8d1f-857cc2b9c085_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd4bc3d8-01f5-4de5-92e9-4d44be0d190d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"PCR of EDN3, EDNRB, and SOX10","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002211","obo:HP_0001100","obo:HP_0001053","obo:HP_0000408"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:276880ef-8f7f-4bfd-8d1f-857cc2b9c085_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ba43e89e-94c2-495f-a230-f4035e1a6f09","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_207034.2(EDN3):c.507C>A (p.Cys169Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/16649"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11303518","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Pingault V","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A heterozygous endothelin 3 mutation    in Waardenburg-Hirschsprung    disease: is there a dosage effect of    EDN3/EDNRB gene mutations on    neurocristopathy phenotypes?"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11303518","rdfs:label":"Pingault Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because 3 family members carry the variant and are unaffected.

The etiology of the hearing loss is speculated to have a major influence of CI outcomes, particularly in cases resulting from mutations in genes preferentially expressed in the spiral ganglion region. To elucidate precise gene expression levels in each part of the cochlea, we performed laser-capture micro dissection in combination with next-generation sequencing analysis and determined the expression levels of all known deafness-associated genes in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, lateral wall, and spiral limbs. The results were generally consistent with previous reports based on immunocytochemistry or in situ hybridization. As a notable result, the genes associated with many kinds of syndromic hearing loss (such as Clpp, Hars2, Hsd17b4, Lars2 for Perrault syndrome, Polr1c and Polr1d for Treacher Collins syndrome, Ndp for Norrie Disease, Kal for Kallmann syndrome, Edn3 and Snai2 for Waardenburg Syndrome, Col4a3 for Alport syndrome, Sema3e for CHARGE syndrome, Col9a1 for Sticker syndrome, Cdh23, Cib2, Clrn1, Pcdh15, Ush1c, Ush2a, Whrn for Usher syndrome and Wfs1 for Wolfram syndrome) showed higher levels of expression in the spiral ganglion than in other parts of the cochlea.

The trait segregated as a semidominant bellyspot with reduced penetrance. Homozygous mutant mice showed preweaning lethality, and exhibited white spotting over the majority of the body surface, with pigmented patches remaining around the pinnae, eyes and tail. Linkage analysis localized 114-CH19 on mouse chromosome 2, suggesting endothelin 3 (Edn3) as a candidate gene. Sequence analysis of Edn3 identified a G > A transversion that encodes an arginine to histidine substitution (R96H). This mutation is predicted to disrupt furin-mediated proteolytic cleavage of pro-endothelin that is necessary to form biologically active EDN3. This mutation is novel among human and mouse EDN3 mutants, is the first reported EDN3 ENU mutant, and is the second reported EDN3 point mutation.
