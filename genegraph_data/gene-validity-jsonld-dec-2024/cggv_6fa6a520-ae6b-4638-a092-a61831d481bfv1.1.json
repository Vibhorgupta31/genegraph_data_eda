Although many genes for LQTS have been described, the etiology remains unknown in 30%-40% of cases. In the present study, a large Chinese family (four generations, 49 individuals) with autosomal-dominant LQTS was clinically evaluated. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed by using polymorphic microsatellite markers to map the genetic locus, and positional candidate genes were screened by sequencing for mutations. The expression pattern and functional characteristics of the mutated protein were investigated by western blotting and patch-clamp electrophysiology. The genetic locus of the LQTS-associated gene was mapped to chromosome 11q23.3-24.3. A heterozygous mutation (Kir3.4-Gly387Arg) was identified in the G protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir3.4, encoded by the KCNJ5 gene. The Kir3.4-Gly387Arg mutation was present in all nine affected family members and absent in 528 ethnically matched controls. Western blotting of human cardiac tissue demonstrated significant Kir3.4 expression levels in the cardiac ventricles. Heterologous expression studies with Kir3.4-Gly387Arg revealed a loss-of-function electrophysiological phenotype resulting from reduced plasma membrane expression. Our findings suggest a role for Kir3.4 in the etiology of LQTS.","dc:creator":"Yang Y","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Identification of a Kir3.4 mutation in congenital long QT syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20560207","rdfs:label":"III-8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The variant provided in the manuscript is not correct.

The gene is located within a 16 million base pair region (11q23.3-24.3) identified by linkage analysis in a large Chinese family with LQTS (PMID 20560207). The Gly387Arg variant identified in this family, however, is now recognized to be present in 1/200 individuals of East Asian descent, making it very unlikely to be a rare cause of a rare disease. Because there is very little other data supporting the association of KCNJ5 with LQTS, the level of evidence for this gene-disease association was classified as disputed. \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams.
