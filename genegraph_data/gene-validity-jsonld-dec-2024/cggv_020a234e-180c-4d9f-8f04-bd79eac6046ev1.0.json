Repair via homologous recombination typically restores the original DNA sequence without introducing mutations, and a number of genes that are required for homologous recombination DNA double-strand break repair (HR-DSBR) have been identified. However, a systematic analysis of this important DNA repair pathway in mammalian cells has not been reported. Here, we describe a genome-scale endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNA (esiRNA) screen for genes involved in DNA double strand break repair. We report 61 genes that influenced the frequency of HR-DSBR and characterize in detail one of the genes that decreased the frequency of HR-DSBR. We show that the gene KIAA0415 encodes a putative helicase that interacts with SPG11 and SPG15, two proteins mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). We identify mutations in HSP patients, discovering KIAA0415/SPG48 as a novel HSP-associated gene, and show that a KIAA0415/SPG48 mutant cell line is more sensitive to DNA damaging drugs. We present the first genome-scale survey of HR-DSBR in mammalian cells providing a dataset that should accelerate the discovery of novel genes with roles in DNA repair and associated medical conditions. The discovery that proteins forming a novel protein complex are required for efficient HR-DSBR and are mutated in patients suffering from HSP suggests a link between HSP and DNA repair.","dc:creator":"Słabicki M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A genome-scale DNA repair RNAi screen identifies SPG48 as a novel gene associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia."},"rdfs:label":"Co-Immunoprecipitation "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:020a234e-180c-4d9f-8f04-bd79eac6046e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:229cf01d-22cd-4234-89ea-49eb6addde33","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d5a0e62a-f9e1-457d-a6e8-52ef178505d6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Early neurite outgrowth defects are a common finding among several HSP subtypes> However is not clear if this is a consistent feature of AP5Z1-HSP","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29726929","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mechanisms by which long corticospinal axons degenerate in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) are largely unknown.

In patient iPSC-derived telencephalic glutamatergic and midbrain dopaminergic neurons, neurite number, length and branching are significantly reduced, recapitulating disease-specific phenotypes. We analyzed mitochondrial morphology and noted a significant reduction in both mitochondrial length and their densities within axons of these HSP neurons. Mitochondrial membrane potential was also decreased, confirming functional mitochondrial defects. Notably, mdivi-1, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial fission GTPase DRP1, rescues mitochondrial morphology defects and suppresses the impairment in neurite outgrowth and late-onset apoptosis in HSP neurons. Furthermore, knockdown of these HSP genes causes similar axonal defects, also mitigated by treatment with mdivi-1. Finally, neurite outgrowth defects in SPG15 and SPG48 cortical neurons can be rescued by knocking down DRP1 directly. Thus, abnormal mitochondrial morphology caused by an imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion underlies specific axonal defects and serves as a potential therapeutic target for SPG15 and SPG48.","dc:creator":"Denton K","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Impaired mitochondrial dynamics underlie axonal defects in hereditary spastic paraplegias."},"rdfs:label":"Human neuronal iPSCs/hESCs model for AP5Z1 HSP "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not clear if the finding recapitulate the phenotype observed in humans"},{"id":"cggv:2b24e286-6493-4298-9dbb-c9c530244947","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec2c827e-a078-4bc6-b78f-a32fbe5eac22","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"AP5 zeta deficient mice develop a progressive gait abnormality as \nmeasured by the foot base angle at the toe-off position when mice traversed a\nbeam directing to the home cage as described previously (Beetz et al.,\n2013).

In vivo, we observe an increase of autophagosomes and autolysosomes and, at later stages, the accumulation of intracellular waste in neurons.

Genetically, more than 70 different forms of spastic paraplegias have been characterized. A subgroup of complicate recessive forms has been distinguished for the presence of thin corpus callosum and white matter lesions at brain imaging. This group includes several genetic entities, but most of the cases are caused by mutations in the KIAA1840 (SPG11) and ZFYVE26 genes (SPG15). We studied a cohort of 61 consecutive patients with complicated spastic paraplegias, presenting at least one of the following features: mental retardation, thin corpus callosum and/or white matter lesions. DNA samples were screened for mutations in the SPG11/KIAA1840, SPG15/ZFYVE26, SPG21/ACP33, SPG35/FA2H, SPG48/AP5Z1 and SPG54/DDHD2 genes by direct sequencing. Sequence variants were found in 30 of 61 cases: 16 patients carried SPG11/KIAA1840 gene variants (26.2%), nine patients carried SPG15/ZFYVE26 variants (14.8%), three patients SPG35/FA2H (5%), and two patients carried SPG48/AP5Z1 gene variants (3%). Mean age at onset was similar in patients with SPG11 and with SPG15 (range 11-36), and the phenotype was mostly indistinguishable. Extrapyramidal signs were observed only in patients with SPG15, and epilepsy in three subjects with SPG11. Motor axonal neuropathy was found in 60% of cases with SPG11 and 70% of cases with SPG15. Subjects with SPG35 had intellectual impairment, spastic paraplegia, thin corpus callosum, white matter hyperintensities, and cerebellar atrophy. Two families had a late-onset presentation, and none had signs of brain iron accumulation. The patients with SPG48 were a 5-year-old child, homozygous for a missense SPG48/AP5Z1 variant, and a 51-year-old female, carrying two different nonsense variants. Both patients had intellectual deficits, thin corpus callosum and white matter lesions. None of the cases in our cohort carried mutations in the SPG21/ACP33 and SPG54/DDH2H genes. Our study confirms that the phenotype of patients with SPG11 and with SPG15 is homogeneous, whereas cases with SPG35 and with SPG48 cases present overlapping features, and a broader clinical spectrum. The large group of non-diagnosed subjects (51%) suggests further genetic heterogeneity. The observation of common clinical features in association with defects in different causative genes, suggest a general vulnerability of the corticospinal tract axons to a wide spectrum of cellular alterations.

Mutations in AP5Z1, encoding a subunit of the AP-5 complex, have been reported to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), although their impact at the cellular level has not been assessed. Here we characterize three independent fibroblast lines derived from skin biopsies of patients harbouring nonsense mutations in AP5Z1 and presenting with spastic paraplegia accompanied by neuropathy, parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment. In all three patient-derived lines, we show that there is complete loss of AP-5 ζ protein and a reduction in the associated AP-5 µ5 protein. Using ultrastructural analysis, we show that these patient-derived lines consistently exhibit abundant multilamellar structures that are positive for markers of endolysosomes and are filled with aberrant storage material organized as exaggerated multilamellar whorls, striated belts and 'fingerprint bodies'. This phenotype can be replicated in a HeLa cell culture model by siRNA knockdown of AP-5 ζ. The cellular phenotype bears striking resemblance to features described in a number of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Collectively, these findings reveal an emerging picture of the role of AP-5 in endosomal and lysosomal homeostasis, illuminates a potential pathomechanism that is relevant to the role of AP-5 in neurons and expands the understanding of recessive HSPs. Moreover, the resulting accumulation of storage material in endolysosomes leads us to propose that AP-5 deficiency represents a new type of LSDs.

It encodes the zeta subunit of the adaptor-related protein complex-5, a component of the adaptor-related protein complex-5, which localizes in the late endosomes were facilitates vesicle-mediated intracellular sorting and trafficking of selected transmembrane cargo proteins.\n\nAP5Z1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in 2010 (Słabicki et al., PMID: 20613862). The disorder is a slowly progressive complex spastic paraplegia of the lower limbs accompanied by other phenotypic features, including ataxia, seizures, intellectual disability, muscle atrophy, extrapyramidal disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy. Onset is typically between 10 and 59 years of age, and affected individuals often become wheelchair-dependent. Multiple unique variants have been reported in at least 21 individuals in numerous publications (PMID: 20613862, 26085577, 33543803, 27606357, 31289639). Variants in this gene segregated with the disorder in additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) was reached. Most reported variants are LoF (PMID:33543803, 20613862, 2608557) but missense variants have also been identified in several cases (PMID:24833714). Functional evidence, including immunohistochemistry and protein expression studies, supports the assumption that these variants are responsible for the patient's phenotype by acting through a loss of function mechanism (PMID:33543803). \n\nMutations in the AP5Z1 gene lead to transport defects from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. In vitro experiments conducted in patient's fibroblasts and knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed a generalized autophagy defect under stress conditions manifested with an increased number of autophagosomes and decreased lysosome counts (PMID: 31289639, 27606357). The lysosome depletion and impaired autophagic clearance ultimately lead to aberrant multilamellar toxic storage material accumulation. The gene-disease relationship is additionally supported by AP5Z1 knockout mice that recapitulate most of the features seen in HSP patients (Khundadze M et al., 2019, PMID: 30930081).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between the AP5Z1 gene and autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 09/19/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n\nConsistent replication of findings ","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:020a234e-180c-4d9f-8f04-bd79eac6046e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
