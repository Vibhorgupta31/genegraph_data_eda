However, the specific role of GNPTG was not well understood.\nIn this paper, through a series of experiments in Gnptg knock out mouse embryoic fibroblasts (outlined above) the authors show that deficiency of the gamma-subunit of GlcNAc-1- phosphotransferase results in the decreased intracellular activities and amounts of various lysosomal enzymes (arylsulfatase B, beta-hexosaminidase A/B, beta-galactosidase, beta-mannosidase, and beta-fucosidase), decreased GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity, reduced amounts and altered pattern of M6P-containing proteins in cell extracts and lysosome-enriched fractions, and specifically that that loss of alpha-L-fucosidase and arylsulfatase B activity resulted in accumulation of storage of L-fucose- containing glycostructures and sulfated glycosaminoglycans in Gnptg KO MEF. In short, the gamma-subunit of (GlcNAc)-1- phosphotransferase, enoded by GNPTG, is required for the lysosomal targeting of multiple soluble lysosomal proteins.

The ML II mice have a total loss of acid hydrolase phosphorylation, which results in depletion of acid hydrolases in mesenchymal-derived cells. The ML III Î³ mice retain partial phosphorylation.

The gnptg(-/-) embryos lack the gross morphological or craniofacial phenotypes shown in gnptab-deficient morphant embryos to result from altered cathepsin activity. Despite the lack of overt phenotypes, decreased fertilization and embryo survival were noted in mutants, suggesting that gnptg associated deposition of mannose 6-phosphate modified hydrolases into oocytes is important for early embryonic development. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that loss of the zebrafish GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase Î³ subunit causes enzyme-specific effects on mannose phosphorylation.

In this study we describe the phenotypic, histologic, and serum lysosomal enzyme abnormalities in knockout mice lacking the gamma subunit and compare these findings to those of mice lacking the alpha/beta subunits and humans with MLII and MLIIIC. We found that both lines of mutant mice had elevated levels of serum lysosomal enzymes and cytoplasmic alterations in secretory cells of several exocrine glands; however, lesions in gamma-subunit deficient (Gnptg(-/-)) mice were milder and more restricted in distribution than in alpha/beta-subunit deficient (Gnptab(-/-)) mice. We found that onset, extent, and severity of lesions that developed in these two different knockouts correlated with measured lysosomal enzyme activity; with a more rapid, widespread, and severe storage disease phenotype developing in Gnptab(-/-) mice. In contrast to mice deficient in the alpha/beta subunits, the mice lacking the gamma subunits were of normal size, lacked cartilage defects, and did not develop retinal degeneration. The milder disease in the gamma-subunit deficient mice correlated with residual synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. Of significance, neither strain of mutant mice developed cytoplasmic vacuolar inclusions in fibrocytes or mesenchymal cells (I-cells), the characteristic lesion associated with the prominent skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities in humans with MLII and MLIII.

The absence of retinal and chondrocyte lesions in Gnptg(-/-) mice might be attributed to residual beta-glucuronidase activity.

RT-PCR analysis of the c.610-2A>G transition demonstrated that the change altered splicing, leading to the production of two distinct aberrantly spliced forms, viz. the skipping of exon 9 (p.G204_K247del) or the retention of introns 8 and 9 (p.G204VfsX28).

This is consistent with these repeats having mediated the microdeletions via replication slippage and supports the view that the mutational spectrum of the GNPTG gene is strongly influenced by the properties of the local DNA sequence environment.","dc:creator":"Persichetti E","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Identification and molecular characterization of six novel mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase gamma subunit (GNPTG) gene in patients with mucolipidosis III gamma."}},"rdfs:label":"Persichetti- Patient 6-I"},{"id":"cggv:cc935b3a-7d8c-4d2d-a7b2-f16f4eca3027","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc935b3a-7d8c-4d2d-a7b2-f16f4eca3027_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a274a8df-2d72-4f38-82de-26b7cf74b6f4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a274a8df-2d72-4f38-82de-26b7cf74b6f4","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:b5ca9085-040b-4981-aabe-b7087d9286a0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032520.5(GNPTG):c.318-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342403"}},{"id":"cggv:f29f149b-b0fe-4566-b08d-d4a30000ba7e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032520.5(GNPTG):c.196C>T (p.Arg66Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342401"}}],"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of the 11 exons and exon/intron boundaries of GNPTG.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Stiffness in shoulders and hands.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0004322","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Sequencing of the 11 exons and exon/intron boundaries of GNPTG.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:1cc4ee05-03c0-4866-9f2d-55ef5be60970_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f29f149b-b0fe-4566-b08d-d4a30000ba7e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15060128","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Raas-Rothschild A","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Genomic organisation of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase gamma subunit (GNPTAG) and its mutations in mucolipidosis III."}},{"id":"cggv:55af1b16-6ace-4dc1-aeff-a8bf83a30f4c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b5ca9085-040b-4981-aabe-b7087d9286a0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15060128"}],"rdfs:label":"Raas-Rothschild, 2004: Individual 8-I"},{"id":"cggv:1cc4ee05-03c0-4866-9f2d-55ef5be60970","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1cc4ee05-03c0-4866-9f2d-55ef5be60970_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Downscoring because GNPTAB, associated with a similar but typically more severe phenotype, was not sequenced."},{"id":"cggv:55af1b16-6ace-4dc1-aeff-a8bf83a30f4c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55af1b16-6ace-4dc1-aeff-a8bf83a30f4c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:55af1b16-6ace-4dc1-aeff-a8bf83a30f4c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR showed that this variant results in skipping of exon 6."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downscoring because GNPTAB, associated with a similar but typically more sever phenotype, was not sequenced."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:458993cd-4f56-4c71-8f90-fb7f3eea57e4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:458993cd-4f56-4c71-8f90-fb7f3eea57e4","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:04e90516-5ce6-4b5d-87ef-3f01048639e2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032520.5(GNPTG):c.500dup (p.Val168ArgfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573332333"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequence analysis of the 11 exons of GNPTG and exon/intron boundaries.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Patient underwent valve replacement therapy at the age of 27 years. \nMovement limitations/stiffness of elbows, wrists, shoulders, knees, and hips.

GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase catalyzes the first step of the formation of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) on specific soluble lysosomal hydrolases. M6P is essential for the trafficking of these lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomes via M6P receptors. Without M6P, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are missorted into the extracellular space and are unable to breakdown specific substrates in lysosomes (for reviews, see Velho et al, 2019, PMID: 30882951; and Khan and Tomatsu, 2020, PMID: 32957425). As a result, various macromolecules accumulate in the lysosomes in different tissues causing the characteristic symptoms of mucolipidosis. \n\nBiallelic variants in GNPTG are reported in individuals with mucolipiosis type III gamma. This condition is characterized by gradual mild coarsening of facial features, spinal deformities including scoliosis and hyperlordosis, genu valgum, restricted joint mobility, short stature, and characteristic radiographic findings. Most patients have normal intellectual capacity, and organomegaly is not present. Mucolipidosis type II gamma is typically milder and less rapidly progressive than mucolipidosis type II, which is caused by variants in GNPTAB (Raas-Rothschild & Spiegel, 2019, PMID: 20301784).\n\nAbout 50 different GNPTG variants have been identified in individuals with mucolipiosis type III gamma, about 80% of which result in formation of a premature stop codon (Velho et al, 2019, PMID: 30882951). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Seventeen variants (including nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense, in-frame deletion) reported in 12 probands in 4 publications (Raas-Rothschild et al, 2000, PMID: 10712439; Raas-Rothschild et al, 2004, PMID: 15060128; Persichetti et al, 2009, PMID: 19370764; Velho et al, 2014, PMID: 27896079) are included in this curation in addition to segregation data from a large, consanguineous family (Raas-Rothschild et al, 2000, PMID: 10712439). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of the gene product, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical features of mucolipidosis type III gamma (Lee et al, 2007, PMID: 17652091; Di Lorenzo et al, 2018, PMID: 29773673), rescue in patient cells (Zarghooni et al, 2009, PMID: 19938078), and the features reported in Gnptg knock out mouse and zebrafish models (Vogel et al, 2009, PMID: 19261645; Idol et al, 2014, PMID: 25314316; Flannagan-Steet et al, 2016, PMID: 27241848). \n\nIn summary, GNPTG is definitively associated with autosomal recessive GNPTG-mucolipidosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP (SOP v9) on December 28, 2022.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:71d1d916-4c96-4d09-a66b-1c7ccb55c353"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
