Comparing the molecular pathophysiology of mutations in the same epilepsy gene may provide mechanistic insights into the phenotypic heterogeneity. GABRG2 is an established epilepsy gene, and mutations in it produce epilepsy syndromes with varying severities. The disease phenotype in some cases may be caused by simple loss of subunit function (functional haploinsufficiency), while others may be caused by loss-of-function plus dominant negative suppression and other cellular toxicity. Detailed molecular defects and the corresponding seizures and related comorbidities resulting from haploinsufficiency and dominant negative mutations, however, have not been compared. Here we compared two mouse models of GABRG2 loss-of-function mutations associated with epilepsy with different severities, Gabrg2+/Q390X knockin (KI) and Gabrg2+/- knockout (KO) mice. Heterozygous Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice are associated with a severe epileptic encephalopathy due to a dominant negative effect of the mutation, while heterozygous Gabrg2+/- KO mice are associated with mild absence epilepsy due to simple haploinsufficiency. Unchanged at the transcriptional level, KI mice with severe epilepsy had neuronal accumulation of mutant γ2 subunits, reduced remaining functional wild-type subunits in dendrites and synapses, while KO mice with mild epilepsy had no intracellular accumulation of the mutant subunits and unaffected biogenesis of the remaining wild-type subunits. Consequently, KI mice with dominant negative mutations had much less wild-type receptor expression, more severe seizures and behavioural comorbidities than KO mice. This work provides insights into the pathophysiology of epilepsy syndrome heterogeneity and designing mechanism-based therapies.","dc:creator":"Warner TA","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Differential molecular and behavioural alterations in mouse models of GABRG2 haploinsufficiency versus dominant negative mutations associated with human epilepsy."},"rdfs:label":"Q390X heterozygous knockin mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:3a3176e9-ac0c-41fe-ae40-0750726c33d8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a3176e9-ac0c-41fe-ae40-0750726c33d8_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3a3176e9-ac0c-41fe-ae40-0750726c33d8_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8e8ca445-cddc-45c3-b5cd-29931b1f1459_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a96fa72-0015-4c0f-8097-d902231dbc00","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

Disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in epilepsy for many decades. We now report a K289M mutation in the GABA(A) receptor gamma2-subunit gene (GABRG2) that segregates in a family with a phenotype closely related to GEFS+ (ref. 8), an autosomal dominant disorder associating febrile seizures and generalized epilepsy previously linked to mutations in sodium channel genes. The K289M mutation affects a highly conserved residue located in the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments M2 and M3. Analysis of the mutated and wild-type alleles in Xenopus laevis oocytes confirmed the predicted effect of the mutation, a decrease in the amplitude of GABA-activated currents.

Many epileptic encephalopathies have a genetic aetiology and are often associated with de novo mutations in genes mediating synaptic transmission, including GABAA receptor subunit genes. Recently, we performed next generation sequencing on patients with a spectrum of epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes, and we identified five novel (A106T, I107T, P282S, R323W and F343L) and one known (R323Q) de novo GABRG2 pathogenic variants (mutations) in eight patients. To gain insight into the molecular basis for how these mutations contribute to epileptic encephalopathies, we compared the effects of the mutations on the properties of recombinant α1β2γ2L GABAA receptors transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. Using a combination of patch clamp recording, immunoblotting, confocal imaging and structural modelling, we characterized the effects of these GABRG2 mutations on GABAA receptor biogenesis and channel function. Compared with wild-type α1β2γ2L receptors, GABAA receptors containing a mutant γ2 subunit had reduced cell surface expression with altered subunit stoichiometry or decreased GABA-evoked whole-cell current amplitudes, but with different levels of reduction. While a causal role of these mutations cannot be established directly from these results, the functional analysis together with the genetic information suggests that these GABRG2 variants may be major contributors to the epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes.
