The coimmunoprecipitation of the repair proteins was sensitive to nuclease treatment and an ICF3 mutation in CDCA7 that impairs its chromatin binding. The functional importance of these interactions was strongly suggested by the compromised C-NHEJ activity and significant delay in Ku80 accumulation at DNA damage sites in CDCA7- and HELLS-deficient HEK293 cells. Consistent with the repair defect, these cells displayed increased apoptosis, abnormal chromosome segregation, aneuploidy, centrosome amplification, and significant accumulation of γH2AX signals. Although less prominent, cells with mutations in the other ICF genes DNMT3B and ZBTB24 (responsible for ICF types 1 and 2, respectively) showed similar defects. Importantly, lymphoblastoid cells from ICF patients shared the same changes detected in the mutant HEK293 cells to varying degrees. Although the C-NHEJ defect alone did not cause CG hypomethylation, CDCA7 and HELLS are involved in maintaining CG methylation at centromeric and pericentromeric repeats.

The chromatin remodeler HELLS (helicase, lymphoid specific) has emerged as an important epigenetic regulator of DNA repair, genome stability, and multiple cancer-associated pathways. HELLS belongs to a subfamily of the conserved SNF2 ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, which use energy from ATP hydrolysis to alter nucleosome structure and packaging of chromatin during the processes of DNA replication, transcription, and repair. The mouse homologue, LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase), plays an important role in the maintenance of heterochromatin and genome-wide DNA methylation, and is crucial in embryonic development, gametogenesis, and maturation of the immune system. Human HELLS is abundantly expressed in highly proliferating cells of the lymphoid tissue, skin, germ cells, and embryonic stem cells. Mutations in HELLS cause the human immunodeficiency syndrome ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, Facial anomalies).

Knock down of HELLS, Zbtb24, and Cdca7 and knock out of DNMT3B resulted in hypomethylation of centromeric repeats. Hypomethylation of these centromeric repeats may be responsible for the wide ranging phenotypes observed in ICF syndrome through a shared pathway involving methylation.

This result suggests that HELLS may be important to the efficient functioning of NHEJ, which normally functions in class switch recombination to join the variable domain exon to the a specific constant domain exon in the heavy chain of antibodies. The authors suggest that a deficiency in this mechanism during class switch recombination may be an underlying cause of Ig deficiency observed in individuals with ICF4.

We assessed here the role of Lsh in hematopoiesis using conditional Lsh knockout mice with expression of Mx1 or Vav Cre-recombinase. Bone marrow transplantation studies revealed that Lsh depletion in hematopoietic stem cells severely reduced B cell numbers and impaired B cell development in a hematopoietic cell-autonomous manner. Lsh-deficient mice without bone marrow transplantation exhibited lower Ig levels in vivo compared to controls despite normal peripheral B cell numbers. Purified B lymphocytes proliferated normally but produced less immunoglobulins in response to in vitro stimulation, indicating a reduced capacity to undergo class switch recombination (CSR). Analysis of germline transcripts, examination of double-stranded breaks using biotin-labeling DNA break assay, and End-seq analysis indicated that the initiation of the recombination process was unscathed. In contrast, digestion-circularization PCR analysis and high-throughput sequencing analyses of CSR junctions and a chromosomal break repair assay indicated an impaired ability of the canonical end-joining pathway in Lsh-deficient B cells. Our data suggest a hematopoietic cell-intrinsic role of Lsh in B cell development and in CSR providing a potential target for immunodeficiency therapy.","dc:creator":"He Y","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Lsh/HELLS is required for B lymphocyte development and immunoglobulin class switch recombination."},"rdfs:label":"He et al.

This condition is characterized by recurrent infection, dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, cytogenetic abnormalities on chromosomes 1,9, and 16, and hypomethylation of alpha satellite regions. Six variants (frameshift, in frame deletion, missense, nonsense, and splice site) have been reported in five probands in two publications (PMIDs: 26216346, 30511102). Variants segregated with disease in two families. Heterozygous parents and siblings were unaffected. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, GTEx bulk tissue expression showing that HELLS is greatly expressed in EBV transformed lymphocytes and other highly proliferative tissues such as the testis, and a co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that HELLS interacts with CDCA7, which is associated with ICF type 3 (PMIDs:23715323, 36012581, 30307408). Additionally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by several cell culture and animal models, including a conditional mouse model which showed that knocked out LSH (mouse orthologue of HELLS) recapitulated a core immunological phenotype of reduced Ig levels (PMID: 32727902). Other cell culture models demonstrated that knock down HELLS recapitulated phenotypes of centromeric hypomethylation (PMID:26216346), while another model suggests HELLS may effect NHEJ, which may reflect a deficiency in class switch recombination observed in patients (PMID:32727902). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the SCID-CID GCEP on April 20th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
