Domain swapping experiments suggest that the functional specificity for EF-G2mt resides in domains III and IV. Furthermore, GTP hydrolysis by EF-G2mt is not necessary for ribosomal splitting, in contrast to the bacterial-recycling mode.

The GFM2 gene encodes mitochondrial elongation factor G2, which plays an important role in mitochondrial translation by recycling the mitochondrial ribosome after translation termination.\n\nThe GFM2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2015 (PMID: 26016410). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants identified in three unrelated cases from two publications (PMIDs: 26016410, 29075935). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function (PMID: 19716793).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
