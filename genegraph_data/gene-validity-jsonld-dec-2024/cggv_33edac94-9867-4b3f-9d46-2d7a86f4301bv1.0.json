Since this publication, most reported probands have had microdeletions and microduplications in the 15q13.3 region, which often includes at least six other genes (ARHGAP11B, MTMR15, MTMR10, TRPM1, KLF13, and OTUD7A). Because these deletions are not isolated to CHRNA7 alone, they are not included in this curation. \n\nThree missense variants that have been reported in three probands in one paper were evaluated as a part of this curation (PMID: 26421493). However, none of these cases were awarded points, as their variants were either inherited from a healthy parent, or were predicted to be benign. Another paper with a homozygous *CHRNA7* knock-out mouse model found no evidence of recapitulating phenotypes observed in humans, and there were no electrophysiological phenotypic differences between the wild type and knock-out mice (PMID: 28045139). Taken together, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CHRNA7* and autosomal dominant epilepsy has been REFUTED and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on February 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\nThe evidence supporting the relationship between *CHRNA7* and autosomal dominant epilepsy has been evaluated and refuted, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. This is further explained in the evidence summary.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:33edac94-9867-4b3f-9d46-2d7a86f4301b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
