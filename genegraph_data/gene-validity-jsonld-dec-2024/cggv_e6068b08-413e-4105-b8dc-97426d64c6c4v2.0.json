We here present two affected brothers. At 9 months of age the elder brother developed ataxia and myoclonic jerks. In his second year he lost the ability to walk and talk, and he developed drug-resistant progressive myoclonus epilepsy. The cerebrospinal fluid level of glutamate was decreased while glutamine was increased. His younger brother manifested similar symptoms from 6 months of age. By exome sequencing of the proband we identified a novel homozygous frameshift variant in the potassium channel tetramerization domain 7 (KCTD7) gene (NM_153033.1:c.696delT: p.F232fs), which results in a truncated protein. The identified F232fs variant is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and the healthy consanguineous parents carry the variant in a heterozygous state. Bioinformatic analyses and structure modelling showed that KCTD7 is a highly conserved protein, structurally similar to KCTD5 and several voltage-gated potassium channels, and that it may form homo- or heteromultimers. By heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we demonstrate that wild-type KCTD7 hyperpolarizes cells in a K+ dependent manner and regulates activity of the neuronal glutamine transporter SAT2 (Slc38a2), while the F232fs variant impairs K+ fluxes and obliterates SAT2-dependent glutamine transport. Characterization of four additional disease-causing variants (R94W, R184C, N273I, Y276C) bolster these results and reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of KCTD7-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Thus, our data demonstrate that KCTD7 has an impact on K+ fluxes, neurotransmitter synthesis and neuronal function, and that malfunction of the encoded protein may lead to progressive myoclonus epilepsy.","dc:creator":"Moen MN","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Pathogenic variants in KCTD7 perturb neuronal K+ fluxes and glutamine transport."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:afd96712-0924-4b7b-a2d4-34b23f49f8aa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:afd96712-0924-4b7b-a2d4-34b23f49f8aa_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:afd96712-0924-4b7b-a2d4-34b23f49f8aa_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Wild-type KCTD7 hyperpolarizes cells in a K+ dependent manner and regulates activity of the neuronal glutamine transporter SAT2 (Slc38a2) by heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes,while the F232fs variant impairs K+ fluxes and obliterates SAT2-dependent glutamine transport."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:997add8f-823c-46bd-add4-cf6cf1a84a9b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:997add8f-823c-46bd-add4-cf6cf1a84a9b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":9,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f8bde509-25b3-47ae-bfed-d42e7c2b43e5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153033.5(KCTD7):c.550C>T (p.Arg184Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129977"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0032794","obo:HP_0000572","obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0001336","obo:HP_0001257"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Targeted sequencing of all known genes associated with autosomal-recessive NCL (PPT1, TPP1, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, MFSD8, CLN8, and CTSD) identified no known or predicted pathogenic mutations.

To further understand the genetic underpinnings of the NCLs, we performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA samples from a Mexican family affected by a molecularly undefined form of NCL characterized by infantile-onset progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), vision loss, cognitive and motor regression, premature death, and prominent NCL-type storage material. Using a recessive model to filter the identified variants, we found a single homozygous variant, c.550C>T in KCTD7, that causes a p.Arg184Cys missense change in potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 7 (KCTD7) in the affected individuals. The mutation was predicted to be deleterious and was absent in over 6,000 controls. The identified variant altered the localization pattern of KCTD7 and abrogated interaction with cullin-3, a ubiquitin-ligase component and known KCTD7 interactor. Intriguingly, murine cerebellar cells derived from a juvenile NCL model (CLN3) showed enrichment of endogenous KCTD7. Whereas KCTD7 mutations have previously been linked to PME without lysosomal storage, this study clearly demonstrates that KCTD7 mutations also cause a rare, infantile-onset NCL subtype designated as CLN14.","dc:creator":"Staropoli JF","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A homozygous mutation in KCTD7 links neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis to the ubiquitin-proteasome system."}},"rdfs:label":"IV-1"},{"id":"cggv:07d38231-c241-4bda-b191-56151bb138f2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07d38231-c241-4bda-b191-56151bb138f2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:07d38231-c241-4bda-b191-56151bb138f2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The identified variant altered the\nlocalization pattern of KCTD7 and abrogated interaction with cullin-3, a ubiquitin-ligase component and known KCTD7 interactor.\nIntriguingly, murine cerebellar cells derived from a juvenile NCL model (CLN3) showed enrichment of endogenous KCTD7"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:fbe1c7da-b946-43ea-a399-5bd555469737_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fbe1c7da-b946-43ea-a399-5bd555469737","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":18,"allele":{"id":"cggv:03bf2578-cfd5-4a45-8a8e-b4239689d05e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153033.5(KCTD7):c.295C>T (p.Arg99Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114572"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0032794","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0010841","obo:HP_0011463"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:717367f4-2c30-4f28-b94f-8c1cbc8dba20_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:03bf2578-cfd5-4a45-8a8e-b4239689d05e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17455289","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We investigated a large consanguineous Moroccan family with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, to describe the phenotype and identify the causal gene.","dc:creator":"Van Bogaert P","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Mutation of a potassium channel-related gene in progressive myoclonic epilepsy."}},"rdfs:label":"Family 1 proband"},{"id":"cggv:717367f4-2c30-4f28-b94f-8c1cbc8dba20","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:717367f4-2c30-4f28-b94f-8c1cbc8dba20_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e6068b08-413e-4105-b8dc-97426d64c6c4_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:e6068b08-413e-4105-b8dc-97426d64c6c4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e6068b08-413e-4105-b8dc-97426d64c6c4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:defbd52c-a816-41f8-8e19-489d822533bd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b99d881f-84d6-44da-a52d-6308a67ed251","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The knockout mice exhibited spontaneous epileptiform activity lasting several seconds to 1-2 minutes, consisting of interictal multifocal fast cortical spike and polyspike discharges in 8 of 10 animals recorded.

Kctd7 (EPM3) is a member of a large family of progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM) syndromes displaying a broad spectrum of clinical severity. Animal models of Kctd7-related disease are lacking, and little is known regarding how Kctd7 protein defects lead to epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction. We characterized brain Kctd7 expression patterns during development and show it is selectively enriched in specific regions as the brain matures. We further demonstrate that Kctd7-deficient mice develop seizures and locomotor defects with features similar to those observed in human KCTD7-associated disease. We also show that Kctd7 is required for Purkinje cell survival in the cerebellum and that selective degeneration of these neurons is accompanied by defects in cerebellar brain microvascular organization and patterning. Together, these results define a new model for Kctd7- associated epilepsy and identify Kctd7 as a modulator of neuron survival and excitability linked to microvascular alterations in vulnerable regions.","dc:creator":"Liang JH","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Kctd7 deficiency induces myoclonic seizures associated with Purkinje cell death and microvascular defects."},"rdfs:label":"KCTD7 knockout mouse model exhibits myoclonic seizures"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5245,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e60f7330-418b-4c87-ab0b-346766124922","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020074","gene":"hgnc:21957","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"KCTD7 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) in 2007 (Van Bogaert et al., PMID: 17455289).  The typical clinical presentation is characterized by onset of myoclonic seizures in infancy or early childhood followed by developmental regression and ataxia, sometimes also associated with cerebral or cerebellar atrophy and microcephaly (PMID: 34866617).  Up to 25% of individuals with KCTD7 pathogenic variants have developmental delay and/or movement disorders such as ataxia, dyskinesia, dystonia, choreoathetosis, or tremors prior to the onset of seizures (PMIDs: 30295347, 31197948).\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function (LOF).  To date, approximately 55 missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants have been reported in more than 50 probands in the literature.  Eight publications (PMIDs: 17455289, 22638565, 22693283, 27742667, 30295347, 30825425, 22748208, 25060828) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence from an animal model that exhibits spontaneous seizure activity in a knockout mouse (PMIDs: 35972048). \n\nIn summary, KCTD7 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e6068b08-413e-4105-b8dc-97426d64c6c4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
