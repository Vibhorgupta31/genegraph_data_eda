Rab GTPases are small proteins that are primarily involved in the formation, trafficking, and fusion of vesicles. We showed thatCRACR2A(Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel regulator 2A) encodes a lymphocyte-specific large Rab GTPase that contains multiple functional domains, including EF-hand motifs, a proline-rich domain (PRD), and a Rab GTPase domain with an unconventional prenylation site. Through experiments involving gene silencing in cells and knockout mice, we demonstrated a role for CRACR2A in the activation of the Ca(2+) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Vesicles containing this Rab GTPase translocated from near the Golgi to the immunological synapse formed between a T cell and a cognate antigen-presenting cell to activate these signaling pathways. The interaction between the PRD of CRACR2A and the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 was required for the accumulation of these vesicles at the immunological synapse. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GTP binding and prenylation of CRACR2A were associated with its localization near the Golgi and its stability. Our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized function of a large Rab GTPase and vesicles near the Golgi in TCR signaling. Other GTPases with similar domain architectures may have similar functions in T cells.","dc:creator":"Srikanth S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"A large Rab GTPase encoded by CRACR2A is a component of subsynaptic vesicles that transmit T cell activation signals."},"rdfs:label":" activation of the Ca2+ and the Jnk signaling pathways"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Here the authors show that CRACR2A encodes a lymphocyte-specific large Rab GTPase containing multiple functional domains.

The calcium release-activated calcium channel regulator 2A (*CRACR2A*) was identified as a protein that binds ORAI1/STIM1 and stabilizes their interaction to mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in T cells. *CRACR2A* encodes a large Rab GTPase that is expressed abundantly in T cells and acts as a signal transmitter between T cell receptor stimulation and activation of the Ca2+-NFAT and JNK-AP1 pathways. Two isoforms of the protein are expressed in T cells, a short cytoplasmic isoform CRACR2A-c, which was originally shown to bind ORAI1/STIM1 and stabilize their interaction, and a longer isoform CRACR2A-a, that is a Rab GTPase. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function and the resulting clinical phenotype is an antibody deficiency, although detailed immunological investigations show a combined immune defect with evidence of progressive lymphopenia and impaired T cell activation. Genetic evidence is available from a single proband (PMID: 34908525) with compound heterozygous missense and nonsense variants. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its interaction with ORAI1/STIM1 (PMID: 34908525), its function in T cells (PMID: 27016526), which is altered in patient cells as well as CRISPR/Cas9 modified Jurkat T cells (PMID: 34908525), resulting in reduced cytokine production. Furthermore, T cell-specific deletion of Cracr2a in Cracr2afl/fl mice showed defects in SOCE as well as JNK-phosphorylation, and thereby, reduction in cytokine (IFN-Î³) production, suggesting conserved function of *CRACR2A* in mouse and human T cells (PMID: 29987160). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:404d2603-e070-4798-81b0-ebf683a76efe"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
