The main objective of this study was to identify the genetic alterations underlying recessive congenital glaucoma with ASD (CG-ASD). Next-generation DNA sequencing identified rare biallelic CPAMD8 variants in four patients with CG-ASD and in one case with PCG. CPAMD8 is a gene of unknown function and recently associated with ASD. Bioinformatic and in vitro functional evaluation of the variants using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and minigene analysis supported a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism. Optical and electron microscopy of the trabeculectomy specimen from one of the CG-ASD cases revealed an abnormal anterior chamber angle, with altered extracellular matrix, and apoptotic trabecular meshwork cells. The CPAMD8 protein was immunodetected in adult human ocular fluids and anterior segment tissues involved in glaucoma and ASD (i.e., aqueous humor, non-pigmented ciliary epithelium, and iris muscles), as well as in periocular mesenchyme-like cells of zebrafish embryos. CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of this gene in F0 zebrafish embryos (96 hpf) resulted in varying degrees of gross developmental abnormalities, including microphthalmia, pharyngeal maldevelopment, and pericardial and periocular edemas. Optical and electron microscopy examination of these embryos showed iridocorneal angle hypoplasia (characterized by altered iris stroma cells, reduced anterior chamber, and collagen disorganized corneal stroma extracellular matrix), recapitulating some patients' features. Our data support the notion that CPAMD8 loss-of-function underlies a spectrum of recessive CG-ASD phenotypes associated with extracellular matrix disorganization and provide new insights into the normal and disease roles of this gene.","dc:creator":"Bonet-Fernández JM","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"CPAMD8 loss-of-function underlies non-dominant congenital glaucoma with variable anterior segment dysgenesis and abnormal extracellular matrix."}},{"id":"cggv:c34ea0b3-13f3-4b36-bd4a-330f1b7ba282_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6830eb4e-6af3-4a3f-9940-ffec6a918015"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32274568"}],"rdfs:label":"JG-ASD-33"},{"id":"cggv:c34ea0b3-13f3-4b36-bd4a-330f1b7ba282","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c34ea0b3-13f3-4b36-bd4a-330f1b7ba282_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Compound heterozygous for NM_015692.4:c.2807C>T (p.Pro936Leu) and NM_015692.4:c.3991G>T (p.Ala1331Ser).

The gene maps to chromosome 19p13.2-p13.3 and spans approximately 130 kb. The gene partially overlaps with the protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR4) gene in the reverse orientation. The cDNA consists of 40 exons ( approximately 6 kb) and encodes a protein of 1885 amino acids. Similar to other proteins in this family, CPAMD8 contains a signal sequence, an RXXR processing site, and a thioester motif. In addition, CPAMD8 has a Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor/follistatin-like domain at the C-terminus. The intact CPAMD8 protein generated by in vitro transcription and translation resolved as a single band of about 200 kDa on SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR and immunoblot assays showed that CPAMD8 is expressed in a number of human tissues, most abundantly in the kidney, brain, and testis and at lower levels in heart, liver, and small intestine. CPAMD8 is also expressed in several types of cells in culture, in which it is proteolytically processed into two chains of about 70 and 130 kDa. The Kazal domain of CPAMD8 binds to heparin, and subcellular fractionation shows that CPAMD8 is membrane associated via ionic interaction. In response to immune stimulants, CPAMD8 expression is markedly up-regulated in cells in culture. Thus, CPAMD8 may, like other members of the C3/alpha(2)M family, function in innate immunity but in a localized manner.","dc:creator":"Li ZF","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Identification and characterization of CPAMD8, a novel member of the complement 3/alpha2-macroglobulin family with a C-terminal Kazal domain."},"rdfs:label":"Li Expression Experiment"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This paper studied expression of CPAMD8 in various human tissues.

The exon 23 deletion (c.2794_­­­­2845del) variant is reported in proband CG-ASD-ANI-0066 (PMID:32274568) was not scored in the GCI as the exact breakpoints are unknown; however the variant likely causes a frameshift and warrants 1.5 points. One large duplication spanning exons 8 to 13 reported in (PMID: 32085876).WaS too large to register in the ClinGen Allele Registry and; therefore, could not be scored in the GCI, but warrants 1.5 points. More evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 29556725), but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. \nSummary of Experimental Evidence: This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and expression studies (32274568, 27839872, 28683140). The expression study (PMID: 27839872) showed *CPAMD8* detected in the developing human lens and retina at week 9 of gestation into the second trimester. *CPAMD8* was also detected in the iris and cornea at week 22 of gestation. Zebrafish embryos replicated the corneal thickening and abnormal collagen deposition that were found in probands (PMID: 32274568). *CPAMD8* was detected in the epithelium of the ciliary body in fetal and adult cattle (PMID:28683140). In summary, *CPAMD8* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive anterior segment dysgenesis 8. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bc4d2b2a-08d6-4869-a56e-55721fd4c9dc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
