To explore the potential role of the RGS9 gene in human retinal disease, we determined its exon/intron arrangement, and investigated its expression in human retina. The results show that the gene, located on 17q24, consists of 19 exons and spans more than 75kb of genomic DNA. The entire gene was found to be contained on a single BAC clone with an insert size of 170kb. The major transcripts of the gene are alternatively spliced into a 9.5kb retina-specific transcript (RGS9-1) and a brain specific 2.5kb transcript (RGS9-2). Exons 1-16 are constitutive and present in both variants. Exon 17 contains the 3' end of the open reading frame and the 3'-UTR of the RGS9-1 variant. In RGS9-2, exon 17 is alternatively spliced and joined to exons 18 and 19 that are not present in the retina variant. Immunolocalization with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the retina and brain variants shows abundant expression in photoreceptors and possibly very low levels in cell types of the inner retina. Owing to the specific expression of RGS9-1 in photoreceptors the RGS9 gene is a candidate gene for RP17, a form of autosomal retinitis pigmentosa, located on the long arm of chromosome 17.","dc:creator":"Zhang K","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Structure, alternative splicing, and expression of the human RGS9 gene."},"rdfs:label":"Western Blot"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:793d94d2-3941-45bb-a824-8256a2bc86c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ea413a6-0cdb-40dc-9549-98a40aa14fb0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Monoclonal antibody raised against bacterially expressed RGS9 was used in immunostaining which was specific for retina and brain isoforms.

It is now well established that the GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) RGS9-1 plays an important role in determining the recovery kinetics of photoresponses. RGS9-1 has been found to be anchored to photoreceptor disk membranes by a novel photoreceptor protein, R9AP. R9AP has a single transmembrane domain at its C-terminal region. Membrane tethering by R9AP enhances RGS9-1 GAP activity in vitro and has been hypothesized to be important for the regulation of RGS9-1 function in vivo. In addition, R9AP shows structural similarity to the SNARE complex protein syntaxin and has been shown to be required for the correct targeting and localization of the RGS9-1 protein in photoreceptors. Therefore, R9AP may have additional functions other than that in the phototransduction pathway. This article presents methods and protocols developed for the functional characterization of R9AP in phototransduction, including the immunoprecipitation of the endogenous protein, the expression and purification of recombinant proteins, the reconstitution of proteoliposomes, and assays for its interaction with RGS9-1 and its effects on RGS9-1 GAP activity.

Regulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) proteins accelerate hydrolysis of GTP by the alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins in vitro. Several retinal RGS proteins can act in vitro as GTPase accelerating proteins (GAP) for Galphat. Recent reconstitution experiments indicate that one of these, RGS9-1, may account for much of the Galphat GAP activity in rod outer segments (ROS). Here we report that ROS membranes from mice lacking RGS9-1 hydrolyse GTP more slowly than ROS membranes from control mice. The Gbeta5-L protein that forms a complex with RGS9-1 was absent from RGS9-/- retinas, although Gbeta5-L messenger RNA was still present. The flash responses of RGS9-/- rods rose normally, but recovered much more slowly than normal.

Bradyopsia was reported to be characterized by difficulty in adjusting to changes in luminance, difficulty in seeing moving objects, and normal to subnormal visual acuity. Routine electroretinograms showed normal responses to scotopic stimulus flashes but responses to standard high-density flashes were strikingly reduced in amplitude. At least 03 patients were evaluated for neurologic features and were found to be normal. Color vision was normal in all patients while fundus appeared normal in most of the cases except slight pigment alterations in the maculae of one patient. The ophthalmic clinical features in patients were found to be non-progressive (PMIDs: 17826834, 19818506).  \nBy far, one missense and one nonsense variant have been reported in 05 human subjects (PMIDs: 14702087, 19818506). Four (2 siblings and 2 unrelated) Dutch patients were found to be homozygous for p.Trp299Arg variant while their unaffected parents were heterozygous for this variant. One British male was compound heterozygous for p.Trp299Arg and p.Arg128Ter (PMID: 19818506). \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies and in vitro assays (PMIDs: 10676965, 25257059, 10564809, 14702087). It was reported in an expression study that there are two protein isoforms of RGS9, a retina specific RGS9-1, and a brain specific RGS9-2. The reported variants seem to affect both isoforms of RGS9 however no neurological features were reported in any patients. \n A single-turn over transducin GTPase assay demonstrated that activity of transducin protein is reduced with the use of mutant RGS9 domains as compared to the wild type RGS9. Furthermore, in a RGS9 knock out study, the null mice showed slow recovery of photoresponse on electroretinogram as compared to the control mice (PMID: 10676965). In another RGS9 knockout study, the null mice showed delayed pupillary reflex as well as photophobia (PMID: 25257059). Both mouse knockout studies seem to recapitulate the phenotype observed in human subjects. In a co-immunoprecipitation study RGS9 was identified in a heterotetrameric complex containing RGS9-1, G5L, G_Beta5L and R9AP (RGS9BP), R9AP interacts with the N-terminal domain of RGS9-1. Mutations in R9AP has been reported to cause autosomal recessive Bradyopsia (PMIDs: 14702087, 19818506). \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between RGS9 and autosomal recessive Bradyopsia. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on September 8th, 2021.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f90aa6cd-9e08-4fab-b6c3-570beb8232dd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
