A single locus associated with HPT-JT (HRPT2) was previously mapped to chromosomal region 1q25-q32. We refined this region to a critical interval of 12 cM by genotyping in 26 affected kindreds. Using a positional candidate approach, we identified thirteen different heterozygous, germline, inactivating mutations in a single gene in fourteen families with HPT-JT. The proposed role of HRPT2 as a tumor suppressor was supported by mutation screening in 48 parathyroid adenomas with cystic features, which identified three somatic inactivating mutations, all located in exon 1. None of these mutations were detected in normal controls, and all were predicted to cause deficient or impaired protein function. HRPT2 is a ubiquitously expressed, evolutionarily conserved gene encoding a predicted protein of 531 amino acids, for which we propose the name parafibromin. Our findings suggest that HRPT2 is a tumor-suppressor gene, the inactivation of which is directly involved in predisposition to HPT-JT and in development of some sporadic parathyroid tumors.","dc:creator":"Carpten JD","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"HRPT2, encoding parafibromin, is mutated in hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12434154","rdfs:label":"kindred-05"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"A M1I heterozygous germline mutation in the CDC73 gene resulting from a 3G-A transition in exon 1.

Commonly there is a long lag time between diagnosis and clinical evidence of malignant behavior even in histopathologically straightforward lesions. There is therefore a need for a novel adjunctive marker to assist in the diagnosis of carcinoma. Parafibromin is the protein encoded by the putative tumor suppressor gene HRPT2. Mutations predicted to inactivate parafibromin were first detected in the germline of patients with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome. Subsequently, somatic mutations have been identified in the majority of sporadic carcinomas. We performed immunohistochemistry for parafibromin on 115 parathyroid tissues comprising 4 HPT-JT-related tumors (3 adenomas and 1 carcinoma), 11 sporadic parathyroid carcinomas, 79 sporadic adenomas, 3 multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A-related adenomas, 2 sporadic primary hyperplasias, 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)-1-related hyperplasias, 6 secondary hyperplasias, 4 tertiary hyperplasias, and 4 normal parathyroid glands.

HPT-JT is caused by mutations of the cell division cycle 73 (CDC73) gene, located on chromosome 1q31.2 and encodes a 531 amino acid protein, parafibromin. To facilitate in vivo studies of Cdc73 in tumourigenesis we generated conventional (Cdc73+/-) and conditional parathyroid-specific (Cdc73+/L/PTH-Cre and Cdc73L/L/PTH-Cre) mouse models. Mice were aged to 18-21 months and studied for survival, tumour development and proliferation, and serum biochemistry, and compared to age-matched wild-type (Cdc73+/+ and Cdc73+/+/PTH-Cre) littermates. Survival of Cdc73+/- mice, when compared to Cdc73+/+ mice was reduced (Cdc73+/-=80%; Cdc73+/+=90% at 18 months of age, P<0.05). Cdc73+/-, Cdc73+/L/PTH-Cre and Cdc73L/L/PTH-Cre mice developed parathyroid tumours, which had nuclear pleomorphism, fibrous septation and increased galectin-3 expression, consistent with atypical parathyroid adenomas, from 9 months of age. Parathyroid tumours in Cdc73+/-, Cdc73+/L/PTH-Cre and Cdc73L/L/PTH-Cre mice had significantly increased proliferation, with rates >fourfold higher than that in parathyroid glands of wild-type littermates (P<0.0001). Cdc73+/-, Cdc73+/L/PTH-Cre and Cdc73L/L/PTH-Cre mice had higher mean serum calcium concentrations than wild-type littermates, and Cdc73+/- mice also had increased mean serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. Parathyroid tumour development, and elevations in serum calcium and PTH, were similar in males and females. Cdc73+/- mice did not develop bone or renal tumours but female Cdc73+/- mice, at 18 months of age, had uterine neoplasms comprising squamous metaplasia, adenofibroma and adenomyoma. Uterine neoplasms, myometria and jaw bones of Cdc73+/- mice had increased proliferation rates that were 2-fold higher than in Cdc73+/+ mice (P<0.05). Thus, our studies, which have established mouse models for parathyroid tumours and uterine neoplasms that develop in the HPT-JT syndrome, provide in vivo models for future studies of these tumours.","dc:creator":"Walls GV","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mice deleted for cell division cycle 73 gene develop parathyroid and uterine tumours: model for the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"CDC73 deficient mice develop parathyroid and uterine tumours"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Increase points because (1) both conventional (Cdc73+/−) and conditional (Cdc73+/L/PTH-Cre and Cdc73L/L/PTH-Cre) knockout mice develop parathyroid tumours, (2) comprehensive comparison between phenotypes in mice and HPT-JT patients are described (Table 1 and in discussion)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":298,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:628f4a28-46d4-47e5-b023-4a27d2fafe58","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007768","gene":"hgnc:16783","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"There is abundant published evidence associating the CDC73 gene with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Carpten et al. (2002). Multiple case level studies have been performed with HPT-JT patients that have variants in the CDC73 gene. Loss of nuclear expression and immunoreactivity of Parafibromin was reported in Parathyroid Carcinoma of HPT-JT patients. Functional characterization of three mutations from CDC73 patients  caused cell overgrowth in cell proliferation assay. CDC73 deficient mice (Both Cdc73+/− mice and the conditional Cdc73+/L/PTH- Cre and Cdc73L/L/PTH-Cre mice) develop parathyroid and uterine tumours. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the CDC73 gene and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a5bd498b-dc86-4f2d-a51b-48baf7017a02"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
