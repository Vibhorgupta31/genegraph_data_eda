We newly characterized three novel mutations in 2 Japanese patients with MTP deficiency, and investigated the clinical and molecular aspects of 5 Japanese patients including 3 previously reported cases. Herein, we describe the characterization of four missense mutations, R214C, H346R, R411K, and V422G, in the HADHB gene, which have been identified in Japanese patients, employing a newly developed, sensitive transient expression analysis. Co-transfection of wild-type HADHA and HADHB cDNAs in SV40-transfected fibroblasts from a MTP-deficient patient yielded sufficient enzyme activity to evaluate low-level residual enzyme activity, using two incubation temperatures of 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, residual enzyme activity was higher than that at 37 degrees C in V422G, R214C, and R411K. However, H346R, which was seen in the most severe case, showed no enzyme activity at both temperatures. Our results demonstrate that a defect of HADHB in MTP deficiency is rather common in Japanese patients, and the mutational spectrum is heterogeneous. The present findings showed that all missense mutations in this study were disease-causing. Although the number of patients is still limited, it is suggested that the phenotype is correlated with the genotype and a combination of two mutant alleles of the HADHB gene in MTP deficiency.","dc:creator":"Purevsuren J","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular aspects of Japanese patients with mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19699128","rdfs:label":"Purevsuren et al, Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"NM_000183.2:c.1136A>G, NP_000174.1:p.His379Arg (missense)\nNM_000183.2:c.442+614A>G"},{"id":"cggv:dc8ec70b-4e98-437c-86b1-8a33dd70a81b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c14753c-f7fd-47f4-b97c-c50da406bb82","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"The entire coding regions of human cDNAs for alpha and\n beta subunits were amplified with the use of oligonucleotide\nprimers corresponding to 5'- and 3'-flanking\nsequences adjacent to the coding regions.

Studies on defects in this enzyme in patients with TP deficiency suggest that there are two types of defect. Patients in group 1 have normal amount of cross-reacting material by immunoblot and lack only long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Patients in group 2 have a trace amount of cross-reacting material, with all three activities being low. We identified three patients in group 2, and analysis was made at the cDNA level. In patient 2, there was a heterozygous 71-bp deletion at position 110-180 in the alpha-subunit. In patients 1 and 3, there was an abnormal beta-subunit; patient 1 had an A-788-to-G substitution, and patient 3 had G-182-to-A and G-740-to-A substitutions in each of separate alleles. This is the first demonstration of disease-causing mutations in the beta-subunit. cDNA-expression experiments in patients' fibroblasts, using a vaccinia virus system, and gel filtration analysis, using patients' fibroblasts, revealed that the existence of both normal alpha- and beta-subunits, and possibly their association, are important for stabilizing TP and that A-788-to-G substitution on the beta-subunit in patient 1 seems to interfere with the association, the result being a rapid decomposition of TP.","dc:creator":"Ushikubo S","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Molecular characterization of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency: formation of the enzyme complex is important for stabilization of both alpha- and beta-subunits."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8651282","rdfs:label":"Ushikubo et al, Patient 3 with MTP deficiency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Immunoblot analysis demonstrated the lack of beta subunit and the functional studies suggest reduced enzyme activity."},{"id":"cggv:cba4349c-590a-4d6e-8b38-a26e6cca08c0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3321e858-b2d2-4693-8e94-db5b7b71c92f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"DNA isolated from whole blood or isolated fibroblasts.

It is composed of four alpha-subunits (HADHA) harboring long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) and four beta-subunits (HADHB) harboring long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (LKAT). Mutations in either subunit can result in TFP deficiency with reduced activity of all three TFP enzymes. We characterize 15 patients from 13 families with beta-subunit mutations by clinical, biochemical, and molecular features. Three clinical phenotypes are apparent: a severe neonatal presentation with cardiomyopathy, Reye-like symptoms, and early death (n=4); a hepatic form with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycemia (n=2); and a milder later-onset neuromyopathic phenotype with episodic myoglobinuria (n=9). Maternal HELLP syndrome occurred in two mothers independently of the fetal phenotype. Mutational analysis revealed 16 different mutations, the majority being missense mutations (n=12). The predominance of missense mutations and the milder myopathic phenotype are consistent. Based upon homology to yeast thiolase that has been characterized structurally, the mutation localization within the protein correlates with the clinical phenotype. Outer loop mutations that are expected to alter protein stability less were only present in milder forms. The degree of reduction in thiolase antigen also correlated with the severity of clinical presentation. Although TFP deficiency is highly heterogeneous, there is genotype-phenotype correlation.","dc:creator":"Spiekerkoetter U","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity in mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency due to beta-subunit mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12754706","rdfs:label":"Spiekerkoetter et al, Patient 5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"NM_000183.2:c.693del; NP_000174.1:p.Ala232LeufsTer20 (predicted null variant)\nNM_000183.2:c.881C>G; NP_000174.1:p.Pro294Arg (missense variant)"},{"id":"cggv:d595616a-fe12-4660-9e37-22de7b2b708e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e313a72b-46d3-4566-aa54-780f4b0903bb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"DNA isolated from whole blood or isolated fibroblasts.

Whole genome homozygosity mapping with 262 SNP markers mapped the disease gene to chromosome 5 where candidate genes Hadha and Hadhb, encoding the mitochondria trifunctional protein (MTP) alpha- and beta-subunits, respectively, are located. Direct sequencing revealed a normal alpha-subunit, but detected a nucleotide T-to-A transversion in exon 14 (c.1210T>A) of beta-subunit (Hadhb) which resulted in a missense mutation of methionine to lysine (M404K). Western blot analysis showed a significant reduction of both the alpha- and beta-subunits, consistent with reduced enzyme activity in both the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and the long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activities. These mice had a decreased weight gain and cardiac arrhythmias which manifested from a prolonged PR interval to a complete atrio-ventricular dissociation, and died suddenly between 9 and 16 months of age. Histopathological studies showed multifocal cardiac fibrosis and hepatic steatosis. This mouse model will be useful to further investigate the mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis relating to lipotoxic cardiomyopathy and to investigate pathophysiology and treatment strategies for human MTP deficiency.","dc:creator":"Kao HJ","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"ENU mutagenesis identifies mice with cardiac fibrosis and hepatic steatosis caused by a mutation in the mitochondrial trifunctional protein beta-subunit."},"rdfs:label":"Mutagenesis analysis, expression, mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Partly recapitulates human MTP deficiency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":641,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:934754ef-076c-460d-b35e-65bf54d8e798","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012172","gene":"hgnc:4803","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"\nReplicated overtime","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:65cb0124-8476-422c-924f-15fac7c95592"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
