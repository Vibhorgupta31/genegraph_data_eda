Deficiency of *CSF2RB* results in alveolar macrophage dysfunction, which leads to impaired clearance and accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles. This accumulation results in *CSF2RB*-related surfactant metabolism dysfunction, or pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, with various characteristics including ground-glass opacities with interlobular or intralobular septal thickening, resulting in a “crazy-paving” pattern on radiograph, enlarged foamy alveolar macrophages, dyspnea, and respiratory failure (Tanaka T, et al., PMID: 21075760). The age of onset for those presenting with isolated interstitial lung disease ranges from childhood to adulthood. \n\nFour variants (2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 1 missense) that have been reported in 4 probands across 4 publications (PMIDs: 21075760, 21205713, 38259275, 38111540) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies showing reduced or absent expression of beta chain (*CSF2RB*) in patients with PAP (PMID: 9410898), biochemical function assays demonstrating the role of signaling pathways in surfactant clearance (PMID: 21075760), animal models that recapitulate the human phenotype and a rescue of that phenotype with pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMID: 25274301). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CSF2RB* and autosomal recessive *CSF2RB*-related surfactant metabolism dysfunction. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
