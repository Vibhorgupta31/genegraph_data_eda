We have now investigated whether the androgen receptor gene on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome is a candidate gene for this disease. In patient samples we found androgen receptor gene mutations with increased size of a polymorphic tandem CAG repeat in the coding region. These amplified repeats were absolutely associated with the disease, being present in 35 unrelated patients and none of 75 controls. They segregated with the disease in 15 families, with no recombination in 61 meioses (the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod score) is 13.2 at a recombination rate of 0). The association is unlikely to be due to linkage disequilibrium, because 11 different disease alleles were observed. We conclude that enlargement of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene is probably the cause of this disorder.","dc:creator":"La Spada AR","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Androgen receptor gene mutations in X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a05eab29-c7e9-4b2a-9378-ac384962b69c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a05eab29-c7e9-4b2a-9378-ac384962b69c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ed7fde5-c6db-47ec-9e9f-e0279a221107","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e93bb09-ae3e-4211-bca5-2c1b632161ff","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"from Human Protein Atlas","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309898","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Global classification of the human proteins with regards to spatial expression patterns across organs and tissues is important for studies of human biology and disease.

We immunohistochemically examined 11 SBMA patients at autopsy with 1C2, an antibody that specifically recognizes expanded polyQ. Our study demonstrated that diffuse nuclear accumulation of mutant AR was far more frequent and extensive than NIs being distributed in a wide array of CNS nuclei, and in more visceral organs than thus far believed. Mutant AR accumulation was also present in the cytoplasm, particularly in the Golgi apparatus; nuclear or cytoplasmic predominance of accumulation was tissue specific. Furthermore, the extent of diffuse nuclear accumulation of mutant AR in motor and sensory neurons of the spinal cord was closely related to CAG repeat length.

In SBMA, the nucleus is further implicated by the critical role for disease of androgens, which promote the nuclear translocation of the mutant androgen receptor (AR). To clarify the importance of the nucleus in SBMA, we genetically manipulated the nuclear localization signal of the polyglutamine-expanded AR. Transgenic mice expressing this mutant AR displayed inefficient nuclear translocation and substantially improved motor function compared with SBMA mice. While we found that nuclear localization of polyglutamine-expanded AR is required for SBMA, we also discovered, using cell models of SBMA, that it is insufficient for both aggregation and toxicity and requires androgens for these disease features. Through our studies of cultured motor neurons, we further found that the autophagic pathway was able to degrade cytoplasmically retained expanded AR and represents an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism. Moreover, pharmacologic induction of autophagy rescued motor neurons from the toxic effects of even nuclear-residing mutant AR, suggesting a therapeutic role for autophagy in this nucleus-centric disease. Thus, our studies firmly establish that polyglutamine-expanded AR must reside within nuclei in the presence of its ligand to cause SBMA. They also highlight a mechanistic basis for the requirement for nuclear localization in SBMA neurotoxicity, namely the lack of mutant AR removal by the autophagic protein degradation pathway.","dc:creator":"Montie HL","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Cytoplasmic retention of polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor ameliorates disease via autophagy in a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy."},"rdfs:label":"transgenic mice with AR lacking nuclear localization signal"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"only partial rescue was observed"},{"id":"cggv:f860f2e9-ebd3-431c-bfd8-dce8d63e1a8b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8bb906c-6eb5-496c-88fe-3595fafa8fe4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Muscle weakness","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15003169","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the Kennedy disease (OMIM:313200) entity has been split from the following disease entities: hypospadias 1, X-linked (OMIM:300633), androgen insensitivity, partial, with or without breast cancer (OMIM:312300), androgen insensitivity (OMIM:300068), and prostate cancer, susceptibility to (OMIM:176807). \nOne variant (trinucleotide repeat expansion) that has been reported in 15 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 2062380, 1303195, 15659427, 25047668, 28877561, 37058074) is included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature. The mechanism of pathogenicity is currently unknown; hypotheses with experimental support include disruption of AR's function as a transcription factor, altered interactions between AR protein and its coactivators and corepressors, and formation of nulear inclusions by peptides after proteolytic processing of AR. The gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in non-human model organisms (PMIDs: 15003169, 24309898, 19279159, 15659427, 9708548, 12372280). \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between AR and X-linked Kennedy disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spectrum Disorders GCEP on the meeting date August 8, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a05eab29-c7e9-4b2a-9378-ac384962b69c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
