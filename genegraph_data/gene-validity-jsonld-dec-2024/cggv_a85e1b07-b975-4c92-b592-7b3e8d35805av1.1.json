This defect leads to glycine accumulation in body tissues, including the brain, and causes various neurological symptoms such as encephalopathy, hypotonia, apnea, intractable seizures and possible death. We screened 14 patients from 13 families with clinical and biochemical features suggestive of GCE for mutation in AMT, GLDC and GCSH genes by direct sequencing and genomic rearrangement of GLDC gene using a multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification. We identified mutations in all 14 patients. Seven patients (50%) have biallelic mutations in GLDC gene, six patients (43%) have biallelic mutations in AMT gene and one patient (7%) has mutation identified in only one allele in GLDC gene.

The studies presented in this communication indicate that the amino group of glycine is retained in the intermediate and released as ammonia in the second partial reaction catalyzed by T-protein. The formation of ammonia accompanies the stoichiometric formation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate from the methylene carbon of glycine and tetrahydrofolate. Kinetic studies show that the reaction proceeds through a sequential mechanism. Km values for the intermediate complex and tetrahydrofolate are 2.2 and 50 microM, respectively. In the absence of tetrahydrofolate, T-protein catalyzes the stoichiometric formation of ammonia and formaldehyde from the intermediate although the velocity is extremely low. Km value for the intermediate complex in the absence of tetrahydrofolate is 10.3 microM, about 4-fold higher than the value in the presence of tetrahydrofolate. The addition of tetrahydrofolate increased the rate about 2400-fold. The modification of the free lipoyl sulfhydryl group with N-ethylmaleimide caused the intermediate complex inactive. The lipoyl sulfhydryl group seems to be essential for both P-protein- and T-protein-catalyzed partial reactions.","dc:creator":"Fujiwara K","dc:date":"1984","dc:title":"Mechanism of the glycine cleavage reaction.

This reaction occurs in the presence of an accessory protein, GCS H-protein (GCSH) to which the aminomethyl moiety is transferred. The subsequent action of aminomethyltransferase (AMT) transfers the second one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate (THF), generating 5,10-methylene THF (for a review, see Kilkuchi et al, 2008, PMID 18941301).

The reaction exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both substrates. The optimum pH for the reaction is 7.1, with 6.5 for the reverse reaction. Km values for glycine and H-protein are independent of the concentration of the the co-substrate, and calculated values are 5.8 mM for glycine and 3.4 microM for H-protein. Initial velocity experiments gave intersecting double reciprocal plots that conform to a sequential mechanism. Product inhibition studies revealed that both products inhibited competitively with respect to the varied substrate. Glycine methyl ester was found to be a competitive inhibitor of glycine and noncompetitive inhibitor of H-protein. H-protein whose lipoic acid prosthetic group and cysteinyl residues were modified with N-ethylmaleimide was a noncompetitive inhibitor of glycine and a competitive inhibitor of H-protein. These results are most consistent with a sequential random Bi Bi mechanism in which no abortive dead end complex is formed.

Variants in AMT, which encodes the T-protein (aminomethyltransferase) of the glycine cleavage system, were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1994 (Nanao et al, PMID 8005589). Variants in AMT have been reported in over 100 cases of glycine encephalopathy (non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, NKH) and include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants. Variants in this gene have been reported in about 15-20% of probands with glycine encephalopathy; about 80% of patients have variants in GLDC which encodes the P-protein of the glycine cleavage system (Coughlin et al, 2017, PMID 27362913). Eleven patients with 15 unique variants in AMT are included here (Nanao et al, 1994, PMID 8005589; Azize et al, 2014, PMID 25231368; Swanson et al, 2015, PMID 26179960; Belcastro et al, 2016, PMID 26371980; Gencpinar et al, 2016, PMID 27164344). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Various recurrent variants have been reported, including p.Arg320His (Coughlin et al, 2017, PMID 27362913). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of the T protein (aminomethyltransferase) in the glycine cleavage system (Fujiwara and Motokara, 1983, PMID 6863283; Kilkuchi et al, 2008, PMID 18941301), and the knowledge that GLDC, encoding the P-protein of the glycine cleavage system, is definitely associated with glycine encephalopathy. In summary, AMT is definitively associated with autosomal recessive glycine encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy GCEP on May 24th, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a85e1b07-b975-4c92-b592-7b3e8d35805a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
