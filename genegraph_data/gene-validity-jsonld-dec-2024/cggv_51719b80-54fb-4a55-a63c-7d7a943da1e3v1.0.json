In this work, we used candidate gene and whole-exome sequencing to investigate the molecular basis of ARA in 6 patients from 4 consanguineous North-African families. Sanger sequencing of candidate genes encoding the pre-BCR components (ΙGΗΜ, CD79A, CD79B, IGLL1, and VPREB1) was initially performed and determined the genetic defect in five patients. Two novel mutations in IGHM (p.Val378Alafs*1 and p.Ile184Serfs*21) were identified in three patients from two unrelated kindred and a novel nonsense mutation was identified in CD79A (p.Trp66*) in two siblings from a third kindred. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the sixth patient who harbored a homozygous stop mutation at position 407 in the RAG2 gene (p.Glu407*). We concluded that conventional gene sequencing, especially when multiple genes are involved in the defect as is the case in ARA, is costly and time-consuming, resulting in delayed diagnosis that contributes to increased morbidity and mortality.

To determine the proportion of affected patients who have defects in the micro heavy chain (IGHM) gene, we used single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis to screen genomic DNA from 40 unrelated patients with early onset infections, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, and absent B cells. All of the patients were genotypically normal in BTK, the gene that underlies X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Eight different mutations in the micro heavy chain were identified in 19 members of 12 unrelated families. Four of the mutations were large deletions that removed more than 40 kb of DNA in the IGHM locus. In six of the 12 families, the affected patients had an identical single base pair substitution, a G-->A, at the -1 position of the alternative splice site. Immunoglobulin haplotype analysis showed that this mutation occurred on at least three different haplotypes, indicating that this is a hot spot for mutations. Compared with patients with mutations in Btk, patients with defects in the micro heavy chain had an earlier onset of disease and more complications. Our study indicates that at least 20-30% of patients with autosomal recessive defects in B cell development have mutations in the micro heavy chain.","dc:creator":"Lopez Granados E","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular analysis of patients with defects in micro heavy chain gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12370281","rdfs:label":"F6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The homozygous frameshift variant Lys169ArgfsTer? occurs in exon 2 and is predicted to result in NMD."},{"id":"cggv:53533ac6-b215-4cfa-b4fc-bbfbcb1ad004_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f4628f5a-4d01-40f2-98dd-5c4f7112fbb7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing of all exons ","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"17 mg.dl IgG, <6.5 mg.dl IgA, 1 mg.dl IgM, <1 % B cells","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0004432","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"No mutations in BTK, IGLL1, VpreB1, mb-1 or B29.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:53533ac6-b215-4cfa-b4fc-bbfbcb1ad004_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:da64a126-4714-4800-b7fa-51ee55f42267","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000014.9:g.105854568_105854572delinsCCG (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139771677"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17410177"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17410177","rdfs:label":"P17"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The homozygous indel causes the frameshift Val378AlafsTer7 (reported as residue 377) in exon 4 of 6 and is predicted to result in NMD. mRNA of both the secreted and membrane isoforms was present in patient samples at reduced levels."},{"id":"cggv:8ded0959-00ba-4f18-8201-2a65e7bdb370_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f05ce14e-a15f-4f3d-8e39-c083e02534bc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was PCR amplified encompassing exons and exon-intron boundaries before Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004432","obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0001873","obo:HP_0000979","obo:HP_0001369","obo:HP_0002014","obo:HP_0001508"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Sanger sequencing of candidate genes encoding the pre-BCR components (ΙGΗΜ, CD79A, CD79B, IGLL1, and VPREB1).","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:8ded0959-00ba-4f18-8201-2a65e7bdb370_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5fccf983-f708-4d0c-8904-92b3e787722b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000014.9:g.105854565_105854572delinsTCAGG (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139771390"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31696364"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31696364","rdfs:label":"P1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The homozygous frameshift variant Val378AlafsTer2 in exon 4 of 6 is predicted to result in NMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2935,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4b2f80ce-3b30-45e7-8ed0-2540f6853755","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020729","gene":"hgnc:5541","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":" IGHM was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia 1 in 1996 (Yel L, et al., 1996, PMID: 8890099). IGHM encodes Igμ, which is part of the pre-B-cell antigen receptor complex, that promotes the generation and expansion of a population of large pre-B cells. Agammaglobulinemia 1 is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by profoundly low or absent serum immunoglobulins and low or absent circulating B-cells due to an early block of B-cell development. Affected individuals are susceptible to recurrent infections. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. The mechanism of disease is homozygous loss of function and at least 20 unique variants have been reported in humans, including nonsense, frameshift, and splicing as well as large deletions. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 8890099, 26910880, 31696364, 12370281, 17410177), and segregated with disease in four additional family members. Additional evidence is available in the literature but the maximum of 12pt for genetic evidence has been reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its role in B cell development (PMID: 24378843), which is altered in patient cells (PMID: 11560957). In summary IGHM is definitively associated with autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
