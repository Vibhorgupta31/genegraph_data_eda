We have identified five further ethnically diverse families cosegregating CRD and AI. Phenotypic characterization of teeth and visual function in the published and new families reveals a consistent syndrome in all seven families, and all link or are consistent with linkage to 2q11, confirming the existence of a genetically homogenous condition that we now propose to call Jalili syndrome. Using a positional-candidate approach, we have identified mutations in the CNNM4 gene, encoding a putative metal transporter, accounting for the condition in all seven families. Nine mutations are described in all, three missense, three terminations, two large deletions, and a single base insertion. We confirmed expression of Cnnm4 in the neural retina and in ameloblasts in the developing tooth, suggesting a hitherto unknown connection between tooth biomineralization and retinal function. The identification of CNNM4 as the causative gene for Jalili syndrome, characterized by syndromic CRD with AI, has the potential to provide new insights into the roles of metal transport in visual function and biomineralization.","dc:creator":"Parry DA","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in CNNM4 cause Jalili syndrome, consisting of autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy and amelogenesis imperfecta."}},"rdfs:label":"Scotland_III:1"},{"id":"cggv:8ad8bbe7-2703-42f9-a070-fd8e0508657c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ad8bbe7-2703-42f9-a070-fd8e0508657c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6215afc3-60a6-47a9-9d7f-db104b6803ba_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6215afc3-60a6-47a9-9d7f-db104b6803ba","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"cggv:bbf28fb6-1817-490a-8f92-9f24e4bd8600","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020184.4(CNNM4):c.599C>A (p.Ser200Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115783"}},"detectionMethod":"Genotyping by Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 refining the region of homozygosity to a 10.6 Mb region between RS2628473 and RS1901284 (Table S5) containing 71 genes.

Using a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype analysis to fine map the locus and a gene-candidate approach, we identified homozygous mutations in the ancient conserved domain protein 4 gene (CNNM4) that either generate a truncated protein or occur in highly conserved regions of the protein.

Here, we show that CNNM4 is the basolaterally located Mg(2+) extrusion molecule. CNNM4 is strongly expressed in intestinal epithelia and localizes to their basolateral membrane. CNNM4-knockout mice showed hypomagnesemia due to the intestinal malabsorption of magnesium, suggesting its role in Mg(2+) extrusion to the inner parts of body. Imaging analyses revealed that CNNM4 can extrude Mg(2+) by exchanging intracellular Mg(2+) with extracellular Na(+). Furthermore, CNNM4 mutations cause Jalili syndrome, characterized by recessive amelogenesis imperfecta with cone-rod dystrophy. CNNM4-knockout mice showed defective amelogenesis, and CNNM4 again localizes to the basolateral membrane of ameloblasts, the enamel-forming epithelial cells. Missense point mutations associated with the disease abolish the Mg(2+) extrusion activity. These results demonstrate the crucial importance of Mg(2+) extrusion by CNNM4 in organismal and topical regulation of magnesium.

At least four missense variants, three nonsense variants, and one frameshift variant have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 2 publications (19200525, 19200527). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 33 additional family members.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.  This gene-disease association is supported by several lines of experimental evidence including the expression of CNNM4 in retina and incisors in mice (19200525, 19200527), enamel defects similar to AI in a mouse model (24339795), along with rescue studies in zebrafish (19200527).  In summary, CNNM4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Jalili syndrome.  This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e3cedd07-df9e-4838-8a6b-b24b2802f223"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
