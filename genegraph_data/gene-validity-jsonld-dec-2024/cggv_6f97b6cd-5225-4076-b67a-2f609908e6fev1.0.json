In its aa sequence (837 and 881 aa, calculated pIs: 9.33 and 9.38, mol wts 92,750 and 97,410 kD), it is conspicuously related to the 80-kD plakophilin 1, with which it shares a central region of 9 repeats of the arm-motif, preceeded by a long head region and followed by a very short (11 aa) carboxy-terminal sequence. Plakophilin 2 and its mRNA have been detected in a wide range of tissues and cell types, including cells devoid of desmosomes. By light and electron microscopical immunolocalization, plakophilin 2 has been localized to plaques of desmosomes of one-layered (\"simple\") and complex epithelia, carcinomas, diverse epithelium-derived cell culture lines, as well as cardiac tissue and the dendritic reticulum cells of lymphatic germinal centers, i.e., desmosomes in which plakophilin 1 is not detected. However, plakophilin 2 has also been localized in the desmosomes of certain but not all stratified epithelia where it coexists with plakophilin 1. Remarkably, plakophilin 2 is also enriched in the karyoplasm of a wide range of cell types, including many that lack desmosomes and in which, therefore, the nuclear state is the only locally enriched form of plakophilin 2 present. We conclude that plakophilins 2a and 2b are basic nuclear proteins that in certain cell types additionally assemble with other proteins to form the desmosomal plaque and serve general nuclear functions as well as a function specific to many but not all desmosomes.","dc:creator":"Mertens C","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Plakophilins 2a and 2b: constitutive proteins of dual location in the karyoplasm and the desmosomal plaque."},"rdfs:label":"Mertens Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c3dcad87-307c-4e3b-868c-6237b677a10e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec79247f-f2e1-45e6-852c-6ee14b8922de","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"PKP2 was shown to directly interact with several desomosomal components using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analysis.

Among the three known plakophilin members, plakophilin 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in desmosome assembly and organization. However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, plakophilin 2. To better understand the cellular functions of plakophilin 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other junctional molecules using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we show that plakophilin 2 can interact directly with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. The head domain of plakophilin 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct plakophilin 2 to cell borders. In addition, plakophilin 2 is less efficient than plakophilin 1 in localizing to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess desmoplakin to cell borders in transiently transfected COS cells. Furthermore, plakophilin 2 is able to associate with beta-catenin through its head domain, and the expression of plakophilin 2 in SW480 cells up-regulates the endogenous beta-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity. This up-regulation by plakophilin 2 is abolished by ectopic expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that these proteins compete for the same pool of signaling active beta-catenin. Our results demonstrate that plakophilin 2 interacts with a broader repertoire of desmosomal components than plakophilin 1 and provide new insight into the possible roles of plakophilin 2 in regulating the signaling activity of beta-catenin.","dc:creator":"Chen X","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Protein binding and functional characterization of plakophilin 2.

To understand the pathological basis of ARVC, the authors analyzed desmosome assembly and stability in epithelial cell lines expressing mutants of plakophilin-2 found in ARVC patients. Mutant plakophilin-2 proteins were unable to disrupt established desmosomes when expressed in an E-cadherin-expressing epithelial cell model; however, they were unable to initiate de novo assembly of desmosomes in an N-cadherin-expressing epithelial cell model.

relationship between PKP2 and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using\nthe ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September, 2018. Variants in PKP2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2004 (Gerull et al., PMID: 15489853). PKP2 is the major causative gene for ARVC and accounts for 34%-74% of cases (McNAlly et al., 2005; PMID: 20301310).  There are over 250 PKP2 variants listed in ClinVar for ARVC (missense, nonsense, frameshift, complex rearrangements, etc) (Novelli et al., 2018; PMID: 30619891). This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.  Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, in vitro assays, and protein interactions. In summary, PKP2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ARVC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on October, 26, 2018 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6f97b6cd-5225-4076-b67a-2f609908e6fe"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
