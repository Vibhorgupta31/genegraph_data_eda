We used genetic linkage and whole genome sequencing to identify Spermatogenesis Associated Protein 13, SPATA13 (NM_001166271; NP_001159743, SPATA13 isoform I), also known as ASEF2 (Adenomatous polyposis coli-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2), as the causal gene for PACG in a large seven-generation white British family showing variable expression and incomplete penetrance. The 9 bp deletion, c.1432_1440del; p.478_480del was present in all affected individuals with angle-closure disease. We show ubiquitous expression of this transcript in cell lines derived from human tissues and in iris, retina, retinal pigment and ciliary epithelia, cornea and lens. We also identified eight additional mutations in SPATA13 in a cohort of 189 unrelated PACS/PAC/PACG samples. This gene encodes a 1277 residue protein which localises to the nucleus with partial co-localisation with nuclear speckles. In cells undergoing mitosis SPATA13 isoform I becomes part of the kinetochore complex co-localising with two kinetochore markers, polo like kinase 1 (PLK-1) and centrosome-associated protein E (CENP-E). The 9 bp deletion reported in this study increases the RAC1-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) activity. The increase in GEF activity was also observed in three other variants identified in this study. Taken together, our data suggest that SPATA13 is involved in the regulation of mitosis and the mutations dysregulate GEF activity affecting homeostasis in tissues where it is highly expressed, influencing PACG pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Waseem NH","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Mutations in SPATA13/ASEF2 cause primary angle closure glaucoma."},"rdfs:label":"Waseem_Expression_Experiment"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Ubiquitous expression (not just eye)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:5ef1d5a1-5a5b-425b-998d-0c6e23d3bd40_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ef1d5a1-5a5b-425b-998d-0c6e23d3bd40_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.1}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6037,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":2.1,"subject":{"id":"cggv:aaab4f69-21a2-47d1-ab11-bcef26a53b4d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0001868","gene":"hgnc:23222","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*SPATA13* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG)  in 2020 (Waseem et al., PMID: 32339198). PACG disorders include physical obstruction of the aqueous humor outflow channels, elevation of internal eye pressure, ocular hypertension, plateau iris configuration, iridocorneal angle closure, drainage angle damage, and end-organ glaucomatous damage. *SPATA13 *contains 1,339 amino acids and 14 exons, and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. There is only one disease assertion made for *SPATA13*; Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (618880).\nSummary of Genetic Evidence (2.1 points): One 9-base-pair deletion was found in all affected individuals (n=12) from one family in one publication (PMID: 32339198). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \nSummary of Experimental Evidence (0 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by an expression study (PMID: 32339198) revealing expression of SPATA13 in eye tissue including the human iris, ciliary epithelium, retinal pigment epithelium, retina and lens; however, the study also suggested a ubiquitous expression pattern of *SPATA13,* confirmed by GTex (https://gtexportal.org/home/gene/SPATA13). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5ef1d5a1-5a5b-425b-998d-0c6e23d3bd40"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
