The latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 'syndromic', or 'specific', mental retardation (MRXS) and 66 entries leading to 'nonspecific' mental retardation (MRX). For 9 of the 66 MRX entries, the causative gene has been identified. Our recent discovery of the contiguous gene deletion syndrome ATS-MR (previously known as Alport syndrome, mental retardation, midface hypoplasia, elliptocytosis, OMIM #300194), characterized by Alport syndrome (ATS) and mental retardation (MR), indicated Xq22.3 as a region containing one mental retardation gene. Comparing the extent of deletion between individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone allowed us to define a critical region for mental retardation of approximately 380 kb, containing four genes. Here we report the identification of two point mutations, one missense and one splice-site change, in the gene FACL4 in two families with nonspecific mental retardation. Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared with normal cells, indicating that both mutations are null mutations. All carrier females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a completely skewed X-inactivation, suggesting that the gene influences survival advantage.

Acsl mutant brains had a decreased abundance of C16:1 fatty acyls; restoration of Acsl expression abrogated NMJ overgrowth and the increase in BMP signaling.

The MacCer level was elevated in Acsl mutant NMJs and, along with sterol, promoted NMJ overgrowth, but was not associated with the increase in BMP signaling in the mutants.

We report here that dAcsl, the Drosophila ortholog of ACSL4 and ACSL3, inhibits synaptic growth by attenuating BMP signaling, a major growth-promoting pathway at neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses. Specifically, dAcsl mutants exhibited NMJ overgrowth that was suppressed by reducing the doses of the BMP pathway components, accompanied by increased levels of activated BMP receptor Thickveins (Tkv) and phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad), the effector of the BMP signaling at NMJ terminals. In addition, Rab11, a small GTPase involved in endosomal recycling, was mislocalized in dAcsl mutant NMJs, and the membrane association of Rab11 was reduced in dAcsl mutant brains. Consistently, the BMP receptor Tkv accumulated in early endosomes but reduced in recycling endosomes in dAcsl mutant NMJs. dAcsl was also required for the recycling of photoreceptor rhodopsin in the eyes, implying a general role for dAcsl in regulating endocytic recycling of membrane receptors.
