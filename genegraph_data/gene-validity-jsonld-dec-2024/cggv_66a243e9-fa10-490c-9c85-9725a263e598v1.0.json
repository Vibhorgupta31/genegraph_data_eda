Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"MT-TV Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Score upgraded for the shared number of genes with shared function (as per MD-GCEP guidelines)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:66a243e9-fa10-490c-9c85-9725a263e598_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c5e11c1e-053d-4390-bf55-db2b00eda806","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f14b692-fbd9-4bd8-8e9c-2c523da27399","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"This case report describes a 71-year old woman with camptocormia (upright spinal flexion), mild proximal limb weakness, gait abnormality, and fatty replacement of paraspinal muscles.

This technique evaluates normalized expression of complexes I and IV in single fibers using antibodies against NDUFB8 and COX-I, laminin to define muscle fiber boundaries, and porin to measure mitochondrial mass (Rocha et al, 2015 (PMID:26469001)). Fig. 1C shows the results of this analysis; each circle represents a single fiber, the shading represents the mitochondrial mass (Blue = very low, Red = very high), and the position on each axis corresponding to expression levels of each MRC complex in units of standard deviations. This plot shows a correlation between high mitochondrial mass and reduced expression of complexes I and IV, consistent with increased mt proliferation to compensate for loss of complex function. Further, the majority of evaluated fibers show reduced COX-I expression, suggesting defective mitochondrial translation. This finding was recapitulated using standard MRC enzyme activity assay, finding mild deficiencies of complexes I and IV (63.6% and 51.1% residual activity vs the control mean, respectively). \n\nConsistent with the quadruple imaging experiment, single fiber analysis demonstrated significantly higher levels of variant heteroplasmy in COX-deficient vs COX-positive fibers (94.3±0.76%, n=20 vs 22.17±6.49%, n=18; see Fig. 1D).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148219","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The guanine-to-adenine substitution at nucleotide 1606 (G1606A) mutation in the mitochondrial DNA transfer RNA-valine gene has been reported to cause sensorineural deafness, ataxia, myoclonus, seizures, and mental retardation.

The *MT-TV* gene encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) for valine. Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V and thus impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities.\n\n*MT-TV* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 1998 in an individual with progressive hearing and vision loss, cognitive impairment, and muscle weakness (PMID: 9450773). Other associated features have been reported over time. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TV*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TV* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MT-TV* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on April 14, 2021 (SOP v8), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-TV* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes three variants (m.1606G>A, m.1630A>G, m.1644G>A) in eight probands in six publications (PMIDs: 9450773, 12056939, 19252805, 15320572, 18314141, 24691472). Single fiber testing and cybrid analyses further supported the pathogenicity of several of these variants (PMIDs: 24691472, 9450773, 19252805). Age of onset in affected individuals ranged from childhood to adulthood. Clinical features in affected individuals included LSS, cognitive decline, fatigue, migraines, seizures, myoclonic jerks, ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria, imbalance, muscle weakness, axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, diabetes, gastrointestinal dysmotility, cataracts, retinitis pigmentosa, sensorineural hearing loss, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Brain imaging was variable and ranged from normal to findings consistent with LSS, cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, brainstem atrophy, and basal ganglia calcifications. Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers, COX-deficient fibers, and normal to decreased respiratory chain enzyme activities. Metabolic laboratory investigations revealed elevated lactate. Heteroplasmy levels in affected individuals were highest in muscle when multiple tissues were assessed (67% to homoplasmic in muscle, 70% to homoplasmic in blood, and homoplasmic in skin fibroblasts).\n\nSegregation evidence is scored as case-level data according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function and in vitro functional assays demonstrating altered mitochondrial function as a result of variants in *MT-TV* (PMIDs: 21986556, 33340416, 35148219).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MT-TV* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on on April 3, 2023.
