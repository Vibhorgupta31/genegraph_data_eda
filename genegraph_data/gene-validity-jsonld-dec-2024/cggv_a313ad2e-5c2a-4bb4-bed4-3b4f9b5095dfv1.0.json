The proband had a severe microsatellite instability (MIN) phenotype in both tumor and normal colon mucosa, and mutations in the TGFbeta-RII and APC genes in the colorectal tumor. We identified two germline mutations within the PMS2 gene: a G deletion (1221delG) in exon 11 and a four-base-pair deletion (2361delCTTC) in exon 14, both of which were inherited from the patient's unaffected parents. These results represent the first evidence that two germline frameshift mutations in PMS2, an MMR gene which is only rarely involved in HNPCC, are not pathogenic per se, but become so when occurring together in a compound heterozygote. The compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the PMS2 gene has implications for the role of protein PMS2 in the mismatch repair mechanism, as well as for the presymptomatic molecular diagnosis of at-risk family members.

A broader role for MMR deficiency in human tumorigenesis is implicated by microsatellite instability in a fraction of sporadic tumours, including gastric, endometrial and colorectal malignancies. To better define the role of individual MMR genes in cancer susceptibility and MMR functions, we have generated mice deficient for the murine homologues of the human genes MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2. Surprisingly, we find that these mice show different tumour susceptibilities, most notably, to intestinal adenomas and adenocarcinomas, and different mutational spectra.

The molecular hallmark of this syndrome is high-frequency microsatellite instability in the tumors. Rare childhood cases with homozygous or compound heterozygous DNA mismatch repair gene mutations have a described predisposition to leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors but not to gastrointestinal cancer. We have now characterized a family in which 2 children with a homozygous germline DNA mismatch repair gene mutation developed early-onset gastrointestinal cancers. The 11-year-old proband had café-au-lait macules and developed metastatic duodenal adenocarcinoma that arose in a tubulovillous adenoma. His 9-year-old sister with café-au-lait macules and axillary freckling presented with malignant colon polyps. A 6-year-old sister with café-au-lait macules, hairy nevi, and a plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue has no malignancies to date. The family history did not fulfill the Amsterdam criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, but 2 relatives in their 60s had gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, whereas the parents, who are first cousins, remain cancer free. The proband's metastatic duodenal cancer and his sister's malignant colon polyps had high-frequency microsatellite instability but had detectable MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 proteins by immunohistochemistry. Because some germline DNA mismatch repair gene deficiencies are associated with apparently intact immunohistochemical DNA mismatch repair gene expression in tumors, we proceeded to DNA sequencing, which showed that all 3 children had a germline homozygous MLH1 missense mutation (exon 18, codon 687, CGG-->TGG), whereas both parents were heterozygous for this mutation.","dc:creator":"Gallinger S","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Gastrointestinal cancers and neurofibromatosis type 1 features in children with a germline homozygous MLH1 mutation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14762794","rdfs:label":"IV-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The Arg687Trp MLH1 mutation is a three star variant reviewed by International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":417,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:9dec4293-f0f7-4de9-bda8-6aab043aac54","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010159","gene":"hgnc:7127","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"There is sufficient evidence published associating the MLH1 gene with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome - a distinct disorder from Lynch syndrome - since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Wang et al., (1999).
