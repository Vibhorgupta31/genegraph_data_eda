In this work, a new mutation in the ALG3 gene causing atypical splicing is described with characterization of expression levels and transcript stabilities of the different splice products. A silent mutation in exon 1 of the ALG3 gene (c.165C<T) resulted in a deletion in the corresponding transcripts (c.160_196del) due to the activation of a cryptic donor splice site. Expression studies revealed that negligible amounts of normal transcripts were present in the patient. The deletion in the ALG3 gene generated a premature termination codon (PTC) coding for an ALG3 protein truncated after the first N-terminal transmembranous domain (p.Val54fsX66). Nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of mRNA is a general mechanism for clearing of RNA molecules containing suitable PTCs. However, suppression of NMD using cycloheximide had no influence on ALG3 transcript levels, although the PTCs of the transcript fulfill the criteria for the initiation of NMD. The results presented in this work demonstrate that factors abrogating NMD of the ALG3 gene exists and that the ALG3 gene can serve as a valuable tool for further investigations of the regulation of NMD.","dc:creator":"Denecke J","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"An activated 5' cryptic splice site in the human ALG3 gene generates a premature termination codon insensitive to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in a new case of congenital disorder of glycosylation type Id (CDG-Id)."}},"rdfs:label":"Deneck Proband"},{"id":"cggv:5cf6578b-9236-4630-bf30-52e1fcae3137","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5cf6578b-9236-4630-bf30-52e1fcae3137_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5cf6578b-9236-4630-bf30-52e1fcae3137_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Displays aberrant splicing, truncated product, and no nonsense mediated decay.

Phenotypes commonly reported with *ALG3* variants include severe neurological involvement, craniofacial abnormalities, facial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, ophthalmologic impairment, and feeding problems. \n\nEight variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift), reported in seven probands, in six  publications (PMIDs: 33583022, 34090370, 15108280, 31067009, 32389449, 27172925) are included in this curation. The variant p.Gly55= is recurrent and has been included four times within this curation. Most probands were first identified by a CDG type I N-glycosylation defect as determined by a serum isoelectric focusing assay. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.  \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported as loss-of-function. Experimental evidence is inconclusive and has not been curated as “definitive” evidence level has been reached based on genetic evidence alone.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ALG3* and ALG3-related CDG. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 6, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1512f6a2-f64c-49d6-ab26-44cdaeef97ee"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
