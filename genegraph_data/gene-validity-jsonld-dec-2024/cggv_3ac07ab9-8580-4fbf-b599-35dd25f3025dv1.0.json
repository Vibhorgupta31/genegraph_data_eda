However, many aspects of the context-dependent expression of mt-tRNAs in mammals remain unknown. To investigate the tissue-specific effects of mt-tRNAs, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial tRNA expression across five mice tissues (brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney) using Northern blot analysis. Striking differences in the tissue-specific expression of 22 mt-tRNAs were observed, in some cases differing by as much as tenfold from lowest to highest expression levels among these five tissues. Overall, the heart exhibited the highest levels of mt-tRNAs, while the liver displayed markedly lower levels. Variations in the levels of mt-tRNAs showed significant correlations with total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents in these tissues. However, there were no significant differences observed in the 2-thiouridylation levels of tRNA","dc:creator":"He Q","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Tissue-specific expression atlas of murine mitochondrial tRNAs."},"rdfs:label":"Northern blot analysis of 22 mt-tRNAsteady-statelevels among"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"supported by 2 other papers with patient heart tissue \nMerante et al., 1996 PMID: 8889580 PCR amplification from heart tissue of all tRNA genes and directly sequenced â€“ variant in siblings and mother \nGiordano et al., 2013 PMID: 21945886 Northern blot analysis of patient and control cardiac muscle RNA\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3ac07ab9-8580-4fbf-b599-35dd25f3025d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":8639,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":6.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c3021fb9-dd5d-4498-a845-2ad4940f6fbd","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005045","gene":"hgnc:7488","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"MT-TI is a mitochondrial gene that encodes for mitochondrially-encoded tRNA for isoleucine, it is located on the heavy stand of mitochondrial DNA spanning 69 nucleotides 4263-4331. MT-TI was first reported in association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 1996 (Merante et al. 1996, PMID: 8889580). Three variants have been seen in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 8889580, 12767666, 37124643). One homoplastic variant m.4300A>G is seen in most cases, including in a family segregating to 16 affected family members. Each variant has supporting histochemical and biochemical functional evidence from patient biopsies. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies (PMID: 8889580, 34265302). In summary, there is MODERATE evidence supporting the relationship between MT-TI and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
