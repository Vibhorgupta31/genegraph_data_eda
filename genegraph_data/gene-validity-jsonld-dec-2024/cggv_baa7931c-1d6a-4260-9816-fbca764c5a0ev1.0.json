However, insufficient evidence for pathogenicity of any of the three variants was presented and so none of the human evidence was scored in the ClinGen framework. The gene was shown to be expressed in mouse inner ear tissue and  a mouse model with a homozygous knockout of the WBP2 gene showed progressive, later-onset HL compared to their wildtype littermates (Buniello et al. 2016). In summary, although the mouse model suggests that the WBP2 gene is a strong candidate for human hearing loss, none of the human cases presented to date have evidence to implicate WBP2 and therefore the final conclusion  is limited in the ClinGen gene-disease validity framework.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 11/20/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:baa7931c-1d6a-4260-9816-fbca764c5a0e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
