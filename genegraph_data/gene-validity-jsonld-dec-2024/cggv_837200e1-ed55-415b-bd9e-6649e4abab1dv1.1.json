In the current study, mouse ADNP was shown to be expressed at the time of neural tube closure, detected at E7.5 and increased on E9.5. Expression was augmented in the brain (E12.5), sustained throughout embryogenesis and regulated by VIP. To assess the function of ADNP, knockout mice were established. Detailed analysis revealed cranial neural tube closure failure and death on E8.5-9.0 of the ADNP-knockout embryos. The expression of Oct4, a gene associated with germ-line maintenance was markedly augmented in the knockout embryos. In contrast, the expression of Pax6, a gene crucial for cerebral cortex formation, was abolished in the brain primordial tissue of the knockout embryos. Thus, Pax6 and Oct4 constitute a part of the mechanism of action of ADNP on brain formation, inhibiting germ-line division while activating morphogenesis. In conclusion, ADNP is identified here as a new key gene essential for organogenesis in the developing embryo and may be implicated as a clinical target associated with proper neurodevelopment.","dc:creator":"Pinhasov A","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein: a novel gene essential for brain formation."},"rdfs:label":"knockout mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"behavioral phenotype describe in  PMID: 30659505"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:837200e1-ed55-415b-bd9e-6649e4abab1d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:837200e1-ed55-415b-bd9e-6649e4abab1d_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e577fea8-b6dd-41ba-b8d6-29443648d12b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0085fc8c-ab06-446a-a705-18f4673ded65","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"MIPs, molecular inversion probes","firstTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:e577fea8-b6dd-41ba-b8d6-29443648d12b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:a4249478-9adc-49ad-a45a-10b70dfed865","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001282531.3(ADNP):c.1930C>T (p.Arg644Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA408971877"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24531329","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Despite the high heritability of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, a genetic diagnosis can be established in only a minority of patients. Known genetic causes include chromosomal aberrations, such as the duplication of the 15q11-13 region, and monogenic causes, as in Rett and fragile-X syndromes. The genetic heterogeneity within ASD is striking, with even the most frequent causes responsible for only 1% of cases at the most. Even with the recent developments in next-generation sequencing, for the large majority of cases no molecular diagnosis can be established. Here, we report ten patients with ASD and other shared clinical characteristics, including intellectual disability and facial dysmorphisms caused by a mutation in ADNP, a transcription factor involved in the SWI/SNF remodeling complex. We estimate this gene to be mutated in at least 0.17% of ASD cases, making it one of the most frequent ASD-associated genes known to date.
