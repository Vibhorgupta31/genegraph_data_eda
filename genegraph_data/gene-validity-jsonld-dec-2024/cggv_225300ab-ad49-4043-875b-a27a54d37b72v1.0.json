PCD-causing mutations have been identified in 14 genes, but they collectively account for only ~60% of all PCD. To identify mutations that cause PCD, we performed exome sequencing on six unrelated probands with ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) defects. Mutations in CCDC114, an ortholog of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii motility gene DCC2, were identified in a family with two affected siblings. Sanger sequencing of 67 additional individuals with PCD with ODA defects from 58 families revealed CCDC114 mutations in 4 individuals in 3 families. All 6 individuals with CCDC114 mutations had characteristic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, but none had situs abnormalities. In the remaining 5 individuals with PCD who underwent exome sequencing, we identified mutations in two genes (DNAI2, DNAH5) known to cause PCD, including an Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation in DNAI2. These results revealed that mutations in CCDC114 are a cause of ciliary dysmotility and PCD and further demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing to identify genetic causes in heterogeneous recessive disorders.","dc:creator":"Knowles MR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Exome sequencing identifies mutations in CCDC114 as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia."}},"rdfs:label":"UNC 167"},{"id":"cggv:c511ce45-f51f-48a1-a4ce-8ea3f761f15f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c511ce45-f51f-48a1-a4ce-8ea3f761f15f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Pedigree analysis is consistent with autosomal recessive mode of inheritance individuals had ciliary\nouter dynein arm defects, homozygous c.1304G>A (p.W453*) mutation in exon 10\nOnly maternity variant was confirmed lowed the score "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:91030c59-fc57-46d9-9459-b2a37027a251_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91030c59-fc57-46d9-9459-b2a37027a251","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0626d72c-4d6b-4eb1-b605-23a87bdc5b38","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000017.11:g.(?_74299708)_(74305452_?)del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/831419"}},"detectionMethod":"The patient was initially genotyped using a next-generation sequencing panel focused on 36 genes known to harbor causal variants in PCD, revealing a homozygous deletion in the DNAI2 locus.

Males often have reduced fertility due to impaired sperm tail function. The complex PCD phenotype results from dysfunction of cilia of the airways and the embryonic node and the structurally related motile sperm flagella. This is associated with underlying ultrastructural defects that frequently involve the outer dynein arm (ODA) complexes that generate cilia and flagella movement. Applying a positional and functional candidate-gene approach, we identified homozygous loss-of-function DNAI2 mutations (IVS11+1G > A) in four individuals from a family with PCD and ODA defects. Further mutational screening of 105 unrelated PCD families detected two distinct homozygous mutations, including a nonsense (c.787C > T) and a splicing mutation (IVS3-3T > G) resulting in out-of-frame transcripts. Analysis of protein expression of the ODA intermediate chain DNAI2 showed sublocalization throughout respiratory cilia. Electron microscopy showed that mutant respiratory cells from these patients lacked DNAI2 protein expression and exhibited ODA defects. High-resolution immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated absence of the ODA heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9 from all DNAI2 mutant ciliary axonemes. In addition, we demonstrated complete or distal absence of DNAI2 from ciliary axonemes in respiratory cells of patients with mutations in genes encoding the ODA chains DNAH5 and DNAI1, respectively. Thus, DNAI2 and DNAH5 mutations affect assembly of proximal and distal ODA complexes, whereas DNAI1 mutations mainly disrupt assembly of proximal ODA complexes.","dc:creator":"Loges NT","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"DNAI2 mutations cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with defects in the outer dynein arm."}},"rdfs:label":"OP42-II2"},{"id":"cggv:bf9ab59e-6e6e-46ed-92db-36339b3689ae","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf9ab59e-6e6e-46ed-92db-36339b3689ae_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:bf9ab59e-6e6e-46ed-92db-36339b3689ae_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The variant protein is absent from respiratory epithelial cells from patients with PCD."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The variant is a splicing acceptor site disruption and is proven to have an effect on protein expression in patient cells.

Following the same strategy, we have characterized DNAI2, a human gene related to Chlamzydomonas IC69, and evaluated its possible involvement in a PCD population characterized by an absence of outer dynein arms. DNAI2, which is composed of 14 exons located at 17q25, is highly expressed in trachea and testis. No mutation was found in the DNAI2 coding sequence of the twelve patients investigated. However, ten intragenic polymorphic sites and an EcoRI RFLP have been identified, allowing the exclusion of DNAI2 in three consanguineous families.","dc:creator":"Pennarun G","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"The human dynein intermediate chain 2 gene (DNAI2): cloning, mapping, expression pattern, and evaluation as a candidate for primary ciliary dyskinesia."},"rdfs:label":"DNAI2 shows high levels of expression in trachea and testis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This experiment is consistent with the disease and the tissues in the body affected in the patients."},{"id":"cggv:8da442e7-f54d-4861-a422-5e880e3a52f2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5067869a-91b4-4b9b-a78d-950ba277c6a7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"the function of the protein is consistent with ODA effect from the patient ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2147183","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have used immunoelectron microscopy to determine the location of an intermediate chain in the isolated outer arm dynein from Chlamydomonas flagella.

This protein previously was shown to be located at the base of the solubilized dynein particle and to interact with alpha tubulin in situ, suggesting that it may be involved in binding the outer arm to the doublet microtubule. The sequence predicts a polypeptide of 683 amino acids having a mass of 76.5 kD. Sequence comparison indicates that IC78 is homologous to the 69,000 M(r) intermediate chain (IC69) of Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein and to the 74,000 M(r) intermediate chain (IC74) of cytoplasmic dynein. The similarity between the chains is greatest in their COOH-terminal halves; the NH(2)-terminal halves are highly divergent. The COOH-terminal half of IC78 contains six short imperfect repeats, termed WD repeats, that are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Although not previously reported, these repeated elements also are present in IC69 and IC74. Using the IC78 cDNA as a probe, we screened a group of slow-swimming insertional mutants and identified one which has a large insertion in the IC78 gene and seven in which the IC78 gene is completely deleted. Electron microscopy of three of these IC78 mutants revealed that each is missing the outer arm, indicating that IC78 is essential for arm assembly or attachment to the outer doublet. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping places the IC78 gene on the left arm of chromosome XII/XIII, at or near the mutation oda9, which also causes loss of the outer arm. Mutants with defects in the IC78 gene do not complement the oda9 mutation in stable diploids, strongly suggesting that ODA9 is the structural gene for IC78.","dc:creator":"Wilkerson CG","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"The 78,000 M(r) intermediate chain of Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein isa WD-repeat protein required for arm assembly."},"rdfs:label":"Chlamydomonas model of DNAI2 loss-of-function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"A good model for particular phenotypes of patients, however It gives lower score because this evidence has scored before from pervious publications regrading ODA defects.

This gene expresses a component of the axonemal dynein complex that functions in cilia or flagella. We found that overexpression of Dnaic2 results in female subfertility and male infertility. In this study, we generated Dnaic2 knockdown (KD) mice and identified the potential regulatory mechanisms involved in Dnaic2 function. For phenotype analysis, we found that body weight was lighter and size was smaller in Dnaic2 KD mice than in wild-type mice. A total of 45% of these Dnaic2 KD mice were infertile due to sperm abnormalities in males, or had oocyte abnormalities and pathological changes in the tunica mucosa in the oviduct of females. Moreover, Dnaic2 overexpression enhanced the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the ovaries, which suggested that Dnaic2 stimulated proliferation of cells in the ovaries. However, PCNA expression in the testis of Dnaic2-overexpressed mice was lower than that in controls. Additionally, the ratio of Bax/B-cell lymphoma-2(Bcl-2) in the testis of Dnaic2-overexpressed mice was higher than that in controls, which suggested that Dnaic2 inhibited cellular proliferation in the testis. To examine the molecular action of Dnaic2, immunoprecipitation analysis was used and showed that Dnaic2 protein interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Molecular modelling analysis showed that Dnaic2 bound with the linker and SH2 domains of Stat3. Furthermore, overexpression of Dnaic2 promoted phosphorylation of Stat3.

The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 9 (PCD 9) (MONDO: 0012906, OMIM # 612444), is part of a larger group of primary ciliary dyskinesias (PCD) and one of at least 50 monogenic causes of PCD. \n\nThe onset of the symptoms and signs of the disease can occur at birth (Rocca MS et al., PMID:33167880), and the median age of diagnosis is 15 years old (Loges et al., PMID:18950741). The clinical features among well-characterized newborn patients with DNAI2 pathogenic mutations include neonatal respiratory distress, such as tachypnea or mild hypoxemia, requiring supplemental oxygen for a few hours to days after birth. In early childhood and later life, recurrent pneumonia is common. Otitis and rhinosinusitis are also reported. Approximately 50% of patients exhibit situs inversus or another form of reversed organ laterality and heterotaxy, in some cases including congenital transposition of the great vessels, pyloric stenosis, and other cardiac abnormalities. Patients can also be characterized by chronic sinusitis, as well as bronchiectasis in older individuals. Normal pressure hydrocephalus has been described in PCD (PMID: 31004071, PMID: 11912187, PMID: 31383820). Most men and women with PCD 9 have impaired and/or decreased fertility.\n \nAdditional diagnostic features include impaired or absent ciliary movement and radiological findings of bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, atelectasis, and lobar collapse. Nasal nitric oxide levels are very low or absent in these patients. However, among diagnostic features of PCD associated with pathogenic DNAI2 variants is exhibiting ciliary ultrastructure with an absence or shortening of outer dynein arms. \n\nThis curation has scored five different suspected deleterious DNAI2 variants (one deleting exons 7-9, one nonsense variant in exon 7, one nonsense variant in exon 10, one splicing variant causing skipping of exon 11, and one splicing variant disrupting exon 4), which were collectively reported in 3 publications (PMID:18950741, PMID:23261302, PMID:33167880). All probands harbored biallelic homozygous variants that were confirmed to be trans. The molecular mechanism appears to be biallelic loss-of-function with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of a gene product. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. High levels of DNAI2 expression in humans are specific to tissues that harbor multi-ciliated cells, particularly the testis and trachea (PMID: 11153919 and PMID: 18950741). Loss of DNAI2 from the cilia of patients harboring other forms of PCD has been described and supports the functional role of DNAI2 in outer dynein arm assembly complexes throughout all respiratory ciliary axonemes and sperm (PMID: 18950741). Biochemical studies of the Chlamydomonas ortholog of DNAI2 indicate that the protein product is an intermediate dynein chain positioned at the base of the alpha-beta dimer of the outer dynein arms (PMID: 2147183). This is consistent with the ultrastructural defect characteristic of human patients. The protein also interacts with the Chlamydomonas ortholog of DNAI1 (2147183), a related intermediate dynein chain associated in humans with variants that cause PCD 1. Human patient phenotypes such as ciliary immotility and the absence of outer dynein arms are recapitulated by the Chlamydomonas model of DNAI2 loss of function (PMID:7698982) . Histopathology, infertility and lung damage phenotypes are recapitulated by mouse models of DNAI2 loss of function (PMID: 30387321). In addition, fish mutants with dnai2 loss-of-function exhibit a defect in outer dynein arms in the cilia axoneme, resulting in aberrant ciliary motility along with reversed organ laterality and situs inversus (PMID: 20709053). These phenotypic features are consistent with the pathogenicity of DNAI2 loss of function variants in PCD 9 patients.\n\nIn summary, DNAI2 is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 9. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical diagnostic and research settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on August 11, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\nAdjust the scoring to account for the homozygous status of the variants in the patients.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:225300ab-ad49-4043-875b-a27a54d37b72"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
