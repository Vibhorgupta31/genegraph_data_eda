The sudden onset of symptoms over hours to a few weeks, often associated with physical or emotional stress, suggests a trigger initiating a nervous system insult resulting in permanent neurologic disability. We report the finding of six missense mutations in the gene for the Na+/K+ -ATPase alpha3 subunit (ATP1A3) in seven unrelated families with RDP. Functional studies and structural analysis of the protein suggest that these mutations impair enzyme activity or stability.

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.","dc:creator":"GTEx Consortium","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues."},"rdfs:label":"gene expression in tissues"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2a572fef-35c5-46dd-8a69-af436b3ecdcc_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eab808eb-71f1-467d-bb19-f0cf9d13498e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:75c7ddd1-2773-49b1-991f-3f3ebf2fc450","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Light microscopy with immunofluorescence for α3 and β1 was used to investigate the distribution of Na,K-ATPase subunits. \nD923N and D743H (mild phenotypes) resembled α3WT in that there was a polygonal cell appearance and a majority of both subunits had a plasma membrane distribution. \nL924P had relatively faint plasma membrane stain for α3 and prominent accumulations of stain for β subunit in cytoplasm.

Several new mutations and their phenotypes are reported here (p.Asp366His, p.Asp742Tyr, p.Asp743His, p.Leu924Pro, and a VUS, p.Arg463Cys). Mutations associated with mild or severe phenotypes [rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP), alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE)] were expressed in HEK-293 cells. Paradoxically, the severity of human symptoms did not correlate with whether there was enough residual activity to support cell survival. We hypothesized that distinct cellular consequences may result not only from pump inactivation but also from protein misfolding. Biosynthesis was investigated in four tetracycline-inducible isogenic cell lines representing different human phenotypes. Two cell biological complications were found. First, there was impaired trafficking of αβ complex to Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, as well as changes in cell morphology, for two mutations that produced microcephaly or regions of brain atrophy in patients. Second, there was competition between exogenous mutant ATP1A3 (α3) and endogenous ATP1A1 (α1) so that their sum was constant. This predicts that in patients, the ratio of normal to mutant ATP1A3 proteins will vary when misfolding occurs. At the two extremes, the results suggest that a heterozygous mutation that only impairs Na,K-ATPase activity will produce relatively mild disease, while one that activates the unfolded protein response could produce severe disease and may result in death of neurons independently of ion pump inactivation.","dc:creator":"Arystarkhova E","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Factors in the disease severity of ATP1A3 mutations: Impairment, misfolding, and allele competition."},"rdfs:label":"transiently transfection of ATP1A3 variants in HEK-293 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2a572fef-35c5-46dd-8a69-af436b3ecdcc_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:239b5e5f-e6fa-41b5-8e7b-cd4712f17bd8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c63b011f-c24f-4432-a472-0c85da39477a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"E815K, a common pathogenic variant, results in a severe clinical AHC phenotype in humans.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30071271","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"De novo mutations causing dysfunction of the ATP1A3 gene, which encodes the α3 subunit of Na","dc:creator":"Helseth AR","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Novel E815K knock-in mouse model of alternating hemiplegia of childhood."},"rdfs:label":"Novel knock-in mouse model (Atp1a3 E815K+/-, Matoub, Matb+/-"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:7718b508-7758-4482-addd-af0996e662c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbd79422-f6ed-4479-9d79-f0ed7498e286","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In this model, Atp1a3-deficient heterozygous mice phenocopy rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP) in humans.

Rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP), one of the heredity forms of dystonia, is caused by mutations of Na,K-ATPase α3 subunit gene (ATP1A3). The abrupt onset of bulbar and limb symptoms of RDP are often triggered by physical and/or emotional stress. We reported previously that Atp1a3-deficient heterozygous mice showed higher locomotor activity and developed enhanced dystonia symptoms after kainate injection into the cerebellum, but not spontaneous movement disorder like RDP patients. Here we show that Atp1a3-deficient heterozygous mice exhibited shorter stride length at 4 weeks of age without stress and at later stages under chronic restraint stress loading. Shorter hanging time in the hanging box test was also observed after stress loading. Shorter stride length and hanging time may be relevant to certain phenotypes, such as gait abnormality, observed in RDP patients. Atp1a3 was widely expressed in the brain, including basal ganglia and cerebellum, and spinal cord of young mice, and the expression pattern was compatible with movement abnormalities under lack of one of alleles. Our results demonstrated the usefulness of Atp1a3-deficient heterozygous mice as an animal model of RDP and its potential use to explore the pathophysiology of movement abnormality in this disorder.

ATP1A3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders in 2004 (Carvalho Aguiar  et al., PMID:15260953). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s), inheritance pattern, and/or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, alternating hemiplegia of childhood 2 (OMIM:614820), CAPOS syndrome (OMIM:601338), developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 99 (OMIM:619606), and dystonia 12 (OMIM: 128235). 8 variants (including 7 missense and 1 in-frame indel) have been reported in 9 probands in 3 publications (Heinzen et al., 2012, PMID: 22842232; Marzin et al., 2018, PMID: 29861155; Miyatake et al., 2021, PMID: 33762331) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The genotype-phenotype correlation is not fully understood. Differences in ATPase activity, protein trafficking and interaction with beta subunit are thought to contribute to the wide range of pathogenicity of de novo ATP1A3 variants (PMID: 31425744). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and functional alteration (Arystarkhova et al., 2019, PMID: 31425744; Battle et al., 2017, PMID: 29022597; Sugimoto et al., 2014, PMID: 24983657; Helseth et al., 2018, PMID: 30071271). In summary, ATP1A3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ATP1A3-associated neurological disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 07.16.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2a572fef-35c5-46dd-8a69-af436b3ecdcc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
