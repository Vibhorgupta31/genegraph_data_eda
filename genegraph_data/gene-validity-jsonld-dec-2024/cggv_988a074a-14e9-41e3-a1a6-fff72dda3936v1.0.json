The great majority of mutations identified so far involve genes whose defects result in dynein-arm anomalies. By contrast, PCD due to CC/RS defects (those in the central complex [CC] and radial spokes [RSs]), which might be difficult to diagnose, remains mostly unexplained. We identified non-ambiguous RSPH3 mutations in 5 of 48 independent families affected by CC/RS defects. RSPH3, whose ortholog in the flagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii encodes a RS-stalk protein, is mainly expressed in respiratory and testicular cells. Its protein product, which localizes within the cilia of respiratory epithelial cells, was undetectable in airway cells from an individual with RSPH3 mutations and in whom RSPH23 (a RS-neck protein) and RSPH1 and RSPH4A (RS-head proteins) were found to be still present within cilia. In the case of RSPH3 mutations, high-speed-videomicroscopy analyses revealed the coexistence of immotile cilia and motile cilia with movements of reduced amplitude. A striking feature of the ultrastructural phenotype associated with RSPH3 mutations is the near absence of detectable RSs in all cilia in combination with a variable proportion of cilia with CC defects. Overall, this study shows that RSPH3 mutations contribute to disease in more than 10% of PCD-affected individuals with CC/RS defects, thereby allowing an accurate diagnosis to be made in such cases. It also unveils the key role of RSPH3 in the proper building of RSs and the CC in humans.","dc:creator":"Jeanson L","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"RSPH3 Mutations Cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia with Central-Complex Defects and a Near Absence of Radial Spokes."}},"rdfs:label":"PCD9"},{"id":"cggv:db768375-82f7-4a2a-88ba-e882c60d6d1f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db768375-82f7-4a2a-88ba-e882c60d6d1f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:db768375-82f7-4a2a-88ba-e882c60d6d1f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional Evidence for the proband: \"The access to ciliated cells obtained by airway brushing in one of the individuals with biallelic RSPH3 mutations (individual PCD9) allowed us to study by high-speed videomicroscopy (according to the protocol described by Papon et al.53) the ciliary motion in this individual compared to that in healthy control individuals.\" See Movie S2."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Good genotyping, homozygosity, recurrence, no functional data showing splicing defect "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:cd62865c-4dde-4d45-9f64-a7075a993cb6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd62865c-4dde-4d45-9f64-a7075a993cb6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":45,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:829a930c-a328-45a4-9019-260aeabf456e"},{"id":"cggv:42a1167d-b8d1-4cee-96a2-930421acaea3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031924.8(RSPH3):c.679C>T (p.Arg227del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA204025"}}],"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping and WES analysis.

Autosomal recessive mutations in DNAH11 and HYDIN produce normal TEM ciliary ultrastructure, while mutations in genes encoding for radial spoke head proteins result in some cross-sections with non-diagnostic alterations in the central apparatus interspersed with normal ciliary cross-sections. Mutations in nexin link and dynein regulatory complex genes lead to a collection of different ciliary ultrastructures; mutations in CCDC65, CCDC164, and GAS8 produce normal ciliary ultrastructure, while mutations in CCDC39 and CCDC40 cause absent inner dynein arms and microtubule disorganization in some ciliary cross-sections. Mutations in CCNO and MCIDAS cause near complete absence of respiratory cilia due to defects in generation of multiple cellular basal bodies; however, the scant cilia generated may have normal ultrastructure. Lastly, a syndromic form of PCD with retinal degeneration results in normal ciliary ultrastructure through mutations in the RPGR gene.

Trypanin is a flagellar protein required for directional cell motility, but its molecular function is unknown. Recently, a trypanin homologue in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was reported to be part of a dynein regulatory complex (DRC) that transmits regulatory signals from central pair microtubules and radial spokes to axonemal dynein. DRC genes were identified as extragenic suppressors of central pair and/or radial spoke mutations. We used RNA interference to ablate expression of radial spoke (RSP3) and central pair (PF16) components individually or in combination with trypanin. Both rsp3 and pf16 single knockdown mutants are immotile, with severely defective flagellar beat. In the case of rsp3, this loss of motility is correlated with the loss of radial spokes, while in the case of pf16 the loss of motility correlates with an aberrant orientation of the central pair microtubules within the axoneme. Genetic interaction between trypanin and PF16 is demonstrated by the finding that loss of trypanin suppresses the pf16 beat defect, indicating that the DRC represents an evolutionarily conserved strategy for dynein regulation. Surprisingly, we discovered that four independent mutants with an impaired flagellar beat all fail in the final stage of cytokinesis, indicating that flagellar motility is necessary for normal cell division in T. brucei. These findings present the first evidence that flagellar beating is important for cell division and open the opportunity to exploit enzymatic activities that drive flagellar beat as drug targets for the treatment of African sleeping sickness.","dc:creator":"Ralston KS","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Flagellar motility contributes to cytokinesis in Trypanosoma brucei and is modulated by an evolutionarily conserved dynein regulatory system."},"rdfs:label":"Ralston et al. 2006"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Trypanosoma brucei is a single cell organism.

In Chlamydomonas species, mutations in radial spoke proteins result in ciliary motility defects. However, little is known about the function of radial spoke proteins during embryonic development. Here, we investigated the role of a novel radial spoke protein, leucine-rich repeat containing protein 23 (Lrrc23), during zebrafish embryonic development. Mutations in lrrc23 resulted in a selective otolith formation defect during early ear development. Similar otolith defects were also present in the radial spoke head 3 homolog ( rsph3) and radial spoke head 4 homolog A ( rsph4a) radial spoke mutants. Notably, the radial spoke protein mutations specifically affected ciliary motility in the otic vesicle (OV), whereas motile cilia in other organs functioned normally. Via high-speed video microscopy, we found that motile cilia formation was stochastic and transient in the OV. Importantly, all the motile cilia in the OV beat circularly, in contrast to the planar beating pattern of typical 9 + 2 motile cilia. We identified the key time frame for motile cilia formation during OV development. Finally, we showed that the functions of radial spoke proteins were conserved between zebrafish and Tetrahymena. Together, our results suggest that radial spoke proteins are essential for ciliary motility in the OV and that radial spoke-regulated OV motile cilia represent a unique type of cilia during early zebrafish embryonic development.-Han, X., Xie, H., Wang, Y., Zhao, C.

The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 32 (MONDO:0014657, OMIM:616481), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Some of the common clinical phenotypes are: neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, bronchiectasis, male/female infertility, chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media, reduced nasal nitric oxide, and reduced or absent ciliary motility.\n\n*RSPH3* encodes a protein of the radial spoke of the ciliary axoneme. This curation includes six variants (3 nonsense, 1 frameshift, 1 missense and 1 canonical splice site) that have been reported in 6 unrelated probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 26073779 and 32124190). Overall, the pattern of variants observed in the probands indicated that the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of RSPH3 function. However, it is important to note that missense variants contribute to the gene-disease relationship through mechanisms that have not yet been well-studied.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by multiple kinds of experimental evidence ranging from gene expression and biochemical studies to non-human model organisms (PMID: 23715323, PMID: 16607017, PMID: 28915070). High levels of expression of *RSPH3* are found in human tissues associated with motile cilia (testis, lungs, and brain/hypothalamus, PMID: 23715323). An *RSPH3* ortholog knockout in *Trypanosoma brucei* recapitulated phenotypes displayed by patients carrying pathogenic variants in *RSPH3*, including reduced ciliary beat frequency (PMID: 16607017). RSPH3 localizes to radial spoke heads (PMID: 28915070), matching the RSPH9 protein previously shown to be associated with PCD 12 (19200523). A zebrafish model lacking the orthologous gene encoding lrrc23, a component of the radial spoke neck, showed otolith defects (an ear problem which indicates an underlying problem with ciliary movement, PMID: 29475374). Lastly, a naturally occurring *Chlamydomonas* mutant “pf14” lacks the RSPH3 ortholog and shows abnormal flagellar morphology and movement as well as central pair defects when examined by electron microscopy (PMID: 24283352).\n\nIn conclusion, *RSPH3* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 32. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on August 8th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:988a074a-14e9-41e3-a1a6-fff72dda3936"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
