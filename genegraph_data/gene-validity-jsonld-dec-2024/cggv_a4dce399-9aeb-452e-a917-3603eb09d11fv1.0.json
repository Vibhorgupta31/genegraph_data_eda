The deletion is located in exon 1 and results in a frameshift and premature protein truncation (p.Gly15AlafsX150). Interestingly, the deleted sequence is part of a repetitive and CG-rich motive predicted to be prone to structural aberrations during crossover formation. We identified another family with progressive ARNSHL linked to this locus, whose affected members were shown to carry a causative 1 bp deletion (c.1347delG) in exon 1 of TPRN.

This association was made using case-level data and experimental data). At least 7 unique variants (e.g. missense, frameshift, nonsense) have been reported in humans. TPRN was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2010 (Khan et al.​). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 19603065, 20170898,  20170899, 23340767, 25129962). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 20 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, knockout mice models, biochemical function studies, and protein interaction (PMID: 20170899, 20170899, 27693694, 24285636).
