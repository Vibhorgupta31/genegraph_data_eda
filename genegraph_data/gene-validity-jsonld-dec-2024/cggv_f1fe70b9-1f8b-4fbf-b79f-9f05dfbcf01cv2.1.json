Consistently 7 variants (V525F, G269S, R409Q, R455H, Y775H, R907C, and F911I), showed altered sensitivity to Na2+ concentration for activation (Figure 2).  tey show that one variant R379Q consistently shows reduced sensistivty to Na2+, compared to the other 7 that show enhanced sensitivty. Channel open probability is also enhanced in the R379Q, Y775H and R455H variants).\nNote: 4 of these mutations are associated with nocturnal epilepsy (R379Q, Y775H, R907C, and M875I).

The changes in biophysical properties of these mutants and the underlying mechanisms causing disease remain elusive. Here, we report that seven of the 12 mutations increase, whereas one mutation decreases, the channel's sodium sensitivity. Two of the mutants exhibit channel over-activity only when the intracellular Na(+) ([Na(+)]i) concentration is ∼80 mM. In contrast, single-channel data reveal that all 12 mutants increase the maximal open probability (Po). We conclude that these mutant channels lead to channel over-activity predominantly by increasing the ability of sodium binding to activate the channel, which is indicated by its maximal Po. The sodium sensitivity of these epilepsy causing mutants probably determines the [Na(+)]i concentration at which these mutants exert their pathological effects.

Patients present in childhood with features including seizures, delayed myelination, and developmental delays. Five missense variants reported in eight probands across two publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 23086397, 24029078). Of note, a number of recurrent variants have been observed, including p.Ala934Thr, p.Arg428Gln, p.Arg474His, p.Ile760Met, and p.Gly288Ser. More evidence may be available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity for early-onset epilepsy in *KCNT1* is thought to be gain-of-function (GOF) (PMIDs: 23086397, 26725113). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression and functional alteration studies (PMIDs: 12442315, 10196543, 23086397, 26725113). In summary, there is a definitive relationship between *KCNT1* and childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on August 1, 2017. It was re-evaluated on August 16, 2022. As a result of this reevaluation, scoring was updated to reflect the current SOP version 9 recommendations for case-level data. New evidence was also included to retain the definitive classification. This includes additional case-level data (PMIDs:29196579, 32167590) as well as a mouse model (PMID: 33113364).
