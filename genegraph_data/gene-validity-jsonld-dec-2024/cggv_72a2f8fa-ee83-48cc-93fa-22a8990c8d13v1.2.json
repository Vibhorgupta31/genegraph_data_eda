The mechanisms that control ciliogenesis have been extensively explored. However, the intersection between GPCR signaling and the ubiquitin pathway in the control of cilium stability are unknown. Here we observe that cAMP elevation promotes cilia resorption. At centriolar satellites, we identify a multimeric complex nucleated by PCM1 that includes two kinases, NEK10 and PKA, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. We show that NEK10 is essential for ciliogenesis in mammals and for the development of medaka fish. PKA phosphorylation primes NEK10 for CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and proteolysis resulting in cilia resorption. Disarrangement of this control mechanism occurs in proliferative and genetic disorders. These findings unveil a pericentriolar kinase signalosome that efficiently links the cAMP cascade with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby controlling essential aspects of ciliogenesis.","dc:creator":"Porpora M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Counterregulation of cAMP-directed kinase activities controls ciliogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Immunostaining analysis "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Recognize as independent assay but showing same datapoint as Chivukula 2020 paper.

can result from infectious, genetic, immunological and allergic causes. 60-80% of cases are idiopathic, but a well-recognised genetic cause is the motile ciliopathy, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Diagnosis of PCD has management implications including addressing comorbidities, implementing genetic and fertility counselling and future access to PCD-specific treatments. Diagnostic testing can be complex; however, PCD genetic testing is moving rapidly from research into clinical diagnostics and would confirm the cause of bronchiectasis.","dc:creator":"Shoemark A","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Genome sequencing reveals underdiagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia in bronchiectasis."}},{"id":"cggv:741904c2-625c-4718-880d-888b79a4d97b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:70d41716-e277-446e-a9a6-c1081ac1714e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35728977"}],"rdfs:label":"Shoemark-1"},{"id":"cggv:eefe9d55-0163-4a03-b633-d8e178a7dc4d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eefe9d55-0163-4a03-b633-d8e178a7dc4d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Potential alt start in gene with multiple transcripts.

Loss-of-function variants in this gene were first identified in patients with bronchiectasis and reduced ciliary motion in cultured bronchial epithelial cells (PMID: 31959991). These features are consistent with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition of impaired ciliary function characterized by neonates with respiratory distress, recurrent chest infections, wet cough, and abnormalities of abdominal situs in approximately half of affected individuals. Given the ciliary function of *NEK10,* this gene has been evaluated in this curation for gene-disease association with primary ciliary dyskinesia 44.\n\nIndividuals with phenotypes consistent with PCD (e.g. bronchiectasis, recurrent sinusitis, neonatal respiratory distress) who carried homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in *NEK10* were first identified in 2020 (PMID: 31959991). The mutational spectrum of disease-causing variants suggests loss of function (LOF) as a mechanism of disease. However, missense and a non-canonical splice variants (p.Pro748Leu, p.Arg773Cys, c.1230+5G>C) have also been identified in the homozygous state. Variant-specific functional studies of cultured patient bronchial epithelial cells in an air-liquid interface reveal short airway cilia in imaging flow cytometry, supporting a deleterious effect. At the same time, many of the individuals in the literature were reported to have normal nasal nitric oxide measurements, normal electron microscopy of the cilia, and absence of abdominal situs abnormalities (PMID: 31959991, 32414360, 33875846, 35728977).\n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes studies demonstrating that NEK10 protein localizes to motile cilia and interacts with other motile cilia proteins, as well as knockout/knockdown assays in cell culture and zebrafish models that result in ciliary abnormalities and can be rescued with exogenous *NEK10* (PMID: 29581457, 31959991).\n\nIn summary, *NEK10* has a Strong association with primary ciliary dyskinesia 44 based on multiple genetic and experimental evidence data points. Replication over a longer period of time without the emergence of contradictory evidence will be required to reach a more definitive association.
