By analysis of exome of the proband, we identified a novel missense (p.R306C) mutation and a nonsense (p.R186*) mutation in the BCS1L gene. Mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The siblings were compound heterozygotes, and the inheritance mode of autosomal recessive was postulated. BCS1L is the causative gene of Björnstad syndrome, which is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. The longitudinal gutters along the hair shaft were found by scanning electron microscopy in our patient. Therefore the diagnosis of Björnstad syndrome was eventually made for the patients.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 12 missense, splice site, and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. BCS1L was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2007 (Hinson et al.). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 5 publications (17314340, 24172246, 25895478, 28322498, 28105683). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 13 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence performed by Hinston et al. 2007. In summary, BCS1L is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Bjornstad syndrome.
