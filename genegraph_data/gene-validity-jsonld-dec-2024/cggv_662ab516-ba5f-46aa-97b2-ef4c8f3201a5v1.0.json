Multiple causative PCD mutations account for only 65% of cases, suggesting that many genes essential for cilia function remain to be discovered. By using zebrafish morpholino knockdown of PCD candidate genes as an in vivo screening platform, we identified c21orf59, ccdc65, and c15orf26 as critical for cilia motility. c21orf59 and c15orf26 knockdown in zebrafish and planaria blocked outer dynein arm assembly, and ccdc65 knockdown altered cilia beat pattern. Biochemical analysis in Chlamydomonas revealed that the C21orf59 ortholog FBB18 is a flagellar matrix protein that accumulates specifically when cilia motility is impaired. The Chlamydomonas ida6 mutant identifies CCDC65/FAP250 as an essential component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. Analysis of 295 individuals with PCD identified recessive truncating mutations of C21orf59 in four families and CCDC65 in two families. Similar to findings in zebrafish and planaria, mutations in C21orf59 caused loss of both outer and inner dynein arm components. Our results characterize two genes associated with PCD-causing mutations and elucidate two distinct mechanisms critical for motile cilia function: dynein arm assembly for C21orf59 and assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex for CCDC65.","dc:creator":"Austin-Tse C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Zebrafish Ciliopathy Screen Plus Human Mutational Analysis Identifies C21orf59 and CCDC65 Defects as Causing Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia."},"rdfs:label":"Rescuing the Chlamydomonas mutant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Rescuing in non-human model organism"},{"id":"cggv:c0a8966a-c418-4558-a80e-40e5d97c96c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7239b9f-7389-429f-8601-5c2e12729a2d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"ccdc65 morphant cilia show normal dynein arm ultrastructure in averaged doublets \nKymograms of ccdc65 morphant olfactory cilia beat shows either complete cilia paralysis or dyskinetic, faster beat rate, a similar phenotype to those observed in CCDC65 deficient patients\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24094744","rdfs:label":"Morpholino knockdown of ccdc65 produces ciliopathy phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1ca6f321-287f-4b56-8524-42c4c372c5e0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff46e374-9777-4e6e-baca-7c06ed461ca8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Cardiac transposition and dilated lateral ventricle recapitulated situs inversus and hydrocephalus reported in PCD patients.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35844805","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"CCDC65 is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family and was only reported in gastric cancer by our group.

In sperm cells from the patient, we also show the loss of GAS8, another component of the N-DRC, supporting a structural/functional link between the two proteins.

We recorded clinical features, relevant laboratory tests for PCD and performed whole exome sequencing (WES). We are reporting 67 patients here who had positive variant/s on WES. We had 117 variants in 40 genes among 67 patients. Among the 108 unique variants, 33 were categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP). We had nine novel variants in out cohort. The 29 definite PCD cases, diagnosed by composite reference standards, had variants in 16 genes namely LRRC6/DNAAF11 (5), DNAH5 (3), CCDC39 (3), HYDIN (3), DNAH11 (2), CCDC40 (2), CCDC65 (2) and one each DNAAF3, DNAAF2, CFAP300, RPGR, CCDC103, CCDC114, SPAG1, DNAI1, and DNAH14. To conclude, we identified 108 unique variants in 40 genes among 67 patients. The common genes involved in definite cases of PCD in Indian patients were LRRC6, DNAH5, CCDC39, and HYDIN. Our findings suggest a need to develop a separate genetic panel for PCD in the Indian population.","dc:creator":"Jat KR","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"Genetics of 67 patients of suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia from India."}},"rdfs:label":"P1_Jat"},{"id":"cggv:3c7ad13c-32fd-4201-9df8-66991251e1c5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c7ad13c-32fd-4201-9df8-66991251e1c5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3c7ad13c-32fd-4201-9df8-66991251e1c5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"yes"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This variant creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Arg305*) in the CCDC65 gene.

CDCC65 has also been identified as a human sperm tail protein (PMID: 37975235, PMID: 17089017). *CCDC65* was first reported in relation to PCD in 2013 by Austin-Tse et al. and Horani et al. (PMID: 24094744, PMID: 23991085). The two groups reported a homozygous 2-bp (c.877_878del) deletion in 4 probands of Ashkenazi-Jewish descent and a PCD-consistent phenotype without laterality defects. The variant causes a premature termination codon 2 amino acids downstream (p.Ile293Profs2Ter) that is predicted to result in nonsense-mediated decay, consistent with the decreased expression of CCDC65 revealed by immunofluorescent staining in nasal epithelial cells. On the other hand, the minor allele frequency of 0.004339 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the gnomAD database suggests a founder effect. CCDC65 deficiency was also shown to result in loss of GAS8, another component of the N-DRC (PMID: 23991085) that has similarly been linked to PCD (PMID: 26387594 27120127 27472056). Affected patients also had cilia with a reduced inner dynein arms and nexin link, and disorganization of the microtubules, as well as stiff and hyperkinetic cilia with a limited ciliary stroke (PMID: 24094744 and PMID: 23991085). Other studies have reported homozygous *CCDC65* variants in probands with infertility due to aszthenospermia, exhibiting short, absent, and coiled flagella and near-absence of CDCC65 protein (PMID: 37975235), as well as in patients from PCD cohorts harboring apparent loss-of-function variants in *CCDC65* in the homozygous state (PMID: 33479112, PMID: 39004944).\n \nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence including enriched gene expression in PCD-relevant human tissues (testis, fallopian tubes, and lung). CCDC65 has been detected during early ciliated cell differentiation, coinciding with the expression of the master ciliogenesis gene, *FOXJ1* (PMID: 23991085).  Expression of the CCDC65 ortholog DRC2 in the biflagellated alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* increased significantly following deflagellation (PMID: 23991085). The *Chlamydomonas* *ida6* motility mutant with inner arm dynein defects could be rescued by transformation with the CCDC65 ortholog Fap250. Morpholino-based knockdown of *ccdc65* in zebrafish resulted in ciliopathy phenotypes and olfactory ciliary beat with either complete cilia paralysis or dyskinetic, faster beat rate (PMID: 24094744). A *Ccdc65* knockout mouse showed laterality defects consistent with a PCD phenotype (cardiac transposition and dilated lateral ventricle) (PMID: 35844805).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *CCDC65* with primary ciliary dyskinesia 27. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence.
