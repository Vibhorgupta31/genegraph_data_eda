Familial dilated cardiomyopathy has been shown to be caused by rare variant mutations in more than 30 genes but only ~35% of its genetic cause has been identified, principally by using linkage-based or candidate gene discovery approaches. In a multigenerational family with autosomal dominant transmission, we employed whole-exome sequencing in a proband and three of his affected family members, and genome-wide copy number variation in the proband and his affected father and unaffected mother. Exome sequencing identified 428 single point variants resulting in missense, nonsense, or splice site changes. Genome-wide copy number analysis identified 51 insertion deletions and 440 copy number variants > 1 kb. Of these, a 8733 bp deletion, encompassing exon 4 of the heat shock protein cochaperone BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), was found in seven affected family members and was absent in 355 controls. To establish the relevance of variants in this protein class in genetic DCM, we sequenced the coding exons in BAG3 in 311 other unrelated DCM probands and identified one frameshift, two nonsense, and four missense rare variants absent in 355 control DNAs, four of which were familial and segregated with disease. Knockdown of bag3 in a zebrafish model recapitulated DCM and heart failure. We conclude that new comprehensive genomic approaches have identified rare variants in BAG3 as causative of DCM.","dc:creator":"Norton N","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Genome-wide studies of copy number variation and exome sequencing identify rare variants in BAG3 as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21353195","rdfs:label":"Pedigree F proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"No functional data.

We employed whole-exome sequencing to identify the causative variant in a large family with autosomal dominant transmission of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones play a central role in functioning PQC. Constant mechanical and metabolic stress in cardiomyocytes places great demand on the PQC system. Mutation and downregulation of the co-chaperone protein BCL-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) are associated with cardiac myopathy and heart failure, and a BAG3 E455K mutation leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the role of BAG3 in the heart and the mechanisms by which the E455K mutation leads to DCM remain obscure. Here, we found that cardiac-specific Bag3-KO and E455K-knockin mice developed DCM. Comparable phenotypes in the 2 mutants demonstrated that the E455K mutation resulted in loss of function. Further experiments revealed that the E455K mutation disrupted the interaction between BAG3 and HSP70. In both mutants, decreased levels of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) were observed, and a subset of proteins required for cardiomyocyte function was enriched in the insoluble fraction. Together, these observations suggest that interaction between BAG3 and HSP70 is essential for BAG3 to stabilize sHSPs and maintain cardiomyocyte protein homeostasis. Our results provide insight into heart failure caused by defects in BAG3 pathways and suggest that increasing BAG3 protein levels may be of therapeutic benefit in heart failure.","dc:creator":"Fang X","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Loss-of-function mutations in co-chaperone BAG3 destabilize small HSPs and cause cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"BAG3 Cardiomyocyte KO and KI Mouse Models"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1ad6eeea-17e8-4b92-bee1-cdad8a007038","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b052b565-e4eb-4f95-8049-388856a2baec","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Retro-orbital injection of an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 expressing BAG3 (rAAV9-BAG3) significantly (p < 0.0001) improved left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and stroke volume 9 days post-injection in mice with cardiac dysfunction secondary to a myocardial infarction.

The missense mutation P209L in exon 3 results in a primarily cardiac phenotype leading to skeletal muscle and cardiac complications. At least 10 other Bag3 mutations have been reported, nine resulting in a dilated cardiomyopathy for which no specific therapy is available. We generated Î±MHC-human Bag3 P209L transgenic mice and characterized the progressive cardiac phenotype inÂ vivo to investigate its utility in modeling human disease, understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, and identify potential therapeutic targets. We identified a progressive heart failure by echocardiography and Doppler analysis and the presence of pre-amyloid oligomers at 1 year. Paralleling the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Parkinson disease), pre-amyloid oligomers-associated alterations in cardiac mitochondrial dynamics, haploinsufficiency of wild-type BAG3, and activation of p38 signaling were identified. Unexpectedly, increased numbers of activated cardiac fibroblasts were identified in Bag3 P209L Tg+ hearts without increased fibrosis. Together, these findings point to a previously undescribed therapeutic target that may have application to mutation-induced myofibrillar myopathies as well as other common causes of heart failure that commonly harbor misfolded proteins.","dc:creator":"Quintana MT","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Cardiomyocyte-Specific Human Bcl2-Associated Anthanogene 3 P209L Expression Induces Mitochondrial Fragmentation, Bcl2-Associated Anthanogene 3 Haploinsufficiency, and Activates p38 Signaling."},"rdfs:label":"BAG3 P209L Tg Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"While over-expression of BAG3 P209L caused DCM phenotype recent reports suggest BAG3 P209L at physiological levels did not spontaneously induced DCM in mice (PMID: 30499714)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1347,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:72f5f747-0a28-48a2-8e0b-9aa30acd554c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:939","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"BAG3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy in 2011 (Norton et al., 2011, PMID: 21353195). At least 16 unique variants including missense, in-frame indel, nonsense and frameshift variants, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, case-control data, segregation data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 20 probands in 8 primary publications (PMIDs 21353195, 25008357, 25448463, 24623017, 27391596, 28211974, 30442290, 31983221). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >100 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least one case-control study (PMID 31983221) at the aggregate variant level, where BAG3 truncating variants were enriched in two DCM cohorts vs primary and ExAC control populations. The reported etiologic fraction for truncating variants was 0.98 and >0.99 for the primary and secondary cohorts respectively.  In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by multiple animal models (mouse and zebrafish), a human iPS cell culture model, in vitro functional assays, and expression studies. BAG3 was shown to be expressed in human and mouse heart tissues (Homma et al., 2006, PMID: 16936253). BAG3 protein levels were noted to be reduced in heart failure patients and individuals with BAG3 genetic variants (Feldman et al., 2014, PMID: 24623017 and Toro et al., 2016, PMID: 27391596). Heterozygous cardiomyocyte-specific BAG3 knockout or BAG3 E455K knock-in mouse models both developed DCM phenotypes (Fang et al., 2017, PMID: 28737513 and Myers et al., 2018, PMID: 29323723). Additional evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in myofibrillar myopathy. This phenotype relationship has been assessed separately. In summary, BAG3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on September 24, 2020  (SOP Version 7).\nExtensive genetic and experimental evidence for gene-disease relationship with findings replicated consistently over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1bec07e1-0186-4f45-bd8e-7d8a0f2547a9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
