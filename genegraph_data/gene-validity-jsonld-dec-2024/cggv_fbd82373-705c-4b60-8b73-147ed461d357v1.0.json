However, to date, the true frequency and distribution of the mutations along the RYR1 gene have not been determined yet, since mutation screening has been limited to three 'hot spots', with particular attention to the C-terminal region. In this study, 27 unrelated Japanese CCD patients were included. Clinical histories and muscle biopsies were carefully reviewed. We sequenced all the 106 exons encoding RYR1 with their flanking exon-intron boundaries, and identified 20 novel and 3 previously reported heterozygous missense mutations in 25 of the 27 CCD patients (93%), which is a much higher mutation detection rate than that perceived previously. Among them, six were located outside the known 'hot spots'. Sixteen of 27 (59%) CCD patients had mutations in the C-terminal 'hot spot'. Three CCD patients had a probable autosomal recessive disease with two heterozygous mutations. Patients with C-terminal mutations had earlier onset and rather consistent muscle pathology characterized by the presence of distinct cores in almost all type 1 fibres, interstitial fibrosis and type 2 fibre deficiency. In contrast, patients with mutations outside the C-terminal region had milder clinical phenotype and harbour more atypical cores in their muscle fibres. We also sequenced two genes encoding RYR1-associated proteins as candidate causative genes for CCD: the 12 kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and the alpha1 subunit of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S). However, no mutation was found, suggesting that these genes may not, or only rarely, be responsible for CCD. Our results indicate that CCD may be caused by RYR1 mutations in the majority of patients.","dc:creator":"Wu S","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Central core disease is due to RYR1 mutations in more than 90% of patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16621918","rdfs:label":"2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9ca04597-ce08-4d45-999e-754bc4fb7266_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c9bdeb89-3821-4bdf-b7a1-5a9402af2538","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"NGS sequencing was employed and variants were confirmed using Sanger sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003701","obo:HP_0030230"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:9ca04597-ce08-4d45-999e-754bc4fb7266_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8ab185f0-f9e1-4006-a926-8d8b356cd488","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000540.3(RYR1):c.14752G>A (p.Asp4918Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA405690809"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28527222","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Central core disease and malignant hyperthermia are human disorders of skeletal muscle resulting from aberrant Ca2+ handling.

This resulted in 49 potential RyR1 interacting proteins, and 4 were selected for additional interaction studies: calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein (CHERP), endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment 53-kDa protein (LMAN1), T-complex protein, and phosphorylase kinase. Western blotting showed that only CHERP co-purified with affinity-tagged RyR1 and was eluted with imidazole.

Phenotypic expression of skeletal-type EC coupling by RyR1 with mutations in the K(3495)KKRR_ _R(3502) cluster was evaluated in dyspedic myotubes. The results indicated that charge neutralization or deletion severely depressed the magnitude of RyR1-mediated Ca(2+) transients coupled to voltage-dependent activation of the DHPR. Meantime the Ca(2+) content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum was not affected, and the amplitude and activation kinetics of the DHPR Ca(2+) currents were slightly affected. The data show that the DHPR beta-subunit, like alpha1S, interacts directly with RyR1 and is critical for the generation of high-speed Ca(2+) signals coupled to membrane depolarization. These findings indicate that EC coupling in skeletal muscle involves the interplay of at least two subunits of the DHPR, namely alpha1S and beta1a, interacting with possibly different domains of RyR1.","dc:creator":"Cheng W","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Interaction between the dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+ channel beta-subunit and ryanodine receptor type 1 strengthens excitation-contraction coupling."},"rdfs:label":"Calcium Transients - EC Coupling Assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fbd82373-705c-4b60-8b73-147ed461d357_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a868fda-38ff-47f5-848a-20996928b18a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64ed0704-7b0d-45a9-a471-1df74633f9cc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In CCD patients, cores are described as delimited regions of the muscle fiber in which overall ultrastructure is damaged and mitochondria are missing and/or nonfunctional.

In humans, the Y522S RYR1 mutation is associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) and the presence in skeletal muscle fibers of core regions that lack mitochondria. In heterozygous Y522S knock-in mice (RYR1(Y522S/WT)), the mutation causes SR Ca(2+) leak and MHS. Here, we identified mitochondrial-deficient core regions in skeletal muscle fibers from RYR1(Y522S/WT) knock-in mice and characterized the structural and temporal aspects involved in their formation. Mitochondrial swelling/disruption, the initial detectable structural change observed in young-adult RYR1(Y522S/WT) mice (2 months), does not occur randomly but rather is confined to discrete areas termed presumptive cores. This localized mitochondrial damage is followed by local disruption/loss of nearby SR and transverse tubules, resulting in early cores (2-4 months) and small contracture cores characterized by extreme sarcomere shortening and lack of mitochondria. At later stages (1 year), contracture cores are extended, frequent, and accompanied by areas in which contractile elements are also severely compromised (unstructured cores). Based on these observations, we propose a possible series of events leading to core formation in skeletal muscle fibers of RYR1(Y522S/WT) mice: Initial mitochondrial/SR disruption in confined areas causes significant loss of local Ca(2+) sequestration that eventually results in the formation of contractures and progressive degradation of the contractile elements.","dc:creator":"Boncompagni S","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Characterization and temporal development of cores in a mouse model of malignant hyperthermia."},"rdfs:label":"Knock-In Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1459,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:63d17607-42c1-4cd1-9134-1187f3ac15fa","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100150","gene":"hgnc:10483","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"RYR1 was reported in relation to autosomal dominant RYR1-related myopathy in 1993. At least 7 unique variants (missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 8220422, 12136074, 20888934, 17376685, 28527222, 25960145). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by knock-in mouse models, in vitro functional assays, and expression studies. In summary, RYR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant RYR1-related myopathy. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive RYR1-related myopathy and autosomal dominant malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fbd82373-705c-4b60-8b73-147ed461d357"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
