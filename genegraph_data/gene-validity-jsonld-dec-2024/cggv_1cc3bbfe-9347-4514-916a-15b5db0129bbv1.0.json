Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in thrombopoietin (THPO, c.112C>T) in both affected siblings. This mutation encodes an arginine to cysteine substitution at residue 38 or residue 17 excluding the 21-amino acid signal peptide of THPO receptor binding domain (RBD). THPO has 4 conserved cysteines in its RBD that form 2 disulfide bonds. Our in silico modeling predicts that introduction of a fifth cysteine may disrupt normal disulfide bonding to cause poor receptor binding. In functional assays, the mutant-THPO-containing media shows two- to threefold reduced ability to sustain UT7-TPO cells, which require THPO for proliferation. Both parents and a sibling with heterozygous R17C change have reduced platelet counts, whereas a sibling with wild-type sequence has normal platelet count. Thus, the R17C partial loss-of-function allele results in aplastic anemia in the homozygous state and mild thrombocytopenia in the heterozygous state in our family. Together with the recent identification of THPO receptor (MPL) mutations and the effects of THPO agonists in aplastic anemia, our results have clinical implications in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with aplastic anemia and highlight a role for the THPO-MPL pathway in hematopoiesis in vivo.

Because of its clinical phenotypes and the bone marrow morphology associated with this condition, hereditary thrombocytopenia can be misdiagnosed as primary immune thrombocytopenia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Therefore, genetic evidence is necessary for the accurate diagnosis of hereditary thrombocytopenia. Refractory cytopenia of childhood is a subgroup of myelodysplastic syndrome that was added to the World Health Organization classification in 2008. To investigate the germline and somatic variants associated with refractory cytopenia of childhood, we performed targeted multigene sequencing in three patients with refractory cytopenia of childhood. Of the three patients, one progressed from megakaryocytic hypoplasia with thrombocytopenia, and targeted multigene sequencing revealed THPO variants in this patient and his sister.

This study was undertaken to further delineate the putative binding domain on the Mpl receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that within the Mpl-EC domain 1 (Mpl-EC-D1), amino acids 102-251 were strongly involved in ligand binding. We subsequently expressed five subdomains within this region with T7 phage display. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays identified a short stretch of peptide located between residues 206 and 251 as the minimum binding domain for both TPO and hNUDC. A series of sequential Ala replacement mutations in the region were subsequently used to identify the specific residues most involved in ligand binding. Our results point to two hydrophobic residues, Leu(228) and Leu(230), as having substantial effects on hNUDC binding. For TPO binding, mutations in residues Asp(235) and Leu(239) had the largest effect on binding efficacy. In addition, deletion of the conservative motif WGSWS reduced binding capacity for hNUDC but not for TPO.

Conversly, Thrombocytopenia, congenital amegakaryocytic and Thrombocytopenia 9 were considered a single disease entity with semidominant inheritance resulting in milder thrombocytopenia in monoallelic individuals and more severe disease in biallelic cases.\n\n*THPO* was first reported in relation to congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia inherited in a semidominant manner in 2013 (Dasouki et al., PMID: 24085763) in a Micronesian family.\n \nNonsense, missense and frameshift variants have been reported in humans thus far.

Chen et al. showed that *THPO* physically interacts with MPL. (PMID: 20529857). A knock-out mouse model was generated by Sauvage et al, wherein homozygous KO mice recapitulated the thrombocytopenia phenotype while the heterozygous mice showed a significant reduction in platelet counts (PMID: 8627177). Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9 generated loss of function thpo-szy6 zebrafish had significant reduction of thpo expression and developed thrombocytopenia, as in humans (PMID: 35622056).\n\nIn summary, there is Definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *THPO* and autosomal recessive congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the Hemostatis and Thrombosis GCEP on March 29, 2022. It was re-evaluated on May 01, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of two probands (PMIDs: 36226497, 36534659) and a new zebrafish model (PMID: 35622056). Of note, the previous instance scored only the autosomal recessive cases but the evidence for a semidominant inheritance was considered sufficeint to update on re-evaluation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1cc3bbfe-9347-4514-916a-15b5db0129bb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
