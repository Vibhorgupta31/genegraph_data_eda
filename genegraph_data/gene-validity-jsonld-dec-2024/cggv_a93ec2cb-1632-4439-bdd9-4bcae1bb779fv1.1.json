Association between *PPM1D* variants and autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability (Jansen-de Vries syndrome) was first reported in 2017 (Jansen et al., PMID: 28343630). Since then, at least 20 truncating variants, most of which are *de novo*, have been reported in individuals with intellectual disability and/or developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral problems including autism spectrum disorder, high pain threshold, and facial dysmorphism (PMIDs: 28343630, 29758292, 30795918, 30979967, 31916397, 32399599). All the variants are located in the last or penultimate exon and are expected to escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which is supported by the presence of truncated *PPM1D* transcripts in patient-derived cells (PMID: 28343630). In addition, these cells showed a cell-growth disadvantage after exposure to ionizing radiation, suggesting a possible effect on the stress-response pathway (PMID: 28343630).\n\n*PPM1D* has a pLI of 0 in gnomAD (v2.1.1), with 49 observed truncating variants. Mosaic C-terminal truncating *PPM1D* variants in blood are associated with clonal hematopoiesis during aging and cancer therapy (PMID: 34963005). This suggests that some of the truncating variants in gnomAD, many of which exhibit allelic imbalance, may represent somatic mosaicism. \n\nIn summary, *PPM1D* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 15, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a93ec2cb-1632-4439-bdd9-4bcae1bb779f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
