The nature of the mutation has so far been reported in patients from six families world wide and eight different mutations were described. Here we report the mutational spectrum in 48 additional unrelated families of different geographic origin. We detected 27 novel mutations at the cDNA level, of which 26 could be attributed to changes at the genomic level. Furthermore, six mutations were detected that did not strongly affect SSADH activity when expressed in HEK 293 cells and are considered nonpathogenic allelic variants. Twenty of the mutations were only found in one family. The spectrum of disease-causing mutations from all patients sequenced thus far consists of 25 point mutations, four small insertions, and five small deletions. Seven of these mutations affect splice junctions, seven are nonsense mutations, and 12 are missense mutations. Although there were no mutational hotspots or prevalent mutations responsible for a significant number of cases, 14 out of 37 (38%) of the missense alleles were present in exon 4 or 5. With one exception, the missense mutations we consider to be causative of SSADH deficiency reduced the SSADH activity to less than 5% of the normal activity in our in vitro expression system. This indicates that residual expression is not likely to be an important factor contributing to the large phenotypic differences observed among different families and even among siblings, suggesting that other modifying factors are of great importance in disease pathology.","dc:creator":"Akaboshi S","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutational spectrum of the succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH5A1) gene and functional analysis of 27 novel disease-causing mutations in patients with SSADH deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14635103","rdfs:label":"Fam31-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:73655c9f-3ec5-45c5-86d2-37fdf242f3bb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ab35f32-1fc2-46e3-a365-550d5a667fd5","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Total RNA and genomic DNA were extracted from lymphoblastoid or epithelial cell lines derived from patients or from fresh lymphocytes or whole blood.

The neurological phenotype includes intellectual disability, autism spectrum, epilepsy and sleep and behavior disturbances. Approximately 70 variants have been reported in the ALDH5A1 gene, half of them being missense variants. In this study, 34 missense variants, of which 22 novel, were evaluated by in silico analyses using PolyPhen2 and SIFT prediction tools. Subsequently, the effect of these variants on SSADH activity was studied by transient overexpression in HEK293 cells. These studies showed severe enzymatic activity impairment for 27 out of 34 alleles, normal activity for one allele and a broad range of residual activities (25 to 74%) for six alleles. To better evaluate the alleles that showed residual activity above 25%, we generated an SSADH-deficient HEK293-Flp-In cell line using CRISPR-Cas9, in which these alleles were stably expressed. This model proved essential in the classification as deficient for one out of the seven studied alleles. For 8 out of 34 addressed alleles, there were discrepant results among the used prediction tools, and/or in correlating the results of the prediction tools with the functional data. In case of diagnostic urgency of missense alleles, we propose the use of the transient transfection model for confirmation of their effect on the SSADH catalytic function, since this model resulted in fast and robust functional characterization for the majority of the tested variants. In selected cases, stable transfections can be considered and may prove valuable.","dc:creator":"Pop A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Functional analysis of thirty-four suspected pathogenic missense variants in ALDH5A1 gene associated with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"SSADH activity assessment of ALDH5A1 variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c3e57466-df2f-4045-b374-010dbd334bfc_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:305327f7-faa2-4472-9521-a895680dcc01","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e983fde-a548-47b3-b8ff-e16aa477f59a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder of the GABA degradation pathway where consecutive elevation of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and GABA occur.

Metabolic studies in murine neural tissue have revealed elevated GABA [and its derivatives succinate semialdehyde (SSA), homocarnosine (HC), 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid (DHHA) and guanidinobutyrate (GB)] and GHB [and its analogue D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG)] at birth.

ALDH5A1 encodes the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, which is involved in the degradation pathway of GABA. SSADHD is a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, intellectual disability, ataxia, seizures, and behavioral problems. Approximately 50 pathogenic variants have been reported in the literature, including large deletions, and frameshift, nonsense and missense variants predicted or shown to cause loss or reduced enzyme function. There is experimental evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including a mouse model. In summary, ALDH5A1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.
