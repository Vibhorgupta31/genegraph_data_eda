We discovered nanomolar, selective allosteric inhibitors of MALT1 that bind by displacing the side chain of Trp580, locking the protease in an inactive conformation. Interestingly, we had previously identified a patient homozygous for a MALT1 Trp580-to-serine mutation who suffered from combined immunodeficiency. We show that the loss of tryptophan weakened interactions between the paracaspase and C-terminal immunoglobulin MALT1 domains resulting in protein instability, reduced protein levels and functions. Upon binding of allosteric inhibitors of increasing potency, we found proportionate increased stabilization of MALT1-W580S to reach that of wild-type MALT1. With restored levels of stable MALT1 protein, the most potent of the allosteric inhibitors rescued NF-κB and JNK signaling in patient lymphocytes. Following compound washout, MALT1 substrate cleavage was partly recovered. Thus, a molecular corrector rescues an enzyme deficiency by substituting for the mutated residue, inspiring new potential precision therapies to increase mutant enzyme activity in other deficiencies.","dc:creator":"Quancard J","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"An allosteric MALT1 inhibitor is a molecular corrector rescuing function in an immunodeficient patient."},"rdfs:label":"MALT1 expression in patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8c2ac432-4f6c-4295-865c-db3c83ac1834","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f9ae540-5e92-49f0-95e7-18e1efded09e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Stimulation of patient cells with MALT1 variant using anti-CD3 show a defect in NFKB activation, similar to what is seen in the mouse cells.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25762782","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The paracaspase MALT1 plays an important role in immune receptor-driven signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation. MALT1 promotes signaling by acting as a scaffold, recruiting downstream signaling proteins, as well as by proteolytic cleavage of multiple substrates. However, the relative contributions of these two different activities to T and B cell function are not well understood. To investigate how MALT1 proteolytic activity contributes to overall immune cell regulation, we generated MALT1 protease-deficient mice (Malt1(PD/PD)) and compared their phenotype with that of MALT1 knockout animals (Malt1(-/-)). Malt1(PD/PD) mice displayed defects in multiple cell types including marginal zone B cells, B1 B cells, IL-10-producing B cells, regulatory T cells, and mature T and B cells. In general, immune defects were more pronounced in Malt1(-/-) animals. Both mouse lines showed abrogated B cell responses upon immunization with T-dependent and T-independent Ags. In vitro, inactivation of MALT1 protease activity caused reduced stimulation-induced T cell proliferation, impaired IL-2 and TNF-α production, as well as defective Th17 differentiation. Consequently, Malt1(PD/PD) mice were protected in a Th17-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. Surprisingly, Malt1(PD/PD) animals developed a multiorgan inflammatory pathology, characterized by Th1 and Th2/0 responses and enhanced IgG1 and IgE levels, which was delayed by wild-type regulatory T cell reconstitution. We therefore propose that the pathology characterizing Malt1(PD/PD) animals arises from an immune imbalance featuring pathogenic Th1- and Th2/0-skewed effector responses and reduced immunosuppressive compartments. These data uncover a previously unappreciated key function of MALT1 protease activity in immune homeostasis and underline its relevance in human health and disease.

Autosomal recessive MALT1 deficiency is associated with a combination of recurrent bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, periodontal disease, enteropathy, dermatitis, and failure to thrive. Immunological defects are variable, but typically include normal total T lymphocyte numbers, impaired B cell development with normal/decreased numbers, and variable eosinophilia. There is impaired T cell mitogen proliferation and reduction in Foxp3+ regulatory CD4 T (Treg) cells as well as T helper 17 (TH17) cells. 11 variants have been reported and are composed of missense, frameshift, splice site and indel variants resulting in the loss of function of MALT1. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. 7 unique variants from 7 individuals across 6 publications were curated  (PMID: 23727036, 27253662, 24332264, 31037583, 32858082, 25627829). Heterozygous carriers have not been shown to have a clinical phenotype. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (12 pts).\n\nExperimentally, in vitro studies studying MALT1 function use patient derived cells to support this gene-disease relationship. MALT1 is a paracaspase that regulates antigen receptor signaling pathways in lymphocytes. In response to antigen receptor signaling, -MALT1 serves as a scaffold protein for BCL10 and associates with CARD family proteins to generate the CBM signalosome complex. This CBM complex recruits signaling intermediates that lead to the activation of the NF-kB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. The MALT1 protein has been shown to be expressed in T and B lymphocytes and is absent in patients with biallelic MALT1 variants with associated CID (PMID:30692685). In vitro functional data demonstrates altered NF-kB signaling in patient cells with MALT1 variants, with associated changes in downstream activation, proliferation, and cytokine production in lymphocytes (PMID:30692685). Mouse models of MALT1 deficiency or alterations of the protease domain show defects in generation and maintenance of B and T lymphocytes, alterations in Foxp3+ regulatory T cell development and alterations in serum immunoglobulin levels (PMID:14576442, 26405015, 25762782). These phenotypic changes are associated with alteration in NF-kB signaling, replicating those defects seen in patients. In summary, MALT1 is definitively associated with combined immunodeficiency. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 7/21/2022  (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:537efc87-5f45-489b-9aa0-6bd3e029754e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
