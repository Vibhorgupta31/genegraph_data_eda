Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Ferreira 2021 ICMD review"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"EP elected to consider 6-9 genes with shared function."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:0c3a57a6-2bdb-420d-80fc-58a65a7863fb_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8509c086-37d4-4e4b-87af-8800ac05dc7b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:081bad5d-47b3-49a8-a6ca-f68498fa8263","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Immunoblot analysis: decreased abundance of mutant MIP\nAccumulation of MIP target, large mitoribosomal subunit (mtLSU) protein, elevated levels of long isoform  bL12m compared to controls\nBN-PAGE showed decrease in complexes I, IV, V levels\nLentiviral transduction of MIPEP cDNA into patient cells restored bL12m processing and OXPHOS abundance. \nResults replicated in HEK293 FT cells carrying both hypomorphic MIPEP variants, two clones tested (Fig3).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34620555","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and targeted to mitochondria via N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signals (MTS) that are proteolytically removed upon import. Sometimes, MTS removal is followed by a cleavage of an octapeptide by the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), encoded by the MIPEP gene. Previously, MIPEP variants were linked to four cases of multisystemic disorder presenting with cardiomyopathy, developmental delay, hypotonia and infantile lethality. We report here a patient carrying compound heterozygous MIPEP variants-one was not previously linked to mitochondrial disease-who did not have cardiomyopathy and who is alive at the age of 20 years. This patient had developmental delay, global hypotonia, mild optic neuropathy and mild ataxia. Functional characterization of patient fibroblasts and HEK293FT cells carrying MIPEP hypomorphic alleles demonstrated that deficient MIP activity was linked to impaired post-import processing of subunits from four of the five OXPHOS complexes and decreased abundance and activity of some of these complexes in human cells possibly underlying the development of mitochondrial disease. Thus, our work expands the genetic and clinical spectrum of MIPEP-linked disease and establishes MIP as an important regulator of OXPHOS biogenesis and function in human cells.","dc:creator":"Pulman J","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Variants in the MIPEP gene presenting with complex neurological phenotype without cardiomyopathy, impair OXPHOS protein maturation and lead to a reduced OXPHOS abundance in patient cells."},"rdfs:label":"Patient skin fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:0c3a57a6-2bdb-420d-80fc-58a65a7863fb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3518b6d8-de4c-4068-87d1-9bb7126be69f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3518b6d8-de4c-4068-87d1-9bb7126be69f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":10,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:6fa38de9-c743-4300-93ba-d42a1142e9a9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005932.4(MIPEP):c.304C>T (p.Pro102Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6913399"}},{"id":"cggv:283aa5f1-3a53-4d0b-ae38-7844b83aa3b1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"GRCh37/hg19 13q12.12(chr13:23519916-24941516)x1","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/208634"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"At age 10 months, the proband developed seizures and was diagnosed with West syndrome.

The *MIPEP* gene encodes mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), a presequence protease which cleaves proteins that are imported into the mitochondrion to their mature size.  \n\nThe *MIPEP* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2016 (PMID: 27799064), in four unrelated patients with a severe infantile onset disorder characterized by global developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC).  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MIPEP*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MIPEP* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 14 unique variants (10 missense, one nonsense, one frameshift and two large deletions) reported in eight cases from five publications (PMIDs: 27799064, 35598585, 31607746, 27391121, 34620555). Subsequent publications have reported a consistent early-onset disease characterized by global developmental delay with or without a cardiac phenotype. Phenotypic heterogeneity is observed with additional features such as failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, optic atrophy, hypertonia, and microcephaly variably reported. When performed, muscle biopsies showed glycogen accumulation, lipid droplet accumulation within mitochondria, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, as well as variable decreases in mitochondrial respiratory complex activities I, III and IV.  \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and studies in patient fibroblast cells (PMIDs: 33340416, 34620555).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *MIPEP* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
