Mutations in the paired box 6 (PAX6) gene are considered the major cause of aniridia. In this study, we identified four mutations exclusively presented in aniridia patients from a four-generation Chinese pedigree, including two single nucleotide substitutions in the 3'UTR of PAX6 (NM_000280.4:c.[*76G>A; *2977C>A]) and two missense mutations in tripartite motif containing 44 (TRIM44, NM_017583.4:c.[191C>A; 463G>A]), which lead to amino acid changes p.S64Y and p.G155R, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the two 3'UTR mutations of PAX6 disrupted microRNA binding motifs in the wildtype 3'UTR sequence. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting with predicted microRNAs showed that the two 3'UTR mutations could only increase or have no effect on the expression of PAX6. Therefore, they would not be the cause of aniridia that resulted from PAX6 deficiency. Instead, we found that overexpression of TRIM44 significantly reduced the expression of PAX6 in human lens epithelial cells, and the p.G155R mutant exhibited much stronger effect than the wildtype form. We conclude that inhibition of PAX6 expression by mutant TRIM44 is a novel pathogenic mechanism for aniridia.","dc:creator":"Zhang X","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Variants in TRIM44 Cause Aniridia by Impairing PAX6 Expression."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c03ad7e1-74ea-4c47-b372-5beb8fbf4e97_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c03ad7e1-74ea-4c47-b372-5beb8fbf4e97_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b53d8c09-19f7-48c1-8e34-7e4a0e40dfd7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67fe4e46-4e48-468f-b9ed-762e375a9f34","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Overexpression of wildtype TRIM44 significantly reduced the expression of PAX6 mRNA and proteins, compared to that transfected with empty vectors ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394807","rdfs:label":"Functional analyses of mutations found in aniridia patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c03ad7e1-74ea-4c47-b372-5beb8fbf4e97_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c03ad7e1-74ea-4c47-b372-5beb8fbf4e97_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":8541,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":2,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e9d5922c-c85f-4331-89b0-7f393016642d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014938","gene":"hgnc:19016","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*TRIM44* encodes Tripartite Motif Containing 44, a protein belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. *TRIM44* was mapped to 11p13 in a study (PMID:10568747) searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor-aniridia-genital anomalies-retardation). In 7 affected members of 4-generation Chinese family with aniridia linked to chromosome 11p13, Zhang et al. (PMID: 26394807) identified a heterozygous missense variant, c.463G>A (p.Gly155Arg), in exon 1 of *TRIM44*. The mutation segregated fully with aniridia in the family. Functional analysis in the human lens epithelial cell line HLE-B3 showed that overexpression of wildtype *TRIM44* significantly reduced the expression of PAX6 at the mRNA and protein levels, while the p.Gly155Arg mutation enhanced TRIM44 activity relative to the wild-type control (PMID: 26394807). There is only one published study reporting this gene-disease association to date, so there is limited but suggestive evidence to support the relationship between *TRIM44* and ocular dysgenesis caused by defects in *PAX6* regulation. While more case-level and experimental evidence is needed to establish this gene-disease relationship definitively, no contradictory evidence has yet emerged.
