However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which p73 stability is regulated are unclear. During the search for interacting molecules with the COOH-terminal proline-rich region of p73, we identified a novel NEDD4-related protein (termed as NEDL2) which contains a C2 domain at its NH(2)-terminus, two WW domains, and a HECT domain at its COOH-terminus. As expected, NEDL2 catalyzed the ubiquitination of bacterial cellular proteins in vitro. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro pull-down assays revealed that NEDL2 bound to p73, which carries two putative PY motifs. p73 was efficiently ubiquitinated but stabilized in a NEDL2-dependent manner. Accordingly, p73 decayed at faster rates in the absence of NEDL2 than in its presence. Consistent with the NEDL2-mediated stabilization of p73, NEDL2 enhanced the p73-dependent transcriptional activation. Thus, our results suggest that NEDL2 activates the function of p73 by increasing its stability.","dc:creator":"Miyazaki K","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"A novel HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDL2, stabilizes p73 and enhances its transcriptional activity."},"rdfs:label":"Interaction with TP73"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:191cff25-f54c-4628-87f6-13a5daaec847_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6460ae53-9a4d-450f-9db5-bdfcb70e0c67","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1ea8651-91da-4c7c-9d24-4ed2ed3e11bc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Co-injection of HECW2 RNA significantly ameliorated the opaque tissues in the brain region leading to a notable decline of onset frequency compared to corresponding morpholino oligo injection alone.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33205896","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is a severe encephalopathy in infants and early childhood.

To date, at least 20 missense variants in *HECW2*, including 4 recurrent variants, have been reported in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability (100%), developmental language disorder (100%) and hypotonia (100%). Other common features are behavioral problems (89%) including autism spectrum disorder or autistic features, vision problems (84%), motor coordination/movement abnormalities (75%), gastrointestinal issues (70%), and seizures (61%). All reported variants with known inheritance are *de novo* missense variants; the majority are located in the C-terminal area of the protein, and particularly in the C-terminal HECT domain of HECW2. The disease mechanism of HECW2-related autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder is still unclear. Of note, homozygous *HECW2* loss-of-function variants have been reported in two unrelated individuals with a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype (PMIDs: 35487419, 35753050); the disease relationship in these cases will be curated separately.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is further supported by experimental evidence. Transcriptional knockdown of zebrafish hecw2a led to early brain development abnormalities (PMID: 33205896). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and *in vitro* pull-down assays revealed that HECW2 bound to TP73 and activated its function by increasing its stability (PMID: 12890487). Null variants of *TP73* are associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia-47 and lissencephaly.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *HECW2* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
