The functional importance of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 in renal ion transport has recently been highlighted by mutations in the human Kir4.1 gene (KCNJ10) that result in seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, mental retardation, and electrolyte imbalance (SeSAME)/epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness, and renal tubulopathy (EAST) syndrome, a complex disorder that includes salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis. Here, we investigated the role of the Kir5.1 subunit in mice with a targeted disruption of the Kir5.1 gene (Kcnj16). The Kir5.1(-/-) mice displayed hypokalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with hypercalciuria. The short-term responses to hydrochlorothiazide, an inhibitor of ion transport in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), were also exaggerated, indicating excessive renal Na(+) absorption in this segment. Furthermore, chronic treatment with hydrochlorothiazide normalized urinary excretion of Na(+) and Ca(2+), and abolished acidosis in Kir5.1(-/-) mice. Finally, in contrast to WT mice, electrophysiological recording of K(+) channels in the DCT basolateral membrane of Kir5.1(-/-) mice revealed that, even though Kir5.1 is absent, there is an increased K(+) conductance caused by the decreased pH sensitivity of the remaining homomeric Kir4.1 channels. In conclusion, disruption of Kcnj16 induces a severe renal phenotype that, apart from hypokalemia, is the opposite of the phenotype seen in SeSAME/EAST syndrome. These results highlight the important role that Kir5.1 plays as a pH-sensitive regulator of salt transport in the DCT, and the implication of these results for the correct genetic diagnosis of renal tubulopathies is discussed.","dc:creator":"Paulais M","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Renal phenotype in mice lacking the Kir5.1 (Kcnj16) K+ channel subunit contrasts with that observed in SeSAME/EAST syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Expression-level evidence from Humphrey's lab"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7ddfc279-2ec5-4736-b65f-c2b4a0735a1c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:841becde-d2a0-4fd2-97c1-84669181b9d1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Impairment of KCNJ16 function, and therefore the movement of potassium through the Kir4.1/Kir5.1 heterodimers, causes serious kidney complications that, excluding hypokalemia, is the reverse of the physiological effects in SeSAME/EAST syndrome.

To define the importance of Kir5.1 in blood pressure control under conditions of salt-induced hypertension, we generated a Kcnj16 knockout in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats (SSKcnj16-/-). SSKcnj16-/- rats exhibited hypokalemia and reduced blood pressure, and when fed a high-salt diet (4% NaCl), experienced 100% mortality within a few days triggered by salt wasting and severe hypokalemia. Electrophysiological recordings of basolateral K+ channels in the collecting ducts isolated from SSKcnj16-/- rats revealed activity of only homomeric Kir4.1 channels. Kir4.1 expression was upregulated in SSKcnj16-/- rats, but the protein was predominantly localized in the cytosol in SSKcnj16-/- rats. Benzamil, but not hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide, rescued this phenotype from mortality on a high-salt diet. Supplementation of high-salt diet with increased potassium (2% KCl) prevented mortality in SSKcnj16-/- rats and prevented or mitigated hypertension in SSKcnj16-/- or control SS rats, respectively. Our results demonstrate that Kir5.1 channels are key regulators of renal salt handling in SS hypertension.","dc:creator":"Palygin O","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Essential role of Kir5.1 channels in renal salt handling and blood pressure control."},"rdfs:label":"Rat model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"No mention of specific variants.

Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: hypokalemic tubulopathy and deafness (OMIM ID: 619406). Seven variants (missense and nonsense) that have been reported in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 33840812, 33811157) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function, as nonsense variants are implicated in disease, but missense variants are too. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (ie. rat/mouse models, expression-level evidence, biochemical evidence; PMIDs: 21633011, 21047793, 21047793). In summary, KCNJ10 is strongly associated with autosomal recessive hypokalemic tubulopathy and deafness. The gene-disease assertion has held up for less than three years, as it was just made in 2021. \nIndividual homozygous for Lys48Ter variant should be scored at 2 as variant should be downgraded 1 point for homozygosity/consanguinity. Individuals homozygous for Arg137Cys/Thr64Ile should each be scored at 0.6 instead of 1 due to the functional evidence only counting once for homozygosity. Genetic evidence should total to 6.7 instead of 8.5. The experimental evidence totals to 5, so the sum of the evidence should be 11.7, which rounds up to 12, meeting strong. Gene disease assertion was just made in 2021, so definitive is not met.
