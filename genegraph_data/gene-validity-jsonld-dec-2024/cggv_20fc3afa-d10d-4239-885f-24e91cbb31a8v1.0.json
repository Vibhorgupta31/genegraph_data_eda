Since then, several reports have been published describing a large variety of genetic defects resulting in the Goltz-Gorlin syndrome, and mutations or deletions were also reported in angioma serpiginosum, the pentalogy of Cantrell and Limb-Body Wall Complex. Here we present a review of the published mutations in the PORCN gene to date and report on seven new mutations together with the corresponding clinical data. Based on the review we have created a Web-based locus-specific database that lists all identified variants and allows the inclusion of future reports. The database is based on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) software, and is accessible online at http://www.lovd.nl/porcn. At present, the database contains 106 variants, representing 68 different mutations, scattered along the whole coding sequence of the PORCN gene, and 12 large gene rearrangements, which brings up to 80 the number of unique mutations identified in Goltz-Gorlin syndrome patients.","dc:creator":"Lombardi MP","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutation update for the PORCN gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21472892","rdfs:label":"PORCN_00027"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"no genome wide screen"},{"id":"cggv:963bbb2e-f34e-46bc-a2f8-2a6c397d7174_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81d284be-5296-4223-b29d-813724631a8e","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Direct Sequencing / MLPA","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:963bbb2e-f34e-46bc-a2f8-2a6c397d7174_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:d0279dea-a967-482a-8dbe-7e526469375e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001282167.2(PORCN):c.-142A>G (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA412841384"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21472892"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21472892","rdfs:label":"PORCN_00001"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"no genome wide screen"},{"id":"cggv:b01ced92-4a22-43b9-97ab-14ca763a31c4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92938db8-5ade-4737-bae2-f41cd4686b0c","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:b01ced92-4a22-43b9-97ab-14ca763a31c4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:50996ec7-917b-4e4d-b926-365aa6c7725e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001282167.2(PORCN):c.836A>T (p.Glu279Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA412848850"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19277062","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH) is an X-linked developmental disorder with male lethality characterized by patchy dermal hypoplasia, skeletal and dental malformations, and microphthalmia or anophthalmia. Recently, heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PORCN gene have been described to cause FDH. FDH shows some clinical overlap with the microphthalmia with linear skin defects (MLS) syndrome, another X-linked male lethal condition, associated with mutations of HCCS in the majority of cases. We performed DNA sequencing of PORCN in 13 female patients with the clinical diagnosis of FDH as well as four female patients with MLS syndrome and no mutation in HCCS. We identified PORCN mutations in all female patients with FDH. Eleven patients seem to have constitutional PORCN alterations in the heterozygous state and two individuals are mosaic for the heterozygous sequence change in PORCN. No PORCN mutation was identified in the MLS-affected patients, providing further evidence that FDH and MLS do not overlap genetically. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) analysis revealed a random or slightly skewed XCI pattern in leukocytes of individuals with intragenic PORCN mutation suggesting that defective PORCN does not lead to selective growth disadvantage, at least in leukocytes. We conclude that the PORCN mutation detection rate is high in individuals with a clear-cut FDH phenotype and somatic mosaicism can be present in a significant proportion of patients with mild or classic FDH.","dc:creator":"Harmsen MB","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Goltz-Gorlin (focal dermal hypoplasia) and the microphthalmia with linear skin defects (MLS) syndrome: no evidence of genetic

dermal hypoplasia (FDH) is an X-linked dominant disorder featuring developmental abnormalities of ectodermal and mesodermal tissues. Pathogenic mutations in the PORCN gene (locus Xp11.23) were identified in 2007 and thus far 27 different mutations have been reported. PORCN encodes a putative O-acyltransferase which facilitates secretion of Wnt proteins required for ectomesodermal tissue development. We investigated PORCN gene pathology and pattern of X-chromosome inactivation analysis in two unrelated Caucasian female patients who presented with multiple developmental abnormalities consistent with FDH. We also reviewed the clinical and molecular data for all reported PORCN mutations and assessed genotype-phenotype correlation for sporadic and familial cases of FDH. DNA sequencing revealed two new PORCN gene mutations: p.W282X and c.74delG (p.G25fsX51). X-chromosome inactivation analysis revealed a random pattern in one case but was uninformative in the other. Collectively, point/small mutations account for 24 out of the 29 PORCN mutations and are typically seen in sporadic cases; larger deletions are more common in familial cases. Identification of two new PORCN gene mutations confirms the importance of PORCN-associated Wnt signalling in embryogenesis. Both new cases showed Blaschko-linear dermal hypoplasia and extensive ectomesodermal abnormalities, including severe limb developmental anomalies and a giant cell tumour of bone in one patient. Clinical variability can be attributed to the degree of lyonization and postzygotic genomic mosaicism, which are important mechanisms in determining the clinical presentation.","dc:creator":"Clements

Wnt proteins play important roles in embryo development, tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance.
