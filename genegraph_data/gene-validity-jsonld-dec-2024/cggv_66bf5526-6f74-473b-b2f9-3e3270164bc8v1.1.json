Using autozygosity mapping, we identified two families, each with three affected siblings sharing large overlapping homozygous regions that harbored the IMPG2 gene on chromosome 3. Sequence analysis of IMPG2 in the two index cases revealed homozygous mutations cosegregating with the disease in the respective families: three affected siblings of Iraqi Jewish ancestry displayed a nonsense mutation, and a Dutch family displayed a 1.8 kb genomic deletion that removes exon 9 and results in the absence of seven amino acids in a conserved SEA domain of the IMPG2 protein. Transient transfection of COS-1 cells showed that a construct expressing the wild-type SEA domain is properly targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas the mutant lacking the seven amino acids appears to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutation analysis in ten additional index cases that were of Dutch, Israeli, Italian, and Pakistani origin and had homozygous regions encompassing IMPG2 revealed five additional mutations; four nonsense mutations and one missense mutation affecting a highly conserved phenylalanine residue. Most patients with IMPG2 mutations showed an early-onset form of RP with progressive visual-field loss and deterioration of visual acuity. The patient with the missense mutation, however, was diagnosed with maculopathy. The IMPG2 gene encodes the interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan IMPG2, which is a constituent of the interphotoreceptor matrix. Our data therefore show that mutations in a structural component of the interphotoreceptor matrix can cause arRP.","dc:creator":"Bandah-Rozenfeld D","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in IMPG2, encoding interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2, cause autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66bf5526-6f74-473b-b2f9-3e3270164bc8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66bf5526-6f74-473b-b2f9-3e3270164bc8_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2bc979f-3450-4344-b4eb-3b79a592fa6d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2cec030-5cbe-402e-a0ac-0cd80a12402f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Transcriptomic profiling of more than 75 human tissues revealed that IMPG1 mRNA levels are the highest in retinal tissues (https://eyeintegration.nei.nih.gov/).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239781","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The human eye is built from several specialized tissues which direct, capture and pre-process information to provide vision.

IMPG2 is expressed by photoreceptors and incorporated into the matrix that surrounds the inner and outer segments (OS) of rods and cones, but the mechanism of IMPG2-RP remains unclear. Loss of Impg2 function in mice produces a mild, late-onset photoreceptor phenotype without the characteristic OS loss that occurs in human patients. We generated retinal organoids (ROs) from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and gene-edited embryonic stem cells to model human IMPG2-RP inÂ vitro. All ROs harboring IMPG2 mutations lacked an OS layer, in contrast to isogenic controls. Subsequent protein analyses revealed that this phenotype arises due to a loss of IMPG2 expression or its inability to undergo normal post-translational modifications. We hypothesized that loss of IMPG2 function destabilizes the interphotoreceptor matrix and renders the OS vulnerable to physical stressors, which is accentuated in the tissue culture environment. In support of this mechanism, transplantation of IMPG2 mutant ROs into the protected subretinal space of immunocompromised rodents restored OS production. Beyond providing a robust platform to study IMPG2-RP, this human RO model system may serve a broader role in honing strategies to treat advanced photoreceptor-based diseases.","dc:creator":"Mayerl SJ","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Human retinal organoids harboring IMPG2 mutations exhibit a photoreceptor outer segment phenotype that models advanced retinitis pigmentosa."},"rdfs:label":"Patient retinal organoid rescue by CRISPR/Cas9-based editing"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Down-scoring is recommended due to the use of retinal organoids to model a late onset disease in the context of IPM and photoreceptor development.

Activities crucial to vision occur within the IPM, including trafficking of nutrients and metabolites, retinal attachment, and interactions needed for normal outer segment phagocytosis. The IPM includes the following two unique proteoglycans: IPM proteoglycan 1 (IMPG1) and IMPG2. Patients with mutations in IMPG1/IMPG2 develop visual deficits with subretinal material accumulation, highlighting the critical role of the IPM in vision. To determine the role of these proteoglycans in retinal physiology and the pathologic mechanisms that lead to vision loss, we generated mouse models lacking IMPG1/IMPG2. In normal retina, IMPG1 and IMPG2 occupy distinct IPM compartments, represent the main source of chondroitin sulfate and are fundamental for the constitution of the cone-specific glycocalyx stained by the PNA (peanut agglutinin) lectin marker. No evident morphologic or functional deficits were found in mice lacking IMPG1. In the absence of IMPG2, IMPG1 abnormally accumulated at the subretinal space need, likely leading to the formation of subretinal lesions and reduced visual function. Interestingly, mice lacking both IMPG1 and IMPG2, regardless of sex, showed normal retinal structure and function, demonstrating that the aberrant IMPG1 distribution is the main cause of the visual alterations observed in the absence of IMPG2. In conclusion, our results show the dependence of secreted proteoglycans such as IMPG1 on the extracellular environment to properly integrate into the matrix, demonstrate the role of IMPG2 in shaping the IPM, and shed light on the potential mechanisms leading to the development of subretinal lesions and vision loss.","dc:creator":"Salido EM","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Proteoglycan IMPG2 Shapes the Interphotoreceptor Matrix and Modulates Vision."},"rdfs:label":"CRISPR/Cas9-based disruption of mouse Impg2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The mouse model recapitulates both histological and visual response features of the human patients, and also matches the mode of inheritance.

The histopathological examination of Impg2-KO mice revealed irregularly arranged rod cells and mislocalized rhodopsin protein in the inner segment at 6Â months of age. In addition to the pathological changes in rod cells, cone cells were also affected in KO retinas. KO retinas exhibited progressive cone cell death and impaired cone cell elongation. Further immunoblotting analysis revealed increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins, including C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein (BIP) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), in Impg2-KO mouse retinas. Increased gliosis and apoptotic cell death were also observed in the KO retinas.

The results showed that autophagy was impaired in KO retinas, as revealed by the increased accumulation of SQSTM1 and other proteins involved in autophagy.

The known spectrum of recessive disease continued to expand with reports of individuals affected with retinitis pigmentosa with relatively early macular involvement (PMID: 24876279) or rod-cone dystrophy (PMID: 31264916). *IMPG2* variants were subsequently identified as the basis for autosomal dominant inheritance of vitelliform macular dystrophy (PMID: 25085631), raising the question of whether this disease entity is distinct from retinitis pigmentosa or whether they can occur within the same families. Cases diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 56 generally exhibit features such as night blindness, progressive visual loss, macular retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling / atrophy, decreased ERG amplitudes (affecting rods more severely than cones), color vision defect, peripheral visual field loss, central scotoma, retinal blood vessel attenuation, and/or optic disc pallor. These features are largely distinct from the vitelliform macular dystrophy phenotypes, which include foveal vitelliform lesions, dome-shaped foveal detachment with material above the RPE, normal to mildly decreased visual acuity, normal or decreased amplitude ERG responses, and central RPE atrophy. The two disease entities strongly correlate with mode of inheritance, so that biallelic loss-of-function consistently associates with retinitis pigmentosa, while monoallelic loss-of-function consistently associates with vitelliform macular dystrophy. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (monoallelic vs. biallelic *IMPG2* loss of function) and mode of inheritance (autosomal dominant vs. autosomal recessive) appear to be distinct between patients with vitelliform macular dystrophy 5 (MIM# 616152) or retinitis pigmentosa 56 (MIM# 613581). Therefore, cases caused by inherited *IMPG2* variants have been split into two separate disease entities. The present curation has focused on autosomal recessive cases and is referred to as IMPG2-related recessive retinopathy.\n\nTen suspected disease-causing variants were scored as part of this curation (five nonsense, one frameshift, one canonical splice site disruption, one in-frame exon deletion, and two missense). These variants have been collectively reported in eight probands in four publications (PMID: 24876279, PMID: 20673862, PMID: 31264916, PMID: 34990796). All eight of the probands scored in this curation harbored two variant alleles within the *IMPG2*. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of *IMPG2* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Three families with segregation evidence contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship (PMID: 24876279). Additional genetic evidence was available but was not necessary to include in this curation, as the maximum for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that *IMPG2* encodes a component of the interphotoreceptor matrix (PMID: 10542133), an insoluble extracellular layer located between the retinal pigment epithelium and the neural retina that is known to support the function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells (PMID: 7344830). The *IMPG2* gene similarly encodes a component of this structure (PMID: 10601738) and harbors variants associated with vitelliform macular dystrophy 4 and retinitis pigmentosa 91 (PMID: 23993198), PMID: 32817297). Gene expression profiling across human tissues shows that *IMPG2* mRNA levels are at their highest in retinal tissues (PMID: 30239781). Zebrafish with morpholino-based *Impg2* silencing exhibit decreased cone and rod photoreceptor outer segment length (PMID: 32817297). Mouse models with homozygous CRISPR/Cas9-based *Impg2* disruption exhibit a phenotype with features of human retinitis pigmentosa and vitelliform macular dystrophy, including development of subretinal hyper-reflective vitelliform lesions, mislocalization of Impg1, reduction in the amplitudes of rod and cone ERG responses (PMID: 32265257), disorganization of cone-specific markers, pigmentary retinopathy, and enhanced apoptosis / decreased thickness of the outer nuclear layer (PMID: 32242237). Finally, retinal organoids derived from a compound heterozygous patient exhibit defective development of both the inner photoreceptor matrix and outer segment, and can be rescued by correction of both *Impg2* alleles (PMID: 36206764).\n\nIn summary, *IMPG2* is definitively associated with IMPG2-related recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 3rd, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:66bf5526-6f74-473b-b2f9-3e3270164bc8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
