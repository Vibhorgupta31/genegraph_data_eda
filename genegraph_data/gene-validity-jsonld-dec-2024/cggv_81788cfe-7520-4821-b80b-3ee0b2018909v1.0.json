Seven probands, 4 heterozygotes, 2 compound heterozygotes, and 1 homozygote, belonging to FH families were tested. In all cases, previous genetic analysis and/or LDL receptor fibroblast assay had shown that the disease was due to defects in the LDLR gene. Out of the nine mutations expected, one nonsense mutation in exon 2 and six missense mutations were identified in exons 3, 6, 8, 11, and 15. Two of the latter were found in exon 6. In each family, cosegregation of the base substitution and the disease was observed. Ninety-five control subjects were screened for the presence of the six missense mutations. None was detected, implying that the mutations identified are deleterious. Our results indicate that the SSCP analysis of amplified genomic DNA fragments can be successfully used to rapidly screen mutation containing exons in large genes. Furthermore, all these mutations are newly described and demonstrate heterogeneity of LDLR gene mutations responsible for FH in the French population, as in other reported Caucasian populations.","dc:creator":"Loux N","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Screening for new mutations in the LDL receptor gene in seven French familial hypercholesterolemia families by the single strand conformation polymorphism method."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1301940","rdfs:label":"Case 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Individual is homozygous for a nonsense variation that has been shown to result in degradation of LDLR.

Even an autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity, as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels vary widely within the same pedigree. Molecular screening for LDL receptor ( LDLR) mutations among 75 patients with clinically apparent FH led to identification of a novel splice-site mutation (IVS14+1 G>A) shared by 14 patients. Genealogical research confirmed that all 14 carriers were part of the same 1135-member pedigree with a common ancestor. The mutation resulted in an abruptly truncated LDLR protein, reducing functional LDLR activity by half in heterozygous carriers of the mutant allele. Of the 208 members of the kindred who were screened for the presence of this LDLR mutation, we identified 94 carriers and 114 noncarriers. Nine principal apolipoprotein genes that might affect LDL cholesterol differentially according to LDL-receptor status were examined in this pedigree. Strikingly lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol values were observed among the majority of the LDLR mutation carriers who were simultaneously homozygous for the -265C variant of apoA-II (total cholesterol: 324 +/- 8 vs 244 +/- 19 mg/dl, P = 0.0015; LDL-cholesterol: 237 +/- 8 vs 155 +/- 18 mg/dl, P = 0.0008). In vitro transfection assays showed that transcriptional activity of the apoA-II promoter was reduced by 30% in the -265C variant as compared with the -265T variant. We thus concluded that one variant of the apoA-II gene was associated with reduced plasma LDL cholesterol only in FH patients.","dc:creator":"Takada D","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Interaction between the LDL-receptor gene bearing a novel mutation and a variant in the apolipoprotein A-II promoter: molecular study in a 1135-member familial hypercholesterolemia kindred."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12522687","rdfs:label":"K635 proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This variant is shown to cause a cryptic splicing donor site in exon 15 that leads to the insertion f 214bp of intronic sequence resulting in a premature termination codon.

In this unique mutant strain (derived from subject J.D.), the cell surface receptor for plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) was able to bind 125I-labeled LDL normally, but internalization of the receptor-bound lipoprotein failed to occur. Thus the defect in this strain differed from the defects found in the fibroblasts from the other 21 FH homozygote strains in which the binding of 125I-LDL to the receptor was either absent (receptor-negative) or markedly reduced (receptor-defective). The LDL receptor in the J.D. cells exhibited first, normal kinetics of high affinity binding at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C; second, normal specificity (affinity for LDL more than 200 fold greater than for HDL); third, normal susceptibility to feed-back suppression by 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol; and fourth, a normal rate of turnover when the cells were treated with cycloheximide. Despite its normal ability to bind 125I-LDL, the LDL receptor in the J.D. cells failed to transport its LDL into the cell, and degradation of the lipoprotein in cellular lysosomes therefore did not occur. As a result, the lipoprotein did not suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity; nor did it activate cholesteryl ester formation. A phenocopy of the internalization defect in the J.D. cells could be created by incubation of normal fibroblasts with N-ethyl maleimide, an agent that did not affect 125I-LDL binding to the receptor but blocked its subsequent internalization by the cell.

Xanthomas can also be observed in individuals with biallelic LDLR variants.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia due to genetic variation in the LDLR gene therefore follows a dosage dependent pattern, consistent with semidominant inheritance, in which the presence of biallelic variants results in an earlier onset, more severe phenotype than individuals with a monoallelic variant.\n\nAs such, a semidominant mode of inheritance was chosen and this curation includes evidence from  individuals reported to have autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance. Thousands of variants in LDLR have been described including nonsense, missense, frameshift, large and small deletions, duplications, and more, per ClinVar and LOVD databases. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, functional data, and model organisms. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for more than 40 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data is available and the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) and experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. The mechanism of pathogenicity for this gene-disease relationship is loss of function, in which the receptor is not able to effectively bind and/or internalize plasma LDL for degradation, thus resulting in increased levels of LDL in the arteries (PMID:189940). This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, biochemical  studies, protein interaction, in vitro functional assays, and rescue assays (PMIDS:2280177, 8349823, 17080197). In summary, LDLR is definitively associated with familial hypercholesterolemia in a semidominant inheritance pattern. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease relationship was approved on Feb 24, 2021 by the General Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:81788cfe-7520-4821-b80b-3ee0b2018909"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
