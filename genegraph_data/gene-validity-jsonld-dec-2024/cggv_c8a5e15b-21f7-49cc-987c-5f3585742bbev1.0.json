Molecular analysis revealed the prevalent mutation in the HADHA gene in all 58 examined cases. Twenty patients died. The number of detections and number of deaths were respectively 9 and 4 (44%) in the patients recognized by differential diagnosis, 28 and 9 (32%) - by selective screening, and 11 and 1 (9%) - by NBS. In 80% of cases the death occurred before or within 3 weeks from the identification. Urgent and active metabolic service remarkably influenced the surviving. The current age of 39 survivors is 0.5 to 23 yrs (mean 7.2 yrs). The disease frequency estimated on the patients number was 1: 115 450, whereas in the pilot NBS - 1: 109 750 (658 492 neonates tested).

Analysis of the histopathological changes in the Mtpa(-/-) pups revealed rapid development of hepatic steatosis after birth and, later, significant necrosis and acute degeneration of the cardiac and diaphragmatic myocytes. This mouse model documents that intact mitochondrial long chain fatty acid oxidation is essential for fetal development and for survival after birth. Deficiency of MTP causes fetal growth retardation, neonatal hypoglycemia, and sudden death.","dc:creator":"Ibdah JA","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Lack of mitochondrial trifunctional protein in mice causes neonatal hypoglycemia and sudden death."},"rdfs:label":"Ibdah 2001 Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":56,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:470c3869-ebaf-4234-b483-e21b17fe7f48","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012173","gene":"hgnc:4801","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c8a5e15b-21f7-49cc-987c-5f3585742bbe"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
