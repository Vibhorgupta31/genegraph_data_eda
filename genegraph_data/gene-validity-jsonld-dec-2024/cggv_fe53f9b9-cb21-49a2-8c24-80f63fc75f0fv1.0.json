We used multipoint linkage analysis to map the causative mutation to a 12.7 megabase interval within 1q31.3-q32.2 with a log of odds score of 3.6. For further investigation of the linked region in an efficient and unbiased manner, we performed exome sequencing. Within the suspected region we identified a homozygous single base pair deletion (c.503_503delG) leading to a frameshift in the coding region of the sixth exon of CNTN2 alias TAG-1 (p.Trp168fs), which segregated in the respective family. Many studies point towards an important role of the CNTN2 product contactin 2 in neuronal excitability. Contactin 2, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored neuronal membrane protein, and another transmembrane protein called contactin associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2 alias CASPR2) are together necessary to maintain voltage-gated potassium channels at the juxtaparanodal region. CNTN2 knockout mice were previously reported to suffer from spontaneous seizures and mutations in the CNTNAP2 gene have been described to cause epilepsy in humans. To further delineate the role of CNTN2 in patients with epilepsy, we sequenced the coding exons in 189 Caucasian patients with epilepsy. No recessive mutation was detected and heterozygote carriers of rare CNTN2 variants do not seem to be predisposed to epilepsy. Given the severity of the mutation and the proposed function of the gene, we consider this mutation as the most likely cause for cortical myoclonic tremor and epilepsy in this family.","dc:creator":"Stogmann E","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive cortical myoclonic tremor and epilepsy: association with a mutation in the potassium channel associated gene CNTN2."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe53f9b9-cb21-49a2-8c24-80f63fc75f0f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe53f9b9-cb21-49a2-8c24-80f63fc75f0f_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10},{"id":"cggv:0eb8159c-f596-4817-9ef5-cd8540a205e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0eb8159c-f596-4817-9ef5-cd8540a205e2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d2d436d6-4faf-4eeb-9443-403c547ceb1b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005076.5(CNTN2):c.1699G>T (p.Glu567Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344375675"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Periodic paralysis with short-term memory loss\n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0032794","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001336"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ad84542a-17fa-4f3f-b5c6-da85279ef2dd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d2d436d6-4faf-4eeb-9443-403c547ceb1b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37359369","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Abdulkareem AA","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Whole exome sequencing identified five novel variants in "}},"rdfs:label":"Abdulkareem EP-4 V-1"},{"id":"cggv:ad84542a-17fa-4f3f-b5c6-da85279ef2dd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad84542a-17fa-4f3f-b5c6-da85279ef2dd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading by 1 point due homozygous predicted/proven null variant in consanguineous family."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:fe53f9b9-cb21-49a2-8c24-80f63fc75f0f_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:6fbe4dc1-844a-4960-94a1-45020e43aa68_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6fbe4dc1-844a-4960-94a1-45020e43aa68","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a7109cec-5c21-451f-a2b4-1584eaa22c42","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005076.5(CNTN2):c.940C>T (p.Arg314Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344409704"}},"detectionMethod":"Method described as \"next generation sequencing.\" Unclear what specific testing patient underwent.","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0001250"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2fcd9212-635d-4b15-9cde-c0045859366d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a7109cec-5c21-451f-a2b4-1584eaa22c42"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36553572","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Routine diagnostics is biased towards genes and variants with satisfactory evidence, but rare disorders with only little confirmation of their pathogenicity might be missed.

Previous studies have indicated high levels of genetic heterogeneity, with estimates of more than 2500 autosomal ID genes, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (AR). Here, we combined microarray genotyping, homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) mapping, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, and whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify disease genes/mutations in 192 multiplex Pakistani and Iranian consanguineous families with non-syndromic ID. We identified definite or candidate mutations (or CNVs) in 51% of families in 72 different genes, including 26 not previously reported for ARID. The new ARID genes include nine with loss-of-function mutations (ABI2, MAPK8, MPDZ, PIDD1, SLAIN1, TBC1D23, TRAPPC6B, UBA7 and USP44), and missense mutations include the first reports of variants in BDNF or TET1 associated with ID. The genes identified also showed overlap with de novo gene sets for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcriptional studies showed prominent expression in the prenatal brain. The high yield of AR mutations for ID indicated that this approach has excellent clinical potential and should inform clinical diagnostics, including clinical whole exome and genome sequencing, for populations in which consanguinity is common. As with other AR disorders, the relevance will also apply to outbred populations.","dc:creator":"Harripaul R","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mapping autosomal recessive intellectual disability: combined microarray and exome sequencing identifies 26 novel candidate genes in 192 consanguineous families."}},"rdfs:label":"Harripaul Family 63 (AS104) Proband"},{"id":"cggv:3e30ae21-c5f5-4730-8db8-2876136e0991","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e30ae21-c5f5-4730-8db8-2876136e0991_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading by 1 point due homozygous predicted/proven null variant in consanguineous family."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7fcf53a5-4b81-432c-97fd-e5efd734c843_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7fcf53a5-4b81-432c-97fd-e5efd734c843","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d11539a4-ef8e-4a2a-89cb-8eb8f7ef1255","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005076.5(CNTN2):c.504del (p.Trp168CysfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144703"}},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide linkage analysis was conducted on the members of the family.

Gross morphological analysis of the cerebellum, the spinal cord, and the hippocampus appeared normal in TAG-1-deficient mice. However, TAG-1 (-/-) mice showed the upregulation of the adenosine A1 receptors determined by [(3)H]cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine in the hippocampus, and their greater sensitivity to convulsant stimuli than that in TAG-1 (+/+) mice.
