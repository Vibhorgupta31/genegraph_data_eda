These patients were born from monozygotic twin sisters and unrelated fathers, suggesting an X-linked trait. Fibroblasts from both showed reduction of respiratory chain (RC) cIII and cIV, but not of cI activities. We found a disease-segregating mutation in the X-linked AIFM1 gene, encoding the Apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF) mitochondrion-associated 1 precursor that deletes arginine 201 (R201 del). Under normal conditions, mature AIF is a FAD-dependent NADH oxidase of unknown function and is targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (this form is called AIF(mit)). Upon apoptogenic stimuli, a soluble form (AIF(sol)) is released by proteolytic cleavage and migrates to the nucleus, where it induces \"parthanatos,\" i.e., caspase-independent fragmentation of chromosomal DNA. In vitro, the AIF(R201 del) mutation decreases stability of both AIF(mit) and AIF(sol) and increases the AIF(sol) DNA binding affinity, a prerequisite for nuclear apoptosis. In AIF(R201 del) fibroblasts, staurosporine-induced parthanatos was markedly increased, whereas re-expression of AIF(wt) induced recovery of RC activities. Numerous TUNEL-positive, caspase 3-negative nuclei were visualized in patient #1's muscle, again indicating markedly increased parthanatos in the AIF(R201 del) critical tissues. We conclude that AIF(R201 del) is an unstable mutant variant associated with increased parthanatos-linked cell death. Our data suggest a role for AIF in RC integrity and mtDNA maintenance, at least in some tissues. Interestingly, riboflavin supplementation was associated with prolonged improvement of patient #1's neurological conditions, as well as correction of RC defects in mutant fibroblasts, suggesting that stabilization of the FAD binding in AIF(mit) is beneficial.","dc:creator":"Ghezzi D","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Severe X-linked mitochondrial encephalomyopathy associated with a mutation in apoptosis-inducing factor."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20362274","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"According to the X-ray data, the R201 residue is part of the AIF-specific 191â€“203 b-hairpin, which forms the FAD binding pouch and confers conformational stability to the flavoprotein, its deletion can predictably perturb the functional properties of both oxidized and reduced forms of AIF (Figure 3C).\nFunction: Recombinant AIFM1-Arg201del shows altered redox properties, using anaerobic titration of recombinant human AIFR201 del with NADH experiments showed that the lifetime of the FADH2-NAD complex formed by AIFM1-Arg201del is reduced compared to WT, and that the kinetics of the redox reaction is 2 orders of magnitude faster (fig 2). \n(Muscle biopsy : histochemical COX deficiency, together with a combined biochemical defect of MRC complex activities.)"},{"id":"cggv:b961080f-69d3-4f31-8a8d-4999310d0459_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16580fe7-4000-4fd1-90bd-59e749ab4f33","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"A NGS panel of 100 nuclear genes associated with mitochondriopathies","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"The proband was diagnosed with an early-onset, slowly progressive mitochondrial disease.\nNormal development until 1 year when he started  showing walking difficulties\nDuring childhood, he developed gait and limb ataxia (sensory and cerebellar), hearing loss, and cognitive impairment\nVisual deficit and distal muscle wasting and weakness became evident at puberty, with scanned speech, head and trunk titubation, and intention tremor, progressively more marked at repeated neurologic examinations.\nAt age 23 years developed progressive sleep apnea\nAt age 30 years visual loss had progressed to 1-2/10 bilaterally\nOnly one (13 years) of several assays showed elevated lactate and pyruvate serum levels (3,051 mmol/L, normal value 580â€“2,100; 146 mmol/L, normal value 40â€“140 mmol/L, respectively)\nMRI and brain CT normal at 9 years, cerebral atrophy at 9 years, and mild cortical and thalamic atrophy (30 years). at 35 years bulbar olives, dentate nuclei, and spinal cord (slight cervical atrophy with T2 hyperintensity in posterior columns) were observed- MRI: Figure A-C\nNerve conduction study showed axonal, more sensory than motor, neuropathy. \nEEG was normal.\nOptic atrophy and retinopathy were documented by visual evoked potentials (since his teens) and electroretinogram (25 years).\nMuscle biopsy at 9 years: hyporeactive to cytochrome c oxidase, reduced cIV activity, partial reduction of complex I and III (Fig 1d). \nMother and sister heterozugous carriers, patient hemizygous for a AIFM1 variant","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Mitochondrial DNA Southern blot and screening for POLG1, SURF1, SCO1, and COX15 mutations were normal","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b961080f-69d3-4f31-8a8d-4999310d0459_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6bc59efa-e0ae-45d4-bf6f-af58cd1d1fb7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004208.4(AIFM1):c.784G>A (p.Gly262Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/732670"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25934856","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Ardissone A","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"A slowly progressive mitochondrial encephalomyopathy widens the spectrum of AIFM1 disorders."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25934856","rdfs:label":"Case report"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"MRI and clinical details need to be reviewed by the GCEP.

Overall, our data pinpoint an evolutionarily conserved role of WAH-1/AIF in the maintenance of proper mitochondrial activity.","dc:creator":"Troulinaki K","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"WAH-1/AIF regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans."},"rdfs:label":"C.elegans RNAi model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recapitulation of OXPHOS deficiency in WAF-1 deficient worms."},{"id":"cggv:6ade0787-c150-4402-bc29-8a93d4bad334","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:940bf9ed-e080-4b75-8d6e-db0297ce4625","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Spontaneous mouse model, the Hq mutation is a murine ecotropic proviral insertion in the gene encoding apoptosis-inducing factor (Aifm1), X linked in mice.

AIF has been characterized as a caspase-independent death effector that is activated by its translocation from mitochondria to the cytosol and nucleus. Here, we report the molecular characterization of AIF in Drosophila melanogaster, a species in which most cell deaths occur in a caspase-dependent manner. Interestingly, knockout of zygotic D. melanogaster AIF (DmAIF) expression using gene targeting resulted in decreased embryonic cell death and the persistence of differentiated neuronal cells at late embryonic stages. Although knockout embryos hatch, they undergo growth arrest at early larval stages, accompanied by mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction. Transgenic expression of DmAIF misdirected to the extramitochondrial compartment (DeltaN-DmAIF), but not wild-type DmAIF, triggered ectopic caspase activation and cell death. DeltaN-DmAIF-induced death was not blocked by removal of caspase activator Dark or transgenic expression of baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35, but was partially inhibited by Diap1 overexpression. Knockdown studies revealed that DeltaN-DmAIF interacts genetically with the redox protein thioredoxin-2. In conclusion, we show that Drosophila AIF is a mitochondrial effector of cell death that plays roles in developmentally regulated cell death and normal mitochondrial function.","dc:creator":"Joza N","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The molecular archaeology of a mitochondrial death effector: AIF in Drosophila."},"rdfs:label":"Drosophila knockout model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recapitulation of OXPHOS deficiency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":2909,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":6.75,"subject":{"id":"cggv:a90fff88-2d82-44bb-9919-4c9a14f1e0d0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:8768","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between AIFM1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 17, 2020. The AIFM1 gene encodes apoptosis-inducing factor, mitochondria-associated, 1 which is an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase with important roles in oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, and redox control. \n\nThe AIFM1 gene was first reported in relation to X-linked Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2010 (PMID: 20362274). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants identified in four cases from four publications (PMIDs: 20362274, 22019070, 25934856, 28299359). No segregation data were available. AIFM1 variants have also been reported to be associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-4 (CMTX-4, also known as Cowchock syndrome). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 18791645, 20362274, 15526035, 29780003, 29531799, 18309327).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
