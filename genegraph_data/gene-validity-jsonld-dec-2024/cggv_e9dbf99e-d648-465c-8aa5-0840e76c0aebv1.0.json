ERCC6 corrects the repair defect of CS complementation group B (CS-B). It encodes a protein of 1493 amino acids, containing seven consecutive domains conserved between DNA and RNA helicases. The entire helicase region bears striking homology to segments in recently discovered proteins involved in transcription regulation, chromosome stability, and DNA repair.

CS is caused by mutations in csa and csb genes, and patients with csb mutation are more prevalent. A hallmark feature of CSB patients is neurodegeneration but the precise molecular cause for this defect remains enigmatic. Further, it is not clear whether the neurodegenerative condition is due to loss of CSB-mediated functions in adult neurogenesis. In this study, we examined the role of CSB in neurogenesis by using the human neural progenitor cells that have self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. In this model system, stable CSB knockdown dramatically reduced the differentiation potential of human neural progenitor cells revealing a key role for CSB in neurogenesis. Neurite outgrowth, a characteristic feature of differentiated neurons, was also greatly abolished in CSB-suppressed cells. In corroboration with this, expression of MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), a crucial player in neuritogenesis, was also impaired in CSB-suppressed cells. Consistent with reduced MAP2 expression in CSB-depleted neural cells, tandem affinity purification and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed a potential role for CSB in the assembly of transcription complex on MAP2 promoter. Altogether, our data led us to conclude that CSB has a crucial role in coordinated regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling activities that are required during neurogenesis.

The majority of CS patients carry mutations in Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB), best known for its role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Indeed, because various repair pathways are compromised in patient cells, CS is widely considered a genome instability syndrome. Here, we investigate the connection between the neuropathology of CS and dysregulation of gene expression. Transcriptome analysis of human fibroblasts revealed that even in the absence of DNA damage, CSB affects the expression of thousands of genes, many of which are neuronal genes. CSB is present in a significant subset of these genes, suggesting that regulation is direct, at the level of transcription. Importantly, reprogramming of CS fibroblasts to neuron-like cells is defective unless an exogenous CSB gene is introduced. Moreover, neuroblastoma cells from which CSB is depleted show defects in gene expression programs required for neuronal differentiation, and fail to differentiate and extend neurites. Likewise, neuron-like cells cannot be maintained without CSB. Finally, a number of disease symptoms may be explained by marked gene expression changes in the brain of patients with CS. Together, these data point to dysregulation of gene regulatory networks as a cause of the neurological symptoms in CS.

Cultured cells from sun-sensitive CS patients are hypersensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light and, following UV irradiation, are unable to restore RNA synthesis rates to normal levels. This has been attributed to a specific deficiency in CS cells in the ability to carry out preferential repair of damage in actively transcribed regions of DNA. We report here a cellular and molecular analysis of three Italian CS patients who were of particular interest because none of them was sun-sensitive, despite showing most of the features of the severe form of CS, including the characteristic cellular sensitivity to UV irradiation. They all were altered in the CSB gene. The genetically related patients CS1PV and CS3PV were homozygous for the C1436T transition resulting in the change Arg453opal. Patient CS2PV was a compound heterozygote for two new causative mutations, insertions of an A at position 1051 and of TGTC at 2053, leading to truncated proteins of 367 and 681 amino acids. These mutations result in severely truncated proteins, as do many of those that we previously identified in several sun-sensitive CS-B patients. These observations confirm that the CSB gene is not essential for viability and cell proliferation, an important issue to be considered in any speculation on the recently proposed additional function of the CSB protein in transcription. Our investigations provide data supporting the notion that other factors, besides the site of the mutation, influence the type and severity of the CS clinical features.","dc:creator":"Colella S","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Alterations in the CSB gene in three Italian patients with the severe form of Cockayne syndrome (CS) but without clinical photosensitivity."}},{"id":"cggv:09049289-4179-41be-8e96-32bbec4c194b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f6b63710-f4a1-4b42-ae1c-43ea2abed48e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10196384"}],"rdfs:label":"CS2PV"},{"id":"cggv:09049289-4179-41be-8e96-32bbec4c194b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:09049289-4179-41be-8e96-32bbec4c194b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Leads to a truncated protein of 367 amino acids."},{"id":"cggv:217c4f13-0083-403d-97cb-3757a2483a16","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:217c4f13-0083-403d-97cb-3757a2483a16_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Leads to a truncated protein of 681 amino acids."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:81daffe7-420a-4405-97cc-9a7bdda7fac6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81daffe7-420a-4405-97cc-9a7bdda7fac6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":42,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:9898bf6a-8f45-40bb-a147-2ef0d106085c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000124.4(ERCC6):c.2830-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA274705"}},{"id":"cggv:2ac97265-caf6-475c-9b78-8f4f7cbe67c7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000124.4(ERCC6):c.2170-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1073323"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000320","obo:HP_0011451","obo:HP_0004326","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0000546","obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0001518","obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0000518","obo:HP_0000992"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:ae33ce5f-3520-4903-9507-a42eb6210b91_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2ac97265-caf6-475c-9b78-8f4f7cbe67c7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19894250"},{"id":"cggv:75e19794-d67b-40ad-a025-31e17d7bef28_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9898bf6a-8f45-40bb-a147-2ef0d106085c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19894250"}],"rdfs:label":"CS1GL"},{"id":"cggv:75e19794-d67b-40ad-a025-31e17d7bef28","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:75e19794-d67b-40ad-a025-31e17d7bef28_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ae33ce5f-3520-4903-9507-a42eb6210b91","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae33ce5f-3520-4903-9507-a42eb6210b91_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5901,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:02502f63-5ad3-4e2c-acd0-1c837752545d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100506","gene":"hgnc:3438","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The ERCC6 gene is located on chromosome 10 at 10q11.23 and encodes the Excision Repair 6, Chromatin Remodeling Factor protein, a DNA-binding protein that is important in transcription-coupled excision repair. ERCC6 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Cockayne spectrum with or without cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome in 1992 (Troelstra et al., PMID:1339317). Cockayne spectrum with or without cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome is characterized by growth failure at birth, with little or no postnatal neurologic development in addition to congenital cataracts or other structural anomalies of the eye, early postnatal contractures of the spine (kyphosis, scoliosis) and joints, and death usually occurring by age five years. This term lumps Cockayne syndrome type 2/B (CSB), cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome 1 (COFS syndrome), and De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome into a spectrum of disease. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and/or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, Cockayne spectrum with or without cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome (OMIM: 133540, 214150, 278800), premature ovarian failure 11 (OMIM: 616946), UV-sensitive syndrome 1 (OMIM: 600630), and susceptibilities to [lung] cancer (OMIM: 211980) and age-related macular degeneration (OMIM: 613761). 10 variants (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site, and inframe indel) that have been reported in 5 probands in 4 publications (Mallery et al., 1998, PMID:9443879; Colella et al., 1999, PMID:10196384; Laugel et al., 2010, PMID:19894250; Zhang et al., 2020, PMID:31558084) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, functional and phenotypic rescue, in vitro functional assays, and biochemical function) (Van der Horst et al., 1997, PMID: 9150142; Bradsher et al., 2002, PMID:12419226; Ciaffardini et al., 2014, PMID:24874740;  Wang et al., 2014, PMID:25249633). One mouse model recapitulates some characteristic phenotypes of Cockayne syndrome, while both rRNA rates of transcription and UV-sensitivity are rescued in other models. It was also demonstrated that ERCC6 is essential to neuronal differentiation & neuritogenesis, consistent with delayed neurologic development seen in patients. Additionally, transcription-coupled repair of UV damage was shown to be inhibited by variants in ERCC6. In summary, ERCC6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Cockayne spectrum with or without cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date July 15, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e9dbf99e-d648-465c-8aa5-0840e76c0aeb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
