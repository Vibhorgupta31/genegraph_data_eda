The aim of the study was to investigate the causal role of DTNA in LVNC using a transgenic mouse model.A missense mutation (c.146A > G, p.N49S) of DTNA was identified in a patient with LVNC by Sanger sequencing. Six independent lines of transgenic mice expressing the mutant DTNA under a myosin heavy chain 6 (Myh6) promoter were generated (Myh6:DtnaN49S). Phenotypic characteristics of DTNA-p.N49S mutations were evaluated by echocardiography, histological observation, and immunoblotting. Multiple trabeculation and a higher ratio of non-compacted to compact myocardial layer were found in the Myh6:DtnaN49S mice compared to the controls. The transgenic mice also showed left ventricular (LV) dilation and cardiac systolic dysfunction. In conclusion, overexpression of the DTNA-p.N49S mutation in a mouse heart can be responsible for the phenotype of deep trabeculation, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysfunction, which resembles the phenotype of LVNC.","dc:creator":"Cao Q","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Phenotype and Functional Analyses in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Left Ventricular Noncompaction Caused by a DTNA Mutation."},"rdfs:label":"Transgenic mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:cdac9dca-0cc7-4cca-9af7-d2767d917fd4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cdac9dca-0cc7-4cca-9af7-d2767d917fd4_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c1cad740-853f-4338-a2e1-5229da58ebd6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00b3d383-fd61-4c19-b07c-09ae6c6e9b8d","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Unknown","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c1cad740-853f-4338-a2e1-5229da58ebd6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:93091186-c8cd-4e90-b30f-a7938f41a40c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001390.4(DTNA):c.17G>C (p.Gly6Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA138311"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27532257","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The accurate interpretation of variation in Mendelian disease genes has lagged behind data generation as sequencing has become increasingly accessible.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least 3 unique variants have been reported in humans.  Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 3 probands in 3 publications (Walsh et al, 2017, PMID: 27532257; Dal Ferro et al, 2017, PMID: 28416588; Cao et al, 2017, PMID: 29118297). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies in non-human model organism (Cao et al, 2017, PMID: 29118297).
