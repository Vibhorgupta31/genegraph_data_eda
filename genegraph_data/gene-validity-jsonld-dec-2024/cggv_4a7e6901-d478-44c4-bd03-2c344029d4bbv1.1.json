Myocyte hypertrophy, myofiber disarray and interstitial fibrosis were observed in cTnI-G203S mice.

Expression of slow skeletal TnI (ssTnI), a TnI isoform naturally expressed in developing heart, also increases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, yet its expression in transgenic mouse hearts is not associated with overt cardiac disease. Gene transfer of TnI isoforms or mutants into adult cardiac myocytes is used here to ascertain if expression levels or functional differences between HCM TnI and ssTnI could help explain these divergent organ-level effects. Results showed significantly reduced myofilament incorporation of cTnIR146G compared with ssTnI or wild-type cTnI. Despite differences in myofilament incorporation, ssTnI and cTnIR146G expression each resulted in enhanced myofilament tension in response to submaximal Ca2+ under physiological ionic conditions. Myofilament expression of an analogous HCM mutation in ssTnI (ssTnIR115G) did not further increase myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity of tension compared with ssTnI. In contrast, there was a divergent response under acidic pH conditions, a condition associated with the myocardial ischemia that often accompanies hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

No difference in the cross-bridge turnover rate was observed at the same level of cross-bridge attachment (activation state), showing that changes in Ca(2+) sensitivity were not due to changes in cross-bridge kinetics. Energy cost calculations demonstrated higher energy consumption in Tg-R145G fibers compared with Tg-WT fibers. The addition of 3 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime at pCa 9.0 showed that there was approximately 2-4% of force generating cross-bridges attached in Tg-R145G fibers compared with less than 1.0% in Tg-WT fibers, suggesting that the mutation impairs the ability of the cardiac troponin complex to fully inhibit cross-bridge attachment under relaxing conditions. Prolonged force and intracellular [Ca(2+)] transients in electrically stimulated intact papillary muscles were observed in Tg-R145G compared with Tg-WT.

Two mutations are located in the cTnI inhibitory domain, a highly negatively charged region that alternately binds to either actin or troponin C, depending on the intracellular concentration of calcium. This region is critical to the inhibition of actin-myosin crossbridge formation when intracellular calcium is low. We modeled one of the inhibitory domain mutations, arginine145-->glycine (TnI(146Gly) in the mouse sequence), by cardiac-specific expression of the mutated protein in transgenic mice. Multiple lines were generated with varying degrees of expression to establish a dose relationship; the severity of phenotype could be correlated directly with transgene expression levels. Transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type cTnI were generated as controls and analyzed in parallel with the TnI(146Gly) animals. The control mice showed no abnormalities, indicating that the phenotype of TnI(146Gly) was not simply an artifact of transgenesis. In contrast, TnI(146Gly) mice showed cardiomyocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis and suffered premature death. The functional alterations that seem to be responsible for the development of cardiac disease include increased skinned fiber sensitivity to calcium and, at the whole organ level, hypercontractility with diastolic dysfunction. Severely affected lines develop a pathology similar to human familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but within a dramatically shortened time frame.

The mechanisms by which this mutation leads to heart disease are still unclear. Therefore, we generated cTnI knock-in mouse models carrying an R21C mutation to evaluate the resultant functional consequences. Measuring the in vivo levels of incorporated mutant and WT cTnI, and their basal phosphorylation levels by top-down mass spectrometry demonstrated: 1) a dominant-negative effect such that, the R21C+/- hearts incorporated 24.9% of the mutant cTnI within the myofilament; and 2) the R21C mutation abolished the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser(23)/Ser(24) in the mutant cTnI. Adult heterozygous (R21C+/-) and homozygous (R21C+/+) mutant mice activated the fetal gene program and developed a remarkable degree of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Investigation of cardiac skinned fibers isolated from WT and heterozygous mice revealed that the WT cTnI was completely phosphorylated at Ser(23)/Ser(24) unless the mice were pre-treated with propranolol. After propranolol treatment (-PKA), the pCa-tension relationships of all three mice (i.e. WT, R21C+/-, and R21C+/+) were essentially the same. However, after treatment with propranolol and PKA, the R21C cTnI mutation reduced (R21C+/-) or abolished (R21C+/+) the well known decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension that accompanies Ser(23)/Ser(24) cTnI phosphorylation.

Hypertrophy could arise as a compensatory mechanism.\nWen et al. (2008) found that skinned papillary fibers from transgenic mice expressing human cTnI with the R145G mutation (Tg-R145G mice) developed significantly decreased maximal Ca(2+)-activated force without changes in maximal ATPase activity compared with transgenic mice expressing wildtype human cTnI (Tg-WT mice). Tg-R145G fibers showed increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in both ATPase and force development compared with Tg-WT fibers. Energy cost calculations demonstrated higher energy consumption in Tg-R145G fibers compared with Tg-WT fibers. Use of a myosin ATPase inhibitor showed that R145G impaired the ability of the cardiac troponin complex to fully inhibit cross-bridge attachment under relaxing conditions. Furthermore, electrical stimulation caused prolonged force and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration transients in intact Tg-R145G papillary muscles compared with Tg-WT papillary muscles. Wen et al. (2008) concluded that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to the R145G mutation is likely caused by compensatory changes activated by higher energy cost of cross-bridge formation, slowed rate of fiber relaxation, and the inability of cardiac fibers to completely relax in the absence of Ca(2+)."},{"id":"cggv:f4e5b390-4721-434e-b10d-948900444871_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:263edf87-2507-4813-9486-d9ac2e61f79b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":48,"detectionMethod":"not given","phenotypeFreeText":"LVOT=18mm, MWT=14mm","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001639","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Negative for MYH7, MYBPC3 TNNT2, MYL2, MYL3, TPM1, ACTC.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:f4e5b390-4721-434e-b10d-948900444871_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:45a48889-092a-495c-ba29-df380ec57b47","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000363.5(TNNI3):c.370G>C (p.Glu124Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA021554"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25086479","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common genetic cardiac disorder associated with sudden death, heart failure, and stroke.

(1997) identified a CGG-to-CAG nucleotide change in the TNNI3 gene, resulting in an arg145-to-gly (R145G) substitution at a conserved residue. Lang et al. (2002) showed that the R145G mutation impairs force development and relaxation. These intrinsic contractile changes would likely result in diastolic dysfunction in vivo. Hypertrophy could arise as a compensatory mechanism.\nWen et al. (2008) found that skinned papillary fibers from transgenic mice expressing human cTnI with the R145G mutation (Tg-R145G mice) developed significantly decreased maximal Ca(2+)-activated force without changes in maximal ATPase activity compared with transgenic mice expressing wildtype human cTnI (Tg-WT mice). Tg-R145G fibers showed increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in both ATPase and force development compared with Tg-WT fibers. Energy cost calculations demonstrated higher energy consumption in Tg-R145G fibers compared with Tg-WT fibers. Use of a myosin ATPase inhibitor showed that R145G impaired the ability of the cardiac troponin complex to fully inhibit cross-bridge attachment under relaxing conditions. Furthermore, electrical stimulation caused prolonged force and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration transients in intact Tg-R145G papillary muscles compared with Tg-WT papillary muscles. Wen et al. (2008) concluded that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to the R145G mutation is likely caused by compensatory changes activated by higher energy cost of cross-bridge formation, slowed rate of fiber relaxation, and the inability of cardiac fibers to completely relax in the absence of Ca(2+)."},{"id":"cggv:684c6038-694e-41e2-b67d-ee69a19700e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9dbbfc0-1bcd-4309-9b81-99dae6fe8d20","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":25,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:684c6038-694e-41e2-b67d-ee69a19700e2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f56a7856-4c50-4d36-8e49-0741fd0d48b6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000363.5(TNNI3):c.485G>C (p.Arg162Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA021749"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15698845"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15698845","rdfs:label":"III:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variant absent from gnomAD; LMM: The p.Arg162Pro variant in TNNI3 has been reported in at least 5 individuals with HCM and segregated with disease in 3 affected relatives from 1 family (Richard 2005, Doolan 2005, Ingles 2005, Keller 2009, Coppini 2014, LMM unpublished data).

We assessed the outcome of family screening combining clinical evaluation and screening for sarcomere gene mutations in a cohort of 90 Danish HCM patients and their close relatives, in all 451 persons. Index patients were screened for mutations in all coding regions of 10 sarcomere genes (MYH7, MYL3, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC, CSRP3, TCAP, and TNNC1) and five exons of TTN. Relatives were screened for presence of minor or major diagnostic criteria for HCM and tracking of DNA variants was performed. In total, 297 adult relatives (>18 years) (51.2%) fulfilled one or more criteria for HCM. A total of 38 HCM-causing mutations were detected in 32 index patients. Six patients carried two disease-associated mutations. Twenty-two mutations have only been identified in the present cohort. The genetic diagnostic yield was almost twice as high in familial HCM (53%) vs. HCM of sporadic or unclear inheritance (19%). The yield was highest in families with an additional history of HCM-related clinical events. In relatives, 29.9% of mutation carriers did not fulfil any clinical diagnostic criterion, and in 37.5% of relatives without a mutation, one or more criteria was fulfilled. A total of 60% of family members had no mutation and could be reassured and further follow-up ceased. Genetic diagnosis may be established in approximately 40% of families with the highest yield in familial HCM with clinical events.

TNNI3 was first associated with this disease in humans in 1997 (Kimura et al, PMID 9241277).  At least 60 unique variants, with varying levels of evidence to support their pathogenicity, have been reported in humans (reviewed in Mogensen et al, 2015, PMID 26440512). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 6 families (Kimura et al, 1997, PMID 9241277; Rani et al, 2012, PMID 22876777; Choi et al, 2010, PMID 20641121; Mogensen et al, 2004, PMID 15607392). More evidence is available in the literature , but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) was reached. The mechanism for disease is likely dominant negative, as 91% of mutations reported are missense variants (Mogensen et al, 2015, PMID 26440512). The gene-disease association is supported by the function of the gene product, animal models, and in vitro assays. In summary, TNNI3 is definitively associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
