By analysis of linkage we localize the putative causative gene to a 2.5-Mb segment of chromosome 1q23.2-23.3. Direct DNA sequencing of KCNJ10, which encodes an inwardly rectifying K(+) channel, identifies previously unidentified missense or nonsense mutations on both alleles in all affected subjects. These mutations alter highly conserved amino acids and are absent among control chromosomes. Many of these mutations have been shown to cause loss of function in related K(+) channels. These findings demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ10 cause this syndrome, which we name SeSAME. KCNJ10 is expressed in glia in the brain and spinal cord, where it is believed to take up K(+) released by neuronal repolarization, in cochlea, where it is involved in the generation of endolymph, and on the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron. We propose that KCNJ10 is required in the kidney for normal salt reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule because of the need for K(+) recycling across the basolateral membrane to enable normal activity of the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase; loss of this function accounts for the observed electrolyte defects. Mice deficient for KCNJ10 show a related phenotype with seizures, ataxia, and hearing loss, further supporting KCNJ10's role in this syndrome. These findings define a unique human syndrome, and establish the essential role of basolateral K(+) channels in renal electrolyte homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Scholl UI","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, mental retardation, and electrolyte imbalance (SeSAME syndrome) caused by mutations in KCNJ10."}},{"id":"cggv:f1745dad-08e2-450e-8dce-b5b33912bb5a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:918790a6-373f-4074-a87a-5c4d13227674"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19289823"}],"rdfs:label":"Ala167Val/Arg297Cys; proband from Canada"},{"id":"cggv:f1745dad-08e2-450e-8dce-b5b33912bb5a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1745dad-08e2-450e-8dce-b5b33912bb5a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f1745dad-08e2-450e-8dce-b5b33912bb5a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Mutation triggered a total lack of Kir 4.1 channel activity in mutant cells in an in-vitro model (PMID: 20678478, Tang et al., 2010).

Because diverse human hereditary deafness syndromes are associated with mutations in K(+) channels, we examined auditory function and inner ear structure in mice with a genetically inactivated Kir4.1 K(+) channel subunit. Startle response experiments suggest that Kir4.1-/- mice are profoundly deaf, whereas Kir4.1+/- mice react like wild-type mice to acoustic stimuli. In Kir4.1-/- mice, the Reissner membrane is collapsed, the tectorial membrane is swollen, and type I hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons as well as their central processes degenerate over the first postnatal weeks. In the vestibular ganglia, neuronal cell death with apoptotic features is also observed. Immunostaining reveals that Kir4.1 is strongly expressed in stria vascularis of wild-type but not Kir4.1-/- mice. Within the spiral ganglion, Kir4.1 labeling was detected on satellite cells surrounding spiral ganglion neurons and axons. We conclude that Kir4.1 is crucial for normal development of the cochlea and hearing, via two distinct aspects of extracellular K(+) homeostasis: (1). in stria vascularis, Kir4.1 helps to generate the cochlear endolymph; and (2). in spiral and vestibular ganglia, Kir4.1 in surrounding glial cells helps to support the spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons and their projecting axons.","dc:creator":"Rozengurt N","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Time course of inner ear degeneration and deafness in mice lacking the Kir4.1 potassium channel subunit."},"rdfs:label":"GTEx expression level data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d0267781-f1de-41d1-a21b-2883d606d584","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8467e47-6148-4ae7-90d4-a3ce7e4ee6d4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"If sodium is not properly processed by the heterodimer, kidney salt wasting and therefore SESAME/EAST syndrome results.

Kir4.1-/- mice display marked motor impairment, and the cellular basis is hypomyelination in the spinal cord, accompanied by severe spongiform vacuolation, axonal swellings, and degeneration. Immunostaining in the spinal cord of wild-type mice up to postnatal day 18 reveals that Kir4.1 is expressed in myelin-synthesizing oligodendrocytes, but probably not in neurons or glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP-positive) astrocytes. Cultured oligodendrocytes from developing spinal cord of Kir4.1-/- mice lack most of the wild-type K(+) conductance, have depolarized membrane potentials, and display immature morphology. By contrast, cultured neurons from spinal cord of Kir4.1-/- mice have normal physiological characteristics. We conclude that Kir4.1 forms the major K(+) conductance of oligodendrocytes and is therefore crucial for myelination. The Kir4.1 knock-out mouse is one of the few CNS dysmyelinating or demyelinating phenotypes that does not involve a gene directly involved in the structure, synthesis, degradation, or immune response to myelin.
