The role of this gene in this particular disease has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time (in general, at least 3 years). No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the role of the gene in the specified disease. In summary, based on this overwhelming evidence, DSP is definitely associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma, maximum association score was achieved rapidly after the analysis of few main reports.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b23da580-269c-4e5d-8f13-91dbe7ea6a57"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
