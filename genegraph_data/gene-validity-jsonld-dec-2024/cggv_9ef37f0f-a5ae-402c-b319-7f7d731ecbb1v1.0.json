The majority of cases are due to null mutations in the FGA gene although one would expect the 3 genes to be equally implicated. However, most patients studied so far are white, and therefore the identification of causative mutations in non-European families is necessary to establish if this finding holds true in all ethnic groups. In this study, we report the identification of a novel nonsense mutation (Arg134Xaa) in the FGG gene responsible for congenital afibrinogenemia in 10 patients from Lebanon. Expression studies in COS-7 cells demonstrated that the Arg134Xaa codon, which is encoded by adjacent exons (TG-intron 4-A) affected neither mRNA splicing nor stability, but led to the production of an unstable, severely truncated fibrinogen gamma chain that is not incorporated into a functional fibrinogen hexamer.","dc:creator":"Neerman-Arbez M","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Expression and analysis of a split premature termination codon in FGG responsible for congenital afibrinogenemia: escape from RNA surveillance mechanisms in transfected cells."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15284111","rdfs:label":"Neerman-Arbez_Patient 27"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The proband and 9 other individuals in this study from different families in a highly consanguineous community were found to be homozygous for the nonsense variant, Arg134Ter.

Twenty-seven patients with clinical features suggestive of fibrinogen deficiency and with prolonged plasma clotting times and low fibrinogen levels were studied. Genomic DNA was screened for mutations in the fibrinogen alpha (FGA), beta (FGB), gamma (FGG) genes by PCR and conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis. Fourteen different disease-causing mutations including frameshifts (51.9%), splice site (22.2%), missense (18.5%) and nonsense mutation (7.4%) were identified in 27 patients. Thirteen of them were novel, including seven frameshifts (fibrinogen Aα: p.Asp296 fs*59, p.Thr466 fs*17 and p.Lys575 fs*74; fibrinogen Bβ: p.Gly414 fs*2 and fibrinogen γ: p.Ser81 fs*5, p.Lys185 fs*13 and p.Asp278_279 fs*17), three splice site mutations (FGA gene c.364+1G>A; c.510+2 T>G; FGB gene c.851+1G>A), two missense substitutions (fibrinogen Bβ: p.Gly288Ser; p.Arg445Thr) and a nonsense mutation in fibrinogen Aα (p.Tyr127*). Two common mutations (FGA: c.364+1G>A, n = 6, FGG: p.Lys185 fs*13, n = 7) affecting 13 patients were identified in this series, suggesting that these mutations could be screened first in Indian patients with fibrinogen deficiency.

We speculate that misfolding of the variant protein causes hepatic retention and the subsequent hypofibrinogenemia, and that the functional defect (dysfibrinogenemia) results from hypersialylation of otherwise normal Bbeta and gamma chains consequent to the liver cirrhosis.

Herein, we demonstrate that FXIII-B accelerates fibrin cross-linking. Depletion of FXIII-B from normal plasma supplemented with a physiological level of recombinant FXIII-A resulted in delayed fibrin cross-linking, reduced incorporation of FXIII-A into fibrin clots, and impaired activation peptide cleavage by thrombin; the addition of recombinant FXIII-B restored normal fibrin cross-linking, FXIII-A incorporation into fibrin clots, and activation peptide cleavage by thrombin. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-fibrinogen antibody revealed an interaction between the FXIII heterotetramer and fibrinogen mediated by FXIII-B and not FXIII-A. FXIII-B probably binds the γ-chain of fibrinogen with its D-domain, which is near the fibrin polymerization pockets, and dissociates from fibrin during or after cross-linking between γ-chains. Thus, FXIII-B plays important roles in the formation of a ternary complex between proenzyme FXIII, prosubstrate fibrinogen, and activator thrombin. Accordingly, congenital or acquired FXIII-B deficiency may result in increased bleeding tendency through impaired fibrin stabilization due to decreased FXIII-A activation by thrombin and secondary FXIII-A deficiency arising from enhanced circulatory clearance.

The fibrinogen genes (FGB-FGA-FGG) are expressed almost exclusively in hepatocytes where their output is coordinated to ensure a sufficient mRNA pool for each chain and maintain an abundant plasma fibrinogen protein level. Fibrinogen gene expression is controlled by the activity of proximal promoters which contain binding sites for hepatocyte transcription factors, including proteins which influence fibrinogen transcription in response to acute-phase inflammatory stimuli. The fibrinogen gene cluster also contains cis regulatory elements; enhancer sequences with liver activities identified by sequence conservation and functional genomics. While the transcriptional control of this gene cluster is fascinating biology, the medical impetus to understand fibrinogen gene regulation stems from the association of cardiovascular disease risk with high level circulating fibrinogen. In the general population this level varies from about 1.5 to 3.5 g/l. This variation between individuals is influenced by genotype, suggesting there are genetic variants contributing to fibrinogen levels which reside in fibrinogen regulatory loci. A complete picture of how fibrinogen genes are regulated will therefore point towards novel sources of regulatory variants. In this review we discuss regulation of the fibrinogen genes from proximal promoters and enhancers, the influence of acute-phase stimulation, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs and functional regulatory variants identified in genetic studies. Finally, we discuss the fibrinogen locus in light of recent advances in understanding chromosomal architecture and suggest future directions for researching the mechanisms that control fibrinogen expression.","dc:creator":"Fish RJ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Fibrinogen gene regulation."},"rdfs:label":"Fish_Fibrinogen complex_FGG"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score increased for 2 genes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9ef37f0f-a5ae-402c-b319-7f7d731ecbb1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:231cb081-1cd8-4a21-b55a-61569d912ace","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:485866f0-0a49-465c-8a77-dd5c33a13802","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Similar to that seen in human patients with the variant, heterozygous mice showed loss of fibrinogen polymerization, calcium-binding and ADP-induced platelet aggregation.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 30 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is characterized by quantitative and qualitative defects in fibrinogen. It may manifest as afibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia. Clinical symptoms include a bleeding diathesis and/or a thrombotic phenotype. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 10 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 10880389, 19551918, 28992465, 11354637, 15284111, 23560673). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be heterozygous as well as biallelic loss of function (PMID: 23560673, 28992465). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): FGG encodes the γ subunit of the coagulation factor, fibrinogen, which is a hexamer of three subunit chains (PMID: 22836683). It is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma (PMID: 20921339). Two mouse models that recapitulate fibrinogen deficiency are reported (PMID: 10980108, 15304068). The γ-chain of fibrinogen is the site of interation with FXIII, which accelerates the formation of the fibrin clot (PMID: 25809477).  \n\nIn summary, the FGG-Congenital fibrinogen deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
