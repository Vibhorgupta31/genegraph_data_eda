The c.808C >T mutation altered an evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue (Ser270), while reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing demonstrated that c.963G >A led to aberrant splicing, in which two mutant transcripts with premature stop codons (p.Ala322Valfs*24 and p.Glu308Glyfs*2) were generated. Expression of GPI-anchored proteins such as CD16 and CD24 on granulocytes from affected siblings was significantly decreased, and expression of the GPI-anchored protein CD59 in PIGN-knockout human embryonic kidney 293 cells was partially or hardly restored by transient expression of p.Ser270Pro and p.Glu308Glyfs*2 mutants, respectively, suggesting severe and complete loss of PIGN activity.

He also had supernumerary nipples, pectus excavatum, a short upturned nose, fleshy ear lobes, and a right auricular pit. Massively parallel exome sequencing and analysis revealed two novel compound heterozygous missense (Trp136Gly and Ser859Thr) variants in the PIGN gene. This report extends and further defines the phenotype of this syndrome.","dc:creator":"Couser NL","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"The phenotype of multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 1: report and review."}},{"id":"cggv:b92d1c43-ee75-45a2-b62a-7c081787197b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ebe613f0-08ed-4bf5-9798-753b77b45f01"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25920937"}],"rdfs:label":"Couser Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:e2a5c0f5-bb53-4c84-87d0-6de53299cfa3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e2a5c0f5-bb53-4c84-87d0-6de53299cfa3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Maternally inherited.

Biallelic variants in *PIGN* were first reported in connection with autosomal recessive multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 1 in 2011 (Maydan et. al., PMID: 21493957). This syndrome is characterized by hypotonia, seizures, facial dysmorphisms, developmental delays, brain abnormalities, and cardiac defects. Most reported variants are predicted or confirmed to cause a decrease in PIGN expression. Biallelic variants in *PIGN* were also reported in connection to Fryns syndrome, a distinct syndrome characterized by diaphragmatic hernia, dysmorphism, distal digital hypoplasia and brain malformations, in 2016 (McInerney-Leo et al., PMID: 27038415). While neonatal lethality is the most common outcome of this disorder, intellectual disability is present for those patients who survive infancy. Variants identified in individuals with the Fryns phenotype are primarily biallelic splice site and premature termination variants, all predicted to result in complete loss of function. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Phenotypic variability appears to depend on the degree of PIGN residual activity rather than a distinct molecular mechanism. Therefore, these conditions have been lumped into one disease entity, multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 1.\n\nTen variants (three splice site, six missense, and one nonsense), reported in 13 individuals in six publications, are included in this curation (PMIDs: 21493957, 24253414, 24852103, 25920937, 26364997, 29096607). Additional cases are reported in the literature (PMIDs: 26394714, 32220244) but the maximum genetic evidence score (12 points) has been reached. The disease mechanism is believed to be biallelic loss of function. Most included variants are supported by functional evidence demonstrating significant decreases in PIGN expression and/or GPI-anchored proteins CD16, CD18, CD24, and CD59.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *PIGN* and multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 28, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:252393aa-6a56-483e-a353-6dbe2cd99e84"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
