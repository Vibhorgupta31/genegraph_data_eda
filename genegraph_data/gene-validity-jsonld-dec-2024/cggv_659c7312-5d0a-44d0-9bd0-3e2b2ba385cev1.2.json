Genotype-phenotype correlations can often be traced to different mutation types, localization of the variants in distinct protein domains, or the trigger of or escape from nonsense-mediated decay. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified homozygous variants in EMC1 that segregated with a phenotype of developmental delay, hypotonia, scoliosis, and cerebellar atrophy in three families. In addition, a de novo heterozygous EMC1 variant was seen in an individual with a similar clinical and MRI imaging phenotype. EMC1 encodes a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane protein complex (EMC), an evolutionarily conserved complex that has been proposed to have multiple roles in ER-associated degradation, ER-mitochondria tethering, and proper assembly of multi-pass transmembrane proteins. Perturbations of protein folding and organelle crosstalk have been implicated in neurodegenerative processes including cerebellar atrophy. We propose EMC1 as a gene in which either biallelic or monoallelic variants might lead to a syndrome including intellectual disability and preferential degeneration of the cerebellum.","dc:creator":"Harel T","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Monoallelic and Biallelic Variants in EMC1 Identified in Individuals with Global Developmental Delay, Hypotonia, Scoliosis, and Cerebellar Atrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"Harel Family 3 III.2"},{"id":"cggv:3b8bc892-e227-43fe-b14f-ec815c5ad527","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3b8bc892-e227-43fe-b14f-ec815c5ad527_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:616c46be-04a4-4f07-90b8-64cc66d7ae29_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:616c46be-04a4-4f07-90b8-64cc66d7ae29","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2d9ee42f-efab-4846-8add-e8fe65a5d08b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015047.3(EMC1):c.1212+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338766078"}},"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002451","obo:HP_0025190","obo:HP_0002557","obo:HP_0030799","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0001336","obo:HP_0007366","obo:HP_0000490","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0005484","obo:HP_0100704"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:66b79c53-0397-43be-b466-19bc6bc8993d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2d9ee42f-efab-4846-8add-e8fe65a5d08b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29271071","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Several genes have been implicated in a highly variable presentation of developmental delay with psychomotor retardation.

Pathogenic monoallelic and biallelic variants in EMC1 in humans have been reported only in six families, causing isolated visual impairment or in association with psychomotor retardation and cerebellar atrophy. We report a ten-year-old boy, born to unrelated parents, with early-onset severe global development delay due to novel EMC1 biallelic pathogenic variants. A truncating variant, p.(Tyr378*) and a missense variant, p.(Phe953Ser), located in exon 11 and 23 of EMC1 gene respectively, have been found by reanalysis of exome sequencing data. The proband's phenotype included several signs that overlap with the phenotype of previously reported patients, associating severe global developmental delay, abnormal ophthalmological examination, and postnatal slow-down of the head circumference growth. Some distinguishing clinical signs were observed in comparison to patients from literature, such as autism spectrum disorder, absence of seizures, scoliosis or facial dysmorphic features, thus extending the spectrum of EMC1-related phenotypes. Similarly, brain MRI, performed at 2 years, showed normal cerebellar volume and structure, whereas cerebellar atrophy was described in literature. Moreover, difficulties of clinical differential diagnosis between EMC1-associated disease and other etiologies of global development delay support the importance of large-scale genetic investigations. Our diagnostic approach, through reanalysis of exome sequencing data, highlights the importance of reconsidering initial negative results for patients with a strong suspicion of genetic disease, and to update analytic pipelines in order to improve the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing.","dc:creator":"Cabet S","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Novel truncating and missense variants extending the spectrum of EMC1-related phenotypes, causing autism spectrum disorder, severe global development delay and visual impairment."}},{"id":"cggv:fb53533a-f499-43f4-a58b-c348721ae9cd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:50a87953-032f-48d6-9368-794771ded5e2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32092440"}],"rdfs:label":"Cabet II.2"},{"id":"cggv:c276e67f-1cdc-4266-8aff-66e25f42bfe0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c276e67f-1cdc-4266-8aff-66e25f42bfe0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:fb53533a-f499-43f4-a58b-c348721ae9cd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb53533a-f499-43f4-a58b-c348721ae9cd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:881f714b-751e-4508-9e83-a7542b7552a2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:881f714b-751e-4508-9e83-a7542b7552a2","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6718df5f-2937-4dee-8519-6612d2fa8444","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015047.3(EMC1):c.2619_2622del (p.Pro874ArgfsTer21)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA358739"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0011344","obo:HP_0000188","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0007371","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0007360","obo:HP_0000278","obo:HP_0008936","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0005484","obo:HP_0100704","obo:HP_0002023","obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0008755","obo:HP_0007166"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:43901dbf-85d8-4946-8ab2-d2ebf8531fa6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6718df5f-2937-4dee-8519-6612d2fa8444"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26942288"},"rdfs:label":"Harel Family 1 II.1"},{"id":"cggv:43901dbf-85d8-4946-8ab2-d2ebf8531fa6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43901dbf-85d8-4946-8ab2-d2ebf8531fa6_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:659c7312-5d0a-44d0-9bd0-3e2b2ba385ce_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5537,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":11,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4dae0e0d-31b4-4305-9338-40eb1c6d99cd","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100516","gene":"hgnc:28957","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"EMC1 is a component of the EMC complex, a multifunctional, multi-subunit protein complex involved in insertion of trans-membrane domains with low hydrophobicity into the ER membrane. *EMC1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder with motor features in 2016 (Harel et al., PMID 26942288). *EMC1* has been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: Cerebellar atrophy, visual impairment, and psychomotor retardation (MIM:616875) and Global developmental delay-visual anomalies-progressive cerebellar atrophy-truncal hypotonia syndrome (ORPHA:480898). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in inheritance pattern in some reported cases. The split curation for autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder with motor features has been curated separately. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 8 POINTS. 6 unique variants (including 3 missense, 1 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splicing) that have been reported in 5 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 26942288, 29271071, 32092440) are included in this curation. This gene-disease association is also supported by a Drosophila model, where knockdown in glia resulted in reduced viability and a motor phenotype which were rescued by expression of human *EMC1* (PMID: 35234901). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
