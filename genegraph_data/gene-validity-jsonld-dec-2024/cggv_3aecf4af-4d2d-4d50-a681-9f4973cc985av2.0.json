Here, we report on two brothers (4 years and 9-month old) with early onset MAD due to ZMPSTE24 mutations in whom thin skin was noted as early as 5 months of age. Both had micrognathia, mottled hyperpigmentation, and enlarged fontanelles but little evidence of lipodystrophy. There was no delay of mental development. The older brother had small pinched nose, short clavicles, acro-osteolysis, stunted growth, joint stiffness, and repeated fractures. There was no evidence of renal disease. Both patients were compound heterozygotes harboring a previously reported missense ZMPSTE24 mutation, p.Pro248Leu, and a novel null mutation, p.Trp450stop. These patients and the review of literature reveal that compared to MAD patients with LMNA mutations, those with ZMPSTE24 mutations develop manifestations earlier in life. Other distinguishing features in MAD due to ZMPSTE24 mutations may include premature birth, renal disease, calcified skin nodules, and lack of acanthosis nigricans. We conclude that in patients with MAD due to ZMPSTE24 mutations, the onset of disease manifestations such as thin skin and micrognathia occurs as early as 5 months of age. In these patients, skeletal phenotype presents earlier whereas lipodystrophy and renal disease may occur later in life.","dc:creator":"Ahmad Z","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Early onset mandibuloacral dysplasia due to compound heterozygous mutations in ZMPSTE24."}},"rdfs:label":"Ahm-1"},{"id":"cggv:85b83cf8-24d0-4a54-961a-2d01ae5d62a1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85b83cf8-24d0-4a54-961a-2d01ae5d62a1_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:85b83cf8-24d0-4a54-961a-2d01ae5d62a1_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experimental data shows variant is completely inactive.\n(Barrowman PMID: 22718200)"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ba90ca12-59f7-4bf1-b55c-0fb0f9e668db_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba90ca12-59f7-4bf1-b55c-0fb0f9e668db","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:d2344d9e-fa95-4421-8294-e571afa6e860","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.5(ZMPSTE24):c.743C>T (p.Pro248Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116755"}},{"id":"cggv:f98d7322-0d43-4458-85dd-32d36da4ab59","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.5(ZMPSTE24):c.121C>T (p.Gln41Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116752"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Characteristic facial appearance, including mandibular hypoplasia, dental overcrowding, prominent eyes, and pointed nose.

We now report novel compound heterozygous mutations in exon 1 (c.121C>T; p.Q41X) and exon 6 (c.743C>T; p.P248L) in ZMPSTE24 in two Japanese sisters, 7- and 3-year old, with severe MAD and characteristic facies and atrophic skin. The older sister had lipodystrophy affecting the chest and thighs but sparing abdomen. Their parents and a brother, who were healthy, had heterozygous mutations. The missense mutation, P248L, was not found in 100 normal subjects of Japanese origin. The mutant Q41X was inactive in a yeast halo assay; however, the mutant P248L retained near normal ZMPSTE24 activity. Immunoblots demonstrated accumulation of prelamin A in the patients' cell lysates from lymphoblasts. The lymphoblasts from the patients also revealed less intense staining for lamin A/C on immunofluorescence. We conclude that ZMPSTE24 deficiency results in accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A, which may be responsible for cellular toxicity and the MAD phenotype.","dc:creator":"Miyoshi Y","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Severe mandibuloacral dysplasia caused by novel compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutations in two Japanese siblings."}},{"id":"cggv:ba4a680a-04c5-49fb-b2fc-930829523d77_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d2344d9e-fa95-4421-8294-e571afa6e860"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18435794"}],"rdfs:label":"Miy-1"},{"id":"cggv:ba4a680a-04c5-49fb-b2fc-930829523d77","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba4a680a-04c5-49fb-b2fc-930829523d77_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ba4a680a-04c5-49fb-b2fc-930829523d77_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experimental data shows variant has reduced activity.\n(Barrowman PMID: 22718200)"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:48cd1c2e-1cde-43e5-818b-0f7835985d33","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48cd1c2e-1cde-43e5-818b-0f7835985d33_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:48cd1c2e-1cde-43e5-818b-0f7835985d33_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experimental data shows variant is completely inactive.\n"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:877ed947-6726-4c90-8a88-821ea95845c7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:877ed947-6726-4c90-8a88-821ea95845c7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:b41519ae-d569-4aca-8fd1-9165dd21ba2b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.5(ZMPSTE24):c.281T>C (p.Leu94Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA232743"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Mandibular hypoplasia, dysplastic clavicles, delayed skull ossification, acro-osteolysis, slender diaphysis of long bones, short stature, multiple fractures, contractures, pronounced veins, sclerodermic skin, alopecia, reduced subcutaneous fat, loss of muscle strength predominant in lower limbs. chronic kidney disease with glomerular, vascular and tubular abnormalities (bilateral renal artery calcifications)","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"LMNA Sanger","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:05abda3b-1c6e-4a65-b9b8-db70ff3f8820_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b41519ae-d569-4aca-8fd1-9165dd21ba2b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21267004","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutation in ZMPSTE24 gene, encoding a major metalloprotease, leads to defective prelamin A processing and causes type B mandibuloacral dysplasia, as well as the lethal neonatal restrictive dermopathy syndrome.

We had previously demonstrated that a complete loss of function in ZMPSTE24 was lethal in the neonatal period, whereas compound heterozygous mutations including one PTC and one missense mutation were associated with type B mandibuloacral dysplasia. In this study, we report a 30-year longitudinal clinical survey of a patient harboring a novel severe and complex phenotype, combining an early-onset progeroid syndrome and a congenital myopathy with fiber-type disproportion. A unique homozygous missense ZMPSTE24 mutation (c.281T>C, p.Leu94Pro) was identified and predicted to produce two possible ZMPSTE24 conformations, leading to a partial loss of function. Western blot analysis revealed a major reduction of ZMPSTE24, together with the presence of unprocessed prelamin A and decreased levels of lamin A, in the patient's primary skin fibroblasts. These cells exhibited significant reductions in lifespan associated with major abnormalities of the nuclear shape and structure. This is the first report of MAD presenting with confirmed myopathic abnormalities associated with ZMPSTE24 defects, extending the clinical spectrum of ZMPSTE24 gene mutations. Moreover, our results suggest that defective prelamin A processing affects muscle regeneration and development, thus providing new insights into the disease mechanism of prelamin A-defective associated syndromes in general.","dc:creator":"Ben Yaou R","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Type B mandibuloacral dysplasia with congenital myopathy due to homozygous ZMPSTE24 missense mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"Ben-1"},{"id":"cggv:05abda3b-1c6e-4a65-b9b8-db70ff3f8820","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05abda3b-1c6e-4a65-b9b8-db70ff3f8820_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:05abda3b-1c6e-4a65-b9b8-db70ff3f8820_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experimental data shows variant has reduced activity.\n(Barrowman PMID: 22718200)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ad22f22e-615e-45db-bfb9-09c63942bf70_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad22f22e-615e-45db-bfb9-09c63942bf70","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:df426eee-57b3-4c25-9e9a-aa0d2d286a0f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000001.11:g.40290990A>G (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA339872132"}},"detectionMethod":"'ZMPSTE24 gene was analysed'.

It is part of the spectrum of diseases called laminopathies and results from mutations in genes regulating the synthesis of the nuclear laminar protein, lamin A. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes both the precursor protein prelamin A and lamin C, are the commonest cause of MAD type A. In a few cases of MAD type B, mutations have been identified in the ZMPSTE24 gene encoding a zinc metalloproteinase important in the post-translational modification of lamin A. Here we describe a new case of MAD resulting from compound heterozygote mutations in ZMPSTE24 (p.N256S/p.Y70fs). The patient had typical skeletal changes of MAD, but in addition a number of unusual skeletal features including neonatal tooth eruption, amorphous calcific deposits, submetaphyseal erosions, vertebral beaking, severe cortical osteoporosis and delayed fracture healing. Treatment with conventional doses of pamidronate improved estimated volumetric bone density in the spine but did not arrest cortical bone loss. We reviewed the literature on cases of MAD associated with proven LMNA and ZMPSTE24 mutations and found that the unusual features described above were all substantially more prevalent in patients with mutations in ZMPSTE24 than in those with LMNA mutations. We conclude that MAD associated with ZMPSTE24 mutations has a more severe phenotype than that associated with LMNA mutations--probably reflecting the greater retention of unprocessed farnesylated prelamin A in the nucleus, which is toxic to cells.","dc:creator":"Cunningham VJ","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Skeletal phenotype of mandibuloacral dysplasia associated with mutations in ZMPSTE24."}},"rdfs:label":"Cun-1"},{"id":"cggv:57d30567-d693-453e-89d1-43c66c43a62f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57d30567-d693-453e-89d1-43c66c43a62f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:933d2e00-3965-4c7a-b8df-1658afdaa518_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:933d2e00-3965-4c7a-b8df-1658afdaa518","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:39196d25-cf2d-4c6f-9d03-721577646a6a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.5(ZMPSTE24):c.1018T>C (p.Trp340Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116750"}},{"id":"cggv:00e3adf2-666e-4f21-abb6-5f37c0efb9aa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.4(ZMPSTE24):c.1085dupT (p.Leu362Phefs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116749"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Characteristic face with prominent eyes, a pinched nose, micrognathia, and small mouth.

A homozygous missense mutation, Arg527His, in the LMNA gene which encodes nuclear lamina proteins lamins A and C has been reported in patients with MAD and partial lipodystrophy. We studied four patients with MAD who had no mutations in the LMNA gene. We now show compound heterozygous mutations, Phe361fsX379 and Trp340Arg, in the zinc metalloproteinase (ZMPSTE24) gene in one of the four patients who had severe MAD associated with progeroid appearance and generalized lipodystrophy. ZMPSTE24 is involved in post-translational proteolytic cleavage of carboxy terminal residues of farnesylated prelamin A in two steps to form mature lamin A. Deficiency of Zmpste24 in mice causes accumulation of prelamin A and phenotypic features similar to MAD. The yeast homolog, Ste24, has a parallel role in processing of prenylated mating pheromone a-factor. Since human ZMPSTE24 can also process a-factor when expressed in yeast, we assessed the functional significance of the two ZMPSTE24 mutations in the yeast to complement the mating defect of the haploid MATa yeast lacking STE24 and Ras-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1; another prenylprotein-specific endoprotease) genes. The ZMPSTE24 mutant construct, Phe361fsX379, was inactive in complementing the yeast a-factor but the mutant, Trp340Arg, was partially active compared to the wild type ZMPSTE24 construct. We conclude that mutations in ZMPSTE24 may cause MAD by affecting prelamin A processing.","dc:creator":"Agarwal AK","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Zinc metalloproteinase, ZMPSTE24, is mutated in mandibuloacral dysplasia."}},{"id":"cggv:9bda0da7-6d79-43d0-9fe0-1a9dafcc6f28_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:00e3adf2-666e-4f21-abb6-5f37c0efb9aa"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12913070"}],"rdfs:label":"Agr-MAD600-5"},{"id":"cggv:9bda0da7-6d79-43d0-9fe0-1a9dafcc6f28","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9bda0da7-6d79-43d0-9fe0-1a9dafcc6f28_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9bda0da7-6d79-43d0-9fe0-1a9dafcc6f28_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experimental data shows variant is completely inactive.\n(and Barrowman PMID: 22718200)"}],"strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:3642f767-7fd5-453d-883e-8f75d618a7a4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3642f767-7fd5-453d-883e-8f75d618a7a4_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3642f767-7fd5-453d-883e-8f75d618a7a4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experimental data shows variant has reduced activity.\n(and Barrowman PMID: 22718200)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b0240ad4-f753-41a1-aa38-78e010212f4c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b0240ad4-f753-41a1-aa38-78e010212f4c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":18,"allele":{"id":"cggv:33ed59bd-04be-4a23-997a-73d1a8cabc28","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.5(ZMPSTE24):c.794A>G (p.Asn265Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA232765"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Protuberant eyes, narrow nose, marked maxillary midline hypoplasia, and micrognathia, widely open cranial sutures, relatively short limbs, narrow chest with underdeveloped clavicles, delayed ossification of the pubis, short and broad fingers, and fixed flexion deformities of his knees with patchy areas of atrophic pigmented skin.\nRenal pathology at age 20 years revealed FSGS, progressing to renal failure at age 26 years","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4ddc489d-db7d-410d-8b3b-459f3084ab47_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:33ed59bd-04be-4a23-997a-73d1a8cabc28"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17152860","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities such as hypoplasia of the mandible and clavicles and acro-osteolysis.

Most HGPS patients carry a de novo point mutation within exon 11 of the LMNA gene encoding A-type Lamins. This mutation activates a cryptic splice site leading to the deletion of 50 amino acids at its carboxy-terminal domain, resulting in a truncated and permanently farnesylated Prelamin A called Prelamin A Δ50 or Progerin. Some patients carry other LMNA mutations affecting exon 11 splicing and are named \"HGPS-like\" patients. They also produce Progerin and/or other truncated Prelamin A isoforms (Δ35 and Δ90) at the transcriptional and/or protein level. The results we present show that morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (AON) prevent pathogenic LMNA splicing, markedly reducing the accumulation of Progerin and/or other truncated Prelamin A isoforms (Prelamin A Δ35, Prelamin A Δ90) in HGPS-like patients' cells. Finally, a patient affected with Mandibuloacral Dysplasia type B (MAD-B, carrying a homozygous mutation in ZMPSTE24, encoding an enzyme involved in Prelamin A maturation, leading to accumulation of wild type farnesylated Prelamin A), was also included in this study.

Disruption of the gene Zmpste24 caused severe growth retardation and premature death in homozygous-null mice. Histopathological analysis of the mutant mice revealed several abnormalities, including dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy and lipodystrophy. These alterations are similar to those developed by mice deficient in A-type lamin, a major component of the nuclear lamina, and phenocopy most defects observed in humans with diverse congenital laminopathies. In agreement with this finding, Zmpste24-null mice are defective in the proteolytic processing of prelamin A. This deficiency in prelamin A maturation leads to the generation of abnormalities in nuclear architecture that probably underlie the many phenotypes observed in both mice and humans with mutations in the lamin A gene.

MADB is an infancy/early childhood onset disorder (by age 2 years), with patients surviving into the third decade of life or later. It is characterized by mandibular hypoplasia, dental abnormalities, bird-like facies, joint contractures, a/hypoplastic clavicles, acral osteolysis, skin hyperpigmentation, absent or sparse hair (total or subtotal alopecia), skin atrophy, generalized lipodystrophy, and short stature.\nVariants in ZMPSTE24 have also been reported in association with the related, non-lethal progeroid disorder, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), and the lethal progeroid disorder, lethal restrictive dermopathy. In vitro studies with recombinant mutated ZMPSTE24 demonstrate that the severity of the pathology caused by ZMPSTE24 variants correlates with the residual enzymatic activity of the mutated enzyme (Barrowman et al., 2012 PMID:22718200). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no phenotypic variability or differences in the molecular mechanisms between MADB and HGPS. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy (OMIM:608612) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. We found there was sufficient phenotypic variability and differences in the molecular mechanisms between MADB and lethal restrictive dermopathy to support splitting these disorders into two distinct disease entities. Autosomal recessive lethal restrictive dermopathy (OMIM:275210) has been curated separately.\nThirteen variants (frameshift, nonsense, and missense) that have been reported in 8 probands across 8 publications (PMID:12913070, Agarwal et al., 2006 PMID:17152860, Cunningham et al., 2010 PMID:20550970, Miyoshi et al., 2008 PMID:18435794, Ahmad et al., 2010 PMID:20814950, Ben Yaou et al., 2011 PMID:21267004, Harhouri et al., 2016 PMID:27409638, Hitzert et al., 2020 PMID:31856865) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be partial loss of function.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays (Pendas et al., 2002 PMID:11923874, PMID:21267004, PMID:18435794). In particular, in vitro assays using patient cells demonstrate an accumulation of prelamin A in addition to the lamins A and C also observed in WT cells. No accumulation of prelamin A was observed in heterozygous carriers or healthy control cells (PMID:21267004, PMID:18435794). Knockout mice show severe growth retardation, loss of subcutaneous fat layer, skeletal abnormalities including small mandible and bone fragility, loss of fur, and premature death (average lifespan of 20 weeks), likely due to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Mice also show muscular dystrophy in addition to the cardiac pathology (PMID:11923874). Of note, the similarity between the knockout mouse phenotype and the human MADB phenotype supported identification of ZMPSTE24 as candidate gene for the disorder.\nIn summary, ZMPSTE24 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 06.02.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3aecf4af-4d2d-4d50-a681-9f4973cc985a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
