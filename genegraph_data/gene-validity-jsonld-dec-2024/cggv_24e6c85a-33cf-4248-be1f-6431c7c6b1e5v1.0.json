Seven missense mutations in TBX5 have been identified in patients with Holt-Oram syndrome characterized by congenital heart defects and upper limb abnormalities.

In this study we describe functional defects in DNA binding, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interaction, and cellular localization of mutant TBX5 with these missense mutations (Q49K, I54T, G80R, G169R, R237Q, R237W, and S252I).

The second group of mutations includes Q49K, I54T, G169R, and S252I, which have no or moderate effect on DNA-binding activity and the function of transcription activation of TBX5 but cause the complete loss of synergistic transcription activity between TBX5 and NKX2.5. All seven missense mutations greatly reduced the interaction of TBX5 with NKX2.5 in vivo and in vitro.

These results demonstrate that all seven missense mutations studied here are functional mutations with a spectrum of defects ranging from decreases in DNA-binding activity and transcriptional activation to the dramatic reduction of interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5, and loss of synergy in transcriptional activation between these two proteins, as well as impairment in the nuclear localization of TBX5.

These inferences are, however, based on the analysis of a relatively small number of independent cases of HOS. To better understand the relationship between mutations in TBX5 and the variable expressivity of HOS, we screened the coding and noncoding regions of TBX5 and SALL4 for mutations in 55 probands with HOS. Seventeen mutations, including six missense mutations in TBX5 and two mutations in SALL4, were found in 19 kindreds with HOS. Fewer than 50% of individuals with nonsense or frameshift mutations in TBX5 had heart and limb defects of similar severity, and only 2 of 20 individuals had heart or limb malformations of the severity predicted by the location of their mutations in the T box. These results suggest that neither the type of mutation in TBX5 nor the location of a mutation in the T box is predictive of the expressivity of malformations in individuals with HOS.","dc:creator":"Brassington AM","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Expressivity of Holt-Oram syndrome is not predicted by TBX5 genotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12789647","rdfs:label":"K5 III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Recurrent missense variants.

We analyzed 11 Chinese HOS patients (7 from three families and 4 sporadic cases) for TBX5 mutation by single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs). Three SSCP changes were detected in two of the three familial cases and one sporadic case. Sequence analysis identified three novel, heterozygous mutations in TBX5: a frameshift mutation caused by one base deletion [C416del] in one family, a mis-sense mutation (Gln49Lys) induced by a base substitution (C145A) in another family, and the other mis-sense mutation (Ile54Thr) by T161C in one sporadic case. The patients with the frameshift mutations had severer clinical manifestations that involved aplasia/hypoplasia of the arm and thumbs, while those with the mis-sense mutations presented with milder anomalies such as absent or hypoplastic thumbs but without arm abnormalities.

At least 120 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, small deletions) have been reported in humans, the majority which are de novo.  The upper-limb malformations associated with HOS are fully penetrant, whereas the congenital heart malformations associated with the disease may be less so. In some cases, the cardiac phenotype may be recognized prior to limb anomalies, as some upper limb malformations have a very mild presentation. Cardiac conduction defects that are associated with HOS may occur in the presence or absence of structural heart defects. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.The mechanism for TBX5 is haploinsufficiency (Basson et al., 1999, PMID:10077612; Gruenauer-Kloevekorn et al., 2003, PMID 12818525; Baban et al., 2014, PMID 24664498). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, protein interaction studies. Functional alterations were also shown in non-patient cells harbouring missense variants in TBX5 in different affected individuals. In summary, TBX5 is definitively associated with Holt-Oram syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 26Jan2021 (SOP Version 8).\n>2 publications about gene-disease relationship since original publication in year 1997.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:24e6c85a-33cf-4248-be1f-6431c7c6b1e5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
