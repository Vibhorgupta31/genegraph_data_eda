By high-throughput sequencing of the entire candidate region, we detected disease-causing mutations in the gene PYCR1.

Altered mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential and increased apoptosis rate upon oxidative stress were evident in fibroblasts from affected individuals. Knockdown of the orthologous genes in Xenopus and zebrafish led to epidermal hypoplasia and blistering that was accompanied by a massive increase of apoptosis.

Recently, we reported the cloning and expression of human and murine P5CS cDNAs. Previously, we showed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative splicing to generate two isoforms differing only by a 2 amino acid insert at the N-terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine. Here, we describe a newly recognized inborn error due to the deficiency of P5CS in two siblings with progressive neurodegeneration, joint laxity, skin hyperelasticity and bilateral subcapsular cataracts. Their metabolic phenotype includes hyperammonemia, hypoornithinemia, hypocitrullinemia, hypoargininemia and hypoprolinemia. Both are homozygous for the missense mutation, R84Q, which alters a conserved residue in the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain. R84Q is not present in 194 control chromosomes and dramatically reduces the activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells. Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform. This is the first documented report of an inborn error of P5CS and suggests that this disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with neurodegeneration and/or cataracts and connective tissue disease.","dc:creator":"Baumgartner MR","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Hyperammonemia with reduced ornithine, citrulline, arginine and proline: a new inborn error caused by a mutation in the gene encoding delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase."},"rdfs:label":"PYCR1 and ALDH18A1 Share Functions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Because both ALDH18A1 and PYCR1 are demonstrably involved in the Proline biosynthesis pathway and deficency in both can result in the exact same type of Cutis Laxa, de Barsy Syndrome, this provides significant evidence towards P5CS's pathogenicity.

ALDH18A1 encodes delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), an enzyme that catalyses the first and common step of proline and ornithine biosynthesis from glutamate. Through exome sequencing and candidate gene screening, we report two families with autosomal recessive transmission of ALDH18A1 mutations, and predominant complex hereditary spastic paraplegia with marked cognitive impairment, without any cutaneous abnormality. More interestingly, we also identified monoallelic ALDH18A1 mutations segregating in three independent families with autosomal dominant pure or complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as in two sporadic patients. Low levels of plasma ornithine, citrulline, arginine and proline in four individuals from two families suggested P5CS deficiency. Glutamine loading tests in two fibroblast cultures from two related affected subjects confirmed a metabolic block at the level of P5CS in vivo. Besides expanding the clinical spectrum of ALDH18A1-related pathology, we describe mutations segregating in an autosomal dominant pattern. The latter are associated with a potential trait biomarker; we therefore suggest including amino acid chromatography in the clinico-genetic work-up of hereditary spastic paraplegia, particularly in dominant cases, as the associated phenotype is not distinct from other causative genes.

We report here on eight unrelated individuals born to non-consanguineous families clinically diagnosed with DBS or wrinkly skin syndrome. We found three heterozygous mutations in ALDH18A1 leading to amino acid substitutions of the same highly conserved residue, Arg138 in P5CS. A de novo origin was confirmed in all six probands for whom parental DNA was available. Using fibroblasts from affected individuals and heterologous overexpression, we found that the P5CS-p.Arg138Trp protein was stable and able to interact with wild-type P5CS but showed an altered sub-mitochondrial distribution. A reduced size upon native gel electrophoresis indicated an alteration of the structure or composition of P5CS mutant complex. Furthermore, we found that the mutant cells had a reduced P5CS enzymatic activity leading to a delayed proline accumulation. In summary, recurrent de novo mutations, affecting the highly conserved residue Arg138 of P5CS, cause an autosomal-dominant form of cutis laxa with progeroid features. Our data provide insights into the etiology of cutis laxa diseases and will have immediate impact on diagnostics and genetic counseling.

This gene, which encodes delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), was first characterized in a family with autosomal recessive cutis laxa (Baumgartner et al., PMID: 11092761). However, more recently it has been implicated in both autosomal dominant and resessive forms of cutis laxa and spastic paraplegia (PMIDs: 26026163, 26320891). At least fifteen unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, significant segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least seventeen probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 11092761, 21739576, 24913064, 26026163, 26297558, 26320891, 28228640). Variants in this gene also segregated with the disorder in over twenty-five additional family members, the majority of which were confirmed via whole exome sequencing. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is a variable loss-of-function, depending on the specific mutation(s) present. ALDH18A1 variants fall on a spectrum of severity based on the amount of P5CS residual activity, ranging from the less severe dominant negative missense variants (AD cutis laxa/AD spastic paraplegia) to the highly severe null or grossly misfolded variants that show little to no activity (AR cutis laxa/AR spastic paraplegia) (Marco-Marin et al., 2020; PMID: 32017139).\nThis gene-disease association is additionally supported by a limited amount of experimental evidence. P5CS is a crucial enzyme in several amino acid pathways, catalyzing the de novo biosynthesis of proline, ornithine, and arginine by converting glutamate into P5C. This function additionally matches the probands' metabolic phenotype, commonly consisting of hyperammonemia, hypoornithinemia, hypocitrullinemia, hypoargininemia and/or hypoprolinemia. A similar function is shared by PYRC1, an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in proline synthesis and is established as a causative agent in de Barsy syndrome (AKA AR Cutis Laxa Type III). Immunoflorescent analysis of skin fibroblast mitochondria additionally demonstrates colocalization of PYCR1 and P5CS (PMID: 19648921). \nIn summary, ALDH18A1 is definitively associated with semidominant P5CS deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7bfbe962-beb3-4553-9909-a83a3aac2d55"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
