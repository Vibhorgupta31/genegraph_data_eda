Our goal was to extend molecular genetic analysis to newly identified ALS genetic loci and to determine the frequency of mutations, distribution of disease genes, and variant spectrum of these genes in a large United States ALS-phenotype cohort. We screened 1220 probands with an ALS phenotype, referred originally for SOD1 molecular genetic analysis. 1128 SOD1-negative probands were screened for ANG, and 277 and 223 SOD1- and ANG-negative samples were screened for TARDBP and FUS, respectively. One hundred additional probands were specifically screened only for FUS exon 15. We identified a total of 36 different SOD1 mutations, including three novel mutations, in 92 probands. ANG screening identified three mutations, including two novel mutations, and TARDBP screening identified two previously reported TARDBP mutations. We also identified four mutations in FUS, including the reported FUS in-frame deletion, c.430_447del, p.Gly144_Tyr149del, in a patient with inclusion body myositis, and two known FUS missense mutations. From this study, we estimate frequencies for SOD1, ANG, TARDBP and FUS mutations, in this United States cohort, to be 7.5%, 0.71%, 0.72% and 1.9%, respectively. In conclusion, we identify novel variants in SOD1, ANG, TARDBP and FUS, and expand the FUS-associated clinicopathologic phenotype.","dc:creator":"Brown JA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"SOD1, ANG, TARDBP and FUS mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a United States clinical testing lab experience."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22292843","rdfs:label":"SOD1-7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The Gly28_Pro29del variant was identified in one ALS patient but was not supported by functional evidence of a deleterious effect."},{"id":"cggv:e4439b44-af77-49c9-aae4-2531c3de9904_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de17c893-9d8d-49ed-8c9e-5272d9ab420a","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"PCR amplification of the entire coding region and exon-intron boundaries of SOD1 from genomic DNA.

Its cause is unknown and it is uniformly fatal, typically within five years. About 10% of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance after the sixth decade. In most instances, sporadic and autosomal dominant familial ALS (FALS) are clinically similar. We have previously shown that in some but not all FALS pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8, 9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between FALS and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O2.- to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders, we investigated SOD1 as a candidate gene in FALS. We identified 11 different SOD1 missense mutations in 13 different FALS families.","dc:creator":"Rosen DR","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8446170","rdfs:label":"Family 11"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The Leu39Val (reported as Leu38Val) variant was identified in Family 11 and is supported by functional evidence in PMID: 28884318.

Despite advances in understanding of ALS disease progression and SOD1 folding and stability, cytotoxic species and mechanisms remain unknown, greatly impeding the search for and design of therapeutic interventions. Here, we definitively link cytotoxicity associated with SOD1 aggregation in ALS to a nonnative trimeric SOD1 species.

We apply this methodology to derive the structure of a SOD1 trimer, which we validate in vitro and in hybridized motor neurons.

Further, we demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of the designed mutants correlates with trimer stability, providing a direct link between the presence of misfolded oligomers and neuron death.

Genetic linkage analysis performed with 13 ALS families for 10 DNA markers confirmed the presence of a FALS gene on chromosome 21. The highest total 2-point LOD score for all families was\n4.33, obtained at a distance of 10 CM from the marker D21S223 and a multipoint score of 6.50 was obtained with the markers D21S213, D21S223,\nD21S167, and FALS for 5 chromosome 21-\nlinked ALS families (PMID: 7913294). ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons in the brain and lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord, resulting in fatal paralysis. SOD1 encodes superoxide dismutase which has a tendency to form aggregates, and recent work has highlighted oligomers, specifically trimeric forms as the neurotoxic species (PMID: 26719414). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. More than 155 mutations in SOD1 have been found and associated with ALS, including single point mutations, truncations, deletions, and insertions in the protein (reviewed in PMID: 2368712). This curation includes 35 variants in this gene that have been reported in 35 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 8446170, 22292843, 8004110). A few mechanisms of disease implicated with SOD1 mutations are protein misfolding, proteasome impairment, oxidative stress, oligodendrocyte degeneration, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by the alterations observed in cells expressing SOD1 variants, which support the disease mechanism or association, including the formation of trimers (PMID: 26719414), or aggregates (PMID: 19483195), and the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum which induces stress (PMID: 12659845). Further support is provided by several animal models (at least 12 transgenic strains, reviewed in PMID: 21706386) including mouse (PMID: 8209258) and rat models (PMID: 11717358), which recapitulate features of ALS. More genetic and experimental evidence is available in the literature, however the maximum score of 18pts has been reached. In summary SOD1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on 07/13/2021 (SOPv8).\n\nOf note, SOD1 has also been reported in relation to progressive spastic tetraplegia and axial hypotonia. This will be curated separately from ALS per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting working group; there is a difference in molecular mechanism (gain of toxicity vs loss of function), phenotype (adult onset motor disease vs pediatric onset pan-neurodegenerative disease), and inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant vs recessive). Additionally, ALS has also been reported with biallelic SOD1 variants, specifically Scandinavian founder variant D90A, which shows both autosomal dominant and recessive patterns in different populations (Andersen et al., 1995; Al-Chalabi et al., 1998; Aguirre et al., 1999; Hand et al., 2001; Pasinelli and Brown, 2006). However, this variant may be considered a risk allele, only resulting in disease when biallelic or in combination with another risk factor, and only dominant cases were considered within this curation.\n\nAs per SOPv8 all 11 points scored for \"Proband with other variant type with some evidence of gene impact\" are considered applicable to the overall genetic evidence total, raising it from 8pt to 12pt and the total points increase from 14pt to 18pt.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:97d17778-d21e-441f-b4b7-49eccaa8cbab"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
