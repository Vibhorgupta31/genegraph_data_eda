In patient-derived fibroblasts, we found a complete loss of SORD protein and increased intracellular sorbitol. Furthermore, the serum fasting sorbitol levels in patients were dramatically increased. In Drosophila, loss of SORD orthologs caused synaptic degeneration and progressive motor impairment. Reducing the polyol influx by treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors normalized intracellular sorbitol levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and in Drosophila, and also dramatically ameliorated motor and eye phenotypes. Together, these findings establish a novel and potentially treatable cause of neuropathy and may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes.","dc:creator":"Cortese A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Biallelic mutations in SORD cause a common and potentially treatable hereditary neuropathy with implications for diabetes."}},"rdfs:label":"II-3"},{"id":"cggv:49fb72b4-660b-41f5-9d35-40ee1e562f4c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:49fb72b4-660b-41f5-9d35-40ee1e562f4c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:49fb72b4-660b-41f5-9d35-40ee1e562f4c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Increased sorbitol in patient fibroblasts and serum"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:33703f9f-d4c9-47d1-b551-c6acded706e8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33703f9f-d4c9-47d1-b551-c6acded706e8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":25,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:fe08b50e-72a8-4be4-9aff-7586d3c6796c"},{"id":"cggv:5d6a6689-05e5-4b8a-8b83-15715eef628a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003104.6(SORD):c.786+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7537321"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007178","obo:HP_0003690"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"WES three years prior","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b23629e4-e276-4b01-b32b-5b4df3ce2a4a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5d6a6689-05e5-4b8a-8b83-15715eef628a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995833","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) has been identified as the causative gene of autosomal recessive distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN).

Eighteen patients from 16 unrelated families with biallelic variants in the SORD gene were found and the c.757del was present in all patients on at least one allele. Three novel, probably pathogenic, variants were detected, always in a heterozygous state in combination with the c.757del on the second allele. Patients presented with a slowly progressive axonal HN. Almost all patients had moderate pes cavus deformity. SORD neuropathy is frequent in Czech patients and the third most common cause of autosomal recessive HN. The c.757del is highly prevalent.

The C57BL/LiA mouse has SDH deficiency due to a G-to-A mutation at the +1 position of intron 8, thus producing only aberrant SDH transcripts. These C57BL/LiA mice should have higher levels of polyol accumulation in the peripheral nerve because of the inability to further metabolize sorbitol to fructose. Here, we confirm by Western blot analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography that these mice lack SDH in the sciatic nerve and other various tissues, whereas normal mice possess SDH. These C57BL/LiA mice do not display any obvious phenotype that includes peripheral neuropathy in the normal laboratory environment and breed normally as described previously, although the tissues that normally contain SDH accumulate more sorbitol. This finding suggested that C57BL/LiA mouse strain is a valid model for studying the role in diabetic neuropathy of the polyol pathway, which consists of two enzymes-aldose reductase for converting glucose to sorbitol and SDH for converting sorbitol to fructose. Sorbitol levels in the sciatic nerve of diabetic C57BL/10N, nondiabetic, and diabetic C57BL/LiA mice were increased 4.3-, 16.6-, and 38.1-fold, respectively, above that of nondiabetic C57BL/10N. The fructose level in the sciatic nerve was increased 2.4-fold in diabetic C57BL/10N mice compared with that of nondiabetic and diabetic C57BL/LiA mice. Diabetic SDH-deficient mice showed an MNCV reduction similar in magnitude to that of diabetic C57BL/10N mice, despite greater nerve sorbitol accumulation and the lack of fructose in the former. The present data suggest that the levels of sorbitol and fructose in the sciatic nerve of mice do not correlate with the severity of MNCV deficit associated with diabetes.","dc:creator":"Ng TF","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Effects of sorbitol dehydrogenase deficiency on nerve conduction in experimental diabetic mice."},"rdfs:label":"Western Blot"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:aac3d58a-b916-4b71-819f-ba4ef1de18d2_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bac609dd-4686-4d6c-8c0b-549e54d82c1d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ccff4fb2-80ed-4403-b2ad-91c77ca25c35","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Sorbitol accumulation in fibroblasts from patients","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32367058","rdfs:label":"Sorbitol Analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:aac3d58a-b916-4b71-819f-ba4ef1de18d2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e493560-1843-46e1-ad9c-c192ec388dfd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:740757ea-b828-43f4-aa74-12c311de4c9e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Humans motor neuropathy cause fine motor skills dysfunction and locomotion impairment, similar to findings in Drosophila","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32367058","rdfs:label":"Drosophila Sodh2 Knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6145,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8ab3388a-cab1-43fc-80da-55a5480dc3bb","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015626","gene":"hgnc:11184","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"SORD was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in 2020 (Cortese et al., PMID: 32367058). SORD neuropathy (OMIM: 618912) is caused by loss of the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase, which converts sorbitol to fructose, leading to toxic accumulation of sorbitol levels. Patients with SORD variants develop CMT2 or distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). SORD deficiency is one of the most common types of recessive CMT, with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 100,000 individuals. In this curation, we have included 5 probands from three different publications, all harboring a common frameshift variant (Ala253GlnfsTer27), presented as homozygous or compound heterozygous (PMID: 32367058, 34995833, and 33875678). The most common pathogenic variant is present at a relatively high allele frequency in the population (gnomAD= 0.0004). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for the genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (expression studies, animal model, and functional alteration in patient cells)(PMID: 32367058 and 9604875). Fibroblasts and serum from patients show abnormally increased levels of sorbitol. Loss of the SORD gene ortholog in Drosophila caused synaptic degeneration, progressive motor impairment, and increased sorbitol levels, which were rescued by treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors (PMID: 32367058). A total of 15.5 points have been obtained for this curation. In summary, SORD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive CMT. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aac3d58a-b916-4b71-819f-ba4ef1de18d2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
