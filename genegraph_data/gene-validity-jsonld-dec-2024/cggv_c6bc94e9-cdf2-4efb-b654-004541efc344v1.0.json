In addition to rare ACADS inactivating variations, two common variations, c.511C > T (p.Arg171Trp) and c.625G > A (p.Gly209Ser), have been identified in patients, but these are also present in up to 14% of normal populations leading to questions of their clinical relevance. The common variant alleles encode proteins with nearly normal enzymatic activity at physiological conditions in vitro. SCAD enzyme function, however, is impaired at increased temperature and the tendency to misfold increases under conditions of cellular stress. The present study examines misfolding of variant SCAD proteins identified in patients with SCAD deficiency. Analysis of the ACADS gene in 114 patients revealed 29 variations, 26 missense, one start codon, and two stop codon variations. In vitro import studies of variant SCAD proteins in isolated mitochondria from SCAD deficient (SCAD-/-) mice demonstrated an increased tendency of the abnormal proteins to misfold and aggregate compared to the wild-type, a phenomenon that often leads to gain-of-function cellular phenotypes. However, no correlation was found between the clinical phenotype and the degree of SCAD dysfunction. We propose that SCAD deficiency should be considered as a disorder of protein folding that can lead to clinical disease in combination with other genetic and environmental factors.","dc:creator":"Pedersen CB","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The ACADS gene variation spectrum in 114 patients with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency is dominated by missense variations leading to protein misfolding at the cellular level."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18523805","rdfs:label":"Proband 6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Probable founder variant.

Less than 10 patients have been reported, diagnosed on the basis of ethylmalonic aciduria and low SCAD activity in cultured fibroblast. However, mild ethylmalonic aciduria, a biochemical marker of functional SCAD deficiency in vivo, is a common finding in patients suspected of having metabolic disorders. Based on previous observations, we have proposed that ethylmalonic aciduria in a small proportion of cases is caused by pathogenic SCAD gene mutations, and SCAD deficiency can be demonstrated in fibroblasts. Another - much more frequent - group of patients with mild ethylmalonic aciduria has functional SCAD deficiency due to the presence of susceptibility SCAD gene variations, i.e. 625G>A and 511C>T, in whom a variable or moderately reduced SCAD activity in fibroblasts may still be clinically relevant. To substantiate this notion we performed sequence analysis of the SCAD gene in 10 patients with ethylmalonic aciduria and diagnosed with SCAD deficiency in fibroblasts. Surprisingly, only one of the 10 patients carried pathogenic mutations in both alleles, while five were double heterozygotes for a pathogenic mutation in one allele and the 625G>A susceptibility variation in the other. The remaining four patients carried only either the 511C>T or the 625G>A variations in each allele. Our findings document that patients carrying these SCAD gene variations may develop clinically relevant SCAD deficiency, and that patients with even mild ethylmalonic aciduria should be tested for these variations.","dc:creator":"Corydon MJ","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Role of common gene variations in the molecular pathogenesis of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11134486","rdfs:label":"Patient 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4e64fa24-eb73-46d6-a92d-4d079c70883b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5aae373a-7020-47b8-88f3-e616afb478cc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":19,"detectionMethod":"Referenced the sequencing protocol from  Corydon et al. 2001 PMID:11134486","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"ethylmalonic aciduria","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003219","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"None, acquired through positive newborn screen","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:4e64fa24-eb73-46d6-a92d-4d079c70883b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:73e5ccd1-27a9-4902-81f7-03d1f9d19ded"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18676165","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The medical and neurodevelopmental characteristics of 14 children with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) are described.

Genetic defect of SCAD was documented to cause clinical symptoms such as progressive psychomotor retardation, muscle hypotonia, and myopathy in early reports. However, clinical significance of SCAD deficiency (SCADD) has been getting ambiguous, for some variants in the ACADS gene, which encodes the SCAD protein, has turned out to be widely prevailed among general populations. Accordingly, the pathophysiology of SCADD has not been clarified thus far. The present report focuses on two suspected cases of SCADD detected through the screening of newborns by tandem mass spectrometry. In both subjects, compound heterozygous mutations in ACADS were detected. The mutated genes were expressed in a transient gene expression system, and the enzymatic activities of the obtained mutant SCAD proteins were measured. The activities of the mutant SCAD proteins were significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, confirming the mechanism underlying the diagnosis of SCADD in both subjects. Moreover, the mutant SCAD proteins gave rise to mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy, both of which were proportional to the decrease in SCAD activities. The association of autophagy with programmed cell death suggests that the mutant SCAD proteins are toxic to mitochondria and to the cells in which they are expressed. The expression of recombinant ACADS-encoded mutant proteins offers a technique to evaluate both the nature of the defective SCAD proteins and their toxicity. Moreover, our results provide insight into possible molecular pathophysiology of SCADD.","dc:creator":"Shirao K","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Molecular pathogenesis of a novel mutation, G108D, in short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase identified in subjects with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20376488","rdfs:label":"Subject 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:c08dbffd-77fd-43e8-a25b-c2ea49f78ef4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3122eb0d-d307-4755-896f-e663d69ad186","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Probands pooled from multiple sources.

On the other hand, the 511C-->T mutation was present in 13 of 130 and 15 of 67 625G alleles, respectively, of normal controls and patients with elevated EMA excretion, and was never associated with the 625A variant allele. This over-representation of the haplotype 511T-625G among the common 625G alleles in patients compared with controls was significant ( P < 0.02), suggesting that the allele 511T-625G-like 511C-625A-confers susceptibility to ethylmalonic aciduria. Expression of the variant R147W SCAD protein, encoded by the 511T-625G allele, in COS-7 cells showed 45% activity at 37 degrees C in comparison with the wild-type protein, comparable levels of activity at 26 degrees C, and 13% activity when incubated at 41 degrees C. This temperature profile is different from that observed for the variant G185S SCAD protein, encoded by the 511C-625A allele, where higher than normal activity was found at 26 and 37 degrees C, and 58% activity was present at 41 degrees C. These results corroborate the notion that the 511C-625A variant allele is one of the possible underlying causes of ethylmalonic aciduria, and suggest that the 511C-->T mutation represents a second susceptibility variation in the SCAD gene. We conclude that ethylmalonic aciduria, a commonly detected biochemical phenotype, is a complex multifactorial/polygenic condition where, in addition to the emerging role of SCAD susceptibility alleles, other genetic and environmental factors are involved.","dc:creator":"Gregersen N","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Identification of four new mutations in the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) gene in two patients: one of the variant alleles, 511C-->T, is present at an unexpectedly high frequency in the general population, as was the case for 625G-->A, together conferring susceptibility to ethylmalonic aciduria."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9499414","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:22cc076f-ffc4-4db3-8b23-d1a155475d10_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f8d27d25-082d-4495-817a-1c38b3c7a97e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":10,"detectionMethod":"Referenced the sequencing protocol from  Corydon et al. 2001 PMID:11134486","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"ethylmalonic aciduria","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003219","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"None, acquired through positive newborn screen","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:22cc076f-ffc4-4db3-8b23-d1a155475d10_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:28b09845-a109-437c-8fe7-0110790b684c"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18676165"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18676165","rdfs:label":"Case 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:6367ac92-03f6-412f-a9f4-ba4beb62faf0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f175eb6d-fdec-4d68-908d-5018daf50be8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Direct sequencing of  gene specific PCR product only","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Hypotonia, developmental delay, myopathy  (Unspecified, no HPO was added for curation), speech delay, lethargy, feeding difficulties,   EMA 65-222, C4 elevated","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001254","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0008872","obo:HP_0003219","obo:HP_0008947","obo:HP_0001263"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6367ac92-03f6-412f-a9f4-ba4beb62faf0_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:73e5ccd1-27a9-4902-81f7-03d1f9d19ded"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18054510","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report 10 children (7 male, 3 female), 3 homozygous for c.319C>T mutation and 7 heterozygous for c.319C>T on one allele and c.625G>A variant on the other in the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) gene (ACADS). All were of Ashkenazi Jewish origin in which group we found a c.319C>T heterozygote frequency of 1:15 suggesting the presence of a founder mutation or selective advantage. Phenotype was variable with onset from birth to early childhood. Features included hypotonia (8/10), developmental delay (8/10), myopathy (4/10) with multicore changes in two and lipid storage in one, facial weakness (3/10), lethargy (5/10), feeding difficulties (4/10) and congenital abnormalities (3/7). One female with multiminicore myopathy had progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis and cardiomyopathy with pneumonia and respiratory failure. Two brothers presented with psychosis, pyramidal signs, and multifocal white matter abnormalities on MRI brain suggesting additional genetic factors. Two other infants also had white matter changes. Elevated butyrylcarnitine (4/8), ethylmalonic aciduria (9/9), methylsuccinic aciduria (6/7), decreased butyrate oxidation in lymphoblasts (2/4) and decreased SCAD activity in fibroblasts or muscle (3/3) were shown.
