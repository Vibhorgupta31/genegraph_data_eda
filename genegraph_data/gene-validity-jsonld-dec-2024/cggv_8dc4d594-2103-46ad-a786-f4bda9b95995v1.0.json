Consequently, Btk‐deficient B lymphocytes fail to reach the mature state and are presumably doomed to premature death.

By measuring the ability of human PLCgamma2 to restore calcium responses to the B-cell receptor stimulation or oxidative stress in a B-cell line (DT40) deficient in PLCgamma2, we have demonstrated that two tyrosine residues, Tyr(753) and Tyr(759), were important for the PLCgamma2 signaling function. Furthermore, the double mutation Y753F/Y759F in PLCgamma2 resulted in a loss of tyrosine phosphorylation in stimulated DT40 cells. Of the two kinases that previously have been proposed to phosphorylate PLCgamma2, Btk, and Syk, purified Btk had much greater ability to phosphorylate recombinant PLCgamma2 in vitro, whereas Syk efficiently phosphorylated adapter protein BLNK. Using purified proteins to analyze the formation of complexes, we suggest that function of Syk is to phosphorylate BLNK, providing binding sites for PLCgamma2. Further analysis of PLCgamma2 tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Btk and several kinases from the Src family has suggested multiple sites of phosphorylation and, in the context of a peptide incorporating residues Tyr(753) and Tyr(759), shown preferential phosphorylation of Tyr(753).","dc:creator":"Rodriguez R","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Tyrosine residues in phospholipase Cgamma 2 essential for the enzyme function in B-cell signaling."},"rdfs:label":"protein tyrosine kinase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Using purified protein components in an in vitro phosphorylation assay, Btk was implicated in direct phosphorylation of PLCγ2, including the important Tyr753 residue."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:8dc4d594-2103-46ad-a786-f4bda9b95995_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55055762-f21f-4dbf-a973-f647c53ae715","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97ad4a63-2294-432b-8941-eba53fc9144f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Btk protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates of normal and patient EBV-transformed B cell lines and in vitro autokinase activity was assayed.

It is characterized by susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, and few or no circulating B cells. XLA is caused by mutations in the BTK gene, which encodes Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Because of its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, XLA virtually only affects males, and the mother is the carrier of the mutation in 80-85% of the males with this condition. In the remaining 15-20% of the cases, the affected male is considered to have a de novo mutation. Here, we present the case of a child with a diagnosis of XLA caused by a missense mutation in the BTK gene (c.494G>A/p.C165Y). Apparently, his mother was wild type for this gene, which implied that the mutation was de novo, but careful analysis of Sanger electropherograms and the use of high-coverage massive parallel sequencing revealed low-level maternal gonosomal mosaicism. The mutation was detected in various samples from the mother (blood, urine, buccal swab, and vaginal swab) at a low frequency of 2-5%, and the status of the patient's mutation changed from de novo to inherited. This study underscores the importance of accurately establishing the parents' status on detection of an apparently de novo mutation in a patient, as inadvertent low-level mosaicism may lead to misinterpretation of the risk of recurrence, vital for genetic counseling.","dc:creator":"Rivière JG","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Uncovering Low-Level Maternal Gonosomal Mosaicism in X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia: Implications for Genetic Counseling."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32117230","rdfs:label":"Mosaicism Case"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The missense variant Cys165Tyr was identified in this patient whose monocytes showed an absence of BTK expression, suggesting that the Cys165Tyr mutation led to complete BTK deficiency, however functional evidence was not provided for this variant.

The relationship of BTK to XLA was first reported in 1993 (PMIDs: 8425221, 8380905). Btk is a tyrosine kinase, which is critical in the maturation of Pre-B cells to mature B cells. The absence of functional Btk leads to failure of B-cell development that incapacitates antibody production in XLA patients leading to recurrent bacterial infections (reviewed in PMID: 26909497). Over 900 unique variants have been reported in humans (BTKbase; PMID: 16969761), including missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, small indels, and gross insertions or deletions. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Twenty-three unique variants from 23 probands in 4 publications were curated (PMIDs: 8380905, 17765309, 7880320, 8162056). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members (PMIDs: 17765309, 8162056). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its role as a tyrosine kinase in B-cell development (PMID: 11606584) and its expression in relevant cells and tissues (PMID: 8380905), both of which are altered in patient cells (PMID: 8425221). Further support is provided by chimeric mice (PMID: 7552995), the xid mouse model (PMID: 8332900), and a null mouse model (PMID: 7552994), all of which recapitulate features of XLA. In summary BTK is definitively associated with x-linked Bruton-type agammaglobulinemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nOf note, this gene has also been implicated in isolated growth hormone deficiency type III (MONDO:0010615). This has been assessed separately given the lack of known overlapping molecular mechanism and distinct phenotype.  Furthermore, somatic variants in BTK are associated with malignancy, which is not considered here.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8dc4d594-2103-46ad-a786-f4bda9b95995"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
