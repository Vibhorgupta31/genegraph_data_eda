The protein encoded by BRCA1 interacts in vivo with the BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) protein. Accordingly, BARD1 is likely to be a critical factor in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression and may also serve as a target for tumorigenic lesions in some human cancers. We have now determined the genomic structure of BARD1 and performed a mutational analysis of 58 ovarian tumors, 50 breast tumors and 60 uterine tumors. Seven polymorphisms were detected within the 2.34 kb coding sequence of BARD1 . Somatically acquired missense mutations were observed in one breast carcinoma and one endometrial tumor; in at least one of these cases, tumor formation was accompanied by loss of the wild-type BARD1 allele, following the paradigm for known tumor suppressor genes. In addition, a germline alteration of BARD1 was identified in a clear cell ovarian tumor (Gln564His); again, loss of the wild-type BARD1 allele was observed in the malignant cells of this patient. The Gln564His patient was also diagnosed with two other primary cancers: a synchronous lobular breast carcinoma and a stage IA clear cell endometrioid cancer confined to an endometrial polyp 6 years earlier. These findings suggest an occasional role for BARD1 mutations in the development of sporadic and hereditary tumors.","dc:creator":"Thai TH","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutations in the BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) gene in primary breast, ovarian and uterine cancers."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02af8326-360e-4f42-a378-fefff7387d97_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02af8326-360e-4f42-a378-fefff7387d97_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e80b28b2-cf1b-4194-9624-382339017aa8","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Contradicts","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e80b28b2-cf1b-4194-9624-382339017aa8_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","caseCohort":{"id":"cggv:3637fa42-5334-4ecb-aa28-b15090e47dd3","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":20800,"alleleFrequency":0.001153846153846154,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e80b28b2-cf1b-4194-9624-382339017aa8_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":24,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0016248"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"cggv:1c9b65e6-ff1e-4953-b54b-1de8458dd219","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":134116,"alleleFrequency":0.0008500104387246861,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e80b28b2-cf1b-4194-9624-382339017aa8_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":114},"lowerConfidenceLimit":0.87,"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.1733,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.36,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":2.11,"dc:description":"Odds Ratio calculated as not significant.

BARD1 was proposed to be linked to ovarian cancer due to its relationship with breast cancer and an early case-control study (PMID: 26720728). The mechanism of pathogenicity was proposed to be via BRCA1 binding and subsequent loss of DNA damage response. BARD1-related cancer predisposition MONDO:0700267 is characterized by a susceptibility to breast cancer with emerging evidence suggesting the association of other cancer types including neuroblastoma. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we did a split curation for BARD1-related ovarian cancer predisposition given evidence to dispute or refute. The prior curation in 2017 was Limited. For ovarian cancer, 1 variant has been reported in 1 proband in 1 study (PMID: 9425226), no other clear disease causing variants could be identified. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 8 case-control studies at the aggregate variant level and 1 case-control study (PMID:15342711) at the single variant level. Of these studies, one study reports an association (PMID: 26720728) while 4 report no association (non-significant Odds Ratio), and another 3 reported that despite evaluating BARD1, no associated variants were identified in any cases (PMIDs: 31036035, 15342711, 29020732). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between BARD1 and autosomal dominant hereditary ovarian cancer has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to entirely refute the role BARD1 plays in this disease. This re-curation as disputed was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 04/26/2024 (SOP Version 10). As a result of this re-evaluation, the overall classification changed from Limited to Disputed.\n\nDespite an early study suggesting an association between BARD1 and ovarian cancer (Norquist et al. 2016 PMID:26720728), there remains no clear additional evidence. A number of studies show case-control evidence against a role for BARD1 in ovarian cancer.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:02af8326-360e-4f42-a378-fefff7387d97"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
