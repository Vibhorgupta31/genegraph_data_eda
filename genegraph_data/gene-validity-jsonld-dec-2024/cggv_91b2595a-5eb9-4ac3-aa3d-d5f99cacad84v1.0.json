These include autophagic vacuoles containing both lysosomal and autophagosomal proteins sometimes lined with sarcolemmal proteins such as dystrophin. These features have been most clearly described in patients with Danon's disease due to LAMP2 deficiency and X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) due to mutations in VMA21. Disruptions of these proteins lead to lysosomal dysfunction and subsequent autophagic vacuolar pathology. We performed whole exome sequencing on two families with autosomal dominantly inherited myopathies with autophagic vacuolar pathology and surprisingly identified a p.R454W tail domain mutation and a novel p.S6W head domain mutation in desmin, DES. In addition, re-evaluation of muscle tissue from another family with a novel p.I402N missense DES mutation also identified autophagic vacuoles. We suggest that autophagic vacuoles may be an underappreciated pathology present in desminopathy patient muscle. Moreover, autophagic vacuolar pathology can be due to genetic etiologies unrelated to primary defects in the lysosomes or autophagic machinery. Specifically, cytoskeletal derangement and the accumulation of aggregated proteins such as desmin may activate the autophagic system leading to the pathologic features of an autophagic vacuolar myopathy.

In mature striated muscle fibers, the desmin filament lattice surrounds the Z-discs, interconnects them to each other and links the entire contractile apparatus to the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton, cytoplasmic organelles and the nucleus. There have been increasing reports of human cardiomyopathies associated with abnormal accumulation and aggregation of desmin filaments. Recently identified desmin mutations in humans suffering from skeletal muscle myopathy and cardiomyopathy suggest that these diseases might arise as a consequence of impaired function of desmin filaments. Previous generation of desmin null mice in our laboratory demonstrated that the absence of desmin results in myocyte ultrastructural defects and myocyte cell death leading to fibrosis and calcification of the myocardium. However, the effects that these defects have on cardiac function were not addressed. To further our understanding of desmin function in vivo, and in order to address the direct involvement of desmin in cardiomyopathy, we investigated the effect of the absence of desmin on myocardial mass, myocyte size and shape, changes in gene expression and cardiac systolic and diastolic function in mice. Morphometric characterization of isolated cardiomyocytes demonstrated a 24% increase in cell volume in the desmin null mice, solely due to an increase in transverse section area, suggesting for the first time that mice lacking the intermediate filament protein desmin develop concentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This type of hypertrophy was accompanied by induction of embryonic gene expression and later by ventricular dilatation, and compromised systolic function. These results demonstrate that desmin is essential for normal cardiac function, and they suggest that the absence of an intact desmin filament system, rather than accumulation of the protein, may be responsible for the pathology seen in some of the desmin associated cardiomyopathies.","dc:creator":"Milner DJ","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"The absence of desmin leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac dilation with compromised systolic function."},"rdfs:label":"Generation of Des-/- mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This is a model of Des null mice, rather than a model based on a human DES mutation associated with DCM.

Desmin is the major Intermediate filament that integrates the sarcolemma, Z disk and nuclear membrane in sarcomeres and regulates sarcomeric architecture. Disease-associated desmin variants cause an accumulation of disorganized intracytoplasmic aggregates containing desmin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least 18 variants (including missense, nonsense, splice-site) have been reported in humans with DCM (Li et al., 1999, PMID 10430757; Miyamoto et al., 2001, PMID 11728149; Taylor et al., 2007, PMID 17325244; Tse et al., 2013, PMID 23300193; Gigli et al., 2019, PMID 31514951; Brodehl et al., 2016, PMID 26724190; van Spaendonck-Zwarts et al., 2013, PMID 23349452; Weihl et al., 2015 PMID 25557463 . This gene-disease relationship has been studied in one large case-control study at the aggregate variant level (Mazzarotto et al., 2020, PMID 31983221). There was no enrichment of rare DES variants in two DCM cohorts compared to ExAC derived controls. In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (Milner et al., 1999, PMID 10591032;  Taylor et al., 2007, PMID 17325244; Tse et al., 2013, PMID 23300193; Brodehl et al., 2016, PMID 26724190. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and myofibrillar myopathy 1 (MFM1) and has been assessed separately for these distinct phenotypes (Definitive, ARVC, August 25, 2017; Moderate, MFM1, November 9, 2018). In summary, DES is definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on August 14, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\nEvidence for DES variants being causal for DCM have been replicated over time.
