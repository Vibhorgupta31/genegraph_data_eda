ETF deficiency can be demonstrated in individuals affected by a severe metabolic disorder, glutaric acidemia type II (GAII). In this study, we have investigated for the first time the molecular basis of beta-ETF deficiency in three GAII patients: two Japanese brothers, P411 and P412, and a third unrelated patient, P485. Molecular analysis of the beta-ETF gene in P411 and P412 demonstrated that both these patients are compound heterozygotes. One allele is carrying a G to A transition at nucleotide 518, causing a missense mutation at codon 164. This point mutation is maternally derived and is not detected in 42 unrelated controls. The other allele carries a G to C transversion at the first nucleotide of the intron donor site, downstream of an exon that is skipped during the splicing event. The sequence analysis of the beta-ETF coding sequence in P485 showed only a C to T transition at nucleotide 488 that causes a Thr154 to Met substitution and the elimination of a HgaI restriction site. HgaI restriction analysis on 63 unrelated controls' genomic DNA demonstrated that the C488T transition identifies a polymorphic site. Finally, transfection of wild-type beta-ETF cDNA into P411 fibroblasts suggests that wild-type beta-ETF cDNA complements the genetic defect and restores the beta-oxidation flux to normal levels.","dc:creator":"Colombo I","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Mutations and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the beta-subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein in three patients with glutaric acidemia type II."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9a8d844-c82a-4258-bd48-10e2d977273e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9a8d844-c82a-4258-bd48-10e2d977273e_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.4},{"id":"cggv:9003506f-960c-4eeb-aeb4-e3118d61fb2c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9003506f-960c-4eeb-aeb4-e3118d61fb2c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","allele":{"id":"cggv:8b65bb74-81a1-4a2e-bf1a-173e89a6208b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001014763.1(ETFB):c.397T>C (p.Cys133Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9610859"}},"detectionMethod":"Patients’ DNA was extracted from fibroblasts, the 6 exons and exon–intron boundaries of the ETFB gene were amplified and direct bidirectional sequencing performed.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003811","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"ETFA was sequenced for potentially causative variants","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:56fdd226-6b94-4409-af5b-40fd07b6bc0b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8b65bb74-81a1-4a2e-bf1a-173e89a6208b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16510302","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a recessively inherited metabolic disorder that can be due to a deficiency of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) or its dehydrogenase (ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase).

However, there is no useful biochemical marker to determine the response to different diets or fasting periods. The aims of this study are to report a patient with MADD, diagnosed through a newborn screening program using tandem mass spectrometry, to assess her response to different feedings, and to evaluate the usefulness of acylcarnitines and FFA to monitor the response to dietary changes. The patient was diagnosed at 6 d. Family history revealed three dead siblings. Five tests were performed, one with breast milk and the subsequent four after giving the patient a bottle of a low-fat, low-protein formula (F), F with glucose polymers (GP), F+GP plus uncooked corn starch (CS), or F+GP+CS preceded by amylase. The results showed that acylcarnitines, FFA, and total nonesterified fatty acids levels were greatly improved at 2 and 4 h on F+GP compared with breast milk. At 6 mo of age, the test with F+CS was repeated to assess the response to a longer fast. The results were similar at 2 and 4 h, but showed a marked increase of acylcarnitines, FFA, and total nonesterified fatty acids at 6 h. The increase of these metabolites could not be avoided by the use of F+GP+CS, but was prevented when amylase was used simultaneously. The patient is currently 3.9 y old and has normal growth and development. We conclude that diagnosis of MADD through a newborn screening program using tandem mass spectrometry is suitable; acylcarnitines and FFA are useful to monitor the response to treatment; and exogenous amylase allows the use of CS in small children with MADD. This therapeutic approach may be an alternative to the use of continuous overnight feedings used for young children with severe fatty acid oxidation defects. Early diagnosis and treatment may change the natural history of MADD.","dc:creator":"Abdenur JE","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Multiple acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD): use of acylcarnitines and fatty acids to monitor the response to dietary treatment."}},"rdfs:label":"Abdenur patient"},{"id":"cggv:0d2d4612-5fce-47d1-9e29-e75368460899","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0d2d4612-5fce-47d1-9e29-e75368460899_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Genetic testing was not reported by the authors however ClinVar reports that the variant that underlies the molecular finding for this individual is Phe41Ser (they do not specify that the variant is homozygous).

In order to understand the relationship between the phenotype and genetic defect, we investigated the clinical and molecular features of 15 Japanese patients, including 4 previously reported cases. Three patients had the neonatal form and 8 patients had the late-onset form, 1 of whom presented an extremely mild phenotype. Immunoblot analysis showed that either ETFalpha, ETFbeta, or ETFDH was significantly reduced or absent in all patients. However, no specific enzyme deficiency predominated, and there were no associations with the clinical severity. Genetic analyses identified 15 mutations including non-sense, missense, splice site mutations, and small deletions, in ETFA, ETFB and ETFDH genes. Although almost all mutations were unique to Japanese patients and no common mutations were found, some of them appeared to be associated with a specific phenotype.

To examine whether these different clinical forms could be explained by different ETF/ETFDH mutations that result in different levels of residual ETF/ETFDH enzyme activity, we have investigated the molecular genetic basis for disease development in nine patients representing the phenotypic spectrum of MADD. We report the genomic structures of the ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH genes and the identification and characterization of seven novel and three previously reported disease-causing mutations. Our molecular genetic investigations of these nine patients are consistent with three clinical forms of MADD showing a clear relationship between the nature of the mutations and the severity of disease. Interestingly, our data suggest that homozygosity for two null mutations causes fetal development of congenital anomalies resulting in a type I disease phenotype. Even minute amounts of residual ETF/ETFDH activity seem to be sufficient to prevent embryonic development of congenital anomalies giving rise to type II disease. Overexpression studies of an ETFB-D128N missense mutation identified in a patient with type III disease showed that the residual activity of the mutant enzyme could be rescued up to 59% of that of wild-type activity when ETFB-D128N-transformed E. coli cells were grown at low temperature. This indicates that the effect of the ETF/ETFDH genotype in patients with milder forms of MADD, in whom residual enzyme activity allows modulation of the enzymatic phenotype, may be influenced by environmental factors like cellular temperature.","dc:creator":"Olsen RK","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Clear relationship between ETF/ETFDH genotype and phenotype in patients with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 4"},{"id":"cggv:f57221b5-e87d-4878-a592-46aed01f4e21","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f57221b5-e87d-4878-a592-46aed01f4e21_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f57221b5-e87d-4878-a592-46aed01f4e21_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Analysis of patient cDNA indicated that this apparent missense mutation, Gln216His, at the final nucleotide of exon 3, would result in skipping of exon 3.

Lysine methylation of histone proteins has been extensively studied, but it has recently become evident that methylation of non-histone proteins is also abundant and important. The human methyltransferase METTL20 belongs to a group of 10 established and putative human KMTs. We here found METTL20 to be associated with mitochondria and determined that recombinant METTL20 methylated a single protein in extracts from human cells. Using an methyltransferase activity-based purification scheme, we identified the β-subunit of the mitochondrially localized electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFβ) as the substrate of METTL20. Furthermore, METTL20 was found to specifically methylate two adjacent lysine residues, Lys(200) and Lys(203), in ETFβ both in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, the residues methylated by METTL20 partially overlap with the so-called \"recognition loop\" in ETFβ, which has been shown to mediate its interaction with various dehydrogenases. Accordingly, we found that METTL20-mediated methylation of ETFβ in vitro reduced its ability to receive electrons from the medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. In conclusion, the present study establishes METTL20 as the first human KMT localized to mitochondria and suggests that it may regulate cellular metabolism through modulating the interaction between its substrate ETFβ and dehydrogenases.
