Peroxisomes play an essential role in the formation of etherphospholipids since the first two enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway are strictly peroxisomal. The function of plasmalogens is still an enigma but the recent identification of patients suffering from an isolated defect in either dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (GNPAT) or alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase provides conclusive evidence that plasmalogens play an essential role for human survival and functioning. In this paper we report the complete genomic organisation of the GNPAT gene coding for the peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase. The gene is located on chromosome 1q42.12-43. It spans approximately 28 kb and consists of 16 exons and 15 introns. This information was used to analyse the GNPAT gene in 12 patients with GNPAT deficiency. All patients analysed were found to have mutations in their GNPAT gene. Of the 9 different mutations found, 2 were missense mutations, 2 small deletions, 1 insertion and 3 mutations were within splice donor/acceptor-sites. Another mutation created an alternative splice donor-site causing the partial deletion of an exon.

Patients with RCDP can be subdivided into three subgroups based on biochemical analyses and complementation studies. The largest subgroup contains patients with mutations in the PEX7 gene encoding the PTS2 receptor. This results in multiple peroxisomal abnormalities which includes a deficiency of acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT), alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (alkyl-DHAP synthase), peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, although there are differences in the extent of the deficiencies observed. Patients in the two other subgroups have been reported to be either deficient in the activity of DHAPAT (RCDP type 2) or alkyl-DHAP synthase (RCDP type 3) while no other abnormalities could be observed. To examine whether the gene encoding DHAPAT is mutated in patients with RCDP type 2, we determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme isolated from human placenta. Using this sequence as a query, we identified a 2040 bp open reading frame (ORF) in the human database of expressed sequence tags. Expression of this ORF in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that we have identified the DHAPAT cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed no PTS2 consensus sequence. In contrast DHAPAT appears to contain a putative PTS1 at the extreme C-terminus. All RCDP type 2 patients analyzed were found to contain mutations in their DHAPAT cDNA. This demonstrates that RCDP type 2 is the result of mutations in DHAPAT.","dc:creator":"Ofman R","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase: cloning of the human cDNA and resolution of the molecular basis in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 8"},{"id":"cggv:10ccd71e-1219-43fc-9710-b9e9bdc14f47","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:10ccd71e-1219-43fc-9710-b9e9bdc14f47_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for a missense variant in GNPAT, c.631C>T (p.Arg211Cys).

Classically, patients have a skeletal dysplasia and profound mental retardation, although milder phenotypes are increasingly being identified. It is commonly caused by defects in the peroxisome transporter, PEX7 (RCDP1), and less frequently due to defects in the peroxisomal enzymes required to initiate plasmalogen synthesis, GNPAT (RCDP2) and AGPS (RCDP3). PEX7 transports AGPS into the peroxisome, where AGPS and GNPAT partner on the luminal membrane surface. The presence of AGPS is thought to be required for GNPAT activity. We present six additional probands with RCDP2 and RCDP3, and the novel mutations identified in them. Using cell lines from these and previously reported patients, we compared the amounts of both AGPS and GNPAT proteins present for the first time. We used protein modeling to predict the structural consequences of AGPS mutations and transcript analysis to predict consequences of GNPAT mutations, and show that milder RCDP phenotypes are likely to be associated with residual protein function. In addition, we propose that full GNPAT activity depends not only on the presence of AGPS, but also on the integrity of substrate channeling from GNPAT to AGPS.","dc:creator":"Itzkovitz B","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Functional characterization of novel mutations in GNPAT and AGPS, causing rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) types 2 and 3."}},"rdfs:label":"Pt 2"},{"id":"cggv:fa6294c7-c16c-4b37-ab98-810d7f65906a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa6294c7-c16c-4b37-ab98-810d7f65906a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:fa6294c7-c16c-4b37-ab98-810d7f65906a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"c.1937+5G>A results in a majority of transcripts retaining intron 14 and a minority of transcripts being spliced correctly.

In order to learn more about the functions of ELs, we generated a mouse model for RCDP by a targeted disruption of the dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase gene. The mutant mice revealed multiple abnormalities, such as male infertility, defects in eye development, cataract and optic nerve hypoplasia, some of which were also observed in RCDP. Mass spectroscopic analysis demonstrated the presence of highly unsaturated fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in brain PLs and the occurrence of PLs in lipid raft microdomains (LRMs) isolated from brain myelin. In mutants, PLs were completely absent and the concentration of brain DHA was reduced. The marker proteins flotillin-1 and F3/contactin were found in brain LRMs in reduced concentrations. In addition, the gap junctional protein connexin 43, known to be recruited to LRMs and essential for lens development and spermatogenesis, was down-regulated in embryonic fibroblasts of the EL-deficient mice. Free cholesterol, an important constituent of LRMs, was found in these fibroblasts to be accumulated in a perinuclear compartment.

Deficiency of plasmalogens is a feature of RCDP. Variants in *GNPAT* causing glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase deficiency were first reported in 1998 (Ofman et al, PMID 9536089). Data from 13 patients with 12 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) from 4 publications were curated (Ofman et al, 1998, PMID 9536089; Ofman et al, 2001, PMID 11237722; Thai et al, 2001, PMID 11152660; Nimmo et al, 2010, PMID 20583171; Itzkovitz et al, 2012, PMID 21990100). Additional cases are available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The relationship between *GNPAT* and glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase deficiency is supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of GNPAT which is consistent with the biochemical features of the disease (Hajra et al, 1995; PMID 8685243), that other genes with a role in plasmalogen synthesis (AGPS, and PEX7 which encodes the PTS2 receptor necessary for important of AGPS into the peroxisomes) are implicated in causing RCDP (Braverman et al, 1997, PMID 9090381; Itzkovitz et al, 2012, PMID 21990100), and a knock out mouse model which recapitulates the features of the condition (Rodemer et al, 2003, PMID 12874108; Teigler et al, 2009, PMID  19270340). In summary, *GNPAT* is definitively associated with glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 7, 2020.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ba96f922-5ec9-4404-b2e4-66c31c2dcda6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
