Here we report the identification of two independent deletion mutations linked to ALS2 in the coding exons of the new gene ALS2. These deletion mutations result in frameshifts that generate premature stop codons. ALS2 is expressed in various tissues and cells, including neurons throughout the brain and spinal cord, and encodes a protein containing multiple domains that have homology to RanGEF as well as RhoGEF. Deletion mutations are predicted to cause a loss of protein function, providing strong evidence that ALS2 is the causative gene underlying this form of ALS.","dc:creator":"Hadano S","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A gene encoding a putative GTPase regulator is mutated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11586297","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) are neurodegenerative conditions that affect large motor neurons of the central nervous system.

These diseases can manifest with a clinical continuum from infantile ascending hereditary spastic paraplegia (IAHSP) to juvenile-onset forms with or without lower motor neuron involvement, the juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) and the juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS). We report 11 patients from seven unrelated Turkish and Yemeni families with clinical signs of IAHSP or JPLS. We performed haplotype analysis or next-generation panel sequencing followed by Sanger Sequencing to unravel the genetic disease cause. We described their clinical phenotype and analyzed the pathogenicity of the detected variants with bioinformatics tools. We further reviewed all previously reported cases with ALS2-related MND. We identified five novel homozygous pathogenic variants in ALS2 at various positions: c.275_276delAT (p.Tyr92CysfsTer11), c.1044C>G (p.Tyr348Ter), c.1718C>A (p.Ala573Glu), c.3161T>C (p.Leu1054Pro), and c.1471+1G>A (NM_020919.3, NP_065970.2). In our cohort, disease onset was in infancy or early childhood with rapid onset of motor neuron signs. Muscle weakness, spasticity, severe dysarthria, dysphagia, and facial weakness were common features in the first decade of life. Frameshift and nonsense mutations clustered in the N-terminal Alsin domains are most prevalent. We enriched the mutational spectrum of ALS2-related disorders with five novel pathogenic variants. Our study indicates a high detection rate of ALS2 mutations in patients with a clinically well-characterized early onset MND. Intrafamilial and even interfamilial diversity in patients with identical pathogenic variants suggest yet unknown modifiers for phenotypic expression.","dc:creator":"Sprute R","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Genotype-phenotype correlation in seven motor neuron disease families with novel ALS2 mutations."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 10"},{"id":"cggv:d530fdf2-d47b-4690-bf7d-fc205778f647","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d530fdf2-d47b-4690-bf7d-fc205778f647_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"The homozygous splice variant is predicted to cause skipping of exon 5 with a resulting frameshift and premature stop codon in exon 6 of 34 leading to NMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:fe939852-9710-408c-b284-25cb01be2c03_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe939852-9710-408c-b284-25cb01be2c03","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":15,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7a837470-5634-45b9-a56f-01d8fad6e8e8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020919.4(ALS2):c.1044C>G (p.Tyr348Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA350327543"}},"detectionMethod":"Dideoxy sequencing was performed for coding exons and flanking introns of ALS2 after linkage to its locus was demonstrated.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"IAHSP","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002425","obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0003487","obo:HP_0002169","obo:HP_0009027"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:fbd3ab76-c0ee-4df1-87fe-3cf79adb7f6e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7a837470-5634-45b9-a56f-01d8fad6e8e8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33155358"},"rdfs:label":"Case 2"},{"id":"cggv:fbd3ab76-c0ee-4df1-87fe-3cf79adb7f6e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fbd3ab76-c0ee-4df1-87fe-3cf79adb7f6e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"The nonsense variant is in exon 4 of 34 and is predicted to cause NMD.

Further, the DH/PH domain in the middle portion of ALS2 protein enhances the VPS9 domain-mediated endosome fusions. Taken together, the ALS2 protein as a novel Rab5-GEF, ALS2rab5GEF seems to be implicated in the endosomal dynamics in vivo. Notably, a feature common to eight reported ALS2 mutations among motor neuron diseases is the loss of VPS9 domain, resulting in the failure of Rab5 activation.

From GeneReviews, Pathogenic variants in *ALS2* are responsible for a retrograde degeneration of the upper motor neurons of the pyramidal tracts, leading to phenotypes on a clinical continuum ranging from infantile ascending hereditary spastic paraplegia (IAHSP) to juvenile forms without lower motor neuron involvement (juvenile primary lateral sclerosis [JPLS]) or with lower motor neuron involvement (juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [JALS]), and as such have been lumped into a single disease entity for curation. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Thirteen variants have been curated in relation to motor neuron disease (including frameshift, nonsense, and splice variants as well as some missense), found in 12 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 11586298, 16240357, 23282280, 24562058, 33155358). Cosegregation of variants with disease was reported in at least 18 family members as well. Additional evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function; *ALS2* encodes Alsin, which regulates actin-based neurite outgrowth (PMID: 16049005) as a prominent guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rab5 (PMID: 12837691). The pathomechanism of *ALS2* mutations is considered to be loss of function, and likely involves unlinking or disturbing the connections between *ALS2* and Rab5, which reduces actin-based intracellular trafficking and glutamate signaling at synapses (Lai et al., 2009). The presence of both Rac1 and Rab5 GEF activities makes Alsin a unique dual exchange factor that may couple endocytosis (via Rab5 activation) to cytoskeletal modulation (via Rac1 activation). Several different lines of *ALS2* knockout (ALS2–/–) mice have been generated by independent groups (PMIDs: 16107644, 16321985, 16769894, 16802286, 16675207, 17855450). The loss of alsin does not have a drastic effect on the survival or function of motor neurons in mice. However, subtle deficits observed in the behavior and pathology of these mice have aided in the understanding of the relationship between alsin and motor neuron dysfunction. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of autosomal recessive *ALS2* related motor neuron disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b31dd10c-0b38-4edf-8e23-fb2652c6e939"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
