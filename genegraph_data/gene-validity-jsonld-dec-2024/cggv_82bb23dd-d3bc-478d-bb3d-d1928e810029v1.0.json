We further attempted functional characterization of the p.P120S, p.Q146X and IVS1 + 2 t>c mutations under native conditions. This was achieved by immunoblotting and immunocytofluorescence microscopy on cultured skin fibroblasts and in silico modeling. IVS1 + 2 t>c led to multiple transcripts, with only abnormally spliced cDNAs. Among the three NPC2 variants, only p.P120S led to detectable amounts of an immunoreactive protein. This protein showed a normal lysosomal localization. Our results suggest that the p.P120S mutation, the first naturally occurring missense mutation located in the cholesterol-binding Evolutionarily Constrained Regions D domain, results in reduced amounts of a protein capable to reach the lysosome, but unable to efficiently bind cholesterol. The patient had a juvenile neurological onset form of the disease. An update of the 22 families with mutations in the NPC2 gene, currently known to us, confirms the good genotype-phenotype correlations seen in this disorder.

Mutations in the NPC1 gene have now been well characterized. HE1 was recently identified as the gene underlying the very rare NPC2. Here we report the first comprehensive study of eight unrelated families with NPC2, originating from France, Algeria, Italy, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Turkey. These cases represent essentially all patients with NPC2 who have been reported in the literature, as well as those known to us. All 16 mutant alleles were identified, but only five different mutations, all with a severe impact on the protein, were found; these five mutations were as follows: two nonsense mutations (E20X and E118X), a 1-bp deletion (27delG), a splice mutation (IVS2+5G-->A), and a missense mutation (S67P) resulting in reduced amounts of abnormal HE1 protein. E20X, with an overall allele frequency of 56%, was established as the common mutant allele. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by mutation analysis of an uncultured chorionic-villus sample. All mutations except 27delG were observed in a homozygous state, allowing genotype/phenotype correlations. In seven families (with E20X, E118X, S67P, and E20X/27delG mutations), patients suffered a severe and rapid disease course, with age at death being 6 mo-4 years. A remarkable feature was the pronounced lung involvement, leading, in six patients, to early death caused by respiratory failure. Two patients also developed a severe neurological disease with onset during infancy. Conversely, the splice mutation corresponded to a very different clinical presentation, with juvenile onset of neurological symptoms and prolonged survival. This mutation generated multiple transcripts, including a minute proportion of normally spliced RNA, which may explain the milder phenotype.","dc:creator":"Millat G","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Niemann-Pick disease type C: spectrum of HE1 mutations and genotype/phenotype correlations in the NPC2 group."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 4 (93104)"},{"id":"cggv:e5d0662d-a57d-449f-b1fb-951bdb1ab5cf","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5d0662d-a57d-449f-b1fb-951bdb1ab5cf_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score reduced due to consanguinity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:bbaea222-c8c1-4dc4-93a4-2342dc83993c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbaea222-c8c1-4dc4-93a4-2342dc83993c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:85f45db4-b152-4f2f-a8da-8834bbdb8736","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006432.5(NPC2):c.199T>C (p.Ser67Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340793"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequence analysis of the 5 exons of NPC2 and intron-exon boundaries from genomic DNA.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Onset of symptoms, including \"pulmonary infiltration\" at 11 month old.

Few investigations have been devoted to the NPC2 protein, for which only 13 different disease-causing mutations (including three novel ones in this report) have been described. Among the currently known NPC2 mutant alleles, six resulted in a premature stop codon. Only five missense mutations, c.115G>A (p.V39M), c.140G>T (p.C47F), c.199T>C (p.S67P), c.278G>T (p.C93F), and (this report) c.295T>C (p.C99R) were identified. In the present study, we generated cDNA constructs harboring each of these missense mutations and, upon overexpression in human fibroblasts with a nonsense NPC2 mutation, characterized the mutated proteins by immunoblotting, immunocytofluorescence microscopy, and complementation. Mutation p.V39M, described in the homozygous state in two patients with an adult-onset neurological disease, resulted in the synthesis of apparently functional recombinant proteins correctly targeted to lysosomes. Although a mild functional impact could possibly be overlooked in our overexpression system, comparative studies with NPC1 mutants indicated that mild mutations might not necessarily affect localization of the protein or its quantity in the native state. Conversely, mutations p.C47F, p.C93R, p.C99R but also, less predictably, p.S67P, led to the synthesis of misfolded recombinant proteins that colocalized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The four latter proteins were normally secreted but were unable to correct cholesterol storage in NPC2(-/-) cells.

Finally, human disease-causing mutations in NPC1 domain 2 decrease NPC2 binding, suggesting that NPC2 binding is necessary for NPC1 function in humans.

The clinical presentation typically depends upon age of onset and includes visceral features, such as hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and pulmonary infiltrates (in some cases) in infancy, and neurological features including hypotonia and developmental delay in late infancy, with later development of ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, seizures, dystonia, gelastic cataplexy, and cognitive impairment. Older teenagers and young adults may present with early-onset dementia or psychiatric manifestations (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). \n\nAbout 95% of cases of NPC are caused by biallelic variants in NPC1 and 5% by variants in NPC2; symptoms in individuals with variants in these genes are indistinguishable (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). \n\nNPC2 encodes a soluble lysosomal protein with cholesterol binding properties (Xu et al, PMID: 31843136). Biallelic variants in NPC2 were first reported in patients with Niemann-Pick disease, type C2, by Naureckiene et al in 2000 (PMID: 11125141). Since then, over 20 variants have been reported in about 50 cases worldwide (Xu et al, 2019, PMID: 31843136). The disease mechanism is loss of function. In this curation, data on 8 unique variants (missense, nonsense, splice site) from 8 probands from 3 publications were collected (Millat et al, 2001, PMID: 11567215; Chikk et al, 2005, PMID: 15937921; Verot et al, 2007, PMID: 17470133). This includes c.58G>T (p.Glu20Ter), which is reported to account for >50% of Niemann Pick type C2 alleles (Millat et al, 2001, PMID: 11567215). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of NPC2, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Xu et al, PMID: 31843136); interaction of NPC2 with NPC1, another gene involved in Niemann-Pick disease, type C (Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011, PMID: 22065762); functional alteration studies demonstrating the importance of glycosylation of Asn58 in the localization and function of NPC2 (Chikh et al, 2004, PMID: 15542393); the biochemical, clinical features, and histological features of an NPC2 hypomorphic mouse (Sleat et al, 2004, PMID: 15071184); rescue of abnormal cholesterol accumulation in NPC2 fibroblasts by medium conditioned by NPC2-expressing cells (Naureckiene et al, 2000, PMID: 11125141); and rescue of phenotypic features and visceral cholesterol accumulation in NPC-/- mice by treatment with bivine NPC protein (Nielsen et al 22073306). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, NPC2 is definitively associated with Niemann-Pick disease, type C2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
