In this report we describe the expression and functional characterization of Sorting Nexin 10 (snx10). Snx10 belongs to the sorting nexin (SNX) family, a diverse group of proteins with a common feature: the PX domain, which is involved in membrane trafficking and cargo sorting in endosomes. Snx10 is strongly up-regulated during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro and expressed in osteoclasts in vivo. qPCR analysis confirmed a significant increase in the expression of snx10 in in vitro-derived osteoclasts, as well as in femur and calvaria. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse embryo sections showed expression in long bone, calvariae, and developing teeth. The expression was limited to cells that also expressed TRAP, demonstrating osteoclastic localization. Confocal immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation analysis revealed Snx10 localization in the nucleus and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To study a possible role for snx10 in osteoclast differentiation and function we silenced snx10 expression and found that snx10 silencing inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and osteoclast resorption on hydroxyapatite. Silencing also inhibited TRAP secretion. Taken together, these results confirm that snx10 is expressed in osteoclasts and is required for osteoclast differentiation and activity in vitro. Since inhibition of vesicular trafficking is essential for osteoclast formation and activity and SNX10 is involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking, these studies may identify a new candidate gene involved in the development of human bone diseases including osteoporosis.","dc:creator":"Zhu CH","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"SNX10 is required for osteoclast formation and resorption activity."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in mouse BMM osteoclast cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c7bc53b6-8355-4d68-b447-72a80ed6edb2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30d63d93-9d44-4e09-a9a7-598eda4e2972","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Abnormal activity of osteoclasts leads to sclerosis and excessive growth of bony structures\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22174188","rdfs:label":"SNX10 role in osteoclast formation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4c6f3ffa-405b-4b64-b29d-b4dc157ef586_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:843ffd71-5213-467d-a077-f07b6570e031","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:296115ec-d88f-4172-bcea-ac5088b54bf0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The Y32S and R51P mutants lost the vacuolation activity while R51Q strongly reduced this activity of SNX10.

To study the disease pathogenesis, we investigated the expression of Snx10 and created mouse models in which Snx10 was knocked down globally or knocked out in osteoclasts. Endocytosis is severely defective in Snx10-deficient osteoclasts, as is extracellular acidification, ruffled border formation, and bone resorption. We also discovered that Snx10 is highly expressed in stomach epithelium, with mutations leading to high stomach pH and low calcium solubilization. Global Snx10-deficiency in mice results in a combined phenotype: osteopetrosis (due to osteoclast defect) and rickets (due to high stomach pH and low calcium availability, resulting in impaired bone mineralization). Osteopetrorickets, the paradoxical association of insufficient mineralization in the context of a positive total body calcium balance, is thought to occur due to the inability of the osteoclasts to maintain normal calcium-phosphorus homeostasis. However, osteoclast-specific Snx10 knockout had no effect on calcium balance, and therefore led to severe osteopetrosis without rickets. Moreover, supplementation with calcium gluconate rescued mice from the rachitic phenotype and dramatically extended life span in global Snx10-deficient mice, suggesting that this may be a life-saving component of the clinical approach to Snx10-dependent human osteopetrosis that has previously gone unrecognized. We conclude that tissue-specific effects of Snx10 mutation need to be considered in clinical approaches to this disease entity.

In 2000, we found that mutations in the TCIRG1 gene encoding for a subunit of the proton pump (V-ATPase) are responsible for more than one-half of ARO cases. Since then, five additional genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, leaving approximately 25% of cases that could not be associated with a genotype. Very recently, a mutation in the sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) gene, whose product is suggested to interact with the proton pump, has been found in 3 consanguineous families of Palestinian origin, thus adding a new candidate gene in patients not previously classified. Here we report the identification of 9 novel mutations in this gene in 14 ARO patients from 12 unrelated families of different geographic origin. Interestingly, we define the molecular defect in three cases of \"Västerbottenian osteopetrosis,\" named for the Swedish Province where a higher incidence of the disease has been reported. In our cohort of more than 310 patients from all over the world, SNX10-dependent ARO constitutes 4% of the cases, with a frequency comparable to the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1 (OSTM1)-dependent subsets. Although the clinical presentation is relatively variable in severity, bone seems to be the only affected tissue and the defect can be almost completely rescued by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These results confirm the involvement of the SNX10 gene in human ARO and identify a new subset with a relatively favorable prognosis as compared to TCIRG1-dependent cases. Further analyses will help to better understand the role of SNX10 in osteoclast physiology and verify whether this protein might be considered a new target for selective antiresorptive therapies.","dc:creator":"Pangrazio A","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"SNX10 mutations define a subgroup of human autosomal recessive osteopetrosis with variable clinical severity."}},"rdfs:label":"Pangrazio patient 6"},{"id":"cggv:96679e5b-2c71-4d89-be82-903f302db9fe","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96679e5b-2c71-4d89-be82-903f302db9fe_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.05,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity and homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c720363c-a4d1-4d97-b488-eed4e9ddfe99_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c720363c-a4d1-4d97-b488-eed4e9ddfe99","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2ba617f0-6084-4dd4-8d97-fd312b007a0a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_013322.3(SNX10):c.152G>A (p.Arg51Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130726"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Onset at 4 months, underwent a successful bone marrow therapy at 1 year","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0003593","obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0000572","obo:HP_0011002","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0000256"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:048dabc5-5749-444e-8890-e5bf87a9081f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2ba617f0-6084-4dd4-8d97-fd312b007a0a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22499339"},"rdfs:label":"Aker family A proband 261002"},{"id":"cggv:048dabc5-5749-444e-8890-e5bf87a9081f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:048dabc5-5749-444e-8890-e5bf87a9081f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:048dabc5-5749-444e-8890-e5bf87a9081f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Mutant SNX10 protein was abnormally abundant and its distribution altered in patients' osteoclasts.

This large deletion resulted in the absence of the SNX10 transcript and led to abnormal osteoclast activity. SNX10 is one of the nine genes known to cause ARO, shown to interact with V-ATPase (vacuolar type H( + )-ATPase), as it plays an important role in bone resorption.

We reviewed the relevant literatures and found that anemia, visual and hearing impairment, hepatosplenomegaly are the main clinical symptoms of IMO, SNX10 gene mutation is a rare cause of IMO, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment.","dc:creator":"Zhou T","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"SNX10 gene mutation in infantile malignant osteopetrosis: A case report and literature review."}},"rdfs:label":"Zhou proband "},{"id":"cggv:061babd0-a834-4645-ae78-c650906454ec","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:061babd0-a834-4645-ae78-c650906454ec_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.05,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity and homozygosity.

The proband exhibited macrocephaly, prominent forehead, proptosis of the eyes, strabismus, splenomegaly and joint hyperlaxity. Bone X-rays showed increased bone density, metaphyseal under-modelling, transverse alternating bands of greater and lesser density in tubular bones, anteriorly notched vertebral bodies and bone-in-bone appearance. Brain atrophy, external hydrocephalus and thin corpus callosum were noted at the brain MRI and CT scan. Blood test results revealed the presence of anaemia and leukopenia.

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 8 in 2012 (Aker et al., PMID: 22499339). Osteopetrosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by increased bone density due to impaired bone resorption. The autosomal recessive form manifests in the first months of life with characteristic facial appearance, choanal stenosis, compression of cranial nerves (leading frequently to blindness, rarely to deafness and facial palsy), bone marrow insufficiency, hepatosplenomegaly, dental anomalies, and hypocalcaemia. Eighteen unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and gross deletions) that have been reported in 24 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 22499339, 23123320, 23280965, 27391121, 27187610, 29090071, 29620724, 30977576, 33678645, 36526684, 36703223) are included in this curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (12 pts). All except one proband had a homozygous variant in the *SNX10* gene. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function study, expression data, functional alteration data, and two mouse models (PMIDs: 22174188, 25212774, 28592808, 25811986, 32278070). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *SNX10* and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 8. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date June 24, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4c6f3ffa-405b-4b64-b29d-b4dc157ef586"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
