Clinical overlap with Schwartz-Jampel type 2 syndrome (SJS2) has suggested that SWS and SJS2 could be allelic disorders. Through studying a series of 19 families with SWS/SJS2, we have mapped the disease gene to chromosome 5p13.1 at locus D5S418 (Zmax=10.66 at theta =0) and have identified null mutations in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR or gp190 chain) gene. A total of 14 distinct mutations were identified in the 19 families. An identical frameshift insertion (653_654insT) was identified in families from the United Arab Emirates, suggesting a founder effect in that region. It is interesting that 12/14 mutations predicted premature termination of translation. Functional studies indicated that these mutations alter the stability of LIFR messenger RNA transcripts, resulting in the absence of the LIFR protein and in the impairment of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in patient cells. We conclude, therefore, that SWS and SJS2 represent a single clinically and genetically homogeneous condition due to null mutations in the LIFR gene on chromosome 5p13.","dc:creator":"Dagoneau N","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Null leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) mutations in Stuve-Wiedemann/Schwartz-Jampel type 2 syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14740318","rdfs:label":"Family 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Consanguineous"},{"id":"cggv:e2ca3c6f-66f4-414d-9485-649bf8f13479_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d686fd1-5a84-4c23-9466-23983e5bde56","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"11 SWS families (10 consanguineous and 1 nonconsanguineous) were used in homozygosity-mapping analysis.

It is caused by mutation in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gene (LIFR; 151443) on chromosome 5p13. We provide the clinical follow-up and molecular aspects of six new patients who carried the same novel mutation in the LIFR gene (p.Arg692X) and three patients carried a common haplotype at the LIFR locus supporting a founder effect in the Turkish population. The probable pathogenesis of the features is also discussed. Osseous findings in the presence of other above-mentioned morbid conditions should raise the suspicion of SWS in neonates especially in Arabic and Eastern Mediterranean countries with high rate of consanguineous marriages like in Turkey. Severe osteoporosis, bone deformities, milias, leukocoria, inflammatory lesions on distal extremities, tongue biting behavior and oral ulcers could be more prominent features of the survivors beyond the neonatal period while respiratory and feeding problems are remitting. It is of crucial importance to diagnose such babies earlier in order to prevent extensive laboratory workup and to provide proper genetic counseling.","dc:creator":"Yeşil G","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome: is it underrecognized?"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24988918","rdfs:label":"F1.1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Likely consanguineous"},{"id":"cggv:6daea72a-03e4-45c8-bfe1-44b25d2262fa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad908d21-b246-4df3-8449-c3d51f9c6d6f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001097","obo:HP_0012385","obo:HP_0002643","obo:HP_0008872","obo:HP_0006487","obo:HP_0025428","obo:HP_0010298","obo:HP_0002756","obo:HP_0001954","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0000164"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6daea72a-03e4-45c8-bfe1-44b25d2262fa_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:59ed8c91-2e14-44d1-a87d-f94e4ed92fee","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001127671.2(LIFR):c.1252C>T (p.Arg418Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3243002"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20447141","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS, OMIM 601559) is a severe autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the leukemia inhibitory receptor (LIFR) gene.

To uncover the cellular mechanisms regulated by LIFR beta during facial nucleus development, we first analyzed its expression pattern in the hindbrain. lifr beta is first expressed at E11.5 in the hindbrain neuroepithelium.

CNTF may also serve the maintenance of autonomic, preganglionic sympathetic neurons (PSNs) in the spinal cord, as suggested by its capacity to prevent their death after destruction of one of their major targets, the adrenal medulla. Although somatic motoneurons and PSNs share a common embryonic origin, they are distinct in several respects, including responses to lesions. We have studied PSNs in mice with targeted deletions of the LIFRbeta or CT-1 genes, respectively. We show that LIF, CNTF, and CT-1 are synthesized in embryonic adrenal gland and spinal cord and that PSNs express LIFRbeta. In embryonic day 18.5 LIFRbeta (-/-) and CT-1 (-/-) mice, PSNs were reduced by approximately 20%. PSNs projecting to the adrenal medulla were more severely affected (-55%). Although LIFRbeta (-/-) mice revealed normal numbers of adrenal chromaffin cells and axons terminating on chromaffin cells, levels of adrenaline and numbers of adrenaline-synthesizing cells were significantly reduced. We conclude that activation of LIFRbeta is required for normal development of PSNs and one of their prominent targets, the adrenal medulla.

LIFR was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome in 2004 (Dagoneau et al., PMID 14740318). At least 28 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splicing, missense, gross deletions) have been reported in affected individuals, 22 of which are predicted to cause a loss of function of the protein, suggesting biallelic loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 22 probands in four publications (Dagoneau et al., 2004, PMID 14740318; Jung et al., 2010, PMID 20447141; Yeşil et al., 2014, PMID 24988918; Maddirevula et al., 2018, PMID 29620724). Additional genetic evidence is available in the literature; however, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) was reached. Further evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes functional alteration experiments and a LIFR-deficient mouse model, which recapitulates several features of the disease phenotype, including feeding difficulties, skeletal abnormalities, decreased bone volume and nervous system dysfunction (Dagoneau et al., 2004 PMID 14740318; Bellais et al., 2010 PMID 19603067; Ware et al., 1995 PMID 7789261). In summary, LIFR is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
