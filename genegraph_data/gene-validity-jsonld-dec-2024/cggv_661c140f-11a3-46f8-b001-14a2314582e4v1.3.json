Here we report on five individuals with coloboma, microcephaly, developmental delay, short stature, and craniofacial, cardiac, and renal defects who harbor overlapping microdeletions on 8q24.3. Fine mapping localized a commonly deleted 78 kb region that contains three genes: SCRIB, NRBP2, and PUF60. In vivo dissection of the CNV showed discrete contributions of the planar cell polarity effector SCRIB and the splicing factor PUF60 to the syndromic phenotype, and the combinatorial suppression of both genes exacerbated some, but not all, phenotypic components. Consistent with these findings, we identified an individual with microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, and heart defects with a de novo c.505C>T variant leading to a p.His169Tyr change in PUF60. Functional testing of this allele in vivo and in vitro showed that the mutation perturbs the relative dosage of two PUF60 isoforms and, subsequently, the splicing efficiency of downstream PUF60 targets. These data inform the functions of two genes not associated previously with human genetic disease and demonstrate how CNVs can exhibit complex genetic architecture, with the phenotype being the amalgam of both discrete dosage dysfunction of single transcripts and also of binary genetic interactions.

Verheij syndrome is associated with developmental and intellectual impairments, short stature, skeletal abnormalities, feeding issues, joint laxity, renal and cardiac anomalies, coloboma, and facial dysmorphisms. A subsequent publication reported on additional probands with 8q24.3 deletions, further characterized the gene content in the region, and suggested, via zebrafish models, that the genes *PUF60* (encoding a component of the spliceosome that plays a role in RNA processing) and *SCRIB* contribute to Verheij syndrome phenotypes (Dauber et al., 2013; PMID: 24140112). In that publication, a missense *PUF60* variant shown to cause loss of function via functional studies was reported in a proband with similar clinical features (Dauber et al., 2013; PMID: 24140112). \n\nSince that time, additional publications have described individuals with variants in the *PUF60* gene. Clinical features in affected individuals with *PUF60* sequence variants are similar to those of individuals with Verheij syndrome and 8q24.3 deletions. However, the expert panel elected to curate *PUF60* for syndromic intellectual disability given the potential that *SCRIB* or other genes in the region may contribute to Verheij syndrome.  \n\nAt least 29 probands with *PUF60* variants have been reported in the literature. At least 19 unique nonsense, canonical splice-site, and frameshift variants have been reported in 20 probands (PMIDs: 27479843, 27804958, 28074499, 28327570, 28990276, 30078240, 30352594, 33418956) and 7 unique missense variants have been reported in 9 probands (PMIDs: 24140112, 27804958, 28074499, 28327570, 28471317, 29300383, 30569551). Missense variants cluster in the RNA recognition motifs (PMID: 30352594). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Variants are de novo in all probands. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including a zebrafish model (PMID: 24140112), rescue in zebrafish (PMID: 24140112), functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMID: 24140112), and rescue in cell culture (PMID: 24140112). \n\nIn summary, *PUF60* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/15/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:661c140f-11a3-46f8-b001-14a2314582e4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
