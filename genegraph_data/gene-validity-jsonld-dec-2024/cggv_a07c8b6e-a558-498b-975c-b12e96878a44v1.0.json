A genetic etiology is likely in most cases yet only few genes have been formally correlated with male infertility. Homozygosity mapping was carried out on a cohort of 20 North African individuals, including 18 index cases, presenting with primary infertility resulting from impaired sperm motility caused by a mosaic of multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) including absent, short, coiled, bent, and irregular flagella. Five unrelated subjects out of 18 (28%) carried a homozygous variant in DNAH1, which encodes an inner dynein heavy chain and is expressed in testis. RT-PCR, immunostaining, and electronic microscopy were carried out on samples from one of the subjects with a mutation located on a donor splice site. Neither the transcript nor the protein was observed in this individual, confirming the pathogenicity of this variant. A general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization of the microtubule doublets and loss of the inner dynein arms was observed. Although DNAH1 is also expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility was the only symptom of primary ciliary dyskinesia observed in affected subjects, suggesting that DNAH1 function in cilium is not as critical as in sperm flagellum.

In most cases, axonemal defects are present, i.e. PCD patients often lack inner and/or outer dynein arms in their sperm tails and cilia, supporting the hypothesis that mutations in dynein genes may cause PCD. However, to date it is unclear whether mutations in dynein heavy chain genes are responsible for impaired flagellar and ciliary motility in mammals. To elucidate the role of the mouse dynein heavy chain 7 (MDHC7) gene, which encodes a component of the inner dynein arm, we have generated mice lacking this dynein heavy chain isoform. Both MDHC7(+/-) and MDHC7(-/-) mice are viable and show no malformations; however, homozygous males produce no offspring. In comparison to MDHC7(+/-) and wild-type mice the spermatozoa of MDHC7(-/-) mice revealed a dramatic reduced straight line velocity and progressive movement, resulting in the inability of MDHC7-deficient sperm to move from the uterus into the oviduct. Additionally, we measured the beat frequency of tracheal cilia and observed a decrease in the beat frequency of approximately 50% in MDHC7(-/-) mice. The reduction in both ciliary and flagellar motility is not correlated with any gross defects in the axonemal structure. The phenotype of MDHC7(-/-) mice is similar to that observed in some patients suffering from PCD, and our data strongly suggest that in some patients this disease could be due to mutations in the homologous human gene DNAH1 (HDHC7).","dc:creator":"Neesen J","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Disruption of an inner arm dynein heavy chain gene results in asthenozoospermia and reduced ciliary beat frequency."},"rdfs:label":"Analysis of the CBF of tracheal cilia of  MDHC7–/– mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The MDHC7-deficient mice did not show respiratory signs of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:a07c8b6e-a558-498b-975c-b12e96878a44_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5067f33d-b35e-480d-8ac4-6f86ff28317c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5067f33d-b35e-480d-8ac4-6f86ff28317c","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:4eb744b2-32b6-41e4-834c-533e77033391","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015512.5(DNAH1):c.2912G>A (p.Arg971His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2433428"}},{"id":"cggv:0762ed83-d405-40cf-a27a-29781c8b8c2c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015512.5(DNAH1):c.11135G>A (p.Arg3712Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2436079"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0011946","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:68000259-0feb-445a-8a23-1816d955be97_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4eb744b2-32b6-41e4-834c-533e77033391"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33577779","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a heterogeneous disease with a diverse clinical and genetic spectrum among populations worldwide.

DNAH1 belongs to the axonemal inner dynein arm DHC group and is expressed in lungs and sperm flagella (PMIDs: 24360805,11371505). Primary Ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a motile ciliopathy caused by mutations in a heterogeneous group of genes expressed in the tracheal tissues. The clinical phenotype of PCD includes respiratory signs (neonatal respiratory distress, chronic cough, recurrent chest infections, rhinosinusitis, otitis, bronchiectasis, etc.) and body laterality defects in about 50% of cases. Infertility is also reported in a considerable number of patients (PMID: 33279404).  \n\nDNAH1 has been noted to be associated with two disease entities: primary ciliary dyskinesia 37 (PCD37) and spermatogenic failure 18. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. There is observable phenotypic variability, with infertility being the only commonality in two cases (PMIDs: 24360805, 27798045, 23550210, 31765523, 34210339, 11371505, 32719396, 27573432, 34672773). Therefore, the following have been split into two disease entities: PCD37 (OMIM: 617577, MONDO: 0033204) and spermatogenic failure 18 (OMIM: 617576, MONDO: 0017173). The split curation for autosomal recessive spermatogenic failure 18 has been curated separately.\n\nEvidence from 7 probands in 4 publications were included in this curation, representing 10 unique variants (6 missense, 2 frameshift, 1 nonsense and 1 splice site) (PMIDs: 25927852, 31765523, 33577779, 34210339). The genetic evidence for this curation is scarce, therefore, the maximum score was not reached (1.2/12 points.). This gene-disease relationship is supported by some experimental evidence. The DNAH1 mRNA and protein are proved to be expressed in testis and lungs (PMIDs: 24360805, 31781811, 25613900). This pattern of expression is compatible with PCD. Mice lacking the dynein heavy chain-7 (Mdhc7) gene (the ortholog of DNAH1 in Humans) were generated (PMID: 11371505). Mdhc7 -/- mice revealed sperm motility anomalies. Additionally, a decreased beat frequency in tracheal cilia of 50% was observed. The reduction in both ciliary and flagellar motility was not correlated with structural ciliary defects.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on February 10th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a07c8b6e-a558-498b-975c-b12e96878a44"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
