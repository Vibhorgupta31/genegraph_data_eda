A total of seven unrelated and nonsyndromic patients with RP1 biallelic variants (OMIM # 180100) were diagnosed in our centre and included in the study. They had classic retinitis pigmentosa with diagnosis at the first decade of life. The visual acuities were severely affected at a young age. The fundus aspects were similar among all patients. An atrophic ring was present around the fovea in several cases. All patients had molecular diagnosis, with six different RP1 variants. This study reports two new pathogenic variants - two frameshift duplications (c.1234dupA p.Met412Asnfs*7 and c.1265dupC p.Ala423Cysfs*2) and reinforces other four known pathogenic variants - two frameshift deletions (c.469delG p.Val157Trpfs*16 and c.3843delT p.Pro1282Leufs*12) and two stop gain mutations (c.1186 C > T p.Arg396* and c.1625C > G p.Ser542*). These findings broaden the spectrum of RP1 variants. This study also reviewed the fundus characteristics that clinically could raise the hypothesis of a retinitis pigmentosa due to RP1 gene. It is worthwhile to try to identify the disease-causing variants in each patient since it can provide prognostic information and be useful in genetic consultation and diagnosis in the future.","dc:creator":"Silva RS","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Retinitis Pigmentosa Due to Rp1 Biallelic

Mutations in the photoreceptor-specific gene RP1 account for 5-10% of cases of autosomal dominant RP. We generated a mouse model of the RP1 form of RP by targeted disruption of the mouse ortholog (Rp1) of human RP1. In Rp1(-/-) mice, the number of rod photoreceptors decreased progressively over a period of 1 year, whereas that of cone photoreceptors did not change for at least 10 months. Light and electron microscopic analysis revealed that outer segments of Rp1(-/-) rods and cones were morphologically abnormal and became progressively shorter in length. Before photoreceptor cell death, rhodopsin was mislocalized in inner segments and cell bodies of Rp1(-/-) rods. Rod ERG amplitudes of Rp1(-/-) mice were significantly smaller than those of Rp1(+/+) mice over a period of 12 months, whereas those of Rp1(+/-) mice were intermediate. The decreases in cone ERG amplitudes were slower and less severe than those in rods. These findings demonstrate that Rp1 is required for normal morphogenesis of photoreceptor outer segments and also may play a role in rhodopsin transport to the outer segments. The phenotype of Rp1 mutant mice resembles the human RP1 disease. Thus, these mice provide a useful model for studies of RP1 function, disease pathology, and therapeutic interventions.","dc:creator":"Gao J","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Progressive photoreceptor degeneration, outer segment dysplasia, and rhodopsin mislocalization in mice with targeted disruption of the retinitis pigmentosa-1 (Rp1) gene."},"rdfs:label":"KO mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5653,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ad0a10e3-a450-479b-bc39-fe8101ff3082","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0800399","gene":"hgnc:10263","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*RP1* was first reported in relation to an inherited retinal dystrophy, autosomal dominant (or semidominant) retinitis pigmentosa (RP), in 1999 (Pierce et al., PMID: 10391211 & Sullivan et al. PMID: 10391212). *RP1* was later reported in relation to autosomal recessive RP in 2005 (Khaliq et al., PMID: 15863674). It appears that the majority of *RP1* variants located in the middle region between c.1981 (p.661) to c.2749 (p.917) are associated with dominant RP, while the variants in the N-terminal portion from c.1 (p.1) to c.1837 (p.613) and the C-terminal from c.2816 (p.939) to c.6471 (p.2157) are mostly associated with recessive RP (summarized in Wang et al., PMID: 33681214). Patients with recessive RP generally exhibit much more severe phenotypes than patients with dominant RP. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we split retinitis pigmentosa 1 (OMIM: 180100) into two disease entities, RP1-related dominant retinopathy and RP1-related recessive retinopathy (MONDO:0800399). The split curation for RP1-related dominant retinopathy has been curated separately. The RP1 protein is a member of the doublecortin family and is present in the ciliary axoneme of both rods and cones (reviewed in Nikopoulos et al, PMID: 31253780). Several nonsense and frameshift variants have been curated and more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity for variants in RP1-related recessive retinopathy appears to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and knock-out mouse models. In summary, *RP1* is definitively associated with RP1-related recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on July 7, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8cbd531f-7c23-4745-a3da-38a2db421fc3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
