The epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of disorders, many with an inherited component. Although specific genes have been identified in a few rare diseases causing seizures as part of a more diffuse brain disorder, the molecular pathology of the common idiopathic epilepsies is still unknown. Linkage has been reported for some generalised epilepsy syndromes, but only very recently for familial partial epilepsy syndromes. Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is a partial epilepsy causing frequent, violent, brief seizures at night, usually beginning in childhood. The gene for ADNFLE maps to chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3 in one large Australian kindred. The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit (CHRNA4) maps to the same region of 20q (ref. 12) and the gene is expressed in all layers of the frontal cortex. We screened affected family members for mutations within CHRNA4 and found a missense mutation that replaces serine with phenylalanine at codon 248, a strongly conserved amino acid residue in the second transmembrane domain.

We have analysed the clinical features of 19 ADNFLE families from 12 countries with a total of 150 patients and grouped them with respect to their nAChR mutations. These data suggest that certain nAChR mutations might be associated with an increased risk for major neurological symptoms such as mental retardation, schizophrenia-like symptoms or marked cognitive deficits, but the risk for these disorders seems to be low for most other ADNFLE mutations. The functional data confirm that the mutations differ from each other with respect to the size of their gain-of function effects and other biopharmacological characteristics although these functional changes are not predictive for the severity of the clinical phenotype.","dc:creator":"Steinlein OK","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in familial nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy might be associated with distinct neurological phenotypes."},"rdfs:label":"S284L Functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Used to score missense variant in genetic evidence full points."},{"id":"cggv:11d2cace-90c4-48ca-8953-b614b6fff0ca","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6255d22-f36f-46be-820d-fb09113449b7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Compared to the wildtype the two mutation a4S248F/b2 showed a much higher affinity for acetylcholine.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22036597","rdfs:label":"S280F functional study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Used to fully score case level data"},{"id":"cggv:09e57283-66c3-4728-bfb6-819fa4a3fb96","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64ab276c-101b-442e-9581-b7a4e0e20f38","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"When the same experiments are performed with the α4(776ins3) and β2 subunits in sibling oocytes a large current is also observed in response to ACh (Fig. 4A, lower panel).

In contrast, however, the mutant receptor is ∼10-fold more sensitive to ACh than the control (triangles, Fig. 4B). Taken together these data illustrate that the leucine insertion in M2 does not prevent assembly nor function of the receptor but provokes an increase of its apparent affinity to ACh.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9175743","rdfs:label":"c.776ins3 p.Leu290dup functional"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Used to upgrade case level data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:e3aa0108-5514-48ba-a09c-5506b2030d1f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c073e200-5b53-4d40-96e7-a8b318018bda","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a279a628-0b8e-4428-94be-6beb1f090672","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"These are overlapping phenotypes.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17146052","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Selected mutations in the human alpha4 or beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes cosegregate with a partial epilepsy syndrome known as autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). To examine possible mechanisms underlying this inherited epilepsy, we engineered two ADNFLE mutations (Chrna4(S252F) and Chrna4(+L264)) in mice. Heterozygous ADNFLE mutant mice show persistent, abnormal cortical electroencephalograms with prominent delta and theta frequencies, exhibit frequent spontaneous seizures, and show an increased sensitivity to the proconvulsant action of nicotine. Relative to WT, electrophysiological recordings from ADNFLE mouse layer II/III cortical pyramidal cells reveal a >20-fold increase in nicotine-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents with no effect on excitatory postsynaptic currents. i.p. injection of a subthreshold dose of picrotoxin, a use-dependent gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist, reduces cortical electroencephalogram delta power and transiently inhibits spontaneous seizure activity in ADNFLE mutant mice. Our studies suggest that the mechanism underlying ADNFLE seizures may involve inhibitory synchronization of cortical networks via activation of mutant alpha4-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located on the presynaptic terminals and somatodendritic compartments of cortical GABAergic interneurons.","dc:creator":"Klaassen A","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Seizures and enhanced cortical GABAergic inhibition in two mouse models of human autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":193,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:52e35797-adc9-4cc0-b70e-c5c98b78de36","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0000030","gene":"hgnc:1958","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CHRNA4 was reported in relation to autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy in 1995 (PMID: 7550350). At least 7 unique variants (missense, small insertion) have been reported in humans. \"So far, nearly all of the AD nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy mutations identified within CHRNA4 are missense mutations that cause amino acid exchanges within the second, less often the first, transmembrane domain\" (PMID: 25194481). This gene-disease relationship is supported by case-level data and experimental data including functional alteration studies and a mouse model. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. In summary, CHRNA4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e3aa0108-5514-48ba-a09c-5506b2030d1f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
