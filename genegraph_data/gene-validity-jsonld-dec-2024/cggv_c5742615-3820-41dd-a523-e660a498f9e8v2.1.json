Approximately 80% of individuals with NS harbor mutations in genes whose products are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, the underlying genetic causes in nearly 20% of individuals with NS phenotype remain unexplained. Here, we report four de novo RRAS2 variants in three individuals with NS. RRAS2 is a member of the RAS subfamily and is ubiquitously expressed. Three variants, c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup), c.216A>T (p.Gln72His), and c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu), have been found in cancers; our functional analyses showed that these three changes induced elevated association of RAF1 and that they activated ERK1/2 and ELK1. Notably, prominent activation of ERK1/2 and ELK1 by p.Gln72Leu associates with the severe phenotype of the individual harboring this change. To examine variant pathogenicity in vivo, we generated zebrafish models. Larvae overexpressing c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup) or c.216A>T (p.Gln72His) variants, but not wild-type RRAS2 RNAs, showed craniofacial defects and macrocephaly. The same dose injection of mRNA encoding c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu) caused severe developmental impairments and low dose overexpression of this variant induced craniofacial defects. In contrast, the RRAS2 c.224T>G (p.Phe75Cys) change, located on the same allele with p.Gln72His in an individual with NS, resulted in no aberrant in vitro or in vivo phenotypes by itself. Together, our findings suggest that activating RRAS2 mutations can cause NS and expand the involvement of RRAS2 proto-oncogene to rare germline disorders.","dc:creator":"Niihori T","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Germline-Activating RRAS2 Mutations Cause Noonan Syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Pull-down assay, immunoblotting, and reporter assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because this is variant level evidence instead of gene level"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:c5742615-3820-41dd-a523-e660a498f9e8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3b5ccab1-7c88-4f9b-9da8-94231a856478","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40798e97-908f-4226-b90d-ed9fc3084768","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The zebrafish transfected with p.Gly24_Gly26dup, p.[Gln72His;Phe75Cys] or pGln72His showed induced craniofacial patterning defects consistent with symptoms of affected individuals","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31130285","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded because the phenotypes match RASopathies in general but not specifically Noonan Syndrome"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8975,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b2e8ae2e-f43b-43e3-8ddd-8279de365dca","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018997","gene":"hgnc:17271","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.1","dc:description":"RRAS2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome (NS) in 2019 (Capri et al., PMID: 31130282; Niihori et al., PMID: 31130285). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome, NS with loose anagen hair, or NS with multiple lentigines. No evidence was found to support these other RRAS2 gene-disease relationships. Seven variants (missense and in-frame insertion/duplication) that have been reported in 9 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 31130282, 31130285, 33686258, 34648682) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be GOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by a zebrafish model that displayed features that may be indicative of a RASopathy. RRAS2 shares downstream effectors with the other members of the RAS subfamily, however, little information exists about the function of the protein in the cellular processes and development. Variant level experimental evidence exploring the intracellular signaling pathways affected in NS has been done (PMIDs: 31130282). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between RRAS2 and autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the RASopathy GCEP on 6/27/2019. It was reevaluated on 12/14/2022 (SOP version 9). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did change from Strong to Definitive due to replication over time and more evidence being published.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c5742615-3820-41dd-a523-e660a498f9e8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
