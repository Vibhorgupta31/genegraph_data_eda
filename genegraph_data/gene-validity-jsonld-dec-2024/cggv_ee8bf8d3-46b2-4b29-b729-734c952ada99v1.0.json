Because early treatment is critically important for patients with VODI, broadly usable diagnostic tools are needed to detect Sp110 protein deficiency. Several factors make establishing the diagnosis of VODI challenging: (1) Current screening strategies to identify severe combined immunodeficiency are based on measuring T cell receptor excision circles (TREC). This approach will fail to identify VODI patients because the disease is not associated with severe T cell lymphopenia at birth; (2) the SP110 gene contains 17 exons, making it a challenge for Sanger sequencing. The recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms that can rapidly determine the sequence of all 17 exons are available in only a few laboratories; (3) there is no standard functional assay to test for the effects of novel mutations in Sp110; and (4) it has been difficult to use flow cytometry to identify patients who lack Sp110 because of the low level of Sp110 protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes. We report here a novel flow cytometric assay that is easily performed in diagnostic laboratories and might thus become a standard assay for the evaluation of patients who may have VODI. In addition, the assay will facilitate investigations directed at understanding the function of Sp110.","dc:creator":"Marquardsen FA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Detection of Sp110 by Flow Cytometry and Application to Screening Patients for Veno-occlusive Disease with Immunodeficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Sp110 quantification"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:18aac3ab-7a2c-48ca-87d2-e6b2c8549eeb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f557878-aa50-4b29-8534-1a5b033f765c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The Human Protein Atlas reports enhanced expression of SP110 in lymphoid tissue.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16127175","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Antibody-based proteomics provides a powerful approach for the functional study of the human proteome involving the systematic generation of protein-specific affinity reagents.

VODI is characterized by bacterial infections (including Pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, or mucocutaneous candidiasis), hepatomegaly or hepatic failure, liver biopsy results consistent with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, low intracellular cytokine production, and usually T-cell immunodeficiency with normal circulating T and B cell counts. Some patients displayed a complex neurological phenotype, however the association with SP110 is not fully understood (PMID: 23448538). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be homozygous loss of function. \nThe curation of SP110 related to autosomal recessive VODI includes both case-level and experimental evidence. Seven variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) reported in seven probands in four publications (PMIDs: 16648851, 22621957, 23448538, 32395362) are included in this curation. The heterozygous parents of probands were all unaffected. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by its enhanced expression in lymphoid tissue (PMID: 16127175), disruption of which is observed by flow cytometry of patient T cell blasts (PMID: 28825155). Additionally, functional alteration is reported in patient cells (PMID: 22621957), such that there is an impairment of B cells to produce IgM, IgG, and IgA. The impaired survival and activation of B cells in vitro most likely explains the hypogammaglobulinemia that is typical of patients with VODI. \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between SP110 and autosomal recessive hepatic veno-occlusive disease-immunodeficiency syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ee8bf8d3-46b2-4b29-b729-734c952ada99"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
