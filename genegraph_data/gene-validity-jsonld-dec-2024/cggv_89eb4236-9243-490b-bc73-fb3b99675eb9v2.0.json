This mutation is associated with partial exon skipping, and most of the mRNA lacks sequences corresponding to exon 7. The partial exon skipping apparently is the result of a nonsense mutation in the exon. Mouse strain III is a model for human tyrosinemia type 3 (McKusick 276710), and this strain together with recently established models for tyrosinemia type 1 will facilitate studies of hereditary tyrosinemias.","dc:creator":"Endo F","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"A nonsense mutation in the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase gene (Hpd) causes skipping of the constitutive exon and hypertyrosinemia in mouse strain III."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Mouse strain III was found to exhibit hypertyrosinemia, transmitted in an autosomal recessive inheritance, and maintained through brother-sister mating.

Tyrosinemia is primarily a biochemical phenotype with elevated tyrosine, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and its derivatives; it remains unclear if tyrosinemia type III is a predisposing factor that is strongly associated with cognitive delays, or if the association is purely on the basis of ascertainment bias. At least 7 unique variants (4 missense, 2 nonsense, and 1 splicing) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 10942115, 11073718, 28649543, 23036342, 31901053). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. Of note, this gene has been implicated in autosomal dominant Hawkinsinuria, in which the primary presentation is metabolic acidosis and a single reported pathogenic mutation has been identified. This will be assessed separately. The gene disease relationship is supported by biochemical function, animal models, and rescue experiments. The biochemical function of HPD in tyrosine metabolism accounts for the typical high plasma tyrosine and high levels of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and its derivatives in urine of Tyrosinemia Type 3 patients. A homozygous loss of function mouse exhibits similar biochemical phenotypes which can be rescued by adenoviral expression of human HPD. In summary, HPD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Tyrosinemia Type 3.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism (partial verses full loss of function), inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant verses recessive), and phenotypic variability (biochemical phenotype verses clinical manifestations). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, Tyrosinemia type III and Hawkinsinuria.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:89eb4236-9243-490b-bc73-fb3b99675eb9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
