Several genes necessary for the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) have been characterized in bacteria and plants. The proteins encoded by the Escherichia coli genes moaA and moaC catalyse the first steps in MoCo synthesis. The human homologues of these genes are therefore candidate genes for molybdenum cofactor deficiency, a rare and fatal disease. Using oligonucleotides complementary to a conserved region in the moaA gene, we have isolated a human cDNA derived from liver mRNA. This transcript contains an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the human moaA homologue and a second ORF encoding a human moaC homologue. Mutations can be found in the majority of MoCo-deficient patients that confirm the functional role of both ORFs in the corresponding gene MOCS1 (for 'molybdenum cofactor synthesis-step 1'). Northern-blot analysis detected only full-length transcripts containing both consecutive ORFs in various human tissues. The mRNA structure suggests a translation reinitiation mechanism for the second ORF. These data indicate the existence of a eukaryotic mRNA, which as a single and uniform transcript guides the synthesis of two different enzymatic polypeptides with disease-causing potential.","dc:creator":"Reiss J","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutations in a polycistronic nuclear gene associated with molybdenum cofactor deficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c7c418c-3aea-415f-9953-c84526232963_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c7c418c-3aea-415f-9953-c84526232963_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05a5df2e-cb50-4b0f-b033-e8d391bdac42","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e845f932-bf7d-4605-9f14-a93aeba756d0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Mo-cofactor is necessary for the function of four enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component.

MOCODA is characterized by refractory neonatal seizures, dysmorphic features, ocular lens dislocation, and a characteristic urinary profile indicative of an underlying biochemical dysfunction (PMID:33017596). The underlying mechanism is a failure to synthesize molybdenum cofactor, leading to loss of function of the enzymes sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase (PMID:33017596). \n\nSix variants (four missense, one frameshift, and one canonical splice-site) that have been reported in eight probands in four publications (PMIDs: 9731530, 9634514, 9921896, 29274890) are included in this curation. Co-segregation with disease was observed in a large consanguineous kindred (PMID:9634514). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be biallelic loss of function. The *MOCS1* gene encodes two functional enzymes, MOCS1A and MOCS1B, that participate in sequential steps of molybdenum cofactor synthesis (PMID:33017596). Variants affecting either enzyme individually or both in combination are sufficient to cause MOCODA.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by in vitro functional assays and a mouse model (PMID: 12471057, 17236133, 33017596). Alternative splicing of the *MOCS1* transcript leads to the generation of two functional enzymes, the monomeric MOCS1A and the hexameric MOCS1B. Both proteins are imported into the mitochondrial matrix, where they sequentially catalyze the first and second steps of molybdenum cofactor synthesis (PMID: 33017596). *MOCS1*-deficient mice recapitulate both the developmental and biochemical phenotypes observed in MOCODA patients (PMID:12471057). These phenotypes can be rescued by lentiviral transfection with a human *MOCS1* expression construct (PMID:17236133). \n\nIn summary, *MOCS1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive molybdenum cofactor deficiency A. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence.
