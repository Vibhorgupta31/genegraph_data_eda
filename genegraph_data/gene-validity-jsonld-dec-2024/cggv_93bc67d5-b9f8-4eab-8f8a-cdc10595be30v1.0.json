Our results show that WIP is essential both for the formation of actin cores containing WASP and cortactin and for the organization of integrin and integrin-associated proteins in circular arrays, specific characteristics of podosome structure. We also found that WIP is essential for the maintenance of the high turnover of adhesions and polarity in DCs. WIP exerts these functions by regulating calpain-mediated cleavage of WASP and by facilitating the localization of WASP to sites of actin polymerization at podosomes.

Here we show that, in WIP null (WIP(-/-)) mice, it produces haematological alterations and anatomical abnormalities in several organs, most probably as a consequence of autoimmune attacks. Granulocytosis and severe lymphopenia are associated with a proportional increase in segmented cells and fewer bone marrow erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Splenomegaly is accompanied by an increase of haematopoietic tissue and red pulp, reduction of the white pulp, and fewer B (B220(+)) lymphocytes (also apparent in the lymph nodes and Peyer's patches). Ulcerative colitis, interstitial pneumonitis, glomerular nephropathy with IgA deposits, autoantibodies, and joint inflammation are also evident.

Three nonsense variants that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 22231303, 27742395, 28903942). One variant segregated with disease in affected family members. Individuals affected with the condition present in infancy with recurrent infections, bloody diarrhea, thrombocytopenia with normal platelet volume, and inflammatory diseases such as eczema and pneumonitis. They have T cell lymphopenia affecting CD8+ lymphocytes most severely. T cell proliferation and chemotaxis are defective, and natural killer cell function is impaired. The clinical impact to heterozygous carriers is unknown. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction, functional and rescue assays, as well as an animal model (PMIDs: 9405671, 17141616, 22231303, 28903942, 11869681, 17086554). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. One normal function of WIP is to bind to WASP, stabilizing the protein and preventing its degradation (PMID: 9405671, 17141616, 22231303). In the absence of WIP, WASP expression is reduced or absent despite normal levels of mRNA (PMID: 17141616, 22231303). Introduction of wild type WIPF1 corrects this defect (PMID: 22231303). WAS has been previously established as definitively associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a combined immunodeficiency with thrombocytopenia. WIPF1 knockout mice recapitulate the patient phenotype with severe lymphopenia, splenomegaly, and inflammatory diseases including ulcerative colitis and interstitial pneumonitis (PMID: 11869681, 17086554).\n\nIn summary, WIPF1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive WIPF1-related combined immunodeficiency with thrombocytopenia.
