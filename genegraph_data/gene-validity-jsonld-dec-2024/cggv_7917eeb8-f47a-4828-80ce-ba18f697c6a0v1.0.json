Recessive MLC1 mutations are observed in 75% of patients with MLC. Genetic-linkage studies failed to identify another gene. We recently showed that some patients without MLC1 mutations display the classical phenotype; others improve or become normal but retain macrocephaly. To find another MLC-related gene, we used quantitative proteomic analysis of affinity-purified MLC1 as an alternative approach and found that GlialCAM, an IgG-like cell adhesion molecule that is also called HepaCAM and is encoded by HEPACAM, is a direct MLC1-binding partner. Analysis of 40 MLC patients without MLC1 mutations revealed multiple different HEPACAM mutations. Ten patients with the classical, deteriorating phenotype had two mutations, and 18 patients with the improving phenotype had one mutation. Most parents with a single mutation had macrocephaly, indicating dominant inheritance. In some families with dominant HEPACAM mutations, the clinical picture and magnetic resonance imaging normalized, indicating that HEPACAM mutations can cause benign familial macrocephaly. In other families with dominant HEPACAM mutations, patients had macrocephaly and mental retardation with or without autism. Further experiments demonstrated that GlialCAM and MLC1 both localize in axons and colocalize in junctions between astrocytes. GlialCAM is additionally located in myelin. Mutant GlialCAM disrupts the localization of MLC1-GlialCAM complexes in astrocytic junctions in a manner reflecting the mode of inheritance. In conclusion, GlialCAM is required for proper localization of MLC1. HEPACAM is the second gene found to be mutated in MLC. Dominant HEPACAM mutations can cause either macrocephaly and mental retardation with or without autism or benign familial macrocephaly.","dc:creator":"López-Hernández

Dominant mutations in GLIALCAM cause transient features of MLC but lacks clinical deterioration. Most recessive and dominant mutations in GLIALCAM studied so far affect the targeting of GlialCAM and its associated subunits. Here, we have investigated two patients with MLC2. The first patient has MLC2B disease, as shown by the improvement in MRI and clinical parameters. In this case, we identified a novel GLIALCAM mutation (p.Q56P) which affected the localization of GlialCAM and its associated subunits, however activating ClC-2 function as the wild-type protein. The second patient has MLC2A disease, as indicated by the lack of clinical improvement, even though, interestingly, the MRI of this patient shows a partial improvement. In this case, we found a recessive mode of inheritance, as the patient harbors two compound heterozygous mutations in GLIALCAM. One of them introduces a stop codon (p.Q56X), whereas the second mutation is a missense mutation (p.R73W), for which we could not identify any trafficking defect or an altered functional effect on

is a rare type of leukodystrophy caused by mutations in either MLC1 or GLIALCAM genes and is associated with myelin and astrocyte vacuolation. It has been suggested that MLC is caused by impaired cell volume regulation as a result of defective activation of astrocytic volume-regulated anion currents (VRAC). GlialCAM brings MLC1 and the ClC-2 Cl(-) channel to cell-cell junctions, even though the role of ClC-2 in MLC disease remains incompletely understood. To gain insights into the biological role of GlialCAM in the pathogenesis of MLC disease, here we analyzed the gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes of GlialCAM in Hela cells and primary astrocytes, focusing on its interaction with the MLC1 protein. Unexpectedly, GlialCAM ablation provoked intracellular accumulation and reduced expression of MLC1 at the plasma membrane. Conversely, over-expression of GlialCAM increased the cellular stability of mutant MLC1 variants. Reduction in GlialCAM expression resulted in defective activation of VRAC and augmented vacuolation, phenocopying MLC1 mutations. Importantly, over-expression of GlialCAM together with MLC1 containing MLC-related mutations was able to reactivate VRAC currents and to reverse the vacuolation caused in the presence of mutant MLC1. These results indicate a previously unrecognized role of GlialCAM in facilitating the biosynthetic maturation and cell surface expression of MLC1, and suggest that pharmacological strategies aimed to increase surface expression of MLC1 and/or VRAC activity may be beneficial for MLC patients.","dc:creator":"Capdevila-Nortes X","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Insights into MLC pathogenesis: GlialCAM is an MLC1 chaperone required for proper activation of volume-regulated anion currents."},"rdfs:label":"Glial- CAM shRNA infection of astrocytes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7917eeb8-f47a-4828-80ce-ba18f697c6a0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73f731b2-a662-43bd-b399-e64c835fcecc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:516e3eed-669d-4271-91c5-82de55d870a7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Glialcam knockout mice showed myelin vacuolization in the cerebellum as seen in brain biopsies of MLC patients and MLC knockout mice ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24647135","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Defects in the astrocytic membrane protein MLC1, the adhesion molecule GlialCAM or the chloride channel ClC-2 underlie human leukoencephalopathies.

Here we investigate this by generating loss-of-function Glialcam and Mlc1 mouse models manifesting myelin vacuolization. We find that ClC-2 is unnecessary for MLC1 and GlialCAM localization in brain, whereas GlialCAM is important for targeting MLC1 and ClC-2 to specialized glial domains in vivo and for modifying ClC-2's biophysical properties specifically in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the cells chiefly affected by vacuolization. Unexpectedly, MLC1 is crucial for proper localization of GlialCAM and ClC-2, and for changing ClC-2 currents. Our data unmask an unforeseen functional relationship between MLC1 and ClC-2 in vivo, which is probably mediated by GlialCAM, and suggest that ClC-2 participates in the pathogenesis of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts.","dc:creator":"Hoegg-Beiler MB","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Disrupting MLC1 and GlialCAM and ClC-2 interactions in leukodystrophy entails glial chloride channel dysfunction."},"rdfs:label":"Knock out GlialCAM in mice "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6505,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6a8fe464-84f2-4305-bebe-0330a44f4b1d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013490","gene":"hgnc:26361","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Variants in HEPACAM, also known as GLIALCAM, were first reported by Lopez-Hernandez in 2011 (PMID: 21419380) in relation to the autosomal recessive (AR) condition megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, 2A (MLC2A). Variants in this gene are also implicated in an autosomal dominant (AD) condition, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 2B (MLC2B). AR MLC2A is characterized by early-onset macrocephaly and delayed-onset neurologic deterioration, including cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, epilepsy, and mild cognitive decline. AD MLC2B is characterized by infantile-onset of macrocephaly and mildly delayed motor development related to spontaneously resolving white matter abnormalities. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there are differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability and therefore, these two entities have been split and MLC2B has been curated separately. \n\nFourteen variants (10 missense, 2 nonsense, and 2 frameshift) been reported in 13 patients from 11 families (PMIDs: 21419380, 24202401, 27389245, 31372844) are included in this curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nHEPACAM is a direct MLC1-binding partner. The mechanisms of pathogenicity include trafficking defects and impaired interaction between GlialCAM and its protein targets (PMID: 21419380, 31960914). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, in vitro/in vivo functional assays and animal models. For example, in cultured cells, coexpression of wild-type MLC1 and HEPACAM missense variants resulted in altered localization of MLC1 and mutated HEPACAM (PMID: 21419380, 25044933). Furthermore, mice harboring homozygous GlialCAM G89S variants showed myelin vacuolization in the cerebellum (PMID: 24647135).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between HEPACAM and autosomal recessive megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 2A. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 12, 2023 (SOP 9). ","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7917eeb8-f47a-4828-80ce-ba18f697c6a0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
