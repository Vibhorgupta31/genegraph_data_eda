An unstable expansion of a dodecamer repeat in the CSTB promoter accounts for the majority of EPM1 disease alleles worldwide. We here describe a novel PCR protocol for detection of the dodecamer repeat expansion. We describe two novel EPM1-associated mutations, c.149G > A leading to the p.G50E missense change and an intronic 18-bp deletion (c.168+1_18del), which affects splicing of CSTB. The p.G50E mutation that affects the conserved QVVAG amino acid sequence critical for cathepsin binding fails to associate with lysosomes. This further supports the previously implicated physiological importance of the CSTB-lysosome association. Expression of CSTB mRNA and protein was markedly reduced in lymphoblastoid cells of the patients irrespective of the mutation type. Patients homozygous for the dodecamer expansion mutation showed 5-10% expression compared to controls. By combining database searches with RT-PCR we identified several alternatively spliced CSTB isoforms. One of these, CSTB2, was also present in mouse and was analyzed in more detail. In real-time PCR quantification, CSTB2 expression was less than 5% of total CSTB expression in all human adult and fetal tissues analyzed. In patients homozygous for the minisatellite mutation, the level of CSTB2 was reduced similarly to that of CSTB implicating regulation from the same promoter. The physiological significance of CSTB2 remains to be determined.","dc:creator":"Joensuu T","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Cystatin B: mutation detection, alternative splicing and expression in progressive myclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) patients."},"rdfs:label":"Expression study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2926506c-5b75-4340-b821-e3ac846b6621_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7dbeac02-48e5-4239-a2a0-e6dd11711540","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2fa2c962-f97c-483b-8766-95d26979b0ad","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The  BHK-21 cells transfected with DNA construct with the variant showed a highly concentrated localization of Cystatin B protein in nucleus and absence of colocalization in the lysosome","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17003839","rdfs:label":"Protein localization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2926506c-5b75-4340-b821-e3ac846b6621_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:adae9daa-8283-4e5a-83f8-2be5cc77eb8a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:320389d2-1b23-412f-a179-bba19fd4fd3a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Cstb knock-out mouse model recapitulated the EPM1 patient phenotypes including progressive myoclonic seizure","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9806543","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Loss-of-function mutations in the gene (CSTB) encoding human cystatin B, a widely expressed cysteine protease inhibitor, are responsible for a severe neurological disorder known as Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1).

The EPM1 locus was mapped to within 0.3 cM from PFKL in chromosome 21q22.3. The gene for the proteinase inhibitor cystatin B was recently localized in the EPM1 critical region, and mutations were identified in two EPM1 families. We have identified six nucleotide changes in the cystatin B gene of non-Finnish EPM1 families from northern Africa and Europe. The 426G-->C change in exon 1 results in a Gly4Arg substitution and is the first missense mutation described that is associated with EPM1. Molecular modeling predicts that this substitution severely affects the contact of cystatin B with papain. Mutations in the invariant AG dinucleotides of the acceptor sites of introns 1 and 2 probably result in abnormal splicing. A deletion of two nucleotides in exon 3 produces a frameshift and truncates the protein. Therefore, these four mutations are all predicted to impair the production of functional protein. These mutations were found in 7 of the 29 unrelated EPM1 patients analyzed, in homozygosity in 1, and in heterozygosity in the others. The remaining two sequence changes, 431G-->T and 2575A-->G, probably represent polymorphic variants. In addition, a tandem repeat in the 5' UTR (CCCCGCCCCGCG) is present two or three times in normal alleles. It is peculiar that in the majority of patients no mutations exist within the exons and splice sites of the cystatin B gene.","dc:creator":"Lalioti MD","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Identification of mutations in cystatin B, the gene responsible for the Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1)."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012407","rdfs:label":"GVA02"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:418c9b76-d1a0-47d1-8847-a0f2efa95f2b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:871ae7e4-9fc6-4d77-bfd8-c5ee27f51dc9","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"PCR fragment analysis for repeat expansion number","firstTestingMethod":"Other","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:418c9b76-d1a0-47d1-8847-a0f2efa95f2b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:df8a2968-eb7a-40cd-a935-5eddb1bff5a0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000100.4(CSTB):c.168+2_168+19del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347801"}},{"id":"cggv:da4036f9-0f2e-4dbd-af3d-66d449c1215f"}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17003839"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17003839","rdfs:label":"Patient J"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:c6818014-99fa-44a1-8d70-9c4373c4f286_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5b1d420-ba05-4258-82d4-2aa1c82ab2cb","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Southen blot for repeat expansion number","firstTestingMethod":"Other","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c6818014-99fa-44a1-8d70-9c4373c4f286_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:da4036f9-0f2e-4dbd-af3d-66d449c1215f"},{"id":"cggv:c3d59b37-ce86-4875-8394-c6304ca809ab","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000100.4(CSTB):c.214_215TC[2] (p.Leu73fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344722"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012407"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9012407","rdfs:label":"GVA07"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a0d382a9-10b2-4cf1-8374-61760c1e7dbd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e55ecda6-d389-474e-8935-e226a2a68413","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Southern blot for repeat expansion number","firstTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a0d382a9-10b2-4cf1-8374-61760c1e7dbd_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:da4036f9-0f2e-4dbd-af3d-66d449c1215f"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9126745"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9126745","rdfs:label":"10"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0038e79a-1fe3-4e9a-ab46-0b4dd169f62e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb55d8b7-85f4-43ec-ba2a-e15fe3dd359e","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Southern blot for repeat expansion number","firstTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:0038e79a-1fe3-4e9a-ab46-0b4dd169f62e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:da4036f9-0f2e-4dbd-af3d-66d449c1215f"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9126745"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9126745","rdfs:label":"2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1649,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:31b82cd4-5bd6-4b58-bbb3-2397adc462b8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009698","gene":"hgnc:2482","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Variants in the CSTB gene have been reported in more than 55 affected individuals (from 40 families) with autosomal recessive (AR) Unverricht – Lundborg disease (aka EPM1 (Epilepsy, progressive myoclonic)) since 1996 (Pennacchio et al.). Most of affected individuals have repeat expansion variants, which is proved to cause a loss of function of the protein and it suggest homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of Unverricht – Lundborg disease for this gene. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression study, and animal model study. In summary, CSTB is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Unverricht – Lundborg disease.
