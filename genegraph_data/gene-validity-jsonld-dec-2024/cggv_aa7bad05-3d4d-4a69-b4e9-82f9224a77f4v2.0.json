In this disease, cone photoreceptors, the retinal sensory neurons mediating colour vision, seem viable but fail to generate an electrical response to light. Achromatopsia, or rod monochromatism, was first mapped to 2p11-2q12 (MIM 216900; ref. 3), where it is associated with missense mutations in CNGA3 (ref. 4). CNGA3 encodes the alpha-subunit of the cone cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel, which generates the light-evoked electrical responses of cone photoreceptors. A second locus at 8q21-q22 has been identified among the Pingelapese islanders of Micronesia, who have a high incidence of recessive achromatopsia (MIM 262300). Here we narrow the achromatopsia locus to 1.4 cM and show that Pingelapese achromatopsia segregates with a missense mutation at a highly conserved site in CNGB3, a new gene that encodes the beta-subunit of the cone cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel. Two independent frameshift deletions establish that achromatopsia is the null phenotype of CNGB3. Combined with earlier findings, our results demonstrate that both alpha- and beta-subunits of the cGMP-gated channel are essential for phototransduction in all three classes of cones.","dc:creator":"Sundin OH","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Genetic basis of total colourblindness among the Pingelapese islanders."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa7bad05-3d4d-4a69-b4e9-82f9224a77f4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa7bad05-3d4d-4a69-b4e9-82f9224a77f4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0cfb4a3a-f36d-4fd5-bb51-1d1d060340a4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a140245-efb6-4cc0-9947-d226a74e7deb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Using specific antibodies it was found that CNGB3 and CNGA3 genes are highly expressed in Nrl-/- mouse retinas by western blotting and immunolabeling.

This study investigates the biochemical components of native cone CNG channels, using the cone-dominant retina in mice deficient in the transcription factor neural retina leucine zipper (Nrl). Abundant expression of CNGA3 and CNGB3 but no rod CNG channel expression was detected in Nrl-/- retina by western blotting and immunolabeling. Localization of cone CNG channel in both blue (S)- and red/green (M)-cones was shown by double immunolabeling using antibodies against the channel subunits and against the S- and M-opsins. Immunolabeling also showed co-localization of CNGA3 and CNGB3 in the mouse retina. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the direct interaction between CNGA3 and CNGB3. Chemical cross-linking readily generated products at sizes consistent with oligomers of the channel complexes ranging from dimeric to tetrameric complexes, in a concentration- and time-dependent pattern. Thus this work provides the first biochemical evidence showing the inter-subunit interaction between CNGA3 and CNGB3 and the presence of heterotetrameric complexes of the native cone CNG channel in retina. No association between CNGA3 and the cone Na(+)/Ca(2+)-K(+) exchanger (NCKX2) was shown by co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking.

This channel is composed of two structurally related subunits, CNGA3 and CNGB3; CNGA3 is the ion-conducting subunit, whereas CNGB3 is a modulatory subunit. Mutations in both subunits are associated with achromatopsia and progressive cone dystrophy, with mutations in CNGB3 alone accounting for 50% of all known cases of achromatopsia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cone diseases that result from CNGB3 deficiency are unknown. This study investigated the role of CNGB3 in cones, using CNGB3(-/-) mice. Cone dysfunction was apparent at the earliest time point examined (post-natal day 30) in CNGB3(-/-) mice. When compared with wild-type (WT) controls: photopic electroretingraphic (ERG) responses were decreased by approximately 75%, whereas scotopic ERG responses were unchanged; visual acuity was decreased by approximately 20%, whereas contrast sensitivity was unchanged; cone density was reduced by approximately 40%; photoreceptor apoptosis was detected; and outer segment disorganization was observed in some cones. Notably, CNGA3 protein and mRNA levels were significantly decreased in CNGB3(-/-) mice; in contrast, mRNA levels of S-opsin, Gnat2 and Pde6c were unchanged, relative to WT mice. Hence, we show that loss of CNGB3 reduces biosynthesis of CNGA3 and impairs cone CNG channel function. We suggest that down-regulation of CNGA3 contributes to the pathogenic mechanism by which CNGB3 mutations lead to human cone disease.","dc:creator":"Ding XQ","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Impaired cone function and cone degeneration resulting from CNGB3 deficiency: down-regulation of CNGA3 biosynthesis as a potential mechanism."},"rdfs:label":"CNGB3 null mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:aa7bad05-3d4d-4a69-b4e9-82f9224a77f4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6ea9ad1-8f68-45b8-8a21-ed25d80617c2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6ea9ad1-8f68-45b8-8a21-ed25d80617c2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":{"id":"cggv:43cbb321-e12c-4f0c-bef3-e4d27f650195","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_019098.4(CNGB3):c.1304C>T (p.Ser435Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340371"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:acb4418b-7a04-44b7-b42e-55d332111801_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:43cbb321-e12c-4f0c-bef3-e4d27f650195"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10888875"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:acb4418b-7a04-44b7-b42e-55d332111801","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:acb4418b-7a04-44b7-b42e-55d332111801_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:acb4418b-7a04-44b7-b42e-55d332111801_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"A different study (PMID 12815043) reported that Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes of human CNGA3 (hCNGA3) subunits with hCNGB3subunits  containing  an  achromatopsia-associated  mutation in the S6 transmembrane domain (S435F) generated functional heteromeric channels that exhibited an increase in apparent affinity for both cAMP and cGMP compared with  wild  type  heteromeric  channels.

Al., 2000; PMID 10888875). Achromatopsia is characterized by photophobia, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and inability to discriminate between colors. Electroretinogram shows an absent cone response whereas rod function is preserved. This condition was curated under the disesae entity \"CNGB3-related retinopathy\". \n\nThe maximum score for genetic evidence was achieved by the addition of 5 variants (PMID:10888875, 15657609, 31544997) in this curation, however there is more evidence available in the literature. There are over 200 CNGB3 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants listed on ClinVar (10/05/2021). In one report (PMID 15657609), a cohort of 341 unrelated patients with achromatopsia was studied which resulted in identification of disease-causing variants in 163 patients. Among them, 105 were homozygous for the variant while 44 were compound heterozygotes, 14 carried a single allele. Another study reported a deep intronic variant NM_019098.4(CNGB3):c.1663-1205G>A in-trans with pathogenic variants in 18 patients with achromatopsia, making this variant one of the most frequent variant associated with achromatopsia (PMID 31544997). \n\nCNGB3 and CNGA3 proteins were found to be highly expressed in NRL-/- mouse retinas by western blotting and immunolabeling. Moreover, both these cone CNG channels were observed to co-localize in S and M cones (PMID 18665891). Mouse studies also supported the role of Cngb3 in cone function. A mice line with naturally occurring missense variant NM_013927:c.692G>A; p.(R231H) was studied for visual function which revealed that homozygous mice (n=12) had lost cone function while their rod function was intact (PMID 30592498). Additionally, in another knockout mouse study, homozygous null mice recapitulated achromatopsia phenotype, briefly by showing a decrease in photopic ERG responses, visual acuity, and cone density (PMID 19767295). Role of CNGB3 in cone function was also further supported by rescue studies in null mice by sub-retinal injections of AAV8(Y447,&33F) constructs. The transgenic mice showed expression of CNGB3 in cone cells and restored photopic ERG responses (PMID 32305965).\n\nIn summary, CNGB3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive CNGB3-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.  \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aa7bad05-3d4d-4a69-b4e9-82f9224a77f4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
