Here we report the mapping of the hypolipidemia (hypl) locus to the middle of chromosome 4 and positional cloning of the autosomal recessive mutation responsible for the hypolipidemia. The hypl locus encodes a unique angiopoietin-like lipoprotein modulator, which we named Allm1. It is identical to angiopoietin-like protein 3, encoded by Angptl3, and has a highly conserved counterpart in humans. Overexpression of Angptl3 or intravenous injection of the purified protein in KK/San mice elicited an increase in circulating plasma lipid levels.

Recently, we identified a mutation in the gene encoding angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl3) in KK/San mice, and injection of adenoviruses encoding Angptl3 or recombinant ANGPTL3 protein to mutant KK/San mice raised plasma lipid levels. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of ANGPTL3 on lipid metabolism, we focused on the metabolic pathways of triglyceride in the present study. Overexpression of Angptl3 in KK/San mice resulted in a marked increase of triglyceride-enriched very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). In vivo studies using Triton WR1339 revealed that there is no significant difference between mutant and wild-type KK mice in the hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion rate. However, turnover studies using radiolabeled VLDL revealed that the clearance of (3)H-triglyceride-labeled VLDL was significantly enhanced in KK/San mice, whereas the clearance of (125)I-labeled VLDL was only slightly enhanced. In vitro analysis of recombinant protein revealed that ANGPTL3 directly inhibits LPL activity. These data strongly support the hypothesis that ANGPTL3 is a new class of lipid metabolism modulator, which regulates VLDL triglyceride levels through the inhibition of LPL activity.","dc:creator":"Shimizugawa T","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"ANGPTL3 decreases very low density lipoprotein triglyceride clearance by inhibition of lipoprotein lipase."},"rdfs:label":"Shimizugawa_ANGPTL3 inhibits LPL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Additional information is available in PMID: 19028676 and PMID: 26754661"},{"id":"cggv:47bd4bbc-de2d-409c-9d63-5b3d68668cb3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d4a9764-d0c3-44a4-ba22-1e905ad73516","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"ASO-mediated knockdown of ANGPTL3 resulted in decreased protein levels in mouse models and humans.

We report here that angptl3 is primarily expressed in the zebrafish developing liver and that morpholino (MO) knockdown of Angptl3 reduces the size of the developing liver, which is caused by suppression of cell proliferation, but not by enhancement of apoptosis. However, MO knockdown of Angptl3 did not alter angiogenesis in the developing liver. Additionally, disruption of zebrafish Angptl3 elicits the hypocholesterolemia phenotype that is characteristic of FHBL2 in humans. Together, our findings propose a novel role for Angptl3 in liver cell proliferation and maintenance during zebrafish embryogenesis.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia 2 is characterized by a combined deficiency of plasma lipids: very low VLDL, LDL, and HDL levels, and consequently low total TG and cholesterol levels (PMID: 26754661). The *ANGPTL3* gene encodes a member of a family of secreted proteins that function in lipid metabolism and angiogenesis. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 7 probands with mostly predicted or established loss-of-function variants in 5 publications (PMID: 22155345, 22659251, 20942659, 22247256, 22062970). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 34 additional family members (PMID: 20942659). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. Some heterozygous carriers are occasionally noted to have plasma lipid levels in the disease range; however, most carriers have plasma lipid levels in the normal range. Only individuals with biallelic variants were scored for this curation.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): The ANGPTL3 protein is almost exclusively expressed in the liver (PMID: 11788823). Mouse and zebrafish models with *ANGPTL3* alterations recapitulate the human hypobetalipoproteinemia phenotype (PMID: 11788823, 24685482). Introduction of WT gene into the *Angptl3*-/- mouse model restores lipid levels (PMID: 11788823). In-vitro functional assays elucidate the role of *ANGPTL3* mutations in disease, which acts through reversible inhibition of LPL (PMID: 12097324, 26754661, 19028676). *ANGPTL3* is a therapeutic target to lower lipid levels in dyslipidemia, and studies have been conducted in mice, monkeys and humans (PMID: 25964512, 28538111) \n\nIn summary, the *ANGPTL3*-Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia 2 gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:df7eb35c-09a3-4df2-bf05-22aee7de3855"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
