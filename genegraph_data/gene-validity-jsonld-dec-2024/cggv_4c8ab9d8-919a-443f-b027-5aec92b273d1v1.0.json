Single molecules of titin extend from the Z-line to the M-line. Here, we define the molecular layout of titin within the Z-line; the most NH2-terminal 30 kD of titin is located at the periphery of the Z-line at the border of the adjacent sarcomere, whereas the subsequent 60 kD of titin spans the entire width of the Z-line. In vitro binding studies reveal that mammalian titins have at least four potential binding sites for alpha-actinin within their Z-line spanning region. Titin filaments may specify Z-line width and internal structure by varying the length of their NH2-terminal overlap and number of alpha-actinin binding sites that serve to cross-link the titin and thin filaments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NH2-terminal titin Ig repeats Z1 and Z2 in the periphery of the Z-line bind to a novel 19-kD protein, referred to as titin-cap.

Both mechanical overload and unloading alter t-tubule structure, but the mechanisms mediating the normally tight regulation of the t-tubules in response to load variation are poorly understood. Telethonin (Tcap) is a stretch-sensitive Z-disc protein that binds to proteins in the t-tubule membrane. To assess its role in regulating t-tubule structure and function, we used Tcap knockout (KO) mice and investigated cardiomyocyte t-tubule and cell structure and CICR over time and following mechanical overload. In cardiomyocytes from 3-month-old KO (3mKO), there were isolated t-tubule defects and Ca(2+) transient dysynchrony without whole heart and cellular dysfunction. Ca(2+) spark frequency more than doubled in 3mKO. At 8 months of age (8mKO), cardiomyocytes showed progressive loss of t-tubules and remodelling of the cell surface, with prolonged and dysynchronous Ca(2+) transients. Ca(2+) spark frequency was elevated and the L-type Ca(2+) channel was depressed at 8 months only. After mechanical overload obtained by aortic banding constriction, the Ca(2+) transient was prolonged in both wild type and KO. Mechanical overload increased the Ca(2+) spark frequency in KO alone, where there was also significantly more t-tubule loss, with a greater deterioration in t-tubule regularity. In conjunction, Tcap KO showed severe loss of cell surface ultrastructure. These data suggest that Tcap is a critical, load-sensitive regulator of t-tubule structure and function.","dc:creator":"Ibrahim M","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A critical role for Telethonin in regulating t-tubule structure and function in the mammalian heart."},"rdfs:label":"Deletion (knockout) of TCAP in mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":1175,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":3.9,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c06ab52d-1c7b-4673-bffe-340935147e89","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:11610","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The first reported human evidence in an autosomal dominant isolated DCM case was reported in 2004 (Hayashi et al, PMID: 15582318). At least six unique variants, all heterozygous missense variants, have been reported in humans with isolated DCM. Missense variants were identified in case-level and case-control data sets (Akinrinade et al, 2015, PMID: 26084686; Hershberger et al, 2008, PMID: 19412328; Hirtle-Lewis et al, 2013, PMID: 24037902; Walsh et al, 2017, PMID: 27532257).
