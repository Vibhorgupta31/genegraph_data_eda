The amino acids comprising the catalytic center of G6Pase include Lys(76), Arg(83), His(119), Arg(170), and His(176). During catalysis, a His residue in G6Pase becomes phosphorylated generating an enzyme-phosphate intermediate. It was predicted that His(176) would be the amino acid that acts as a nucleophile forming a phosphohistidine-enzyme intermediate, and His(119) would be the amino acid that provides the proton needed to liberate the glucose moiety. However, the phosphate acceptor in G6Pase has eluded molecular characterization. To identify the His residue that covalently bound the phosphate moiety, we generated recombinant adenoviruses carrying G6Pase wild type and active site mutants. A 40-kDa [(32)P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate was identified after incubating [(32)P]glucose 6-phosphate with microsomes expressing wild type but not with microsomes expressing either H119A or H176A mutant G6Pase. Human G6Pase contains five methionine residues at positions 1, 5, 121, 130, and 279. After cyanogen bromide cleavage, His(119) is predicted to be within a 116-amino acid peptide of 13.5 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.3 (residues 6-121), and His(176) is predicted to be within a 149-amino acid peptide of 16.8 kDa with an isoelectric point of 9.3 (residues 131-279). We show that after digestion of a non-glycosylated [(32)P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate by cyanogen bromide, the [(32)P]phosphate remains bound to a peptide of 17 kDa with an isoelectric point above 9, demonstrating that His(176) is the phosphate acceptor in G6Pase.","dc:creator":"Ghosh A","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The catalytic center of glucose-6-phosphatase.

Poor oral intake and failure to thrive were two main clinical manifestations when she was referred to our hospital at the age of 3.5 months. The milky serum was the only one characteristic presentation. Laboratory testing showed extremely high level of triglycerides, cholesterol and lactate. Many other laboratory indexes cannot be detected because of severe hyperlipemic samples. Multi-gene panel testing for 249 genes about genetic and metabolic liver disease were performed. Gene analysis revealed a G6PC gene deficiency. The patient was a homozygote for c.248G > A, p.R83H and her parents were both the heterozygotes. The infant had been diagnosed as glycogen storage disease type Ia. Conclusions We report an infant presenting with extreme hypertriglyceridemia diagnosed as glycogen storage disease type Ia by genetic testing.

Variations were spread across GSDIa, Ib, III, VI, IXa, b and c. The largest subgroup was GSDIII in 28 individuals with 24 variations (12 novel) in AGL. The 1620+1G>C intronic variation was observed in 5 with GSDVI (PYGL). A total of eleven GSDIX are described with the first Indian report of type IXb. This is the largest study of GSDs from India.

The present study reported the case of a 3‑month‑old female Chinese patient with GSD‑Ia born to consanguineous parents. The aim of the present study was to identify the precise mutation of the G6PC gene associated with this family and to describe the phenotypic characteristics of the patient. A comprehensive examination was performed on the patient, including physical examination, vein blood gas analysis, abdominal sonography and biochemical analyses. In addition, gene sequencing was performed on the coding region of the G6PC gene to identify the mutation. The patient was diagnosed with GSD‑Ia and a G6PC missense mutation of c.518T>C (p.L173P) located in a highly conserved area was identified. The mutation is in a non‑helical region of the protein, which previous studies have suggested should result in a lesser effect on G6PC enzymatic activity and milder phenotypic characteristics compared with mutations located in helical regions. However, the severity of the disease phenotype in the subject of the present study was inconsistent with that predicted from her genotype. The patient suffered from serious hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, increased triglycerides, hepatic dysfunction, clear hepatomegaly and nephromegaly. The incidence of the p.L173P mutation may be relatively high in the Chinese population.

The enzyme causes hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into glucose during the terminal steps of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (Shieh et al. 2002; Udawat et al. 2019).  Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia, MIM232200) also known as von Gierke disease, is caused by deleterious mutations in the *G6PC1* gene. Patients with GSD-Ia experience growth retardation, hypoglycaemia during fasting, and increased serum levels of uric acid, triglycerides, and cholesterol (Wang et al. 2013). The *G6PC1* gene is expressed in the liver, kidney, and intestine, and these are the only organs that release glucose into the blood circulation. G6Pasedeficiency also leads to the accumulation of glucose-6 phosphate (G6P), glycogen, and triglycerides in the liver and kidneys of patients. This results in marked hepatomegaly and nephromegaly.\n\nIn this curation, 21 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift), reported in 15 probands in 10 publications (PMID:17607665, 11196115, 11058918, 32436859, 10234610, 10797430, 27139513, 35834487, 8739966, 27511118) are included. GSD-Ia is not more prevalent in any ethnic group, but mutations unique to Caucasian, oriental, and Jewish populations have been described. GSD-Ia patients have been seen to exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity. Among these variants, p.R170X (PMID: 10797430) has been functionally characterized and completely inactivates the G6PC enzyme. The variant p.R83C (PMID:10797430) is identified as the most prevalent mutation in Caucasian and Jewish GSD-Ia patients.  In Chinese patients the most prevalent mutations are p.R83H (PMID:324685) and c.648G>T (PMID:10797430). \n\nThe experimental evidence that support gene-disease relation include biochemical function analysis, functional alteration and animal models (PMID: 12093795, 10738525,8640227, 33359667, 21109326).  The study by Ghosh et al., (PMID:12093795), reported the crucial role of His176 in G6Pase catalysis where this His residue in G6Pase becomes phosphorylated generating an enzyme-phosphate intermediate showing that substituting His176 with an Ala residue also completely abolished G6Pase activity, a feature in GSD Ia patients. Functional alteration study was carried out using the hGlc6Pase cDNA cloned in pSVK3 (expression plasmid) which were transfected into COS7 cells. Glc6Pase activity of hGlc6Pase after insertion of the fourpoint mutations which were previously identified in French patients, e.g. W77R, A124T, G184E and L211P were analyzed both in terms of maximal velocity (Vmax) and Glc6P affinity (Km), in comparison with Glc6Pase assayed in microsomes isolated from normal human liver and kidney. None of the four new hGlc6Pase mutants exhibited a Glc6Pase activity higher than that of untransfected COS-7 cells (PMID:107538525). In mouse model study by Mutel et al., G6pc- / mice which were generated by an inducible CRE (CRE ERT2) strategy, demonstrated hyperlipidemia, lactic acidosis, and uricemia, hepatomegaly and steatosis (PMID:21109326). Another mouse model study by Arnaoutova et al., (PMID: 33359667) CRISPR/Cas9-based technology to generate a G6pc-R83C mouse line homozygous for G6PC-p.R83C. It was seen that G6pc-R83C mice were devoid of hepatic and renal G6Pase-α activity and died prematurely, and manifested impaired glucose homeostasis and frequent hypoglycemic seizures, like the symptoms of the global G6pc−/− mice (Lei KJ, 1996)(PMID:8640227), essentially the same pathophysiology as human GSD-Ia patients.\n\nIn summary, *G6PC1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease Ia and has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnosis settings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on the meeting date [09/27/2024] (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:951fef4e-a9ac-400c-b94a-5d6531086d9f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
