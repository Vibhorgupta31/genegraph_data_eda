CMT4B1 is caused by mutations in the myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2) gene and as a member of the myotubularin family, the MTMR2 protein is crucial for the modulation of membrane trafficking. To enable future clinical trials, we performed a detailed review of the published cases with MTMR2 mutations and describe four novel cases identified through whole-exome sequencing (WES). The four unrelated families harbor novel homozygous mutations in MTMR2 (NM_016156, Family 1: c.1490dupC; p.Phe498IlefsTer2; Family 2: c.1479+1G>A; Family 3: c.1090C>T; p.Arg364Ter; Family 4: c.883C>T; p.Arg295Ter) and present with CMT4B1-related severe early-onset motor and sensory neuropathy, generalized muscle atrophy, facial and bulbar weakness, and pes cavus deformity. The clinical description of the new mutations reported here overlap with previously reported CMT4B1 phenotypes caused by mutations in the phosphatase domain of MTMR2, suggesting that nonsense MTMR2 mutations, which are predicted to result in loss or disruption of the phosphatase domain, are associated with a severe phenotype and loss of independent ambulation by the early twenties. Whereas the few reported missense mutations and also those truncating mutations occurring at the C-terminus after the phosphatase domain cause a rather mild phenotype and patients were still ambulatory above the age 30 years. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and Centronuclear Myopathy causing mutations have been shown to occur in proteins involved in membrane remodeling and trafficking pathway mediated by phosphoinositides. Earlier studies have showing the rescue of MTM1 myopathy by MTMR2 overexpression, emphasize the importance of maintaining the phosphoinositides equilibrium and highlight a potential compensatory mechanism amongst members of this pathway. This proved that the regulation of expression of these proteins involved in the membrane remodeling pathway may compensate each other's loss- or gain-of-function mutations by restoring the phosphoinositides equilibrium. This provides a potential therapeutic strategy for neuromuscular diseases resulting from mutations in the membrane remodeling pathway.","dc:creator":"Wang H","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Due to MTMR2 Mutations and Implications in Membrane Trafficking."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31680794","rdfs:label":"Wang Family 1-Patient II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Given that prior evidence with other variants suggests that frameshift and nonsense mutations may not result in the loss of protein expression, the score has been reduced from default."},{"id":"cggv:0be945b5-dacb-49d2-a573-c5bd10d390d8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ad37f89-a2ba-4b0d-bb15-2060ce57ea4f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Whole Exome sequencing in the proband.

Such cases have been shown to be genetically heterogeneous. Alterations in the myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) gene on chromosome 11q22 have recently been shown to give rise to this phenotype. Mutations have been identified in the 3' region of the MTMR2 gene in four unrelated families, in two of whom the disorder had been mapped to chromosome 11q22 by genetic linkage analysis. We have sequenced the entire coding region and flanking intronic regions of the MTMR2 gene in eight families with early onset autosomal recessive neuropathies. Two novel mutations were identified in exon 4 at the 5' end of the MTMR2 gene in an English and an Indian family. The clinical phenotype and sural nerve pathology in these two families differs in severity, with the proband in the English family having an earlier onset and more severe neuropathy with prominent cranial nerve involvement. This is probably due to mutation type and possible involvement of small nucleotide polymorphisms in phenotype modulation. Detailed sural nerve pathology is presented in both cases. Mutations in the MTMR2 gene are thus an important cause of autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy. Identifying further mutations and defining their phenotype will help to clarify the genetic classification of this group of disorders.","dc:creator":"Houlden H","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations in the 5' region of the myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) gene in autosomal recessive hereditary neuropathy with focally folded myelin."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11335693","rdfs:label":"Houlden Family C-Case 9 (V-1)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variant evidence was provided in Prevatali et al., 2003 PMID:1335693, in which immunohistochemistry was performed on the patient cells with antibodies against Mtmr2 (human and rat).

MTMR2 is widely expressed and encodes a phosphatase whose substrates include phosphoinositides. However, this does not explain how MTMR2 mutants specifically produce demyelination in the peripheral nerve. Therefore, we analysed the cellular and subcellular distribution of Mtmr2 in nerve. Mtmr2 was detected in all cytoplasmic compartments of myelin-forming Schwann cells, as well as in the cytoplasm of non-myelin-forming Schwann cells and both sensory and motorneurons. In contrast, Mtmr2 was detected in the nucleus of Schwann cells and motorneurons, but not in the nucleus of sensory neurons. As Mtmr2 is diffusely present also within the nerve, a specific function could derive instead from nerve-specific interacting proteins. Therefore, we performed two yeast two-hybrid screenings, using either fetal brain or peripheral nerve cDNA libraries. The neurofilament light chain protein, NF-L, was identified repeatedly in both screenings, and found to interact with MTMR2 in both Schwann cells and neurons. Interestingly, NF-L, encoding NF-L, is mutated in CMT2E.

We generated a Mtmr2-null mouse that models the human neuropathy. We also found that, in Schwann cells, Mtmr2 interacts with Discs large 1 (Dlg1), a scaffold involved in polarized trafficking and membrane addition, whose localization in Mtmr2-null nerves is altered. We here report that, in Schwann cells, Dlg1 also interacts with kinesin 13B (kif13B) and Sec8, which are involved in vesicle transport and membrane tethering in polarized cells, respectively. Taking advantage of the Mtmr2-null mouse as a model of impaired membrane formation, we provide here the first evidence for a machinery that titrates membrane formation during myelination. We established Schwann cell/DRG neuron cocultures from Mtmr2-null mice, in which myelin outfoldings were reproduced and almost completely rescued by Mtmr2 replacement. By exploiting this in vitro model, we propose a mechanism whereby kif13B kinesin transports Dlg1 to sites of membrane remodeling where it coordinates a homeostatic control of myelination. The interaction of Dlg1 with the Sec8 exocyst component promotes membrane addition, whereas with Mtmr2, negatively regulates membrane formation.

The phenotype associated with MTMR2 including vocal paresis, severe neuropathy at an early onset (adolescents), and pathologically with the presence of myelin outfolding (reviewed in Tazir et al., 2013; PMID: 23781959).  At least 25 unique variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and indels have been reported in humans (reviewed in Pareyson et al., 2019, PMID: 31070812 and per the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Database). There are variant databases describing MTMR2 variants of interest in neuropathy, including (1) the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Database (URL: http://hihg.med.miami.edu/code/http/cmt/public_html/index.html#/) and (2) the MTMR2 LOVD database (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/MTMR2).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship has been well studied and the case-level data does not reflect all published studies. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, protein interaction, animal models and rescue models. MTMR2 has 18 exons, and produces several transcripts due to two start sites (exon 1 and exon 3). Studies have indicated that nonsense mutations may not result in loss of protein expression, as the truncated proteins remain expressed in patient cells (Prevatali et al., 2003 PMID:1335693). The molecular mechanism is predicted to be loss of phosphatase activity (reviewed in Raghu et al., 2019; PMID: 31507376; Tazir et al., 2013; PMID: 23781959). In summary, MTMR2 is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal recessive demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
