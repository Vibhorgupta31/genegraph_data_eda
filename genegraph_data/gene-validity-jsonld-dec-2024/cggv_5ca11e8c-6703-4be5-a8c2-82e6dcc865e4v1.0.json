In order to better characterize the phenotypic spectrum associated with FGF3 mutations, we sequenced the FGF3 gene in 10 unrelated families in which probands had congenital deafness associated with various inner ear anomalies, including Michel aplasia, with or without tooth or external ear anomalies. FGF3 sequence changes were not found in eight unrelated probands with isolated inner ear anomalies or with a cochlear malformation along with auricle and tooth anomalies. We identified two new homozygous FGF3 mutations, p.Leu6Pro (c.17T>C) and p. Ile85MetfsX15 (c.254delT), in four subjects from two unrelated families with LAMM. The p.Leu6Pro mutation occurred within the signal site of FGF3 and is predicted to impair its secretion. The c.254delT mutation results in truncation of FGF3. Both mutations completely co-segregated with the phenotype, and heterozygotes did not have any of the phenotypic findings of LAMM. Some affected children had large skin tags on the upper side of the auricles, which is a distinctive clinical component of the syndrome. Enlarged collateral emissary veins associated with stenosis of the jugular foramen were noted on computerized tomographies of most affected subjects with FGF3 mutations. However, similar venous anomalies were also detected in persons with non-syndromic Michel aplasia, suggesting that a direct causative role of impaired FGF3 signaling is unlikely.","dc:creator":"Tekin M","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Homozygous FGF3 mutations result in congenital deafness with inner ear agenesis, microtia, and microdontia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18435799","rdfs:label":"Family 1 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD.

To interrogate these roles and identify new effectors of FGF3 and FGF10 signaling at the earliest stages of otic morphogenesis, we used conditional gene ablation after otic placode induction, and temporal inhibition of signaling with a secreted, dominant-negative FGFR2b ectodomain. We show that both ligands are required continuously after otocyst formation for maintenance of otic neuroblasts and for patterning and proliferation of the epithelium, leading to normal morphogenesis of both the cochlear and vestibular domains.

The developing otic epithelium gives rise to neurosensory and non-sensory elements of the adult membranous labyrinth. Extrinsic and intrinsic signals manage the patterning and cell specification of the developing otic epithelium by establishing lineage-restricted compartments defined in turn by differential expression of regulatory genes. FGF3 and FGF16 are excellent candidates to govern these developmental events. Using the chick inner ear, we show that Fgf3 expression is present in the borders of all developing cristae. Strong Fgf16 expression was detected in a portion of the developing vertical and horizontal pouches, whereas the cristae show weaker or undetected Fgf16 expression at different developmental stages. Concerning the rest of the vestibular sensory elements, both the utricular and saccular maculae were Fgf3 positive. Interestingly, strong Fgf16 expression delimited these Fgf16-negative sensory patches. The Fgf3-negative macula neglecta and the Fgf3-positive macula lagena were included within weakly Fgf16-expressing areas. Therefore, different FGF-mediated mechanisms might regulate the specification of the anterior (utricular and saccular) and posterior (neglecta and lagena) maculae. In the developing cochlear duct, dynamic Fgf3 and Fgf16 expression suggests their cooperation in the early specification and later cell differentiation in the hearing system. The requirement of Fgf3 and Fgf16 genes in endolymphatic apparatus development and neurogenesis are discussed. Based on these observations, FGF3 and FGF16 seem to be key signaling pathways that control the inner ear plan by defining epithelial identities within the developing otic epithelium.","dc:creator":"Olaya-Sánchez D","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Fgf3 and Fgf16 expression patterns define spatial and temporal domains in the developing chick inner ear."},"rdfs:label":"Chick Embryo Expression Map"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"upgraded for thorough expression study"},{"id":"cggv:7e3df6ac-3ed7-4100-846d-100c775376ff","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ea6e5ff-014a-47f9-8a88-dd2b9d5bffea","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"combined FGF10/FGF3 exposure to hiPSCs induces conversion to otic/placodal progenitor cells","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29902227","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The inner ear represents a promising system to develop cell-based therapies from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In the developing ear, Notch signaling plays multiple roles in otic region specification and for cell fate determination. Optimizing hiPSC induction for the generation of appropriate numbers of otic progenitors and derivatives, such as hair cells, may provide an unlimited supply of cells for research and cell-based therapy. In this study, we used monolayer cultures, otic-inducing agents, Notch modulation, and marker expression to track early and otic sensory lineages during hiPSC differentiation. Otic/placodal progenitors were derived from hiPSC cultures in medium supplemented with FGF3/FGF10 for 13 days. These progenitor cells were then treated for 7 days with retinoic acid (RA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) or a Notch inhibitor. The differentiated cultures were analyzed in parallel by qPCR and immunocytochemistry. After the 13 day induction, hiPSC-derived cells displayed an upregulated expression of a panel of otic/placodal markers. Strikingly, a subset of these induced progenitor cells displayed key-otic sensory markers, the percentage of which was increased in cultures under Notch inhibition as compared to RA/EGF-treated cultures. Our results show that modulating Notch pathway during in vitro differentiation of hiPSC-derived otic/placodal progenitors is a valuable strategy to promote the expression of human otic sensory lineage genes.","dc:creator":"Lahlou H","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Modeling human early otic sensory cell development with induced pluripotent stem cells."},"rdfs:label":"Lahlou Biochemical Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5ca11e8c-6703-4be5-a8c2-82e6dcc865e4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5930f0db-2410-422d-ac4f-c0a511c53d3a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9ad4031-4c50-45dd-ada8-54bebd2fe520","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"crossing of fgf3-null hets. resulted in mendelian expected ratio of embryos.

At least 11 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs 21480479, 21306635, 18435799, 17236138, 21306635, 18701883). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 41 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease appears to be homozygous loss of function based on the variants observed in patients. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs 8223243, 26995070, 29902227, 30504125). In summary, FGF3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive deafness with LAMM syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
