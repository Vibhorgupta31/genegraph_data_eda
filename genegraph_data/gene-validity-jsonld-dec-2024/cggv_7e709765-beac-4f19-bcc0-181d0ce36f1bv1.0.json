We previously described a male infant who was born to consanguineous parents and who presented with severe congenital encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, and lactic acidosis associated with deficiencies of multiple mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymes and defective mitochondrial translation. In this work, we have characterized four additional affected family members, performed homozygosity mapping, and identified a homozygous splicing mutation in the splice donor site of exon 2 (c.504+1G>A) of RMND1 (required for meiotic nuclear division-1) in the affected individuals. Fibroblasts from affected individuals expressed two aberrant transcripts and had decreased wild-type mRNA and deficiencies of mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymes. The RMND1 mutation caused haploinsufficiency that was rescued by overexpression of the wild-type transcript in mutant fibroblasts; this overexpression increased the levels and activities of mitochondrial respiratory-chain proteins. Knockdown of RMND1 via shRNA recapitulated the biochemical defect of the mutant fibroblasts, further supporting a loss-of-function pathomechanism in this disease. RMND1 belongs to the sif2 family, an evolutionary conserved group of proteins that share the DUF155 domain, have unknown function, and have never been associated with human disease. We documented that the protein localizes to mitochondria in mammalian and yeast cells. Further studies are necessary for understanding the function of this protein in mitochondrial protein translation.","dc:creator":"Garcia-Diaz B","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Infantile encephaloneuromyopathy and defective mitochondrial translation are due to a homozygous RMND1 mutation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a752e341-235b-4f5c-be28-c95659484eca","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4ebd7c0f-9dbb-46ad-9665-c28aaf2dbd46","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The evidence shows the role of RMND1 in mitochondrial protein translation and thereby its role in mitochondrial function.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25604853","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"RMND1 is an integral inner membrane mitochondrial protein that assembles into a large 240 kDa complex to support translation of the 13 polypeptides encoded on mtDNA, all of which are essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. Variants in RMND1 produce global defects in mitochondrial translation and were first reported in patients with severe neurological phenotypes leading to mortality in the first months of life. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous RMND1 variants in a 4-year-old patient with congenital lactic acidosis, severe myopathy, hearing loss, renal failure, and dysautonomia. The levels of mitochondrial ribosome proteins were reduced in patient fibroblasts, causing a translation defect, which was rescued by expression of the wild-type cDNA. RMND1 was almost undetectable by immunoblot analysis in patient muscle and fibroblasts. BN-PAGE analysis showed a severe combined OXPHOS assembly defect that was more prominent in patient muscle than in fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that RMND1 localizes to discrete foci in the mitochondrial network, juxtaposed to RNA granules where the primary mitochondrial transcripts are processed. RMND1 foci were not detected in patient fibroblasts. We hypothesize that RMND1 acts to anchor or stabilize the mitochondrial ribosome near the sites where the mRNAs are matured, spatially coupling post-transcriptional handling mRNAs with their translation, and that loss of function variants in RMND1 are associated with a unique constellation of clinical phenotypes that vary with the severity of the mitochondrial translation defect.

relationship between *RMND1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September 7, 2022.The *RMND1* gene encodes required for meiotic nuclear division 1 homolog, which functions in mitochondrial translation. \n\nThe *RMND1* gene was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2012 (PMID 23022099). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *RMND1*-related disease, including autosomal recessive combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 11 (MIM 614922), pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *RMND1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique variants (two missense, two frameshift, two consensus splice-site, one stop-gained and one extension variant) from six cases across four publications (PMIDs: 23022099, 25058219, 26395190, 27412952). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function to anchor or stabilize the mitochondrial ribosome near the sites of mRNA maturation, shRNA knockdown of RMND1 in HeLa cells showed significantly decreased complex I, III and IV activities and diminished mitochondrial protein synthesis (PMIDs: 23022099, 25604853). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *RMND1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 7, 2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
