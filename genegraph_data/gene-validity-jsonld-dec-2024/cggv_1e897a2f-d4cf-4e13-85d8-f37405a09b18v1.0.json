In our study, deafness segregating as a recessive trait in 24 consanguineous families showed linkage to markers for the DFNB2/USH1B locus on chromosome 11q13.5. A total of 23 of these families segregate USH1 due to 17 homozygous mutant MYO7A alleles, of which 14 are novel. One family segregated nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNB2 due to a novel three-nucleotide deletion in an exon of MYO7A (p.E1716del) encoding a region of the tail domain. We hypothesized that DFNB2 alleles of MYO7A have residual myosin VIIA. To address this question we investigated the effects of several mutant alleles by making green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged cDNA expression constructs containing engineered mutations of mouse Myo7a at codons equivalent to pathogenic USH1B and DFNB2 alleles of human MYO7A. We show that in transfected mouse hair cells an USH1B mutant GFP-myosin VIIa does not localize properly to inner ear hair cell stereocilia. However, a GFP-myosin VIIa protein engineered to have an equivalent DFNB2 mutation to p.E1716del localizes correctly in transfected mouse hair cells. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that p.E1716del causes a less severe phenotype (DFNB2) than the USH1B-associated alleles because the resulting protein retains some degree of normal function.","dc:creator":"Riazuddin S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Mutation spectrum of MYO7A and evaluation of a novel nonsyndromic deafness DFNB2 allele with residual function."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18181211","rdfs:label":"PKDF008"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4783f320-98de-449d-9ee2-b5e81f37f895_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0d27a3c9-f203-4677-a841-b9bdf9555d5c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":20,"detectionMethod":"Haplotype analysis of MYO7A, CDH23, PCDH15, USH1C, USH1G and CIB2.

Eight zebrafish circler or auditory/vestibular mutants appear to have defects specific to sensory hair cell function. The circler genes may therefore encode components of the mechanotransduction apparatus and/or be the orthologous counterparts of the genes underlying human hereditary deafness. In this report, we show that the phenotype of the circler mutant, mariner, is due to mutations in the gene encoding Myosin VIIA, an unconventional myosin which is expressed in sensory hair cells and is responsible for various types of hearing disorder in humans, namely Usher 1B syndrome, DFNB2 and DFNA11. Our analysis of the fine structure of hair bundles in the mariner mutants suggests that a missense mutation within the C-terminal FERM domain of the tail of Myosin VIIA has the potential to dissociate the two different functions of the protein in hair bundle integrity and apical endocytosis. Notably, mariner sensory hair cells display morphological and functional defects that are similar to those present in mouse shaker-1 hair cells which are defective in Myosin VIIA. Thus, this study demonstrates the striking conservation of the function of Myosin VIIA throughout vertebrate evolution and establishes mariner as the first fish model for human hereditary deafness.","dc:creator":"Ernest S","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mariner is defective in myosin VIIA: a zebrafish model for human hereditary deafness."},"rdfs:label":"Ernest Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because the model is non-mammalian and there was no replicate retinal phenotype"},{"id":"cggv:e48eb9dc-ee44-4b8d-9f1f-1aeec3d3c200","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5efe603-3693-44cb-ac1e-6b7280043fec","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Shaker-1 homozygous mice have hyperactivity, head-tossing and circling as well as progressive degeneration of organ of Corti.

Many of these show primary abnormalities of the sensory neuroepithelia of the inner ear, as do several hearing-impaired mouse mutants, suggesting that genes involved in sensory transduction could be affected. Here we report the identification of one such gene, the mouse shaker-1 (sh1) gene. Shaker-1 homozygotes show hyperactivity, head-tossing and circling due to vestibular dysfunction, together with typical neuroepithelial-type cochlear defects involving dysfunction and progressive degeneration of the organ of Corti. The sh1 gene encodes an unconventional myosin molecule of the type VII family. Three mutations are described, two mis-sense mutations and a splice acceptor site mutation, all in the region encoding the myosin head. The myosin type VII molecule encoded by sh1 is the first molecule to be identified that is known, by virtue of its mutations, to be involved in auditory transduction.","dc:creator":"Gibson F","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"A type VII myosin encoded by the mouse deafness gene shaker-1."},"rdfs:label":"Gibson Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded for lack of retinal phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":456,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3cd85cc6-c487-4464-9c20-7dbd7a513ed2","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010168","gene":"hgnc:7606","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The MYO7A gene has been associated with autosomal recessive Usher syndrome type 1 using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 6/28/2018. This association was made using case-level data only. At least 9 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) have been reported in humans. MYO7A was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1995 (Weil et al.). Association is seen in at least 8 probands in 3 publications (23559863, 18181211, 25211151). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been assessed separately. This gene-disease association is supported by relevant expression studies, protein interaction studies, and animal models that replicate the hearing loss phenotype. In summary, MYO7A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Usher syndrome type 1.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/28/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1e897a2f-d4cf-4e13-85d8-f37405a09b18"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
