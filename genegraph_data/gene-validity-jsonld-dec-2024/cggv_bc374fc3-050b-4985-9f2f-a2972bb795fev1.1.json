Although in research settings NGS has pinpointed causal alleles using segregation in large families, the key challenge for clinical diagnosis is application to single individuals. To explore its diagnostic use, we performed targeted NGS in 42 unrelated infants with clinical and biochemical evidence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disease. These devastating mitochondrial disorders are characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, with more than 100 causal genes identified to date. We performed \"MitoExome\" sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and exons of ~1000 nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and prioritized rare mutations predicted to disrupt function. Because patients and healthy control individuals harbored a comparable number of such heterozygous alleles, we could not prioritize dominant-acting genes. However, patients showed a fivefold enrichment of genes with two such mutations that could underlie recessive disease. In total, 23 of 42 (55%) patients harbored such recessive genes or pathogenic mtDNA variants. Firm diagnoses were enabled in 10 patients (24%) who had mutations in genes previously linked to disease. Thirteen patients (31%) had mutations in nuclear genes not previously linked to disease. The pathogenicity of two such genes, NDUFB3 and AGK, was supported by complementation studies and evidence from multiple patients, respectively. The results underscore the potential and challenges of deploying NGS in clinical settings.","dc:creator":"Calvo SE","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Molecular diagnosis of infantile mitochondrial disease with targeted next-generation sequencing."}},"rdfs:label":"P17"},{"id":"cggv:742619ce-a7a3-4907-bd49-ceb519737150","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:742619ce-a7a3-4907-bd49-ceb519737150_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:742619ce-a7a3-4907-bd49-ceb519737150_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 + 0.4 (Protein blot analysis showed a complete absence of COX6B1 protein in both the patient’s muscle and fibroblasts;

The *COX6B1* gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) subunit 6B1. Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\nThe *COX6B1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18499082). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX6B1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX6B1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three unique variants, each present in the homozygous state in three cases from three publications (PMIDs: 18499082, 22277967, 24781756). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 18499082, 24781756, 34937540). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 21, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bc374fc3-050b-4985-9f2f-a2972bb795fe"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
