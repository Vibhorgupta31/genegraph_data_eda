Null mutants of each are inviable. We demonstrate here that hypomorphic Rad50 mutant mice (Rad50(S/S) mice) exhibited growth defects and cancer predisposition. Rad50(S/S) mice died with complete bone marrow depletion as a result of progressive hematopoietic stem cell failure. Similar attrition occurred in spermatogenic cells. In both contexts, attrition was substantially mitigated by p53 deficiency, whereas the tumor latency of p53(-/-) and p53(+/-) animals was reduced by Rad50(S/S). Indices of genotoxic stress and chromosomal rearrangements were evident in Rad50(S/S) cultured cells, as well as in Rad50(S/S) and p53(-/-) Rad50(S/S) lymphomas, suggesting that the Rad50(S/S) phenotype was attributable to chromosomal instability. These outcomes were not associated with overt defects in the Mre11 complex's previously established double strand break repair and cell cycle checkpoint regulation functions. The data indicate that even subtle perturbation of Mre11 complex functions results in severe genotoxic stress, and that the complex is critically important for homeostasis of proliferative tissues.","dc:creator":"Bender CF","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Cancer predisposition and hematopoietic failure in Rad50(S/S) mice."},"rdfs:label":"RAD50S/S"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No ovarian cancer seen in the mouse model"},{"id":"cggv:53f9be05-1668-4d9b-9c16-c2483917f746","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:983c18ed-ea68-4198-a580-576f6d91e4d9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Histology was examined of thyroid ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37098078","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The MRE11A-RAD50-NBS1 complex activates the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway and plays a central role in genome homeostasis. The association of RAD50 mutations with disease remains unclear; hence, we adopted a medaka rad50 mutant to demonstrate the significance of RAD50 mutation in pathogenesis using the medaka as an experimental animal. A 2-base pair deletion in the rad50 gene was introduced into transparent STIII medaka using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The mutant was analyzed histologically for tumorigenicity and hindbrain quality, as well as for swimming behavior, to compare with existing ATM-, MRE11A-, and NBS1-mutation-related pathology. Our results revealed that the medaka rad50 mutation concurrently reproduced tumorigenesis (8 out of 10 rad50Δ2/+ medaka), had a decrease in median survival time (65.7 ± 1.1 weeks in control vs. 54.2 ± 2.6 weeks in rad50Δ2/+ medaka, p = 0.001, Welch's t-test), exhibited semi-lethality in rad50Δ2/Δ2 medaka and most of the major ataxia-telangiectasia phenotypes, including ataxia (rheotaxis ability was lower in rad50Δ2/+ medaka than in the control, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05), and telangiectasia (6 out of 10 rad50Δ2/+ medaka).

It plays key roles in DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) repairs, which are crucial to safeguarding genome integrity and sustaining tumor suppression.  Biallelic RAD50 mutations are also associated with Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like disorder (autosomal recessive). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we only focus on autosomal dominant hereditary ovarian cancer (refute the association with ovarian cancer) in this curation. Evidence refuting this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data (0 Point) and experimental data (0 Point). This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 2 large case-control studies at the aggregate variant level (PMID: 28888541, 31406321). Both case-control studies did not support the association of ovarian cancer. Several case level studies were also found, in which individuals with ovarian cancer were tested by multigene panels that included RAD50. One pathogenic variant was identified in RAD50 gene out of 360 women with ovarian cancer (PMID: 22006311), while most studies did not identify pathogenic variants in the RAD50 gene (PMID: 29020732, 36531003, 31472684). A study on a mouse homozygous for a hypomorphic RAD50 allele (pLys22Met) resulted in ~20% of mice died with metastatic thymic lymphoma, splenic hyperplasia or myeloid leukemia. However, these mice did not develop ovarian cancer. (0 point, PMID: 12208847). Another study showed tumorigenesis in  RAD50 mutant medaka, but it was not seen in the ovaries (PMID: 37098078). In summary, given the lack of significant association in large case-control studies and a number of ovarian cancer cohort studies not finding an association with RAD50 there is convincing evidence refuting the association between RAD50 and autosomal dominant hereditary ovarian cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 10/26/2016. This re-curation was approved as refuted by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 2/23/2024 (SOP Version 10). \nGiven the lack of significant association in large case-control studies and a number of ovarian cancer cohort studies not finding an association with RAD50 there is convincing evidence refuting the association between RAD50 and autosomal dominant hereditary ovarian cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.
