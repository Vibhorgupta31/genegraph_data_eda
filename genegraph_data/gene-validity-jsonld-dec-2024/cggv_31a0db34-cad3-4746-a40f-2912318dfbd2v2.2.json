In animal models, POPDC1 is an essential regulator of structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle; however, POPDC1 mutations have not been associated with human cardiac and muscular diseases. Here, we have described a homozygous missense variant (c.602C>T, p.S201F) in POPDC1, identified by whole-exome sequencing, in a family of 4 with cardiac arrhythmia and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). This allele was absent in known databases and segregated with the pathological phenotype in this family. We did not find the allele in a further screen of 104 patients with a similar phenotype, suggesting this mutation to be family specific. Compared with WT protein, POPDC1(S201F) displayed a 50% reduction in cAMP affinity, and in skeletal muscle from patients, both POPDC1(S201F) and WT POPDC2 displayed impaired membrane trafficking. Forced expression of POPDC1(S201F) in a murine cardiac muscle cell line (HL-1) increased hyperpolarization and upstroke velocity of the action potential. In zebrafish, expression of the homologous mutation (popdc1(S191F)) caused heart and skeletal muscle phenotypes that resembled those observed in patients. Our study therefore identifies POPDC1 as a disease gene causing a very rare autosomal recessive cardiac arrhythmia and LGMD, expanding the genetic causes of this heterogeneous group of inherited rare diseases.","dc:creator":"Schindler RF","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"POPDC1(S201F) causes muscular dystrophy and arrhythmia by affecting protein trafficking."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31a0db34-cad3-4746-a40f-2912318dfbd2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31a0db34-cad3-4746-a40f-2912318dfbd2_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:803187f5-023e-42cf-9a0b-2d205444e0f9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5bc73a15-3702-4235-ac72-b430c28f716f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Frozen sections of mouse myocardial tissue were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies directed against POPDC1 and, as a marker of ventricular conduction tissue.

Three genes of the Popeye (POP) family were detected in human and mouse and two in chicken. Chromosomal mapping indicates that Pop1 and Pop3 genes are clustered on mouse chromosome 10, whereas Pop2 maps to mouse chromosome 16. We found evidence that POP1 and POP3 in chicken may also be linked and multiple transcript isoforms are generated from this locus. The POP genes encode proteins with three potential transmembrane domains that are conserved in all family members. Individual POP genes exhibit specific expression patterns during development and postnatally. Chicken POP3 and mouse Pop1 are first preferentially expressed in atrium and later also in the subepicardial compact layer of the ventricles. Chicken POP1 and mouse Pop2 are expressed in the entire heart except the outflow tract. All three Pop genes are expressed in heart and skeletal muscle of the adult mouse and lower in lung. Pop1 and Pop2 expression is upregulated in uterus of pregnant mice. Like the mouse genes, human POP genes are predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The strong conservation of POP genes during evolution and their preferential expression in heart and skeletal muscle suggest that these novel proteins may have an important function in these tissues in vertebrates.","dc:creator":"Andrée B","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Isolation and characterization of the novel popeye gene family expressed in skeletal muscle and heart."},"rdfs:label":"Tissue Distribution of POPDC transcripts in the adult"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:17d74921-8c3d-4f0d-a322-85d9031f66f6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2da3bce0-9f73-45f7-bc03-79da1a67a27d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"IHC  staining in patient and control muscle samples was performed to examine POPDC1 and POPDC2 at the plasma membrane.

We report on four affected children (age 7-19 years) from two consanguineous families with two novel pathogenic variants in BVES c.457C>T(p.Q153X) and c.578T>G (p.I193S). Detailed analyses were performed on muscle biopsies from an affected patient of each family including immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and proteomic profiling. Cardiac abnormalities were present in all patients and serum creatine kinase (CK) values were variably elevated despite lack of overt muscle weakness. Detailed histological analysis of skeletal muscle, however indicated a myopathy with reduced sarcolemmal expression of POPDC1 accompanied by altered sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmatic dysferlin and Xin/XIRP1 abundance. At the electron microscopic level, the muscle fiber membrane was focally disrupted. The proteomic signature showed statistically significant dysregulation of 191 proteins of which 173 were increased and 18 were decreased. Gene ontology-term analysis of affected biological processes revealed - among others - perturbation of muscle fibril assembly, myofilament sliding, and contraction as well as transition between fast and slow fibers. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the phenotype of LGMDR25 is highly variable and also includes younger children with conduction abnormalities, no apparent muscular problems, and only mildly elevated CK values.

It is an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein with a molecular function in the establishment and/or maintenance of cell integrity. It is expressed in the cardiac and the skeletal muscle and plays an important role in the development and the maintenance of these tissues. POPDC1*BVES* is associated with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (type 2X  included), where the main clinical features are slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness in lower limbs, usually associated with cardiac disturbances including arrhythmia. *BVES* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2X by Schindler et al. in 2016 (PMID: 26642364), who provided one of the most complete clinical and molecular descriptions with functional studies. More than 70 variants have been identified in *BVES* POPDC1 but only around 49 with clinical significance are assumed to cause LGMD2X. ClinVar reports at least 10 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in *BVES*. Summary of Case Level Data (12 points): Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 26642364, 31119192, 33310206, 35660068, 35718670). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. Functional studies showed that mutant variants lead to important reduction of POPDC1 protein in cAMP affinity in skeletal muscle from patients in addition to impaired membrane trafficking. A certain clinical variability was noted, within the same family and among unrelated individuals. This variability relates to the age of onset of the disease within the same family (PMID:26642364, PMID:31119192), the severity of the phenotype and the progression of the disease (PMID:33310206). Individuals with nonsense variants leading to premature truncation of the protein product appear to display a more severe phenotype (PMID: 33310206). Summary of experimental data (2 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by limited experimental evidence. Expression studies showed that POPDC1 is prominently expressed in the sarcolemma in healthy muscle fibers, while in affected muscles, a significant reduction in membrane localization of both POPDC1 and POPDC2 was observed (PMID: 10882522, 27347491, 31119192). In summary, *BVES* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2X. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:31a0db34-cad3-4746-a40f-2912318dfbd2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
