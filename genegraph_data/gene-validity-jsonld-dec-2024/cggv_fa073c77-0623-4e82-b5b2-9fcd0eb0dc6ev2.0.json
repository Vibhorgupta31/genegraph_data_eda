We have isolated a human PEX19 cDNA (HsPEX19) by functional complementation of peroxisome deficiency of a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, ZP119, defective in import of both matrix and membrane proteins. This cDNA encodes a hydrophilic protein (Pex19p) comprising 299 amino acids, with a prenylation motif, CAAX box, at the C terminus. Farnesylated Pex19p is partly, if not all, anchored in the peroxisomal membrane, exposing its N-terminal part to the cytosol. A stable transformant of ZP119 with HsPEX19 was morphologically and biochemically restored for peroxisome biogenesis. HsPEX19 expression also restored peroxisomal protein import in fibroblasts from a patient (PBDJ-01) with Zellweger syndrome of CG-J. This patient (PBDJ-01) possessed a homozygous, inactivating mutation: a 1-base insertion, A764, in a codon for Met255, resulted in a frameshift, inducing a 24-aa sequence entirely distinct from normal Pex19p. These results demonstrate that PEX19 is the causative gene for CG-J PBD and suggest that the C-terminal part, including the CAAX homology box, is required for the biological function of Pex19p. Moreover, Pex19p is apparently involved at the initial stage in peroxisome membrane assembly, before the import of matrix protein.","dc:creator":"Matsuzono Y","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Human PEX19: cDNA cloning by functional complementation, mutation analysis in a patient with Zellweger syndrome, and potential role in peroxisomal membrane assembly."}},"rdfs:label":"Matsuzono_PBDJ-01"},{"id":"cggv:b131c186-ebc2-4b8b-bbac-19f5cb58aa9d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b131c186-ebc2-4b8b-bbac-19f5cb58aa9d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b131c186-ebc2-4b8b-bbac-19f5cb58aa9d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The authors note that back transfection of the variant cDNA to patient fibroblasts as well as PEX-19 CHO-cell mutant did not restore peroxisome biosynthesis, indicating that the variant is inactivating."}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for 1-bp duplication towards the end of exon 6.

In this study, we describe the largest Arab cohort to date (72 families) of clinically, biochemically and molecularly characterized patients with peroxisomal disorders. At the molecular level, we identified 43 disease-causing variants, half of which are novel. The founder nature of many of the variants allowed us to calculate the minimum disease burden for these disorders in our population ~1:30 000, which is much higher than previous estimates in other populations. Clinically, we found an interesting trend toward genotype/phenotype correlation in terms of long-term survival. Nearly half (40/75) of our peroxisomal disorders patients had documented survival beyond 1 year of age. Most unusual among the long-term survivors was a multiplex family in which the affected members presented as adults with non-specific intellectual disability and epilepsy.

However, with the exception of the peroxisome-targeting signal receptors and the receptor docking proteins, the function of most of these proteins, called peroxins, remains largely unknown. One step toward elucidating the function of a protein is to identify its interacting partners. We have used a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid system to analyze the interactions among a set of 12 mammalian peroxins and a yeast protein three-hybrid system to investigate whether proteins that interact with the same peroxin and have overlapping binding sites cooperate or compete for this site. Here we report a detailed interaction map of these peroxins and demonstrate that (i) farnesylation, and not the CAAX motif, of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex13p; (ii) the CAAXmotif, and not farnesylation, of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex11pbeta; and (iii) the C(3)HC(4) RING (really interesting new gene) finger domain of Pex12p does not alter the binding properties of Pex5p for the C-terminal peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1. Finally, we show that the Pex5p-Pex13p interaction is bridged by Pex14p and that the latter molecule exists predominantly as a dimer in vivo. Collectively, as demonstrated in this work with peroxins, these results indicate that the bacterial two-hybrid system is an attractive complementary approach to the conventional transcription-based yeast two-hybrid system for studying protein-protein interactions.","dc:creator":"Fransen M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Analysis of mammalian peroxin interactions using a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid assay."},"rdfs:label":"Fransen_PEX19 interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The evidence is scored increased points for interaction with 4 other PEX genes."},{"id":"cggv:3f1c5269-b044-4046-a0f0-fc9ebd32eddf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d752eba4-8ab4-42e8-9f62-45469085b1a0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"PEX3, PEX16 and PEX19 are involved in early peroxisomal biogenesis with the transport and incorporation of peroxisomal membrane proteins.

Thirteen of these genes are associated with ZSS disorders. The genetic heterogeneity among PBDs and the inability to predict from the biochemical and clinical phenotype of a patient with ZSS which of the currently known 13 PEX genes is defective, has fostered the development of different strategies to identify the causative gene defects. These include PEX cDNA transfection complementation assays followed by sequencing of the thus identified PEX genes, and a PEX gene screen in which the most frequently mutated exons of the different PEX genes are analyzed. The benefits of DNA testing for PBDs include carrier testing of relatives, early prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis in families with a recurrence risk for ZSS disorders, and insight in genotype-phenotype correlations, which may eventually assist to improve patient management.

We also demonstrate the relevance of Drosophila as a genetic model for the early developmental defects associated with the human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Mutation of the PEX1 gene is the most common cause of peroxisome biogenesis disorders and is one of the causes of the most severe form of the disease, Zellweger syndrome. Inherited mutations in Drosophila Pex1 correlate with reproducible defects during early development. Notably, Pex1 mutant larvae exhibit abnormalities that are analogous to those exhibited by Zellweger syndrome patients, including developmental delay, poor feeding, severe structural abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems, and early death. Finally, microarray analysis defined several clusters of genes whose expression varied significantly between wild-type and mutant larvae, implicating peroxisomal function in neuronal development, innate immunity, lipid and protein metabolism, gamete formation, and meiosis.","dc:creator":"Mast FD","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A Drosophila model for the Zellweger spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders."},"rdfs:label":"Mast_S2 cells function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:fa073c77-0623-4e82-b5b2-9fcd0eb0dc6e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d30268f-57f3-4466-a059-bea276209e5f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbd7a14e-429c-427a-8a86-fc2dcee3aa26","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Yeast cells expressing wild-type Pex19 showed normal peroxisome size.

Pex19 plays multiple roles in these processes, but how these functions relate to the structural organization of the Pex19 domains is unresolved. To this end, using deletion mutants, we mapped the Pex19 regions required for peroxisome biogenesis in the yeast Pichia pastoris Surprisingly, import-competent peroxisomes still formed when Pex19 domains previously believed to be required for biogenesis were deleted, although the peroxisome size was larger than that in wild-type cells. Moreover, these mutants exhibited a delay of 14-24 h in peroxisome biogenesis. The shortest functional N-terminal (NTCs) and C-terminal constructs (CTCs) were Pex19 (aa 1-150) and Pex19 (aa 89-300), respectively. Deletions of the N-terminal Pex3-binding site disrupted the direct interactions of Pex19 with Pex3, but preserved interactions with a membrane peroxisomal targeting signal (mPTS)-containing PMP, Pex10. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal mPTS-binding domain of Pex19 disrupted its interaction with Pex10 while leaving the Pex19-Pex3 interactions intact. However, Pex11 and Pex25 retained their interactions with both N- and C-terminal deletion mutants. NTC-CTC co-expression improved growth and reversed the larger-than-normal peroxisome size observed with the single deletions. Pex25 was critical for peroxisome formation with the CTC variants, and its overexpression enhanced their interactions with Pex3 and aided the growth of both NTC and CTC Pex19 variants. In conclusion, physical segregation of the Pex3- and PMP-binding domains of Pex19 has provided novel insights into the modular architecture of Pex19. We define the minimum region of Pex19 required for peroxisome biogenesis and a unique role for Pex25 in this process.","dc:creator":"Agrawal G","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Functional regions of the peroxin Pex19 necessary for peroxisome biogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Agrawal_FA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The evidence is awarded increased points as it shows that loss of N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the gene can impact peroxisome biogenesis."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:fa073c77-0623-4e82-b5b2-9fcd0eb0dc6e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64fc820f-7639-47af-bf8c-abbcb5f415d9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c49c6e6d-d0a1-4b20-87b2-66517ad207a4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Cells stained with antibodies to catalase showed positive staining, demonstrating rescue of peroxisome formation.

PEX19 encodes a peroxisome membrane protein involved in early peroxisome membrane biosynthesis prior to matrix protein import. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by defects in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or peroxisome biogenesis, involving at least 14 PEX genes. PEX19 belongs to complementation group J and mutations in the gene result in cells devoid of peroxisomal remnants (Waterham and Ebberink 2012, PMID 22871920) or with a small number of enlarged peroxisomes (Ebberink et al, 2010, PMID 20647552).\n\nPEX19 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder in 1999. (Matsuzono et al, PMID: 10051604). At least 3 nonsense or frameshift variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 10051604, 20683989, 21031596, 30561787, 36931687). Variants in this gene segregated with 4 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (4 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays (PMIDs 21669930, 28526747, 12096124, 10051604). PEX19 interacts with PEX3, PEX11B and PEX16. \n  \nIn summary, the PEX19-peroxisome biogenesis disorder gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
