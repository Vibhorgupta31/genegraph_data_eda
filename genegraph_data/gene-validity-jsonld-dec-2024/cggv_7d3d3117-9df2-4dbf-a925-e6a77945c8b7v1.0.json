To identify additional breast cancer susceptibility genes, we used the founder population of Poland and performed whole-exome sequencing on 510 women with familial breast cancer and 308 control subjects. We identified a rare mutation in ATRIP (GenBank: NM_130384.3: c.1152_1155del [p.Gly385Ter]) in two women with breast cancer. At the validation phase, we found this variant in 42/16,085 unselected Polish breast cancer-affected individuals and in 11/9,285 control subjects (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.13-4.28, p = 0.02). By analyzing the sequence data of the UK Biobank study participants (450,000 individuals), we identified ATRIP loss-of-function variants among 13/15,643 breast cancer-affected individuals versus 40/157,943 control subjects (OR = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.76-6.14, p < 0.001). Immunohistochemistry and functional studies showed the ATRIP c.1152_1155del variant allele is weakly expressed compared to the wild-type allele, and truncated ATRIP fails to perform its normal function to prevent replicative stress. We showed that tumors of women with breast cancer who have a germline ATRIP mutation have loss of heterozygosity at the site of ATRIP mutation and genomic homologous recombination deficiency. ATRIP is a critical partner of ATR that binds to RPA coating single-stranded DNA at sites of stalled DNA replication forks. Proper activation of ATR-ATRIP elicits a DNA damage checkpoint crucial in regulating cellular responses to DNA replication stress. Based on our observations, we conclude ATRIP is a breast cancer susceptibility gene candidate linking DNA replication stress to breast cancer.","dc:creator":"Cybulski C","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Variants in ATRIP are associated with breast cancer susceptibility in the Polish population and UK Biobank."},"rdfs:label":"Cybulski case-control discovery phase"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3f8bb3d5-cb95-47b3-b6c8-7175d78035c3","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f8bb3d5-cb95-47b3-b6c8-7175d78035c3_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","caseCohort":{"id":"cggv:9454849a-e0f7-4988-abac-f40f3ec30c40","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":17944,"alleleFrequency":0.000780205082478823,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f8bb3d5-cb95-47b3-b6c8-7175d78035c3_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":14,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0016419"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"cggv:826b8378-00fa-4842-9b0f-b7108f9167a0","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":209337,"alleleFrequency":0.0004681446662558458,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f8bb3d5-cb95-47b3-b6c8-7175d78035c3_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":98},"lowerConfidenceLimit":1.22,"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.00399,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.88,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":2.89,"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37592023","rdfs:label":"Wilcox_Breast Cancer_Case-Control_UKB"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6f6c9de5-7ab2-4191-b00d-6b7f96e5a8c5","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f6c9de5-7ab2-4191-b00d-6b7f96e5a8c5_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","caseCohort":{"id":"cggv:c2fc8736-1c8c-445b-9401-9b126a4cdcaf","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":16085,"alleleFrequency":0.002611128380478707,"detectionMethod":"The genotyping was performed using TaqMan assay on ABI7500 Fast real-time system(ThermoFisherScientific).

Breast cancer (referring to mammary carcinoma) is histopathological and almost certainly etiologically and genetically heterogeneous. Familial occurrence has indicated important genetic factors (OMIM 114480). \nPer the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. One variant (*ATRIP*:c.1152_1155del) reported in breast cancer patients in one publication (PMID: 36977412) is included in this curation. \nMore evidence is available in the literature (Wilcox N, et al., PMID: 37592023), reported associations between protein-truncating variants in *ATRIP* and breast \ncancer (P < 1 × 10−4.). \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence from in vitro functional assays (PMID: 36977412). Immunohistochemistry and functional studies showed the *ATRIP* c.1152_1155del variant allele is weakly expressed compared to the wild-type allele, and truncated ATRIP fails to perform its normal function to prevent replicative stress.\nIn summary, limited evidence supports the relationship between *ATRIP* and autosomal dominant inheritance Breast cancer susceptibility. This relationship has been demonstrated in patients with monoallelic mutations in *ATRIP* (PMIDs: 36977412, 37592023).
