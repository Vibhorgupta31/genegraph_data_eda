Abnormalities in these evolutionarily conserved organelles cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Despite recent strides characterizing the ciliome and sensory ciliopathies through exploration of the phenotype-genotype associations in model organisms, the genetic bases of most cases of PCD remain elusive. We identified nine related subjects with PCD from geographically dispersed Amish communities and performed exome sequencing of two affected individuals and their unaffected parents. A single autosomal-recessive nonsynonymous missense mutation was identified in HEATR2, an uncharacterized gene that belongs to a family not previously associated with ciliary assembly or function. Airway epithelial cells isolated from PCD-affected individuals had markedly reduced HEATR2 levels, absent dynein arms, and loss of ciliary beating. MicroRNA-mediated silencing of the orthologous gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii resulted in absent outer dynein arms, reduced flagellar beat frequency, and decreased cell velocity. These findings were recapitulated by small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of HEATR2 in airway epithelial cells from unaffected donors. Moreover, immunohistochemistry studies in human airway epithelial cells showed that HEATR2 was localized to the cytoplasm and not in cilia, which suggests a role in either dynein arm transport or assembly. The identification of HEATR2 contributes to the growing number of genes associated with PCD identified in both individuals and model organisms and shows that exome sequencing in family studies facilitates the discovery of novel disease-causing gene mutations.","dc:creator":"Horani A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Whole-exome capture and sequencing identifies HEATR2 mutation as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a68a979-fd1d-455b-bf25-25760300a376","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a546c8a5-cf37-4bc8-82cd-8118ca5c6d05","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"DNAAF5 is highly expressed in the cytoplasm of control human ciliated cells but is absent in cilia.

In humans, defects specifically affecting motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, infertility and laterality defects in the genetically heterogeneous disorder Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Using the comparatively simple Drosophila system, in which mechanosensory neurons possess modified motile cilia, we employed a recently elucidated cilia transcriptional RFX-FOX code to identify novel PCD candidate genes. Here, we report characterization of CG31320/HEATR2, which plays a conserved critical role in forming the axonemal dynein arms required for ciliary motility in both flies and humans. Inner and outer arm dyneins are absent from axonemes of CG31320 mutant flies and from PCD individuals with a novel splice-acceptor HEATR2 mutation. Functional conservation of closely arranged RFX-FOX binding sites upstream of HEATR2 orthologues may drive higher cytoplasmic expression of HEATR2 during early motile ciliogenesis. Immunoprecipitation reveals HEATR2 interacts with DNAI2, but not HSP70 or HSP90, distinguishing it from the client/chaperone functions described for other cytoplasmic proteins required for dynein arm assembly such as DNAAF1-4.

Nonetheless, PCD diagnosis can be challenging due to the overlapping features with other disorders and the requirement for sophisticated tests that are only available in specialized centers. We performed exome sequencing on all patients with a clinical suspicion of PCD but for whom no nasal nitric oxide test or ciliary functional assessment could be ordered. Among 81 patients (56 families), in whom PCD was suspected, 68%Â had pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in established PCD-related genes that fully explain the phenotype (20 variants in 11 genes). The major clinical presentations were sinopulmonary infections (SPI) (nâ=â58), neonatal respiratory distress (NRD) (nâ=â2), laterality defect (LD) (nâ=â6), and combined LD/SPI (nâ=â15). Biallelic likely deleterious variants were also encountered in AKNA and GOLGA3, which we propose as novel candidates in a lung phenotype that overlaps clinically with PCD. We also encountered a PCD phenocopy caused by a pathogenic variant in ITCH, and a pathogenic variant in CEP164 causing Bardet-Biedl syndrome and PCD presentation as a very rare example of the dual presentation of these two disorders of the primary and motile cilia. Exome sequencing is a powerful tool that can help \"democratize\" the diagnosis of PCD, which is currently limited to highly specialized centers.","dc:creator":"Shamseldin HE","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"An exome-first approach to aid in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia."}},"rdfs:label":"Family 23 only cacse"},{"id":"cggv:8960bc28-fc2c-49eb-9133-1bc94ce941af","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8960bc28-fc2c-49eb-9133-1bc94ce941af_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downscoring because of homozygosity.

The PCD phenotype results from structural and/or functional abnormalities of motile cilia and flagella. Ciliary motility is powered by a set of axoneme-specific dynein motor complexes. The cytoplasmic assembly of these large multiprotein complexes before their transport into cilia is assisted by dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs). Mutations in genes encoding DNAAFs result in the improper cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein chains, causing defects in both inner (IDA) and outer dynein arms (ODA) that can result in cilia immotility (PMID: 31624012). Horani e tal. report a homozygous missense variant in 9 related individuals with suspected PCD from geographically dispersed Amish communities presenting with situs inversus totalis, neonatal respiratory distress, and bronchiectasis, amongst other PCD complications. Transmission electron microscopy of patient cilia showed absent inner and outer dynein arms. Diggle et al. (2014) report a second family with a homozygous splice donor variant. In this family, patients show classic PCD symptoms including neonatal respiratory distress, bronchiectasis and situs inversus totalis. Electron microscopy also revealed absence of both IDA and ODA.\nEvidence from 19 probands from 4 publications have been included in this curation representing 6 unique variants (2 missense, 1 splice donor and 3 frameshift). The mechanism of pathogenicity in DNAAF5 mutations appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterised in some cases by the absence of a gene product (PMID: 23040496). However, a C500F missense variant has been described as a mild variant, shown to retain some function. With the available evidence, we reached 9.2 points for the genetic evidence of this curation. All probands scored in this curation harboured two variant alleles within the DNAAF5 locus.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as localisation to the cytoplasm and expression during early ciliogenesis in control human respiratory cilia (PMID: 23040496, 25232951). DNAAF5 is highly expressed in developing multiple motile cilia where ODA and IDA components are predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas lower levels of DNAAF5 are observed in fully mature multiple motile cilia where ODA and IDA components are exclusively axonemal, demonstrating a role in ODA and IDA assembly. In addition, functional studies performed on human tracheal epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) have shown that DNAAF5 has a role in an early phase of expression of preassembly proteins, along with SPAG1 and DNAAF2. This phase is independent of MCIDAS regulation and precedes the expression of FOXJ1 (PMID: 29358401). An shRNA lentiviral knock-down model in human tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells shows that DNAAF5 results in an absence of ODA and absent or truncated IDA, as well as impaired ciliary motility (PMID: 23040496). Lastly, there are animal models that support this gene-disease evidence, including a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii knock-down model which results in absent ODA and IDA, and a reduced ciliary beat frequency to 41% of wild-type (PMID: 23040496), a mouse model showing hydrocephaly, early lethality, absence of ODA and IDA and reduced ciliary beat frequency (PMID: 37104040), and a Drosophila model which shows absence of ODA and IDA as well as infertility in male flies (PMID: 25232951). \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in DNAAF5 and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 18. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on May 9, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
