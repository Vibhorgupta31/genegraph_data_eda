We demonstrate now that nephrin is a signaling molecule, which stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases.

Although the disease occurs predominantly in the Finnish population, many cases in other populations have also been reported. The disease gene (NPHS1) encodes nephrin, a podocyte transmembrane protein that is an essential component of the podocyte slit diaphragm, the renal ultrafilter. Since the discovery of the gene, many mutations have been reported in the NPHS1 gene in patients with diverse ethnic background. A surprisingly large number of these mutations are missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions. In order to study the pathomechanism of these missense mutations, we have investigated the fate of 21 such mutations hitherto identified in NPHS1 patients. Immunostaining of stable transfected cells expressing the nephrin mutants demonstrated that most of the mutants showed only endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining and no detectable cell surface localization. Immunoelectron microscopy of cells expressing the wild-type and a mutant nephrin further confirmed that the mutant nephrin could be abundantly found in the ER but not on the plasma membrane. Subcellular fractionation of wild-type and a mutant cell line clearly showed an altered subcellular distribution and molecular mobility of the mutant nephrin. In summary, our data indicate that a defective intracellular nephrin transport, most likely due to misfolding, is the most common consequence of missense mutations in NPHS1.","dc:creator":"Liu L","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Defective nephrin trafficking caused by missense mutations in the NPHS1 gene: insight into the mechanisms of congenital nephrotic syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"NPHS1 double immunofluorescence "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:b474ea36-3ba2-4a2e-b6f6-eaa0f05c05b8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7e22761-ea51-4f59-a5bc-97c4cdc8ac12","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:70d172dc-766a-41c0-9864-adc59ecbe275","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"14 of 72 mice survived with no proteinuria and relatively preserved podocyte morphology on histology","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19948823","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations leading to nephrin loss result in massive proteinuria both in humans and mice.

Fourteen littermates out of 72 lacked endogenous nephrin and expressed transgenic rat nephrin. Six of these rescued mice survived until 6 weeks of age, whereas the nephrin-deficient pups died before the age of 5 days. The rescued mice were smaller, developed proteinuria, and showed histological abnormalities in the kidney. Despite foot process effacement, slit diaphragms were observed. Importantly, the expression and localization of several proteins associated with the signaling capacity of nephrin or the regulation of the expression of nephrin were changed in the podocytes. Indeed, all rescued mice showed impaired locomotor activity and distinct histological abnormalities in the cerebellum, and the male mice were also infertile and showed genital malformations. These observations are consistent with normal nephrin expression in the testis and cerebellum.

*NPHS1* gene is located on chromosome 19 at 19q13.12 and encodes the protein nephrin, which forms the slit diaphragm between podocyte foot processes (the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidney). \n\n*NPHS1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome type 1 in 1994 (Kestila et al., PMID: 8178817). The preferred disease name suggested for this disorder is ‘Nephrotic syndrome - *NPHS1*’. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. The disorder is characterized by significant protein loss in the urine within the first weeks of life causing generalized edema.\n\nAt least 26 variants (frameshift, nonsense, splice, missense) have been reported in 71 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 8178817, 9660941, 9915943, 18503012 included in this curation). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and rescue assays. In particular, nephrin knockout mice showed congenital nephrotic syndrome (PMID 11136707) which could be rescued using doxycycline-induced expression of rat nephrin (PMID 19948823), nephrin expression was demonstrated in normal kidneys but lost in patients with autosomal recessive frameshift or nonsense *NPHS1* mutations (PMID 10972661), and in-vitro functional assays demonstrated a nonsense *NPHS1* mutation stopped nephrin-mediated signalling of intracellular pathways AP-1 and MAPK (PMID 11562357), whilst certain missense *NPHS1* mutations caused nephrin accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing its expression at the cell surface (PMID 11726550). A total of 5.5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NPHS1* autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b474ea36-3ba2-4a2e-b6f6-eaa0f05c05b8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
