However, the precise function of many ciliopathy-related proteins and the mechanisms by which these proteins are targeted to primary cilia are still not well understood. Here, we describe a protein-protein interaction network of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E (INPP5E), a prenylated protein associated with JBTS, and its ciliary targeting mechanisms. INPP5E is targeted to the primary cilium through a motif near the C terminus and prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase 6D (PDE6D)-dependent mechanisms. Ciliary targeting of INPP5E is facilitated by another JBTS protein, ADP-ribosylation factor-like 13B (ARL13B), but not by ARL2 or ARL3. ARL13B missense mutations that cause JBTS in humans disrupt the ARL13B-INPP5E interaction. We further demonstrate interactions of INPP5E with several ciliary and centrosomal proteins, including a recently identified ciliopathy protein centrosomal protein 164 (CEP164). These findings indicate that ARL13B, INPP5E, PDE6D, and CEP164 form a distinct functional network that is involved in JBTS and NPHP but independent of the ones previously defined by NPHP and MKS proteins.","dc:creator":"Humbert MC","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"ARL13B, PDE6D, and CEP164 form a functional network for INPP5E ciliary targeting."},"rdfs:label":"INPP5E physical interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"After discussion with the group, we decided no to score this because we haven't curated INPP5E yet.

Here we describe a mouse mutation, hennin (hnn), that causes coupled defects in cilia structure and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. The hnn mutant cilia are short with a specific defect in the structure of the ciliary axoneme, and the hnn neural tube shows a Shh-independent expansion of the domain of motor neuron progenitors. The hnn mutation is a null allele of Arl13b, a small GTPase of the Arf/Arl family, and the Arl13b protein is localized to cilia. Double mutant analysis indicates that Gli3 repressor activity is normal in hnn embryos, but Gli activators are constitutively active at low levels. Thus, normal structure of the ciliary axoneme is required for the cell to translate different levels of Shh ligand into differential regulation of the Gli transcription factors that implement Hedgehog signals.","dc:creator":"Caspary T","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"The graded response to Sonic Hedgehog depends on cilia architecture."},"rdfs:label":"hennin mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The phenotype does not exactly match the patient phenotype."},{"id":"cggv:3fac2c9a-ba44-4d90-a2e1-c57d2b86e38c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1afb96b2-7b23-4149-9528-c3901f7b1907","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"While the zebrafish does not have the characteristic neurological features of JS, it does have a kidney phentoype, which can be present in JS related diseases.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18674751","rdfs:label":"Scorpion zebra fish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because it is a zebrafish model and only displays the kidney phenotype without any neurological phenotype."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1075,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":12.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f7bfa0e4-dfd0-463b-ae3a-cb0417310243","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018772","gene":"hgnc:25419","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"ARL13B was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Joubert syndrome in 2008 (Cantagrel et al., 18674751). At least 11 unique variants (missense, nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 18674751, 26092869, 25138100, 27894351, 29255182). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, rescue experiments, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, ARL13B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Joubert syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on 6.3.2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f6c474c9-4035-498c-a902-03be50d36205"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
