In four additional and unrelated families, we observed an identical insertion mutation that had occurred in a polycytidine tract in exon 4.

It affects about 2% of the world's population and treatment of diabetes and its complications are an increasing health-care burden. Genetic factors are important in the aetiology of NIDDM, and linkage studies are starting to localize some of the genes that influence the development of this disorder. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a single-gene disorder responsible for 2-5% of NIDDM, is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and an age of onset of 25 years or younger. MODY genes have been localized to chromosomes 7, 12 and 20 (refs 5, 7, 8) and clinical studies indicate that mutations in these genes are associated with abnormal patterns of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The gene on chromosome 7 (MODY2) encodes the glycolytic enzyme glucokinases which plays a key role in generating the metabolic signal for insulin secretion and in integrating hepatic glucose uptake. Here we show that subjects with the MODY3-form of NIDDM have mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha, which is encoded by the gene TCF1). HNF-1alpha is a transcription factor that helps in the tissue-specific regulation of the expression of several liver genes and also functions as a weak transactivator of the rat insulin-I gene.","dc:creator":"Yamagata K","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3)"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8945470","rdfs:label":"Family H-III:2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Down scored as no variant evidence to support changes in HNF1A function or pathogenicity."},{"id":"cggv:f2b84b1b-56c0-4f1f-8dc2-d8a178eda857_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd5c0c41-2fbd-4118-9cdd-af64611d9d68","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis using BAC, YAC, and PAC in the region of HNF1A on chromosome 12.

However, whether increased HNF1alpha expression might be beneficial or deleterious for beta-cells is unknown. Furthermore, although it is clear that HNF1alpha is required for beta-cell function, it is not known whether this role is cell autonomous or whether there is a restricted developmental time frame for HNF1alpha to elicit gene activation in beta-cells. To address this, we generated a tetracycline-inducible mouse model that transcribes HNF1alpha selectively in beta-cells in either wild-type or Hnf1alpha-null backgrounds. Short-term induction of HNF1alpha in islets from adult Hnf1alpha(-/-) mice that did not express HNF1alpha throughout development resulted in the activation of target genes, indicating that HNF1alpha has beta-cell-autonomous functions that can be rescued postnatally. However, transgenic induction throughout development, which inevitably resulted in supraphysiological levels of HNF1alpha, strikingly caused a severe reduction of cellular proliferation, increased apoptosis, and consequently beta-cell depletion and diabetes. Thus, HNF1alpha is sensitive to both reduced and excessive concentrations in beta-cells.
