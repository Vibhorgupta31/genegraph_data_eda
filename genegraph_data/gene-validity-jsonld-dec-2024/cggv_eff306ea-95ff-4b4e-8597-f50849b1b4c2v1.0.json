Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic membranes, yet how cells sense and regulate its levels inÂ vivo remains unclear. Here we show that PCYT1A, the rate-limiting enzyme of PC synthesis, is intranuclear and re-locates to the nuclear membrane in response to the need for membrane PL synthesis in yeast, fly, and mammalian cells. By aligning imaging with lipidomic analysis and data-driven modeling, we demonstrate that yeast PCYT1A membrane association correlates with membrane stored curvature elastic stress estimates. Furthermore, this process occurs inside the nucleus, although nuclear localization signal mutants can compensate for the loss of endogenous PCYT1A in yeast and in fly photoreceptors. These data suggest an ancient mechanism by which nucleoplasmic PCYT1A senses surface PL packing defects on the inner nuclear membrane to control PC homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Haider A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"PCYT1A Regulates Phosphatidylcholine Homeostasis from the Inner Nuclear Membrane in Response to Membrane Stored Curvature Elastic Stress."},"rdfs:label":"Role of CCT1 in drosophila photoreceptor"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:eff306ea-95ff-4b4e-8597-f50849b1b4c2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eff306ea-95ff-4b4e-8597-f50849b1b4c2_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b6048a4-651a-4bcd-b833-051ba0b01a74_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9813ed29-2f4f-418b-a1d3-545d2584c622","type":"Proband","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000505","obo:HP_0000926","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0008905","obo:HP_0000548"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:8b6048a4-651a-4bcd-b833-051ba0b01a74_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:215fad1f-5256-48c3-b498-0bccb1f39f09","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001312673.2(PCYT1A):c.385G>A (p.Glu129Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA214468"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24387991","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with cone-rod dystrophy is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe short stature, progressive lower-limb bowing, flattened vertebral bodies, metaphyseal involvement, and visual impairment caused by cone-rod dystrophy.

This gene encodes the alpha isoform of the phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1 choline enzyme, which is responsible for converting phosphocholine into cytidine diphosphate-choline, a key intermediate step in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis pathway. A different enzymatic defect in this pathway has been previously associated with a muscular dystrophy with mitochondrial structural abnormalities that does not have cartilage and/or bone or retinal involvement.

Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with cone-rod dystrophy (SMDCRD) is characterized by postnatal growth deficiency resulting in profound short stature, rhizomelia with bowing of the lower extremities, platyspondyly with anterior vertebral protrusions, progressive metaphyseal irregularity and cupping with shortened tubular bones, and early-onset progressive visual impairment associated with a pigmentary maculopathy and electroretinographic evidence of cone-rod dysfunction.  Later, Testa et al reported biallelic PCYT1A variants in three young patients from two different Italian families with isolated retinal dystrophy (PMID: 28272537). At least 11 variants (variant types including missense, nonsense and frameshift) that have been reported in 10 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 24387990, 24387991, 28272537) are included in this curation. These variants have been demonstrated to segregate in compound heterozygous or homozygous state in the affected individuals. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is supported by in-vivo studies in drosophila, in which siRNA-mediated knockdown of PCYT1A led to blindness in drosophila (PMID: 29754800). Immunostaining of endogenous PCYT1A also demonstrated its expression in mouse retina tissue (PMID: 29754800). In summary, PCYT1A is strongly associated with autosomal recessive spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with cone-rod dystrophy. Three patients with nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy and compound heterozygous PCYT1A variants (truncating variant + missense) have also been reported.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:eff306ea-95ff-4b4e-8597-f50849b1b4c2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
