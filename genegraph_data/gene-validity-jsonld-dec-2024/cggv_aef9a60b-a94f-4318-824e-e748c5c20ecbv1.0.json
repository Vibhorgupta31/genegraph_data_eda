We genotyped a cohort of 22 ARVC patients referred to molecular genetic screening in our heart center for mutations in the desmosomal candidate genes JUP, DSG2, DSC2, DSP and PKP2 known to be associated with ARVC. In 43% of the cohort, we found disease-associated sequence variants. In addition, we screened for desmin mutations and found a novel desmin-mutation p.N116S in a patient with ARVC and terminal heart failure, which is located in segment 1A of the desmin rod domain. The mutation leads to the aggresome formation in cardiac and skeletal muscle without signs of an overt clinical myopathy. Cardiac aggresomes appear to be prominent, especially in the right ventricle of the heart. Viscosimetry and atomic force microscopy of the desmin wild-type and N116S mutant isolated from recombinant Escherichia coli revealed severe impairment of the filament formation, which was supported by transfections in SW13 cells.

Further studies in families with ARVC have identified additional missense variants: the p.Asn342Asp variant was reported in two pedigrees (20423733); p.His326Arg in one family (24200904); p.Pro419Ser in a large Swedish pedigree (22395865) and p.Glu401Asp was detected in a family with 23 affected individuals showing predominant left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with a high incidence of adverse clinical events (29212896). Two cohort studies of 91 and 22 ARVC index cases respectively have performed genetic screening of DES and identified a total of three missense variants (23168288, 20829228). Immunohistochemistry analysis of cardiac specimens from affected individuals with the p.Arg454Trp or p.Asn116Ser variant has shown severe disruption of desmin distribution at the intercalated discs and formation of cytoplasmic and perinuclear aggregates in cardiomyocytes (20423733, 20829228). Experimental data from three studies support the causative role of DES variants in ARVC (20829228, 22403400, 29212896). In particular, Klauke B et al. characterized the p.Asn116Ser variant in in vitro expression systems using a variety of methods including viscosity analysis of desmin mutant protein and atomic force microscopic imaging. Data from these experiments confirmed the presence of fibrous protein aggregates in mutant cultured cells and were consistent with histological examinations of skeletal and cardiac muscle of ARVC cases carrying the same DES variants (20829228). Similarly, functional studies on the p.Glu401Asp variant in transfected cells showed disruption of cellular adhesion and intermediate filament structure and formation of desmin cytoplasmic aggregates (29212896). Finally, the deleterious structural effects of five heterozygous DES mutations on filament formation in vitro and in living cells were investigated in a study that utilized dual color photoactivation localization microscopy (22403400). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. Desmin mutations associated with ARVC appear to be very rare and the observed phenotypes frequently overlap with dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction system abnormalities and occasionally skeletal myopathy.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aef9a60b-a94f-4318-824e-e748c5c20ecb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
