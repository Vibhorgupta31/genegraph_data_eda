DNA methylation appears to be critical for mammalian development because mice nullizygous for a targeted disruption of the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase die at an early embryonic stage. No DNA methyltransferase mutations have been reported in humans until now. We describe here the first example of naturally occurring mutations in a mammalian DNA methyltransferase gene. These mutations occur in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which is termed the ICF syndrome, for immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies. Centromeric instability of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16 is associated with abnormal hypomethylation of CpG sites in their pericentromeric satellite regions. We are able to complement this hypomethylation defect by somatic cell fusion to Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting that the ICF gene is conserved in the hamster and promotes de novo methylation. ICF has been localized to a 9-centimorgan region of chromosome 20 by homozygosity mapping. By searching for homologies to known DNA methyltransferases, we identified a genomic sequence in the ICF region that contains the homologue of the mouse Dnmt3b methyltransferase gene. Using the human sequence to screen ICF kindreds, we discovered mutations in four patients from three families. Mutations include two missense substitutions and a 3-aa insertion resulting from the creation of a novel 3' splice acceptor. None of the mutations were found in over 200 normal chromosomes. We conclude that mutations in the DNMT3B are responsible for the ICF syndrome.","dc:creator":"Hansen RS","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"The DNMT3B DNA methyltransferase gene is mutated in the ICF immunodeficiency syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"P1"},{"id":"cggv:cff4d035-508f-48b0-8ac9-4ef653809cf5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cff4d035-508f-48b0-8ac9-4ef653809cf5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a3e5cd7f-d290-4b65-8a6a-da97ce8b28a1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3e5cd7f-d290-4b65-8a6a-da97ce8b28a1","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6f2b1f8a-6d5a-477e-91ec-6ec0ff1addbb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006892.4(DNMT3B):c.2450A>G (p.Asp817Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118459"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004313","obo:HP_0031411","obo:HP_0000271"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:8f698796-de83-404a-ba05-74473a7a1da4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6f2b1f8a-6d5a-477e-91ec-6ec0ff1addbb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10647011","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The recessive autosomal disorder known as ICF syndrome (for immunodeficiency, centromere instability and facial anomalies; Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 242860) is characterized by variable reductions in serum immunoglobulin levels which cause most ICF patients to succumb to infectious diseases before adulthood. Mild facial anomalies include hypertelorism, low-set ears, epicanthal folds and macroglossia. The cytogenetic abnormalities in lymphocytes are exuberant: juxtacentromeric heterochromatin is greatly elongated and thread-like in metaphase chromosomes, which is associated with the formation of complex multiradiate chromosomes. The same juxtacentromeric regions are subject to persistent interphase self-associations and are extruded into nuclear blebs or micronuclei. Abnormalities are largely confined to tracts of classical satellites 2 and 3 at juxtacentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 9 and 16. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues, but in ICF syndrome it is almost completely unmethylated in all tissues. ICF syndrome is the only genetic disorder known to involve constitutive abnormalities of genomic methylation patterns. Here we show that five unrelated ICF patients have mutations in both alleles of the gene that encodes DNA methyltransferase 3B (refs 5, 6).

Positional candidate cloning recently discovered the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) as the responsible gene by identifying seven different mutations in nine ICF patients. DNMT3B specifically methylates repeat sequences adjacent to the centromeres of chromosome 1, 9, and 16. Our panel of 14 ICF patients was subjected to mutation analysis in the DNMT3B gene. Mutations in DNMT3B were discovered in only nine of our 14 ICF patients. Moreover, two ICF patients from consanguineous families who did not show autozygosity (i.e. homozygosity by descent) for the DNMT3B locus did not reveal DNMT3B mutations, suggesting genetic heterogeneity for this disease. Mutation analysis revealed 11 different mutations, including seven novel ones: eight different missense mutations, two different nonsense mutations, and a splice-site mutation leading to the insertion of three aa's. The missense mutations occurred in or near the catalytic domain of DNMT3B protein, indicating a possible interference with the normal functioning of the enzyme. However, none of the ICF patients was homozygous for a nonsense allele, suggesting that absence of this enzyme is not compatible with life.

Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes showed chromosomal abnormalities, including multiradial configurations and a stretching of the pericentromeric heterochromatin of chromosomes 1 and 16. Hypomethylation of classical satellite 2 DNA was also observed. Mutation analyses of DNMT3B revealed three novel mutations: patient 1 from the first family was a compound heterozygote for a nonsense mutation (Q42Term) and a missense mutation (R832Q); patients 2 and 3 from the second family were both homozygous for a missense mutation (S282P). The R832Q mutation occurred within the conserved methyltransferase domain, and thus may affect the enzyme activity directly. The S282P mutation, on the other hand, occurred close to the PWWP domain, which is presumably involved in protein-protein interaction. This is the first missense mutation mapped to the N-terminal half of the protein, suggesting that the region plays an important role in the regulation of the DNMT3B enzyme.","dc:creator":"Shirohzu

ICF peripheral blood (PB) contains only naive B cells; memory and gut plasma cells are absent. Naive ICF B cells bear potentially autoreactive long heavy chain variable regions complementarity determining region 3's (V(H)CDR3's) enriched with positively charged residues, in contrast to normal PB transitional and mature B cells, indicating that negative selection is impaired in patients.

One patient without DNMT3B mutations shows differences in immunoglobulin E (IgE) switch induction, suggesting that immunodeficiency could vary with the genetic origin of the syndrome.

The Dnmt3b null allele results in embryonic lethality from E14.5 to E16.5 with multiple tissue defects, including liver hypotrophy, ventricular septal defect and haemorrhage. By contrast, mice homozygous for the ICF mutations develop to term and some survive to adulthood. These mice show phenotypes that are reminiscent of ICF patients, including hypomethylation of repetitive sequences, low body weight, distinct cranial facial anomalies and T cell death by apoptosis.

Patients with ICF1 exhibit a distinct cytogenetic abnormality characterized by multiradiate chromosomes derived from stimulated lymphocytes, comprising chromosomes 1, 9, and 16. This syndrome is associated with mild facial dysmorphisms, recurrent and opportunistic infections, altered T cell CDR3 length and impaired development of B cells associated with hypo- or agammaglobulinemia. 23 variants were curated and are composed of missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. Complete deficiency of DNMT3B is embryonic lethal, thus pathogenic mutations are hypomorphic (PMID: 16501171). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Heterozygous carriers have not been shown to have a clinical phenotype or biochemical changes associated with patients with ICF1 (PMID: 28117327). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (12 pts).\n\nDNMT3A and DNMT3B are DNA methyltransferases involved in de novo DNA methylation. DNMT3B, which is expressed in various tissues, plays a critical role in embryonic development and is responsible for methylation of minor satellite repeat regions. In patients with ICF1, DNA methylation is markedly disrupted (PMID: 10555141, 10647011). While the exact mechanism of immune defect is unknown in ICF patients, B cells in ICF patients show abnormal development and the absence of isotype class switched cells (PMID: 14645008). Analysis of T cell receptor usage by T cells also suggests altered T cell development and selection (PMID: 34825286). In ICF1 patient derived induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs), reversion of the DNTM3B mutations resulted in the reacquisition of normal methylation of pericentromeric repeats, with only partial methylation seen in subtelomeric repeats (PMID: 31738163). A mouse model of ICF  showed facial abnormalities, impaired T cell development and global DNA methylation defects (PMID: 16501171). These model phenotypic changes replicated some defects seen in patients. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 4/16/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3482d453-c6c8-483d-8333-dbe4d5bd9b66"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
