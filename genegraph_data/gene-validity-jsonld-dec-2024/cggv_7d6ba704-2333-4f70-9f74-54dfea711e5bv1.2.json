Rare patients carrying homozygous deletions show more severe phenotypes including epileptic encephalopathy, hypotonia and poor growth. For years, CHRNA7 (MIM: 118511), was considered the candidate gene that could account for this syndrome. However, recent studies in mouse models have shown that OTUD7A/CEZANNE2 (MIM: 612024), which encodes for an ovarian tumor (OTU) deubiquitinase, should be considered the critical gene responsible for brain dysfunction. In this study, a patient presenting with severe global developmental delay, language impairment and epileptic encephalopathy was referred to our genetics center. Trio exome sequencing (tES) analysis identified a homozygous OTUD7A missense variant (NM_130901.2:c.697C>T), predicted to alter an ultraconserved amino acid, p.(Leu233Phe), lying within the OTU catalytic domain. Its subsequent segregation analysis revealed that the parents, presenting with learning disability, and brother were heterozygous carriers. Biochemical assays demonstrated that proteasome complex formation and function were significantly reduced in patient-derived fibroblasts and in OTUD7A knockout HAP1 cell line. We provide evidence that biallelic pathogenic OTUD7A variation is linked to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and proteasome dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Garret P","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Report of the first patient with a homozygous OTUD7A variant responsible for epileptic encephalopathy and related proteasome dysfunction."}},"rdfs:label":"Garret Proband"},{"id":"cggv:f3e8c5b7-d4c3-4086-98d0-abb91505fcf7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f3e8c5b7-d4c3-4086-98d0-abb91505fcf7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f3e8c5b7-d4c3-4086-98d0-abb91505fcf7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In patient fibroblasts, steady-state expression levels of PA28-Î± and 20S proteasome subunits were impacted, presumably resulting in the measured decrease in proteasome activity.

Which of the genes within the deleted interval is responsible for the more severe features when biallelically deleted is currently unknown. Here, we report a patient with profound hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, and seizures who had biallelic loss-of-function variants in OTUD7A: a 15q13.3 deletion including the OTUD7A locus, and a frameshift OTUD7A variant c.1125del, p.(Glu375Aspfs*11).

Our experiment using Caenorhabditis elegans showed that worms carrying a corresponding homozygous variant in the homolog OTUB-2 exhibited weakened muscle contraction suggestive of aberrant neuromuscular transmission.
