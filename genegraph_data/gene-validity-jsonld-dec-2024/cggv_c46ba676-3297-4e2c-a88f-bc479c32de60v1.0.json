Here, we describe 32 individuals from 21 families, presenting with microcephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia, with de novo heterozygous and bi-allelic mutations in asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (NARS1). We demonstrate a reduction in NARS1 mRNA expression as well as in NARS1 enzyme levels and activity in both individual fibroblasts and induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs). Molecular modeling of the recessive c.1633C>T (p.Arg545Cys) variant shows weaker spatial positioning and tRNA selectivity. We conclude that de novo and bi-allelic mutations in NARS1 are a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disease, where the mechanism for de novo variants could be toxic gain-of-function and for recessive variants, partial loss-of-function.","dc:creator":"Manole A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"De Novo and Bi-allelic Pathogenic Variants in NARS1 Cause Neurodevelopmental Delay Due to Toxic

NEDMILG is characterized by global developmental delay, delayed walking with variable gait abnormalities, impaired intellectual development with poor or absent speech and language, and progressive microcephaly. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance patterns during the precuration. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, autosomal recessive (AR) neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, impaired language, and gait abnormalities (OMIM:619091) and autosomal dominant (AD) neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, impaired language, epilepsy, and gait abnormalities (NEDMILEG) (OMIM:619092). The split curation for AD NEDMILEG has been curated separately with evidence for AR NEDMILEG  included here. Eight missense and one nonsense variants that have been reported in six probands in two publications (PMIDs: 32788587, 32738225) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown at this time. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, functional alteration of patient cells, and biochemical function (PMIDs: 32788587, 32738225, 32303649). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date March 6th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c46ba676-3297-4e2c-a88f-bc479c32de60"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
