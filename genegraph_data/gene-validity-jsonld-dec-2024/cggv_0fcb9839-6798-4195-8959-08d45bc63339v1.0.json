We recently mapped DFNB86, a locus associated with nonsyndromic deafness, to chromosome 16p. In this study, whole-exome sequencing was performed with genomic DNA from affected individuals from three large consanguineous families in which markers linked to DFNB86 segregate with profound deafness. Analyses of these data revealed homozygous mutation c.208G>T (p.Asp70Tyr) or c.878G>C (p.Arg293Pro) in TBC1D24 as the underlying cause of deafness in the three families. Sanger sequence analysis of TBC1D24 in an additional large family in which deafness segregates with DFNB86 identified the c.208G>T (p.Asp70Tyr) substitution. These mutations affect TBC1D24 amino acid residues that are conserved in orthologs ranging from fruit fly to human. Neither variant was observed in databases of single-nucleotide variants or in 634 chromosomes from ethnically matched control subjects. TBC1D24 in the mouse inner ear was immunolocalized predominantly to spiral ganglion neurons, indicating that DFNB86 deafness might be an auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. Previously, six recessive mutations in TBC1D24 were reported to cause seizures (hearing loss was not reported) ranging in severity from epilepsy with otherwise normal development to epileptic encephalopathy resulting in childhood death. Two of our four families in which deafness segregates with mutant alleles of TBC1D24 were available for neurological examination. Cosegregation of epilepsy and deafness was not observed in these two families. Although the causal relationship between genotype and phenotype is not presently understood, our findings, combined with published data, indicate that recessive alleles of TBC1D24 can cause either epilepsy or nonsyndromic deafness.

IEs include common disorders with a complex mode of inheritance and rare Mendelian traits suggesting the occurrence of several alleles with variable penetrance. We previously described a large family with a recessive form of idiopathic epilepsy, named familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy (FIME), and mapped the disease locus on chromosome 16p13.3 by linkage analysis. In the present study, we found that two compound heterozygous missense mutations (D147H and A509V) in TBC1D24, a gene of unknown function, are responsible for FIME. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Tbc1d24 is mainly expressed at the level of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. By coimmunoprecipitation assay we found that TBC1D24 binds ARF6, a Ras-related family of small GTPases regulating exo-endocytosis dynamics. The main recognized function of ARF6 in the nervous system is the regulation of dendritic branching, spine formation, and axonal extension. TBC1D24 overexpression resulted in a significant increase in neurite length and arborization and the FIME mutations significantly reverted this phenotype. In this study we identified a gene mutation involved in autosomal-recessive idiopathic epilepsy, unveiled the involvement of ARF6-dependent molecular pathway in brain hyperexcitability and seizures, and confirmed the emerging role of subtle cytoarchitectural alterations in the etiology of this group of common epileptic disorders.","dc:creator":"Falace A","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"TBC1D24, an ARF6-interacting protein, is mutated in familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse brain expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:19081401-439e-4dbc-9b93-54f4ac1732ea","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b98f633-3201-42c2-9179-d2e473d8e642","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Results of mouse neuron transfection studies also supported the hypothesis that TBC1D24 negatively modulates ARF6 function","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20727515","rdfs:label":"TBC1D24 interaction with ARF6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No direct link to phenotype."},{"id":"cggv:144fea73-f583-409b-9ef0-8fa6609462b7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e67bd9fd-fd27-4951-9777-05dfd66d05d5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Also tested p.A515V and p.C156X.

Oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) has been shown previously to be critical for oxidative stress resistance in neuronal cells; deletion of this gene causes neurodegeneration in mice, yet conversely, overexpression of OXR1 is protective in cellular and mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. OXR1 contains the Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC), lysin motif (LysM), domain catalytic (TLDc) domain, a motif present in a family of proteins including TBC1 domain family member 24 (TBC1D24), a protein mutated in a range of disorders characterized by seizures, hearing loss, and neurodegeneration. The TLDc domain is highly conserved across species, although the structure-function relationship is unknown. To understand the role of this domain in the stress response, we carried out systematic analysis of all mammalian TLDc domain-containing proteins, investigating their expression and neuroprotective properties in parallel. In addition, we performed a detailed structural and functional study of this domain in which we identified key residues required for its activity. Finally, we present a new mouse insertional mutant of Oxr1, confirming that specific disruption of the TLDc domain in vivo is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. Our data demonstrate that the integrity of the TLDc domain is essential for conferring neuroprotection, an important step in understanding the functional significance of all TLDc domain-containing proteins in the cellular stress response and disease.

In fly sky mutants, synaptic vesicles traveled excessively to endosomes. Using chimeric fluorescent timers, we show that synaptic vesicle-associated proteins were younger on average, suggesting that older proteins are more efficiently degraded. Using a genetic screen, we find that reducing endosomal-to-lysosomal trafficking, controlled by the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, rescued the neurotransmission and neurodegeneration defects in sky mutants. Consistently, synaptic vesicle proteins were older in HOPS complex mutants, and these mutants also showed reduced neurotransmission.

We report here that in utero TBC1D24 knockdown in the rat developing neocortex affects the multipolar-bipolar transition of neurons leading to delayed radial migration. Furthermore, we find that TBC1D24-knockdown neurons display an abnormal maturation and retain immature morphofunctional properties.

The linked interval contained 160 genes, many of which were considered to be plausible candidates to harbor the disease-causing mutation. To interrogate the interval in an efficient and unbiased manner, we used targeted sequence enrichment and massively parallel sequencing. By prioritizing unique variants that affected protein translation, a pathogenic mutation was identified in TBC1D24 (p.F251L), a gene of unknown function. It is a member of a large gene family encoding TBC domain proteins with predicted function as Rab GTPase activators.

The screening of TBC1D24 in an additional set of eight MMPSI patients was negative. TBC1D24 loss of function has been associated to idiopathic infantile myoclonic epilepsy, as well as to drug-resistant early-onset epilepsy with intellectual disability.

There is no distinct phenotypic correlation with pathogenic variant type or location yet, but patterns are emerging (Balestrini 2016). Sensorineural hearing loss is a key feature of DOORS syndrome, which is characterized by deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures (Campeau 2014). Isolated seizure disorders without any reported deafness have been seen (Balestrini 2016). In contrast, two of the families reported to have nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by variants in TBC1D24 were shown to have no history of seizures (Rehman 2014). Further, two independent reports identified the same variant in TBC1D24 to be segregating in an autosomal dominant manner with nonsyndromic hearing loss (Azaiez 2014, Zhang 2014). The strength of the evidence that this gene can cause autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss is Limited, however. Currently there is not enough evidence to treat nonsyndromic hearing loss or isolated seizures as distinct conditions, especially because those affected with DOORS syndrome have both hearing loss and seizure phenotypes. Experimental evidence has implicated a role for the TBC1D24 gene in neuronal development, including neurite length and arborization (Corbett 2010, Falace 2010, Milh 2013) as well as in protection from neuronal oxidative stress (Finelli 2016). While the gene has been shown to be expressed in the murine cochlea (Rehman 2014, Azaiez 2014, Zhang 2014) , there is no further evidence for a potential mechanism of hearing loss. In summary, the TBC1D24 gene is definitively associated with a spectrum of autosomal recessive phenotypes which the Hearing Loss and Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panels propose are a spectrum of DOORS syndrome. This classification was approved by both the ClinGen Hearing Loss and Epilepsy Working Groups on 3/19/19 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0fcb9839-6798-4195-8959-08d45bc63339"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
