Dissection of the subunit- and domain-specific contributions to complex activities is needed to advance mechanistic understanding. Here, we examine the molecular, structural, and genome-wide regulatory consequences of recurrent, single-residue mutations in the putative coiled-coil C-terminal domain (CTD) of the SMARCB1 (BAF47) subunit, which cause the intellectual disability disorder Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), and are recurrently found in cancers. We find that the SMARCB1 CTD contains a basic Î± helix that binds directly to the nucleosome acidic patch and that all CSS-associated mutations disrupt this binding. Furthermore, these mutations abrogate mSWI/SNF-mediated nucleosome remodeling activity and enhancer DNA accessibility without changes in genome-wide complex localization. Finally, heterozygous CSS-associated SMARCB1 mutations result in dominant gene regulatory and morphologic changes during iPSC-neuronal differentiation. These studies unmask an evolutionarily conserved structural role for the SMARCB1 CTD that is perturbed in human disease.","dc:creator":"Valencia AM","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Recurrent SMARCB1 Mutations Reveal a Nucleosome Acidic Patch Interaction Site That Potentiates mSWI/SNF Complex Chromatin Remodeling."},"rdfs:label":"HEK293T"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0e6291d0-04d6-4f11-86a9-513314dd85e1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d566e8e-d42d-4852-86cd-7988ae36bba8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) demonstrated that iPSC mutants with p.K364del variant had substantially diminished accessibility relative to wild-type.

We generated mice with a heterozygous nervous system-specific partial loss-of-function mutation in a BAF core component gene, Smarcb1. These Smarcb1 mutant mice show various brain midline abnormalities that are also found in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) caused by SMARCB1, SMARCE1, and ARID1B mutations and in SMARCB1-related intellectual disability (ID) with choroid plexus hyperplasia (CPH). Analyses of the Smarcb1 mutant animals indicate that one prominent midline abnormality, corpus callosum agenesis, is due to midline glia aberrations.

Coffin-Siris syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, coarse facial features, hypertrichosis, sparse scalp hair, and hypoplastic or absent fifth fingernails or toenails. Five missense variants and inframe deletions, including recurrent p.(Lys364del) and p.(Arg37His), reported in 20 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 22426308, 23815551, 23906836, 23929686, 25168959, 29907796) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is dominant-negative (PMID: 31759698).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal and cell culture models (PMIDs: 31273213, 31759698). Mice with heterozygous disruption of *Smarcb1* exhibit brain midline abnormalities like those seen in CSS individuals (PMID: 31273213). In patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells with the recurrent p.(Lys364del) variant, neurite outgrowth is diminished, and gene expression is redacted (PMID: 31759698).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *SMARCB1* and autosomal dominant Coffin-Siris syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 15, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ea554e80-81d2-4100-8d0e-b762ea38fe23"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
