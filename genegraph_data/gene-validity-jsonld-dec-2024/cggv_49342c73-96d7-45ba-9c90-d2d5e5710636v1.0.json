A single secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, arising in cis with the primary activating mutation, confers acquired resistance to these drugs. However, the T790M mutation is also detected in the absence of drug selection, suggesting that it may provide a growth advantage. We show here that although T790M alone has only a modest effect on EGFR function, when combined with the characteristic activating mutations L858R or del746-750, it results in a dramatic enhancement of EGFR activity. The double mutants show potent ligand-independent receptor autophosphorylation associated with altered cellular phenotypes, soft agar colony formation, and tumorigenesis in nude mice. The significant gain-of-function properties of these double mutants may explain their initial presence before drug selection and their rapid selection as the single drug resistance mutation during therapy with gefitinib/erlotinib, and suggests that they may contribute to the adverse clinical course of TKI-resistant NSCLC.","dc:creator":"Godin-Heymann N","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Oncogenic activity of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase mutant alleles is enhanced by the T790M drug resistance mutation."},"rdfs:label":"Autophosphorylation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Increased autophosphorylation of tyrosine kinases and/or increased phosphorylation of their downstream target proteins are important factors in conferring growth/mitotic advantage to the cells as well as to their oncogenic transformation.

The relationship of germline variants in EGFR to autosomal dominant familial non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma subtype, was first reported in 2005 (Bell DW et al., PMIDs: 16258541). Two variants that have been reported in germline of twelve probands in eleven literature (PMIDs: 24736066, 16258541, 20068085, 20068085, 21252721, 22588155, 24736080, 18355544, 21172876, 23380224, 25176975, 23358982) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (7 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is gain-of-function. This gene-disease association is particularly supported for p.T790M germline variant by the number of families, animal models and in vitro functional assays on cell culture models where it has been shown to confer oncogenic properties such as tumor development and increased colony formation (PMIDs: 17726540, 17671201). There is also limited experimental evidence for p.V843I showing increased colony formation (PMID:25057940). In summary, EGFR is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial non-small cell lung cancer susceptibility [MIM:211980]. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Lumping and Splitting: Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in molecular mechanisms (gain of function versus loss of function), inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability between Non-small cell lung cancer, susceptibility to [MIM:211980] and Inflammatory skin and bowel disease, neonatal, 2 [MIM:616069]. Additionally, no cancer has been reported in both biallelic and monoallelic loss-of-function variant carriers.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:49342c73-96d7-45ba-9c90-d2d5e5710636"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
