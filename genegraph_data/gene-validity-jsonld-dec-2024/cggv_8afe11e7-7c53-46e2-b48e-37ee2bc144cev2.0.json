In two families affected by POF accompanied by hearing loss (together, these symptoms compose Perrault syndrome), exome sequencing revealed mutations in LARS2, encoding mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase: homozygous c.1565C>A (p.Thr522Asn) in a consanguineous Palestinian family and compound heterozygous c.1077delT and c.1886C>T (p.Thr629Met) in a nonconsanguineous Slovenian family. LARS2 c.1077delT leads to a frameshift at codon 360 of the 901 residue protein. LARS2 p.Thr522Asn occurs in the LARS2 catalytic domain at a site conserved from bacteria through mammals. LARS2 p.Thr629Met occurs in the LARS2 leucine-specific domain, which is adjacent to a catalytic loop critical in all species but for which primary sequence is not well conserved. A recently developed method of detecting remote homologies revealed threonine at this site in consensus sequences derived from multiple-species alignments seeded by human and E. coli residues at this region. Yeast complementation indicated that LARS2 c.1077delT is nonfunctional and that LARS2 p.Thr522Asn is partially functional. LARS2 p.Thr629Met was functional in this assay but might be insufficient as a heterozygote with the fully nonfunctional LARS2 c.1077delT allele. A known C. elegans strain with the protein-truncating alteration LARS-2 p.Trp247Ter was confirmed to be sterile. After HARS2, LARS2 is the second gene encoding mitochondrial tRNA synthetase to be found to harbor mutations leading to Perrault syndrome, further supporting a critical role for mitochondria in the maintenance of ovarian function and hearing.","dc:creator":"Pierce SB","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in LARS2, encoding mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, lead to premature ovarian failure and hearing loss in Perrault syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8afe11e7-7c53-46e2-b48e-37ee2bc144ce_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8afe11e7-7c53-46e2-b48e-37ee2bc144ce_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5358e777-646d-4eb6-83bf-3efe0257dde3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13fd08b6-999f-4f05-9fe2-e0abd9aaa332","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"tested gene expression levels in mouse cochlea and found that LARS2 is expressed most highly in the spiral of ganglion than the organ of Corti, lateral wall or spiral limbus","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28263850","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cochlear implantation (CI), which directly stimulates the cochlear nerves, is the most effective and widely used medical intervention for patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. The etiology of the hearing loss is speculated to have a major influence of CI outcomes, particularly in cases resulting from mutations in genes preferentially expressed in the spiral ganglion region. To elucidate precise gene expression levels in each part of the cochlea, we performed laser-capture micro dissection in combination with next-generation sequencing analysis and determined the expression levels of all known deafness-associated genes in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, lateral wall, and spiral limbs. The results were generally consistent with previous reports based on immunocytochemistry or in situ hybridization. As a notable result, the genes associated with many kinds of syndromic hearing loss (such as Clpp, Hars2, Hsd17b4, Lars2 for Perrault syndrome, Polr1c and Polr1d for Treacher Collins syndrome, Ndp for Norrie Disease, Kal for Kallmann syndrome, Edn3 and Snai2 for Waardenburg Syndrome, Col4a3 for Alport syndrome, Sema3e for CHARGE syndrome, Col9a1 for Sticker syndrome, Cdh23, Cib2, Clrn1, Pcdh15, Ush1c, Ush2a, Whrn for Usher syndrome and Wfs1 for Wolfram syndrome) showed higher levels of expression in the spiral ganglion than in other parts of the cochlea.

LARS2 encodes the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, which attaches leucine to its cognate tRNA. Sequence variants in LARS2 have previously been associated with Perrault syndrome, characterized by premature ovarian failure and hearing loss (OMIM #615300). In this study, we report variants in LARS2 that are associated with a severe multisystem metabolic disorder. The proband was born prematurely with severe lactic acidosis, hydrops, and sideroblastic anemia. She had multisystem complications with hyaline membrane disease, impaired cardiac function, a coagulopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and progressive renal disease and succumbed at 5 days of age. Whole exome sequencing of patient DNA revealed compound heterozygous variants in LARS2 (c.1289C>T; p.Ala430Val and c.1565C>A; p.Thr522Asn). The c.1565C>A (p.Thr522Asn) LARS2 variant has previously been associated with Perrault syndrome and both identified variants are predicted to be damaging (SIFT, PolyPhen). Muscle and liver samples from the proband did not display marked mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiency. Immunoblotting of patient muscle and liver showed LARS2 levels were reduced in liver and complex I protein levels were reduced in patient muscle and liver. Aminoacylation assays revealed p.Ala430Val LARS2 had an 18-fold loss of catalytic efficiency and p.Thr522Asn a 9-fold loss compared to wild-type LARS2.

Causative genes include HARS2, HSD17B4, CLPP, C10orf2, and LARS2. Some patients with Perrault syndrome exhibit neurologic features including learning disability, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy and are classified as type 2 and are clinically separate from those without neurological symptoms other than a hearing loss (type 1). To date, all reported patients with LARS2 mutations (15 patients in 8 families) have been classified as type 1. Here, we report female siblings with biallelic mutations in LARS2, p.Glu294Lys, and p.Thr519Met, who were classified as type 2. The proposita developed progressive sensorineural hearing loss at 18 months and pervasive developmental disorder at 8 years, with repetitive behavior, insistence on sameness, attention deficit, tic, irritability, and an ataxic gait. At age 15 years, she was diagnosed as having primary amenorrhea with elevated FSH and LH and a decreased estradiol; ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging examinations revealed a small uterus and no detectable ovaries. The proposita's younger sister presented with neonatal sensorineural hearing loss and a mild delay in motor and speech development. She was diagnosed as having primary amenorrhea with endocrinologic and radiographic findings that were comparable to those of her sister. She had difficulty with reading comprehension, and had trouble with open-ended test questions at 12 years of age.

Recently, mutations in five genes have been identified: C10orf2, CLPP, HARS2, HSD17B4, and LARS2. Probands included are presented with sensorineural deafness associated with gonadic dysgenesis. DNA was sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a panel of 35 deafness genes including the five Perrault genes. Exonic variations known as pathogenic mutations or detected with <1% frequency in public databases were extracted and subjected to segregation analysis within each family. Both mutations and low coverage regions were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Fourteen female index patients were included. The screening in four cases has been extended to four family members presenting with PS phenotype. For four unrelated patients (28.6%), causative mutations were identified: three homozygous mutations in C10orf2, CLPP, and HARS2, and one compound heterozygous mutation in LARS2. Three additional heterozygous mutations in LARS2 and HSD17B4 were found in three independent familial cases. All these missense mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing.

Recently we reported LARS2 deafness with (ovario) leukodystrophy. Here we describe five patients with a range of phenotypes, in whom we identified biallelic LARS2 variants: three patients with a HLASA-like phenotype, an individual with Perrault syndrome whose affected siblings also had leukodystrophy, and an individual with a reversible mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and developmental delay. Three HLASA cases from two unrelated families were identified. All were males with genital anomalies. Two survived multisystem disease in the neonatal period; both have developmental delay and hearing loss. A 55-year old male with deafness has not displayed neurological symptoms while his female siblings with Perrault syndrome developed leukodystrophy and died in their 30s. Analysis of muscle from a child with a reversible myopathy showed reduced LARS2 and mitochondrial complex I levels, and an unusual form of degeneration. Analysis of recombinant LARS2 variant proteins showed they had reduced aminoacylation efficiency, with HLASA-associated variants having the most severe effect.

Recently, mutations in five genes (HSD17B4, HARS2, CLPP, LARS2 and C10ORF2) were found to be responsible for Perrault syndrome, although they do not account for all cases of this genetically heterogeneous condition. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify pathogenic variants responsible for Perrault syndrome in an Italian pedigree with two affected siblings. Both patients were compound heterozygous for two novel missense variants within the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS2): NM_015340.3:c.899C>T(p.Thr300Met) and c.1912G>A(p.Glu638Lys). Both variants cosegregated with the phenotype in the family. p.Thr300 and p.Glu638 are evolutionarily conserved residues, and are located, respectively, within the editing domain and immediately before the catalytically important KMSKS motif. Homology modeling using as template the E. coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase provided further insights on the possible pathogenic effects of the identified variants.

There are over 80 genes in which variants can cause POI, with these explaining only a minority of cases. Whole exome sequencing (WES) can be a useful tool for POI patient management, allowing clinical care to be personalized to underlying cause. We performed WES to investigate two French sisters, whose only clinical complaint was POI. Surprisingly, they shared one known and one novel likely pathogenic variant in the Perrault syndrome gene, LARS2. Using amino-acylation studies, we established that the novel missense variant significantly impairs LARS2 function. Perrault syndrome is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss in addition to POI. This molecular diagnosis alerted the sisters to the significance of their difficulty in following conversation. Subsequent audiology assessment revealed a mild bilateral hearing loss. We describe the first cases presenting with perceived isolated POI and causative variants in a Perrault syndrome gene. Our study expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with LARS2 variants and highlights the clinical benefit of having a genetic diagnosis, with prediction of potential co-morbidity and prompt and

At least 27 unique variants (missense, frameshift) have been reported in 18 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 23541342, 26970254, 27650058, 26657938, 29205794, 30737337, 31274036, 32442335, 32399598, 32767731, 32842620, 36450801). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 7 additional members in one family (PMID: 32842620). An additional internal case at the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine involves two young sisters with profound sensorineural hearing loss, who are compound heterozygous for a missense variant and exon 22 deletion (NM_015340.3(LARS2):c.(?_2533)-70_*(70_?)del, SCV000731480.1). This gene-disease relationship is supported by relevant expression studies, biochemical function studies, a mouse model and a rescue (PMIDs: 23541342, 26537577, 28263850). In summary *LARS2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Perrault syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally classified as Strong by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/26/2018 as per SOP v5. It was reevaluated on 6/1/2023 as per SOP v9. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Strong to Definitive due to additional case level evidence from new literature (PMIDs: 30737337, 31274036, 32442335, 32399598, 32767731, 32842620, 36450801).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8afe11e7-7c53-46e2-b48e-37ee2bc144ce"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
