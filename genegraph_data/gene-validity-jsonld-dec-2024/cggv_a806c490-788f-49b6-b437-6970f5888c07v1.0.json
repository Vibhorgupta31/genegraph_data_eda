Over 15 years after FOXP2 was identified, most speech and language impairments remain unexplained at the molecular level. We sequenced whole genomes of nineteen unrelated individuals diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech, a rare disorder enriched for causative mutations of large effect. Where DNA was available from unaffected parents, we discovered de novo mutations, implicating genes, including CHD3, SETD1A and WDR5. In other probands, we identified novel loss-of-function variants affecting KAT6A, SETBP1, ZFHX4, TNRC6B and MKL2, regulatory genes with links to neurodevelopment. Several of the new candidates interact with each other or with known speech-related genes. Moreover, they show significant clustering within a single co-expression module of genes highly expressed during early human brain development. This study highlights gene regulatory pathways in the developing brain that may contribute to acquisition of proficient speech.","dc:creator":"Eising E","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A set of

exome sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the genetic architecture of human disease. Here we apply it to more than 2,500 simplex families, each having a child with an autistic spectrum disorder. By comparing affected to unaffected siblings, we show that 13% of de novo missense mutations and 43% of de novo likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations contribute to 12% and 9% of diagnoses, respectively. Including copy number variants, coding de novo mutations contribute to about 30% of all simplex and 45% of female diagnoses. Almost all LGD mutations occur opposite wild-type alleles. LGD targets in affected females significantly overlap the targets in males of lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but neither overlaps significantly with targets in males of higher IQ. We estimate that LGD mutation in about 400 genes can contribute to the joint class of affected females and males of lower IQ, with an overlapping and similar number of genes vulnerable to contributory missense mutation. LGD targets in the joint class overlap with published targets for intellectual disability and schizophrenia, and are enriched for chromatin modifiers, FMRP-associated genes and embryonically expressed genes. Most of the significance for the latter comes from affected females.

Individuals with pathogenic variants in this gene have presented with neurodevelopmental phenotypes including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, motor and speech delay, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship was derived from case-level data. Protein truncating variants in this gene have been reported in over 25 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders;10 probands from 3 publications (PMIDs: 25363768, 29463886, 32152250) are included in this curation, though additional genetic evidence is available in the literature (PMIDs: 27479843, 30564305, 33057194, 28191889). At least six de novo TNRC6B missense variants have been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (PMIDs: 28135719, 31981491) but were not scored because their functional significance is unknown. The mechanism for disease is predicted to be haploinsufficiency based on the predominance of protein truncating variants among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. To date, there is no experimental evidence to directly support the role of this gene in neurodevelopmental disorders. In summary, there is sufficient genetic evidence to support a definitive gene-disease relationship between TNRC6B and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 1/6/21 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a806c490-788f-49b6-b437-6970f5888c07"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
