Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Å resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Complex I structural model "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"At least 18 complex I subunits are associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:8bb99c59-15c9-4e19-ba8b-df6cb800c32d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97d0622f-f903-45c7-8a04-beea7fdc5eda","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a854233f-dd9f-4dac-97e6-a413ae37aab9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Cybrids were obtained by fusing mitochondria-containing cytoplasts from patients’ fibroblasts with mtDNA-less r0 cells derived from 143B human osteosarcoma cell line. 13 clones from patient 1 carrying the  m.3376G > A (p.E24K) variant were analyzed.

Complex I is a giant multiheteromeric enzyme composed of seven ND subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes, and at least 38 subunits encoded by nuclear genes. To establish the contribution to human mitochondrial encephalopathy of ND versus nuclear gene mutations, we have been undertaking a systematic analysis of CI genes in a cohort of 46 adult and paediatric patients with biochemically defined CI defect. Sequence analysis of the entire mtDNA let us identify six patients with mutations in ND genes. The clinical presentations varied, from infantile Leigh syndrome, to childhood MELAS, to adult-onset encephalopathic syndromes of variable severity. Three of the mutations were not previously reported (3481G > A, 14600G > A and 13063G > A, in ND1, ND6 and ND5 genes, respectively) and were further investigated in mutant transmitochondrial cybrids. Tight correlation between mutation load and decrease in CI activity was observed in each of the three mutant cybrid lines, supporting the pathogenic role of the novel mutations. Structural studies on mutant cybrids showed impaired assembly or reduced stability of the holoenzyme complex. In our experience ND gene mutations are relatively common in CI-defective mitochondrial encephalopathy of both children and adults.","dc:creator":"Malfatti E","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Novel mutations of ND genes in complex I deficiency associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Cybrid cell line"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.5 pts scored for evidence of OXPhos dysfunction.

Specific mutations cause overlap syndromes combining several phenotypes, but the mechanisms of their biochemical effects are largely unknown. The m.3376G>A transition leading to p.E24K substitution in ND1 with LHON/MELAS phenotype was modeled here in a homologous position (NuoH-E36K) in the Escherichia coli enzyme and it almost totally abolished complex I activity. The more conservative mutation NuoH-E36Q resulted in higher apparent K(m) for ubiquinone and diminished inhibitor sensitivity. A NuoH homolog of the m.3865A>G transition, which has been found concomitantly in the overlap syndrome patient with the m.3376G>A, had only a minor effect. Consequences of a primary LHON-mutation m.3460G>A affecting the same extramembrane loop as the m.3376G>A substitution were also studied in the E. coli model and were found to be mild. The results indicate that the overlap syndrome-associated m.3376G>A transition in MTND1 is the pathogenic mutation and m.3865A>G transition has minor, if any, effect on presentation of the disease. The kinetic effects of the NuoH-E36Q mutation suggest its proximity to the putative ubiquinone binding domain in 49kD/PSST subunits. In all, m.3376G>A perturbs ubiquinone binding, a phenomenon found in LHON, and decreases the activity of fully assembled complex I as in MELAS.","dc:creator":"Pätsi J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"LHON/MELAS overlap mutation in ND1 subunit of mitochondrial complex I affects ubiquinone binding as revealed by modeling in Escherichia coli NDH-1."},"rdfs:label":"E.coli model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"m.3376G > A (p.E24K) variant results in biochemical abnormalities in complex I that might result in disease development."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4737,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c51eb66d-8a75-4f1a-9d96-f213325e18d7","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:7455","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-ND1* and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 14, 2021. The *MT-ND1* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND1. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *MT-ND1* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2004 (PMID: 15466014). Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-ND1* and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 5 variants in 9 cases (1 with m.3481G>A, 1 with m.3688G>A, 4 with m.3697G>A, 2 with m.3890G>A, and 1 with m.3928G>C) from 8 publications (PMIDs: 15466014, 18504678, 18977334, 23246842, 24063851, 27017994, 24830958, 31996177). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants (the total score for genetic level evidence in this curation was 12). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 27509854, 22079202, 17535832). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 14, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8bb99c59-15c9-4e19-ba8b-df6cb800c32d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
