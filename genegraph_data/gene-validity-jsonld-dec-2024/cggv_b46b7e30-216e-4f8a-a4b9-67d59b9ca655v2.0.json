GS is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA). This protein forms a high-molecular-weight complex with the hydrolases beta-galactosidase (GLB1) and neuraminidase (NEU1). By virtue of this association these two enzymes are correctly compartmentalized in lysosomes and protected against rapid proteolytic degradation. Controversial data show that PPCA is also present in a second complex, including the Elastin Binding Protein (EBP) the EBP-receptor, which is involved in elastogenesis, and NEU1. We investigated the potential role of the PPCA in both complexes. Two new genetic lesions (c60delG and IVS2+1 G > T) that lead to a frameshift and a premature stop codon were detected in the PPCA cDNA and genomic DNA of the patient. The deleterious effect of such mutations was confirmed by the complete absence of the PPCA protein on Western blots. Thus, we examined the effect of the loss of PPCA on the two protein complexes in the patient's fibroblasts. Interestingly, a reduced amount of both GLB1 and EBP proteins was detected. These data confirm that PPCA is present in two functional complexes one with GLB1 and NEU1 in the lysosomal lumen and the other with EBP at the cell surface. The reduction in GLB1 and EBP confirms that PPCA is essential for their integrity.","dc:creator":"Malvagia S","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"New mutations in the PPBG gene lead to loss of PPCA protein which affects the level of the beta-galactosidase/neuraminidase complex and the EBP-receptor."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 - Malvagia"},{"id":"cggv:5d1fde35-dcd8-4ef0-a79c-a60fd4307af5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d1fde35-dcd8-4ef0-a79c-a60fd4307af5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ed5f9ed5-b5ac-4362-842c-f3301675877e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed5f9ed5-b5ac-4362-842c-f3301675877e","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:b471c907-e41d-4931-bfbf-f46cbf4fb14e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000308.4(CTSA):c.269C>T (p.Ser90Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114210"}},{"id":"cggv:38c0f060-7313-4082-8d84-df456e32291d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000308.4(CTSA):c.1184A>G (p.Tyr395Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114213"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:70f4e04d-f51d-48c2-97f7-d967d4b1a1a8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b471c907-e41d-4931-bfbf-f46cbf4fb14e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8514852","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Four different protective protein cDNA mutations, 146A-->G (Q49R), 193T-->C (W65R), 268-269TC-->CT (S90L), and 1184A-->G (Y395C), were identified in six Japanese galactosialidosis patients with various phenotypic manifestations, and another mutation, 746T-->A (Y249N), in a patient of French-German origin with an atypical clinical course.

The novel implementation of genomic sequencing approaches to investigate rare genetic disorders is allowing not only the discovery of new genes, but also the phenotypic expansion of known Mendelian genetic disorders. Here we report the detailed clinical assessment of a patient with a rare genetic disorder with undefined molecular diagnosis. We applied whole-exome sequencing to this patient and unaffected parents in order to identify the molecular cause of her disorder. We identified compound heterozygous mutations in the CTSA gene, responsible for causing galactosialidosis; the molecular diagnosis was further confirmed by biochemical studies. This report expands on the clinical spectrum of this rare lysosomal disorder and exemplifies how genomic approaches are further elucidating the characterization and understanding of genetic diseases.","dc:creator":"Prada CE","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Clinical utility of whole-exome sequencing in rare diseases: Galactosialidosis."}},{"id":"cggv:dc57a51f-dd81-4040-9edb-ee881bbcfb81_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f63faa1d-0629-4e99-91f0-0f5d4e2b4c15"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24769197"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 - Prada"},{"id":"cggv:9f3bd738-e593-4ad6-8a20-37047e27c3cc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f3bd738-e593-4ad6-8a20-37047e27c3cc_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:dc57a51f-dd81-4040-9edb-ee881bbcfb81","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc57a51f-dd81-4040-9edb-ee881bbcfb81_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:dc57a51f-dd81-4040-9edb-ee881bbcfb81_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"shown by pulse-chase experiment to result in reduced protein stability versus wild-type (PMID: 8968752)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3204e32e-d6db-486b-9002-d0df5b1e728f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3204e32e-d6db-486b-9002-d0df5b1e728f","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:55252b2d-73ab-4955-88c2-1c3464173179","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000308.4(CTSA):c.692+3A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212737"}},{"id":"cggv:4c2631fc-d00a-4128-a858-4f03257b335d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000308.4(CTSA):c.158A>C (p.Tyr53Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA409248227"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:fe79667d-999b-4982-8083-13f84f28a1cb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4c2631fc-d00a-4128-a858-4f03257b335d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8968752","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) are the cause of the lysosomal disorder galactosialidosis (GS). Depending on age of onset and severity of the symptoms, patients present with either an early infantile (EI), a late infantile (LI), or a juvenile/adult (J/A) form of the disease. To study genotype-phenotype correlation in this disorder, we have analyzed the mutations in the PPCA gene of eight clinically different patients. In two EI and one J/A patient, we have identified four novel point mutations (Val104Met, Leu208Pro, Gly411Ser and Ser23Tyr), that prevent phosphorylation and, hence, lysosomal localization and maturation of the mutant precursors. Two amino acid substitutions (Phe412Val and Tyr221Asn) are shared by five LI patients. These mutations appear to be pathognomonic for this phenotype, and determine the clinical outcome depending on whether they are present together or in combination with other mutations. The latter include a single base deletion and a novel amino acid change (Met378Thr), which generates an additional glycosylation site. Within the LI group, patients carrying the Phe412Val mutation are clinically more severe than those with the Tyr221Asn substitution. This is in agreement with the biochemical behavior of the Asn221-mutant protein, that is, like the Phe412Val protein, phosphorylated, routed to lysosomes and proteolytically processed, but its intralysosomal stability is intermediate between that of wild-type PPCA and Val412-PPCA. Overall, these results may explain the clinical heterogeneity observed in GS patients and may help to correlate mutant allelic combinations with specific clinical phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Zhou XY","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Molecular and biochemical analysis of protective protein/cathepsin A mutations: correlation with clinical severity in galactosialidosis."}},{"id":"cggv:d995240f-0c46-4e6e-8cca-5e385b1b43a9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:55252b2d-73ab-4955-88c2-1c3464173179"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8968752"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient KF"},{"id":"cggv:fe79667d-999b-4982-8083-13f84f28a1cb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe79667d-999b-4982-8083-13f84f28a1cb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:fe79667d-999b-4982-8083-13f84f28a1cb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"COS-1 cells transfected with the variant showed impaired protein transport to the lysosome and secretion due to the mutant protein not being phosphorylated (PMID: 8968752)"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d995240f-0c46-4e6e-8cca-5e385b1b43a9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d995240f-0c46-4e6e-8cca-5e385b1b43a9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d995240f-0c46-4e6e-8cca-5e385b1b43a9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"splice donor variant of intron 7, shown by RT-PCR to result in skipping of exon 7 (Shimmoto, M., Takano, T., Fukuhara, Y., Oshima, A., Sakuraba, H., Suzuki, Y.

In lysosomes, cathepsin A forms a high-molecular-weight complex with beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase that protects these enzymes against intralysosomal proteolysis. In a patient affected with late infantile form of galactosialidosis, we found two new cathepsin A mutations, a two-nucleotide deletion, c517delTT and an intronic mutation, IVS8+9C-->G resulting in abnormal splicing and a five-nucleotide insertion in the cathepsin A cDNA. Both mutations cause frameshifts and result in the synthesis of truncated cathepsin A proteins, which, as suggested by structural modeling, are incapable of dimerization, complex formation, and catalysis. However, enzymatic assays, gel-filtration, and Western blot analysis of the patient's cultured skin fibroblast extracts showed the presence of a small amount of normal-size, catalytically active cathepsin A and cathepsin A-beta-galactosidase 680 kDa complex, suggesting that a low amount of cathepsin A mRNA is spliced normally and produces the wild-type protein. This may contribute to the relatively mild phenotype of the patient and illustrates the importance of critically comparing molecular results with clinical and biochemical phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Richard C","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Molecular pathology of galactosialidosis in a patient affected with two new frameshift mutations in the cathepsin A/protective protein gene."}},{"id":"cggv:c16d5eb3-5620-4c3d-8857-d609df7143b1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1fbdfc4b-2318-4608-bcbf-281dc1728e6c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9603439"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient GS-9"},{"id":"cggv:c16d5eb3-5620-4c3d-8857-d609df7143b1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c16d5eb3-5620-4c3d-8857-d609df7143b1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"results in abnormal splicing and a 5-nucleotide insertion leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon at c.1102"},{"id":"cggv:52a7f4e9-77ef-43d0-ab56-55f5aa7783f1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:52a7f4e9-77ef-43d0-ab56-55f5aa7783f1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:56c28d10-0269-4097-8427-ab4f5adeef26_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56c28d10-0269-4097-8427-ab4f5adeef26","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:d0455f4a-713f-493a-a6e8-b82f1a5c874c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000308.4(CTSA):c.1230del (p.Trp410CysfsTer18)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573320264"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:726d7567-2c3a-4294-90e0-ebb4e542d2d9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d0455f4a-713f-493a-a6e8-b82f1a5c874c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28555253","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Galactosialidosis is an autosamal reressive lysosomal storage disease caused by a combined deficiency of lysosomal β-galactosidase and neuraminidase, due to a primary defect in protective protein/cathepsin A.

Most of their tissues show characteristic vacuolation of specific cells, attributable to lysosomal storage. Excessive excretion of sialyloligosaccharides in urine is diagnostic of the disease. Affected mice progressively deteriorate as a consequence of severe organ dysfunction, especially of the kidney. The deficient phenotype can be corrected by transplanting null mutants with bone marrow from a transgenic line overexpressing human PPCA in erythroid precursor cells. The transgenic bone marrow gives a more efficient and complete correction of the visceral organs than normal bone marrow. Our data demonstrate the usefulness of this animal model, very similar to the human disease, for experimenting therapeutic strategies aimed to deliver the functional protein or gene to affected organs.

CTSA encodes cathepsin A (aka protective protein) (PMID: 3136930), a multifunctional enzyme that acts as part of the lysosome multifunctional complex to stabilize lysosomal β-galactosidase (GAL), and activate the lysosomal sialidase Neu1 (PMID: 6812049). Individuals with GSL show combined β-galactosidase (GAL) and Neu1 deficiency (PMID: 6812049) due to reduced cathepsin A activity (PMID: 8725271), leading to characteristic clinical features including coarse facies, macular cherry red spots, and skeletal dysostosis (PMID: 28603679). \n\nPrenatal presentation: Biallelic variants in CTSA lead to Galactosialidosis with phenotypic variability. The severe presentation, often referred to as “early infantile” is characterized prenatally by non-immune hydrops fetalis and is often associated with pre or perinatal lethality. Individuals with either biallelic variants in CTSA or a biochemical diagnosis of Galactosialidosis and relevant prenatal phenotypes have been described in multiple publications with nonsense, frameshift and missense variants described (PMID: 7759227; 8838767; 19466716; 16674934; 23915561; 26036949).\n\nThe disease mechanism of GSL is loss of function. GSL was first reported in 1971 by Goldberg et al. (PMID: 4999185) and the first reports of biallelic variants in CTSA among GSL cases in 1991 by Takano et al. (Takano, T., Shimmoto, M., Fukuhara, Y., Itoh, K., et al. (1991). Galactosialidosis: Clinical and molecular analysis of 19 Japanese patients. Brain Dysfunction, 4(5), 271–280.) Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between CTSA and GSL. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 24769197, PMID: 28555253, PMID: 15110321, PMID: 9603439, PMID: 8514852, PMID: 8968752, PMID: 27243974). In total, thirteen variants from seven probands in six publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between CTSA and GSL includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (cathepsin A) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with GSL (PMID: 6812049, PMID: 8725271, PMID: 28603679); the biochemical and clinical features of CTSA knockout mice (PMID: 7590240); and rescue of enzyme function via allogenic bone marrow transplantation in CTSA knockout mice (PMID: 7590240). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, CTSA is definitively associated with GSL. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on September 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b46b7e30-216e-4f8a-a4b9-67d59b9ca655"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
