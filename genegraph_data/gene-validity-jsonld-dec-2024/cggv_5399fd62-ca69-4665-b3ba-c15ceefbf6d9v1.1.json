The all-trans retinal that is generated after cone and rod photopigments absorb photons of light is recycled back to 11-cis retinal by the retinal pigment epithelium and MÃ¼ller cells of the retina. Several of the enzymes involved have recently been purified and molecularly cloned; here we focus on 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase (encoded by the gene RDH5; chromosome 12q13-14; ref. 4), the first cloned enzyme in this pathway. This microsomal enzyme is abundant in the retinal pigment epithelium, where it has been proposed to catalyse the conversion of 11-cis retinol to 11-cis retinal. We evaluated patients with hereditary retinal diseases featuring subretinal spots (retinitis punctata albescens and fundus albipunctatus) and patients with typical dominant or recessive retinitis pigmentosa for mutations in RDH5. Mutations were found only in two unrelated patients, both with fundus albipunctatus; they segregated with disease in the respective families. Recombinant mutant 11-cis retinol dehydrogenases had reduced activity compared with recombinant enzyme with wild-type sequence. Our results suggest that mutant alleles in RDH5 are a cause of fundus albipunctatus, a rare form of stationary night blindness characterized by a delay in the regeneration of cone and rod photopigments.","dc:creator":"Yamamoto H","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase cause delayed dark adaptation and fundus albipunctatus."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:300816cf-9f5e-4faa-a318-b5fb987e3534","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:efd81d52-6cd7-45f1-ba95-6f3c37f9955e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Data from the eyeInegration database (https://eyeintegration.nei.nih.gov/), which integrates RNA-seq data from GTex (for non-eye tissues) and RNA-seq data from various databases for eye tissues, showed that RDH5 is most highly expressed in RPE, and also in adipose tissue and breast tissue.

Rdh5-/- mice developed normally, including their retinas (Fig 3), with no appreciable loss of photoreceptors. The fundus appeared normal and punctata were not present. \nMice had normal rod and cone responses and, unlike humans, dark adaptation was normal except after high bleaching levels when dark adaptation was delayed. In summary, the phenotype in mice appears milder than in humans. Of note, a large increase in the 11-cis-retinyl ester concentration was noticed in the knockout mice compared with wild type. While punctata were not observed in the knock out mice, it is suspected that the punctate in humans may represent local accumulations of 11- and 13-cis-retinyl esters, which does correspond to the observation of elevated 11- cis-retinyl esters in mice.

Homozygous 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase mutants developed normally, including their retinas. There was no appreciable loss of photoreceptors. Recently, mutations in the 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase gene in humans have been associated with fundus albipunctatus. In 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase knockout mice, the appearance of the fundus was normal and punctata typical of this human hereditary ocular disease were not present. A second typical symptom associated with this disease is delayed dark adaptation. Homozygous 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase mutants showed normal rod and cone responses. 11-cis-Retinol dehydrogenase knockout mice were capable of dark adaptation. At bleaching levels under which patients suffering from fundus albipunctatus could be detected unequivocally, 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase knockout animals displayed normal dark adaptation kinetics. However, at high bleaching levels, delayed dark adaptation in 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase knockout mice was noticed. Reduced 11-cis-retinol oxidation capacity resulted in 11-cis-retinol/13-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinyl/13-cis-retinyl ester accumulation. Compared with wild-type mice, a large increase in the 11-cis-retinyl ester concentration was noticed in 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase knockout mice. In the murine retinal pigment epithelium, there has to be an additional mechanism for the biosynthesis of 11-cis-retinal which partially compensates for the loss of the 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase activity. 11-cis-Retinyl ester formation is an important part of this adaptation process. Functional consequences of the loss of 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase activity illustrate important differences in the compensation mechanisms between mice and humans. We furthermore demonstrate that upon 11-cis-retinol accumulation, the 13-cis-retinol concentration also increases. This retinoid is inapplicable to the visual processes, and we therefore speculate that it could be an important catabolic metabolite and its biosynthesis could be part of a process involved in regulating 11-cis-retinol concentrations within the retinal pigment epithelium of 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase knockout mice.","dc:creator":"Driessen CA","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Disruption of the 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase gene leads to accumulation of cis-retinols and cis-retinyl esters."},"rdfs:label":"Rdh5 knock-out mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score is reduced because these mice appear to have a milder phenotype than humans, with delayed dark adaptation only under conditions of high bleaching, and no evidence of flecks in the retina (punctata).

The inheritance is often recessive and as such, CSNB may be more common among populations with a high degree of consanguinity. Here, we present a topic update and a review of the clinical and molecular genetic spectrum of CSNB in Saudi Arabia. Since a major review article on CSNB in 2015, which described 17 genes underlying CSNB, an additional four genes have been incriminated in autosomal recessive CSNB: RIMS2, GNB3, GUCY2D and ABCA4. These have been associated with syndromic cone-rod synaptic disease, ON bipolar cell dysfunction with reduced cone sensitivity, CSNB with dysfunction of the phototransduction (Riggs type) and CSNB with cone-rod dystrophy, respectively. In Saudi Arabia, a total of 24 patients with CSNB were identified, using a combination of literature search and retrospective study of previously unpublished cases. Recessive mutations in TRPM1 and CABP4 accounted for the majority of cases (5 and 13 for each gene, respectively). These genes were associated with complete (cCSNB) and incomplete (icCSNB), respectively, and were associated with high myopia in the former and hyperopia in the latter. Four novel mutations were identified. For the first time, we describe the fundus albipunctatus in two patients from Saudi Arabia, caused by recessive mutation in RDH5 and RPE65, where the former in addition featured findings compatible with cone dystrophy. No cases were identified with any dominantly inherited CSNB.","dc:creator":"Almutairi F","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Congenital stationary night blindness: an update and review of the disease spectrum in Saudi Arabia."}},"rdfs:label":"Pt.

Biallelic variants in RDH5 have been reported in individuals with various clinical features. Many individuals are reported to have fundus albipunctatus, with night blindness from childhood, stationary or slow progression of rod abnormalities, frequent and progressive cone abnormalities in older age, the presence of white dots in the retina, and cone dystrophy developing with age in some patients while others have been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. Due to the variability in phenotype, for this curation, these phenotypes have been lumped together as âRDH5-related retinopathyâ. To date, over 40 variants in the RDH5 gene have been reported in individuals with retinal dystrophy, and most of them are missense variants (Skorczyk-Werner et al 2015, PMID 25820994). Here, eleven unique variants in eleven probands were curated from seven publications (Yamamoto et al, 1999, PMID 10369264; Gonzalez-Fernandez et al, 1999, PMID 10617778; Nakamura et al, 2000, PMID 11053295; Wada et al, 2001, PMID 11448328; Pras et al, 2012, PMID 22815624; Almutairi et al, 2020, PMID 33369259; Katagiri et al, 2020, PMID 32232344). These variants included missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants in addition to one variant, c.928delCinsGAAG (p.Leu310GluVal), which is commonly identified in Japanese patients (Nakamura et al, 2000, PMID 11053295; Katagiri et al, 2020, PMID 32232344; Skorczyk-Werner et al 2015, PMID 25820994). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Of note, in two reported patients, only a single variant was identified (Pras et al, 2012, PMID: 22815624). However, there is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that a single RDH5 variant can cause retinal disease. \nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the function of the RDH5 gene product in the visual cycle, which is consistent with the features noted in patients with biallelic variants (Driessen et al, 1995, PMID 7544779), the expression pattern of RDH5, specifically in the retinal pigment epithelium (Driessen et al, 1995, PMID 7544779; Swamy and McGaughey, 2019, PMID 31343654), physical interaction of RDH5 with RPE65, another gene implicated in retinal dystrophy with a role in the visual cycle (Aoun et al, 2021, PMID 34281261), and the features of an rdh5 knock-out mouse (Driessen et al, 2000, PMID 10825191).\nIn summary, RDH5 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RDH5-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP (SOP v8) on September 2, 2021.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
