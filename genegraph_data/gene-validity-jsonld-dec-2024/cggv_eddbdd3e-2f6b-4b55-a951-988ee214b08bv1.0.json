disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases. Recent whole exome sequencing studies indicated that genes associated with different neurological diseases are shared across disorders and converge on common functional pathways. Using the Ion Torrent platform, we developed a low-cost next-generation sequencing gene panel that has been transferred into clinical practice, replacing single disease-gene analyses for the early diagnosis of individuals with ID/ASD. The gene panel was designed using an innovative in silico approach based on disease networks and mining data from public resources to score disease-gene associations. We analyzed 150 unrelated individuals with ID and/or ASD and a confident diagnosis has been reached in 26 cases (17%). Likely pathogenic mutations have been identified in another 15 patients, reaching a total diagnostic yield of 27%. Our data also support the pathogenic role of genes recently proposed to be involved in ASD. Although many of the identified variants need further investigation to be considered disease-causing, our results indicate the efficiency of the targeted gene panel on the identification of novel and

in KATNAL2 have been reported in numerous individuals with complex neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability [PMID: 32094338, 31209962, 28191889] and autism spectrum disorder [PMID: 32094338, 31209962, 28191889, 25621899, 22495306, 22495309, 25363760, 30504930, 31398340, 31981491]; the first report was published in 2012 in autism [PMID: 22495309]. At least 32 variants have been reported (3 nonsense, 5 frameshift, 5 splice site, 17 missense, and 2 CNV deletions); 4 were de novo, 12 inherited (including 7 truncating variants), and 6 were of unknown inheritance.  It is unlikely that these variants are the cause for the neurodevelopmental disorders present in these individuals. In many of the reported cases, the variants are inherited from parents that are either reportedly unaffected or have no phenotype information, they do not segregate with disease [PMID: 25621899, 28191889, 32094338], or are present in population databases at frequencies too high to be causative of disease [PMID: 28191889, 31981491]. In addition, KATNAL2 truncating variants have also been reported in controls [PMID: 25363760, 30208311, 31981491]. Further, per data from gnomAD, KATNAL2 appears to be tolerant of variation in general - the gene is not constrained for either missense or protein truncating variants.  This makes it difficult to discern a potential disease mechanism and raises the question of whether the variants reported in the affected individuals occurred just by chance.  In our review of the literature, we found no compelling genetic evidence in humans to support the relationship between KATNAL2 and complex neurodevelopmental disorders.
