A genome-wide scan mapped the deafness trait to 10q21-22 (max LOD score of 4.0; D10S196) and fine mapping revealed a 16 Mb ancestral haplotype in deaf relatives. The PCDH15 gene was mapped within the critical region and was an interesting candidate because truncating mutations cause Usher syndrome type IF (USH1F) and two missense mutations have been previously associated with isolated deafness (DFNB23). Sequencing of the PCDH15 gene revealed 33 sequencing variants. Three of these variants were homozygous exclusively in deaf siblings but only one of them was not seen in ethnically matched controls. This novel c.1583 T>A transversion predicts an amino-acid substitution of a valine with an aspartic acid at codon 528 (V528D). Like the two DFNB23 mutations, the V528D mutation in Family A occurs in a highly conserved extracellular cadherin (EC) domain of PCDH15 and is predicted to be more deleterious than the previously identified DFNB23 missense mutations (R134G and G262D). Physical assessment, vestibular and visual function testing in deaf adults ruled out syndromic deafness because of Usher syndrome. This study validates the DFNB23 designation and supports the hypothesis that missense mutations in conserved motifs of PCDH15 cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. This emerging genotype-phenotype correlation in USH1F is similar to that in several other USH1 genes and cautions against a prognosis of a dual sensory loss in deaf children found to be homozygous for hypomorphic mutations at the USH1F locus.","dc:creator":"Doucette L","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Profound, prelingual nonsyndromic deafness maps to chromosome 10q21 and is caused by a novel missense mutation in the Usher syndrome type IF gene PCDH15."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19107147","rdfs:label":"PID IV-4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Did not score this family becasue theere are 3 non segregations where affected family members only inherited 1 copy of the V528D allele."},{"id":"cggv:d421a00c-6180-4a17-9333-205ae4792e1f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6b55f7e8-c84e-46a2-aa23-83f4f34cc3cc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0011476","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"GJB2 screening and clinical questionnaire to rule out history of other possible casuees of HL.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:d421a00c-6180-4a17-9333-205ae4792e1f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:7d1bc1d1-e9bc-42c6-8863-442a9a4f2c70","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142769.2(PCDH15):c.4726C>T (p.Gln1576Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16609567"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28281779","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To investigate the causative genetic mutations in 12 Pakistani families with nonsyndromic or syndromic hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Wang R","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Molecular Analysis of Twelve Pakistani Families with Nonsyndromic or Syndromic Hearing Loss."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28281779","rdfs:label":"F9 IV:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"downgrade"},{"id":"cggv:8565f46c-f503-4741-bfce-ddf02a6cfbf8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:491ef61f-af11-4b8c-a720-001fa4823dc1","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis identified PCDH15 haplotype and Sanger identified 3 different variants.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the family","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"linkage analysis identified 3 different Pakistani families with a different PCDH15-linked haplotype.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:8565f46c-f503-4741-bfce-ddf02a6cfbf8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:e7f07379-883b-4f26-be98-bf2ce071612b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033056.3(PCDH15):c.785G>A (p.Gly262Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA253345"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14570705","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recessive splice site and nonsense mutations of PCDH15, encoding protocadherin 15, are known to cause deafness and retinitis pigmentosa in Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F).

Building on these observations, we describe an updated gene structure that has four additional exons of PCDH15 and isoforms that can be subdivided into four classes. Human PCDH15 encodes three alternative, evolutionarily conserved unique cytoplasmic domains (CD1, CD2 or CD3). Families ascertained on the basis of prelingual hearing loss were screened for linkage of this phenotype to markers for PCDH15 on chromosome 10q21.1. In seven of twelve families segregating USH1, we identified homozygous mutant alleles (one missense, one splice site, three nonsense and two deletion mutations) of which six are novel. One family was segregating nonsyndromic deafness DFNB23 due to a homozygous missense mutation.

LHFPL5 is distributed throughout the bundle, including on stereocilia tips and the kinocilium. At P3, 4-to-6 rows of ranked stereocilia are evident, total LHFPL5 expression peaks, and LHFPL5 is localised to ranked stereocilia tips of all rows and to lower shaft/ankle links. By P12, the bundle has a mature pattern with 3 ranked rows but virtually no unranked stereocilia or kinocilium; LHFPL5 expression has declined and become restricted to the tips of shorter stereocilia.

In P3 mice lacking PCDH15, LHFPL5 labelling is not at the tips but is primarily on unranked stereocilia and lower lateral links.

Mapping and sequencing showed that noddy mutant mice harbor an isoleucine-to-asparagine (I108N) mutation in the EC1 repeat of PCDH15. Residue I108 interacts with CDH23 EC2 in the handshake and its mutation impairs the interaction in vitro. The noddy mutation allowed us to determine the consequences of blocking the handshake in vivo: tip link formation and bundle morphology are disrupted, and mechanotransduction channels fail to remain open at rest.

Here, we provide evidence that mutations at these two cadherin loci can interact to cause hearing loss in digenic heterozygotes of both species. Using a classical genetic approach, we generated mice that were heterozygous for both Cdh23 and Pcdh15 mutations on a uniform C57BL/6J background. Significant levels of hearing loss were detected in these mice when compared to age-matched single heterozygous animals or normal controls. Cytoarchitectural defects in the cochlea of digenic heterozygotes, including degeneration of the stereocilia and a base-apex loss of hair cells and spiral ganglion cells, were consistent with the observed age-related hearing loss of these mice beginning with the high frequencies. In humans, we also have obtained evidence for a digenic inheritance of a USH1 phenotype in three unrelated families with mutations in CDH23 and PCDH15. Altogether, our data indicate that CDH23 and PCDH15 play an essential long-term role in maintaining the normal organization of the stereocilia bundle.","dc:creator":"Zheng QY","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Digenic inheritance of deafness caused by mutations in genes encoding cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15 in mice and humans."},"rdfs:label":"Digenic Mice w/ Double Het CDH23/PCDH15"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"this mouse model was not scored because it could also be scored for an Usher syndrome mouse model because vision loss is not a requirement for scoring Usher mouse models."},{"id":"cggv:6bbdba00-e1f7-4545-8670-ce3afa5a89f0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4972adb-b3e0-4418-9a8b-ff417088c0e7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The mouse model could be used as a mouse model for Usher Syndrome.

Mutation in Pcdh15 affects stereocilia morphogenesis and polarity. Disruptions of apical cellular components in outer hair cells have also been described in av mutants. Organization of stereocilia and cell polarization may be dependent on proper orientation of structural components residing in the apical portion of the cell during development. We used electron and immunofluorescent microscopy to examine structural maturation of outer hair cells in av3J mice with emphasis on the fonticulus, basal body/centriole complex, actin mesh, and the microtubule network during initiation of bundle organization, between embryonic day (E) 16.5 and postnatal day 5 (P5). We found major ultrastructural rearrangements near the hair cell surface in av3J mice. Earliest changes were in kinocilia, basal body, and stereocilia positioning and microtubule arrangement once the kinocilia had lateralized to the side of the cell (between E16.5 and postnatal day [P] 0, before cuticular plate formation and stereocilia elongation). By P0, the developing fonticulus in av mice appeared enlarged, with a normal vesicle density. Stereocilia bundle disorganization increased after P0, with disruptions of the actin mesh within the cuticular plate. These observations support the hypothesis that mutations in Pcdh15 in av3J mice adversely affect coordinated maturation of apical cell components, resulting in disturbed stereocilia bundle polarity in av mice.","dc:creator":"Kikkawa YS","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Development of outer hair cells in Ames waltzer mice: mutation in protocadherin 15 affects development of cuticular plate and associated structures."},"rdfs:label":"Ames waltzer PCDH15 Mutant mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The Ames Walzter mouse model is associated with Usher syndrome and therefore cannot be scored for ARNSHL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":507,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":4.8,"subject":{"id":"cggv:052a55be-65cf-470b-a5f3-120473fbaf80","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:14674","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between PCDH15 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 12/8/2017. The PCDH15 gene has previously been classified as Definitive for Usher syndrome by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Expert Panel. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities of Usher syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss. Variants in PCDH15 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Ahmed et al., PMID 14570705). There are many cases in the literature claiming non-syndromic hearing loss with PCDH15 variants however many of the variants were not scored due to lack of convincing evidence of pathogenicity or lack of information of phase. However, at least 4 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, truncating nonsense, frameshift) with sufficient evidence to score reported in humans with sufficient electroretinography or age-dependent phenotyping to rule out Usher syndrome. These variants were detected in a large Pakistani family with non-syndromic hearing loss with no history of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (age range 13-44) (Ahmed 2003 14570705); a Chinese family that was claimed to be non-consanguineous with non-syndromic HL (18 year old proband and 28 year old brother w/ HL)  (Zhan 2015 25930172); a 21 y.o. male noted to have no other symptoms (Wang 2017 28281779). There were some patients described to have no ERG's conducted so Usher syndrome could not be ruled out (Yang 2013 23767834). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and protein interaction studies (PMIDs: 25467981, 16807332, 11138007, 28263850, 14570705). However, many of the cases do not provide ages for individuals which makes this scoring susceptible to including cases that may develop late-onset RP. Therefore, the association between PCDH15 and ARNSHL is Limited. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/19/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:48910592-40d6-4eb7-a53c-4b0883070287"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
