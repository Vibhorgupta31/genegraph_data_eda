CAV1 and CAV2 organize membrane lipid rafts (MLRs) important for cell signaling and neuronal survival, and overexpression of CAV1 ameliorates ALS phenotypes in vivo. Genome-wide association studies localize a large proportion of ALS risk variants within the non-coding genome, but further characterization has been limited by lack of appropriate tools. By designing and applying a pipeline to identify pathogenic genetic variation within enhancer elements responsible for regulating gene expression, we identify disease-associated variation within CAV1/CAV2 enhancers, which replicate in an independent cohort. Discovered enhancer mutations reduce CAV1/CAV2 expression and disrupt MLRs in patient-derived cells, and CRISPR-Cas9 perturbation proximate to a patient mutation is sufficient to reduce CAV1/CAV2 expression in neurons. Additional enrichment of ALS-associated mutations within CAV1 exons positions CAV1 as an ALS risk gene. We propose CAV1/CAV2 overexpression as a personalized medicine target for ALS.","dc:creator":"Cooper-Knock J","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Rare Variant Burden Analysis within Enhancers Identifies CAV1 as an ALS Risk Gene."},"rdfs:label":"Cooper-Knock- Enhancers to CAV1/CAV2 espression linked to ALS"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":7317,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":3.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0ff87a71-0627-4f0e-b657-766911efadb4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0004976","gene":"hgnc:1528","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Variants in the CAV2 gene have not been reported in relation any disease. CAV2 gene is known to be co-localized with CAV1 gene and has not been associated with any disease independently.  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability for these assertions. Therefore, these assertions have been split into the following disease entities: autosomal dominant Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH3), Congenital Lipodystrophy (CGL3) and Familial Lipodystrophy – Type 7 (FPLD7). This curation for autosomal dominant ALS does not include probands from the other reported diseases. \nHeterozygous missense variants in enhancer regions of the CAV2 gene have been reported till date in individuals with ALS (PMIDs: 33264630).  In all instances of literature when available, affected probands with CAV1/CAV2 enhancer variants are identified to have dysregulated caveolar protein expression levels (PMIDs: 33264630, 36937187, 30894019). The maximum score for genetic evidence reached is 3.5 (Limited 0-6). Evidence supporting this gene disease pair also includes experimental data from patient lymphoblastoid cells and and IPSC derived neurons measuring expression of the calveolar protein (33264630, 36937187, 30894019).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
