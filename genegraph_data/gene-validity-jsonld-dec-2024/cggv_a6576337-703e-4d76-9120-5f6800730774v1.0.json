However, mtDNA sequencing is not routinely available in rapid genetic diagnosis programs, which may fail to diagnose mtDNA mutation-associated diseases. Herein, we explored the clinical utility of rapid exome sequencing combined with mtDNA sequencing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected genetic disorders. Rapid clinical exome sequencing (CES) was performed as a first-tier test in 40 critically ill pediatric patients (aged from 6 days to 15 years) with suspected genetic conditions. Blood samples were also collected from the parents for trio analysis. Twenty-six patients presented with neuromuscular abnormalities or other systemic abnormalities, suggestive of suspected mitochondrial diseases or the necessity for a differential diagnosis of other diseases, underwent rapid mtDNA sequencing concurrently.

We studied an antibody-deficient patient suffering from recurrent respiratory infections and with impaired antibody responses to vaccinations. Patient's B cells showed impaired Ca(2+) influx upon stimulation with anti-IgM and lacked detectable CD19 membrane expression. CD19 sequence analysis revealed a homozygous missense mutation resulting in a tryptophan to cystein (W52C) amino acid change. The affected tryptophan is CONSERVED-TRP 41 located on the C-strand of the first extracellular IgSF domain of CD19 and was found to be highly conserved, not only in mammalian CD19 proteins, but in nearly all characterized IgSF domains. Furthermore, the tryptophan is present in all variable domains in Ig and TR and was not mutated in 117 Ig class-switched transcripts of B cells from controls, despite an overall 10% amino acid change frequency. In vitro complementation studies and CD19 western blotting of patient's B cells demonstrated that the mutated protein remained immaturely glycosylated.

However, mature CD19-/- B cells show a profound deficiency in responding to protein antigens that require T-cell help.

Thus CD19 is crucial for both initial B-cell activation by T-cell-dependent antigens and the maturation and/or selection of the activated cells into the memory compartment.

On mature B cells, CD19, CD81, CD21 and CD225 form the CD19 complex that signals in conjunction with the B cell antigen receptor (BcR), thereby decreasing the threshold for BcR-dependent signaling. Biallelic variation in this gene thus results in profound hypogammaglobulinemia due to a poor response to antigen. These patients are characterized by moderately severe hypogammaglobulinemia, impaired antibody responses on vaccination, and impaired memory B-cell formation. This gene-disease relationship is supported by both genetic and experimental evidence. At least eight variants (missense, splice site, and frameshift) have been reported in seven probands (PMIDs: 16672701, 21159371, 24684239, 34490048 and 21330302) and three additional affected family members. A role in disease is supported by the function of *CD19* in lowering the threshold for antigen receptor stimulation (PMID: 1373518), which is disrupted in patient cells (PMID: 16672701). Expression of *CD19* during B-cell differentiation provides further evidence; the surface molecule CD19 appears early and remains on the B cell until it differentiates into a plasma cell (PMID: 6408173). A CD19-/- mouse model recapitulates the profound deficiency in responding to protein antigens as well as impaired response to vaccination (PMID: 7543183) and live virus (PMID: 9653091). Recapitulation of hypogammaglobulinemia in the CD19-/- mouse can be rescued by human CD19 (PMID: 9144478). In summary *CD19* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive immunodeficiency, common variable, 3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a6576337-703e-4d76-9120-5f6800730774"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
