The mutant zebrafish (with knockdown of CSRP1 via two morpholino oligonucleotides against CSRP1) show cardiac bifida. In the mutants, the expression domain of GATA4 moved laterally, causing a bigger gap in the middle portion. HAND2, which has expression in the cardiac mesoderm of the wild type, had expression in wider regions of the mutant. Expression of endodermal markers like GATA5 and BMP2B was found in the endoderm below the cardiac mesoderm in the wild type. In the mutants, this expression was expanded.

Csrp1 interacts with Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) and Diversin (Div), which control cell morphology and other dynamic cell behaviors via the noncanonical Wnt and JNK pathways. When csrp1 message is knocked down, abnormal convergent extension cell movement is induced, resulting in severe deformities in midline structures. In addition, cardiac bifida is induced as a consequence of defects in cardiac mesoderm cell migration. Our data highlight Csrp1 as a key molecule of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, which orchestrates cell behaviors during dynamic morphogenetic movements of tissues and organs.","dc:creator":"Miyasaka KY","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Csrp1 regulates dynamic cell movements of the mesendoderm and cardiac mesoderm through interactions with Dishevelled and Diversin."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish expression analysis "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7481c1c6-6109-478b-ad2b-0322477c220f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dce55449-9048-4894-8de0-e8ec19f0700c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Fetal expression data from Descartes shows very high expression in this heart.

One variant (frameshift) that has been reported in three affected probands from one family in one publication (PMIDs: 29326753) is included in this curation. This variant was not scored due to assertion for digenic inheritance with *TRPS1*. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence; Descartes fetal expression data, PMID: 17592114). Expression-level evidence in zebrafish with knockdown of CSRP1 is indicative of cardiac bifida. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CSRP1 *and autosomal dominant Congenital Heart Disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role CSRP1 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date July 2nd 2024 (SOP Version 10). \nThere is only one case of genetic evidence, which is not scored as a digenic mode of inheritance is suggested. Thus, disputed was determined to be the appropriate classification.
