About 20% of melanoma-prone families bear a mutation in the CDKN2A locus, which encodes two unrelated proteins, p16INK4A and p14ARF. Mutations in the other locus, CDK4, are much rarer and have been linked to the disease in only three families worldwide. In the 1960s, a large Norwegian pedigree with multiple atypical nevi and malignant melanomas was identified. Subsequently, six generations and more than 100 family members were traced and 20 cases of melanoma verified. In this article, we report that CDK4 codon 24 is mutated from CGT to CAT (Arg24His) in this unusually large melanoma kindred. Intriguingly, one of the family members had ocular melanoma, but the CDK4 mutation could not be detected in archival tissue samples from this subject. Thus, the case of ocular melanoma in this family was sporadic, suggesting an etiology different from that of the skin tumors. The CDK4 mutation in the Norwegian family was identical to that in melanoma families in France, Australia, and England. Haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers flanking the CDK4 gene and single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene did not support the possibility that there was a common founder, but rather indicated at least two independent mutational events. All CDK4 melanoma families known to date have a substitution of amino acid 24. In addition to resulting from selection pressure, this observation may be explained by the CG dinucleotide of codon 24 representing a mutational hot spot in the CDK4 gene.","dc:creator":"Molven A","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"A large Norwegian family with inherited malignant melanoma, multiple atypical nevi, and CDK4 mutation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15880589","rdfs:label":"III‐12, IV‐1, IV‐2, and IV‐22"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"CDK4 Arg24His is one of the most familial CDK4 variants, with known gain of function of CDK4. p16INK4A cannot inhibit the CDK4 kinase activity resulting in the progression of the cell cycle.Variant segregated with disease in this huge family."},{"id":"cggv:079b079f-ba41-48ca-bd10-c167c9cba0ed_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da333740-96cf-4e8c-985c-eaaac5ebcba5","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) for all family member, Proband's PCR result was cloned and sequenced and found  nucleotide 297 C>T (not correct HGVS, it should be c.70C>T) ,  result in Arg24Cys","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0012056","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:079b079f-ba41-48ca-bd10-c167c9cba0ed_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4092434c-7853-4586-8f16-93bfe7d8a23b"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8528263"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8528263","rdfs:label":"II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"CDK4 Arg24Cys is one of the most familial CDK4 variants, with known gain of function of CDK4. p16INK4A cannot inhibit the CDK4 kinase activity resulting in the progression of the cell cycle.

We show that the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 causes a significant decrease in tumor growth in a xenotransplantation mouse model of human melanoma. shRNA knockdown of either CDK4 or CDK6 significantly reduces cell proliferation and impedes their migratory capacity in vitro, which translates into a strong inhibition of tumor growth in xenotransplantation experiments. CDK4/6 inhibition results not only in the pronounced reduction of cell proliferation but also in an impaired tumor angiogenesis. CDK6 knockdown in melanoma cell lines impairs VEGF-A expression and reduces the potential stimulation of endothelial cell growth. The knockdown of CDK4 ends in similar results. The effect is caused by changes of CDK6 localization, less CDK6 is detected on the VEGF-A promoter. Bioinformatic analysis of human melanoma patient data verifies the key role of CDK6 in tumor angiogenesis in melanoma.

The importance of the CDK4 locus in human cancer first became evident following the identification of a germ line CDK4-Arg24Cys (R24C) mutation, which abolishes the ability of CDK4 to bind to p16(INK4a). To determine the role of the Cdk4(R24C) germ line mutation in the genesis of other cancer types, we introduced the R24C mutation in the Cdk4 locus of mice by using Cre-loxP-mediated \"knock-in\" technology. Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) displayed increased Cdk4 kinase activity resulting in hyperphosphorylation of all three members of the Rb family, pRb, p107, and p130. MEFs derived from Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mice displayed decreased doubling times, escape from replicative senescence, and escape sensitivity to contact-induced growth arrest. These MEFs also exhibited a high degree of susceptibility to oncogene-induced transformation, suggesting that the Cdk4(R24C) mutation can serve as a primary event in the progression towards a fully transformed phenotype. In agreement with the in vitro data, homozygous Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mice developed tumors of various etiology within 8 to 10 months of their life span. The majority of these tumors were found in the pancreas, pituitary, brain, mammary tissue, and skin. In addition, Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mice showed extraordinary susceptibility to carcinogens and developed papillomas within the first 8 to 10 weeks following cutaneous application of the carcinogens 9,10-di-methyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). This report formally establishes that the activation of Cdk4 is sufficient to promote cancer in many tissues. The observation that a wide variety of tumors develop in mice harboring the Cdk4(R24C) mutation offers a genetic proof that Cdk4 activation may constitute a central event in the genesis of many types of cancers in addition to melanoma.","dc:creator":"Rane SG","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Germ line transmission of the Cdk4(R24C) mutation facilitates tumorigenesis and escape from cellular senescence."},"rdfs:label":"Cdk4 R24C/R24C mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Systemic in-vitro study to indicate CDK4 R24C is present as gain of function during tumorigenesis."},{"id":"cggv:cbdefa0f-6df1-487a-8f9d-aef0dd4a2064","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:22908894-ffa3-4176-965c-decd0a7fdba1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"By 8 to 10 months, homozygous Cdk4R24C/R24C mice developed tumors in multiple organs,\nclearly demonstrating the consequence of deregulated Cdk4 expression","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11756559","rdfs:label":"CDK4  R24C/R24C mutation homozygous mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":639,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:9c1c1a3b-c61a-47bd-82cb-c5a6a55a4adf","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012183","gene":"hgnc:1773","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CDK4 was the second high risk melanoma susceptibility gene identified . CDK4 is an oncogene located within the 12q14 chromosomal region and encodes a protein that controls cell cycle progression through the G1 phase. To date mutations in this gene have been described in 17 melanoma-prone families and in all of them the mutation affects the same amino acid (Arginine 24): p.Arg24Cys and p.Arg24His (Potrony M, et al. 2015. PMID: 26488006). These R24C and R24H mutations lead to CDK4 behaving as a dominant oncoprotein through loss of binding to p16, its negative regulator. Thus, when CDK4 is mutated, p16INK4A cannot inhibit the CDK4 kinase activity resulting in the progression of the cell cycle.  In an analysis of 17 families, median age at first melanoma diagnosis was 39 years, and the lifetime mutation penetrance based on the available data was estimated at 74%(Read J, et al. 2016.PMID: 26337759). Phenotypically, individuals with CDK4 mutations cannot be distinguished from those with CDKN2A mutations . Both mutations are characterized by numerous atypical nevi and multiple primary melanomas.(Lee KC, et al. 2015.
