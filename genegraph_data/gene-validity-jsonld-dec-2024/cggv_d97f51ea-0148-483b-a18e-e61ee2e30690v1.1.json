Recently, two heterozygous truncating mutations of the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor MPL, coded by the c-mpl gene, were identified in a 10-year-old Japanese patient with CAMT transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner. Here, we report for the first time two different MPL amino-acid substitutions in a 2-year-old Italian boy with CAMT and compound heterozygosis for two (c-mpl point mutations. C-to-T transitions were detected on exons 5 and 12 at the 769 and 1904 cDNA nucleotide positions, respectively. The mutation in exon 5 substitutes an arginine with a cysteine (R257C) in the extracellular domain, 11 amino acids distant from the WSXWS motif conserved in the cytokine-receptor superfamily. The mutation in exon 12 substitutes a proline with a leucine (P635L) in the last amino acid of the C-terminal intracellular domain, responsible for signal transduction. As in the Japanese family, the mutations were both transmitted from the parents. TPO plasma levels were highly increased in the patient. The patient's 7-year-old brother, who was a candidate donor for allografting, turned out to be an asymptomatic heterozygous carrier of P635L and showed defective megakaryocyte colony formation from bone-marrow progenitor cells. The present study provides important confirmation that CAMT can be associated with (c-mpl) mutations.","dc:creator":"Tonelli R","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Compound heterozygosity for two different amino-acid substitution mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl gene) in congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT)."}},{"id":"cggv:53d3f0be-7250-4324-90f2-b3536678a244_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:80789112-f5fb-400c-98ed-11760ab13d79"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11071383"}],"rdfs:label":"III7"},{"id":"cggv:72bb8f8f-0f0c-422d-a98a-ea21a42201ff","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72bb8f8f-0f0c-422d-a98a-ea21a42201ff_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:72bb8f8f-0f0c-422d-a98a-ea21a42201ff_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"By in vitro cellular studies in K562 human leukemia cells, Tijssen et al.

The disease presents with severe thrombocytopenia and absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Furthermore, CAMT patients may develop bone marrow aplasia. To obtain more insight into the mechanism underlying CAMT, five children were analysed. All patients had increased plasma thrombopoietin (Tpo) levels, indicating a platelet production defect. Bone marrow-derived CD34+ stem cells from three patients were cultured in an in vitro liquid culture system to study megakaryocytopoiesis. CD34+ cells from two of the three patients failed to differentiate into megakaryocytes. The lack of megakaryocyte formation could imply that a defect in the c-mpl gene, encoding the Tpo receptor, exists. Sequencing of c-mpl revealed mutations in four of five patients. Three patients had point mutations and/or a deletion in the coding regions of c-mpl. All point mutations led to an amino acid substitution or to a premature stop codon. In one patient, a homozygous mutation in the last base of intron 10 was found that resulted in loss of a splice site. This study showed that mutations in c-mpl could be the cause of thrombocytopenia in CAMT in the majority of patients. Furthermore, Tpo has been shown to have an anti-apoptotic effect on stem cells. Therefore, mutations in c-mpl might not only affect megakaryocyte formation but may also impair stem cell survival, which could explain the occurrence of bone marrow failure as final outcome in patients with CAMT.","dc:creator":"van den Oudenrijn S","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor, Mpl, in children with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia."}},{"id":"cggv:cb4a9fe5-3925-4aba-8337-3248d79bcfe4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f93467b5-cf76-499a-80f3-d36f2f020b17"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10971406"}],"rdfs:label":"1"},{"id":"cggv:7852afae-27dc-46be-a26e-2d76894efe14","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7852afae-27dc-46be-a26e-2d76894efe14_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:cb4a9fe5-3925-4aba-8337-3248d79bcfe4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb4a9fe5-3925-4aba-8337-3248d79bcfe4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:dc1b6c60-15cf-4238-a687-80ec7790e825_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc1b6c60-15cf-4238-a687-80ec7790e825","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0fdcb1d0-ca55-45d6-9f09-8bdab5f3833b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005373.3(MPL):c.378del (p.Phe126LeufsTer5)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA160817"}},"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard\nprocedures.

Our previous hematological analysis indicated similarities between human CAMT and murine c-mpl (thrombopoietin receptor) deficiency. Because the c-mpl gene was considered as one of the candidate genes for this disorder, we analyzed the genomic sequence of the c-mpl gene of a 10-year-old Japanese girl with CAMT. We detected two heterozygous point mutations: a C-to-T transition at the cDNA nucleotide position 556 (Q186X) in exon 4 and a single nucleotide deletion of thymine at position 1,499 (1,499 delT) in exon 10. Both mutations were predicted to result in a prematurely terminated c-Mpl protein, which, if translated, lacks all intracellular domains essential for signal transduction. Each of the mutations was segregated from the patient's parents. Accordingly, the patient was a compound heterozygote for two mutations of the c-mpl gene, each derived from one of the parents. The present study suggests that at least a certain type of CAMT is caused by the c-mpl mutation, which disrupts the function of thrombopoietin receptor.","dc:creator":"Ihara K","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Identification of mutations in the c-mpl gene in congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia."}},{"id":"cggv:e22b57a7-84ed-49b6-bcd4-3e150e36d3d0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d83fa854-a451-4dd5-9ea5-b445da9d9b18"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10077649"}],"rdfs:label":"II1"},{"id":"cggv:e22b57a7-84ed-49b6-bcd4-3e150e36d3d0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e22b57a7-84ed-49b6-bcd4-3e150e36d3d0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:c2f6f123-cb51-4c80-87ad-94546b11a010","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2f6f123-cb51-4c80-87ad-94546b11a010_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"NMD is predicted and the expression of the c-mpl gene was not detected by reverse transcription–PCR in the marrow mononuclear cells of this patient in PMID 9029014"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ef2d0397-452b-4aaf-b8ed-a91350c1ebfb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ef2d0397-452b-4aaf-b8ed-a91350c1ebfb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:396765f2-5cc5-400c-a341-2cf2a904b003","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005373.3(MPL):c.127C>T (p.Arg43Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA806582"}},"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard procedures.

To study the lineage distribution of Mpl-R in normal hematopoietic cells, we developed a monoclonal antibody (designated M1 MoAb) by immunizing mice with a soluble form of the human Mpl-R protein. With few exceptions, Mpl-R was detected by indirect immunofluorescent analysis on all human leukemic hematopoietic cell lines with pluripotential and megakaryocytic phenotypes, but not on other cell lines. By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, M1 MoAb recognized a band at 82 to 84 kD corresponding to the expected size of the glycosylated receptor. Among normal hematopoietic cells, M1 MoAb strongly stained megakaryocytes (MK) and Mpl-R was detected on platelets by indirect immunofluorescence staining or immunoblotting. On purified CD34+ cells, less than 2% of the population was stained, but the labeling was weak and just above the threshold of detection. However, dual-labeling with the M1 and antiplatelet glycoprotein MoAbs showed that most Mpl-R+/CD34+ cells coexpressed CD41a, CD61, or CD42a, suggesting that cell surface appearance of Mpl-R and platelet glycoproteins could be coordinated. M1-positive and M1-negative subsets were sorted from purified CD34+ cell populations. Colony assays showed that the absolute number of hematopoietic progenitors was extremely low and no primitive progenitors were present in the CD34+/Mpl-R+ fraction. However, this cell fraction was significantly enriched in low proliferative colony-forming units-MK. When the CD34+/Mpl-R+ fraction was grown in liquid culture containing human aplastic serum and a combination of growth factors, mature MK were seen as early as day 4, whereas the predominant cell population was erythroblasts on day 8. Similar data were also obtained with the CD34+/Mpl-R- fraction with, however, a delay in the time of appearance of both MK and erythroblasts. In conclusion, Mpl-R is a cytokine receptor restricted to the MK cell lineage. Its expression is low on CD34+ cells and these cells mainly correspond to late MK progenitors and transitional cells. These data indicate that the action of the Mpl-R ligand might predominate during the late stages of human MK differentiation.","dc:creator":"Debili N","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"The Mpl receptor is expressed in the megakaryocytic lineage from late progenitors to platelets."},"rdfs:label":"MPL expression in the Megakaryocytic Lineage"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Megakaryocytes and platelets show MPL expression and these are the cells involved in CAMT"},{"id":"cggv:df4f4a9e-f3dd-48d8-aa82-d44d805e06e4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4691ff55-07e2-47c9-9d93-7d27eecdea10","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"MPL is the receptor for TPO.

This study was undertaken to further delineate the putative binding domain on the Mpl receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that within the Mpl-EC domain 1 (Mpl-EC-D1), amino acids 102-251 were strongly involved in ligand binding. We subsequently expressed five subdomains within this region with T7 phage display. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays identified a short stretch of peptide located between residues 206 and 251 as the minimum binding domain for both TPO and hNUDC. A series of sequential Ala replacement mutations in the region were subsequently used to identify the specific residues most involved in ligand binding. Our results point to two hydrophobic residues, Leu(228) and Leu(230), as having substantial effects on hNUDC binding. For TPO binding, mutations in residues Asp(235) and Leu(239) had the largest effect on binding efficacy. In addition, deletion of the conservative motif WGSWS reduced binding capacity for hNUDC but not for TPO.

Mutations in MPL can drastically impair its function and be a contributing factor in multiple hematologic malignancies, including congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT). CAMT is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia at birth, which progresses to bone marrow failure and pancytopenia. Here we report unique familial cases of CAMT that presented with a previously unreported MPL mutation: T814C (W272R) in the background of the activating MPL G117T (K39N or Baltimore) mutation. Confocal microscopy, proliferation and surface biotinylation assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and western blotting analysis were used to elucidate the function and trafficking of Mpl mutants. Results showed that Mpl protein bearing the W272R mutation, alone or together with the K39N mutation, lacks detectable surface expression while being strongly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calreticulin. Both WT and K39N-mutated Mpl were found to be signaling competent, but single or double mutants bearing W272R were unresponsive to Tpo. Function of the deficient Mpl receptor could be rescued by using 2 separate approaches: (1) GRASP55 overexpression, which partially restored Tpo-induced signaling of mutant Mpl by activating an autophagy-dependent secretory pathway and thus forcing ER-trapped immature receptors to traffic to the cell surface; and (2) CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing used to repair MPL T814C mutation in transfected cell lines and primary umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells.

Somatic variants in MPL are also associated with Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (OMIM 254450) that we did not curate because somatic. \n\nThe MPL gene encodes the receptor for thrombopoietin, a hematopoietic growth factor that regulates the development of megakaryocytes and platelets as well as the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells.\n\nMPL was first reported in relation to Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia (CAMT) in 1999 (Ihara et al., PMID 10077649) in a Japanese 10 year-old girl with thrombocytopenia and absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.

More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 6 POINTS \nThis gene-disease association is supported by evidences of expression: MPL was found expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets, the cells involved in CAMT. It was not detectable on granulocytic cells, blast cells, and lymphocytes (PMID 7529061).\nEvidence of protein interaction: Chen et al. showed that MPL physically interacts with TPO upon immunoprecipitation for TPO and western blotting with an anti- MPL antibody. Moreover, they show that within the Mpl extracellular domain amino acids 102–251 are strongly involved in ligand binding and that mutations in residues Asp235 and Leu239 had the largest effect on decreasing binding efficacy (PMID: 20529857). \n\nEvidence of functional alteration in patient cells is also present: iPSCs were generate from skin fibroblasts of a patient with CAMT generated few MKs or platelets, even in the presence of TPO, these results were further confirmed by the failure of TPO stimulation to induce phosphorylation of mediators downstream of MPL (pAKT, pERK1/2, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5) (PMID: 23908116). \n\nA mouse model knockout for MPL demonstrated that the expression of MPL is crucial for megakaryocyte and platelet formation, and recapitulated the thrombocytopenia and megakaryocytopenia phenotypes of patients with CAMT (PMID: 8630375).\nMoreover, a thrombocytopenic zebrafish model of human CAMT was described to have thrombocytopenia and significantly increased bleeding after injury of the tail (PMID:27811851).\n\nFinally, experimental evidence of rescue in patient cells is available: gene editing was able to restore normal function in CD34+ cells from a patient with the W272R variant. Indeed, edited CD34+ displayed similar amounts of surface Mpl proteins as control CD34+ and were able to generate a significantly higher number of megakaryocytic colonies in the presence of Tpo than unedited cells from the patient (PMID: 29296828).\n\nIn summary, MPL is definitively associated with CAMT. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on 7/22/20 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d97f51ea-0148-483b-a18e-e61ee2e30690"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
