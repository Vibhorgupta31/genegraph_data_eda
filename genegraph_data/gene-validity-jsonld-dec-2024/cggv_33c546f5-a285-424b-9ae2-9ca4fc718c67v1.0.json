It usually presents in infancy and is genetically heterogeneous, but most individuals with mitochondrial complex IV (or cytochrome c oxidase) deficiency have mutations in the biogenesis factor SURF1. We studied eight complex IV-deficient LS individuals from six families of Lebanese origin. They differed from individuals with SURF1 mutations in having seizures as a prominent feature. Complementation analysis suggested they had mutation(s) in the same gene but targeted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of 1,034 genes encoding known mitochondrial proteins failed to identify a likely candidate. Linkage and haplotype analyses mapped the location of the gene to chromosome 19 and targeted MPS of the linkage region identified a homozygous c.3G>C (p.Met1?) mutation in C19orf79. Abolishing the initiation codon could potentially still allow initiation at a downstream methionine residue but we showed that this would not result in a functional protein. We confirmed that mutation of this gene was causative by lentiviral-mediated phenotypic correction. C19orf79 was recently renamed PET100 and predicted to encode a complex IV biogenesis factor. We showed that it is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and forms a âˆ¼300 kDa subcomplex with complex IV subunits. Previous proteomic analyses of mitochondria had overlooked PET100 because its small size was below the cutoff for annotating bona fide proteins. The mutation was estimated to have arisen at least 520 years ago, explaining how the families could have different religions and different geographic origins within Lebanon.","dc:creator":"Lim SC","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"A founder mutation in PET100 causes isolated complex IV deficiency in Lebanese individuals with Leigh syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24462369","rdfs:label":"Lim_Individual_B1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The variant described is a founder mutation.

The PET100 gene has been cloned by complementation of pet100-1, sequenced and disrupted. PET100 is located adjacent to the PDC2 gene on chromosome IV and contains an open reading frame of 333 base pairs. The PET100 protein contains a possible membrane-spanning segment and a putative mitochondrial import sequence at its NH2 terminus. A strain carrying a null mutation in PET100 lacks cytochrome c oxidase activity and assembled cytochromes a and a3, but the other respiratory chain carriers are present. The respiratory-deficient phenotype of this strain is not rescued by added hemin or heme A. These findings indicate that the mutation is specific for cytochrome c oxidase and does not affect the biosynthesis of heme A. In addition, mitochondria from the strain carrying a null mutation in PET100 contain each of the subunit polypeptides of cytochrome c oxidase.

Two unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar. Complex IV deficiency is the disease mechanism for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1 publication (PMID 24462369). This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product and studies in patient cell lines.
