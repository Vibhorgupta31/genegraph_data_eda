The affected individuals of this family exhibited pre-lingual, severe-to-profound degrees of mixed hearing loss. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, which consists of six paralogs in mammals. Several members of the ELMO family have been shown to regulate a subset of GTPases within the Ras superfamily. However, ELMOD3 is a largely uncharacterized protein that has no previously known biochemical activities. We found that in rodents, within the sensory epithelia of the inner ear, ELMOD3 appears most pronounced in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells. Fluorescently tagged ELMOD3 co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton in MDCK cells and actin-based microvilli of LLC-PK1-CL4 epithelial cells. The p.Leu265Ser mutation in the ELMO domain impaired each of these activities. Super-resolution imaging revealed instances of close association of ELMOD3 with actin at the plasma membrane of MDCK cells. Furthermore, recombinant human GST-ELMOD3 exhibited GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity against the Arl2 GTPase, which was completely abolished by the p.Leu265Ser mutation. Collectively, our data provide the first insights into the expression and biochemical properties of ELMOD3 and highlight its functional links to sound perception and actin cytoskeleton.

In the present study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to establish an Elmod3 knockout mice line in the C57BL/6 background (hereinafter referred to as Elmod3-/- mice) and investigated the role of Elmod3 in the cochlea and auditory function. Elmod3-/- mice started to exhibit hearing loss from 2Â months of age, and the deafness progressed with aging, while the vestibular function of Elmod3-/- mice was normal. We also observed that Elmod3-/- mice showed thinning and receding hair cells in the organ of Corti and much lower expression of F-actin cytoskeleton in the cochlea compared with wild-type mice. The deafness associated with the mutation may be caused by cochlear hair cells dysfunction, which manifests with shortening and fusion of inner hair cells stereocilia and progressive degeneration of outer hair cells stereocilia.

At least one homozygous missense variant has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, expression data, biochemical function data, and a null mouse model. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been assessed separately. Summary of Case Level Data: 3 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication and segregated with disease in 5 additional family members (Jaworek et al., PMID: 24039609). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, biochemical function data, and a null mouse model (PMIDs: 31628468, 24039609). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
