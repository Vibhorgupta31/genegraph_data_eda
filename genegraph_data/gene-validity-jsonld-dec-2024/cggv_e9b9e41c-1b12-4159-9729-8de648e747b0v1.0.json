All 3 mutant SLITRK6 proteins displayed defective cell surface localization. High-resolution MRI of WT and Slitrk6-deficient mouse eyes revealed axial length increase in the mutant (the endophenotype of myopia). Additionally, mutant mice exhibited auditory function deficits that mirrored the human phenotype. Histological investigation of WT and Slitrk6-deficient mouse retinas in postnatal development indicated a delay in synaptogenesis in Slitrk6-deficient animals.

A total of 423 children with SNHL were evaluated, with the focus on the determination of causative genetic and acquired etiologies of uni- and bilateral SNHL in relation to age at diagnosis and severity of the hearing loss. We found that a stepwise diagnostic approach comprising of imaging, genetic, and/or pediatric evaluation identified a cause for SNHL in 67% of the children. The most common causative finding in children with bilateral SNHL was causative gene variants (26%), and in children with unilateral SNHL, a structural anomaly of the temporal bone (27%). The probability of finding an etiologic diagnosis is significantly higher in children under the age of 1 year and children with profound SNHL.Conclusions: With our stepwise diagnostic approach, we found a diagnostic yield of 67%. Bilateral SNHL often has a genetic cause, whereas in unilateral SNHL structural abnormalities of the labyrinth are the dominant etiologic factor. The diagnostic yield is associated with the age at detection and severity of hearing loss: the highest proportion of causative abnormalities is found in children with a young age at detection or a profound hearing loss. What is Known: • Congenital sensorineural hearing loss is one of the most common congenital disorders • Determination of the cause is important for adequate management and prognosis and may include radiology, serology, and DNA analysis What is New: • Using a stepwise diagnostic approach, causative abnormalities are found in 67% both in uni- and bilateral SNHL, with the highest diagnostic yield in very young children and those suffering from profound hearing loss • Bilateral SNHL often has a genetic cause, whereas in unilateral SNHL structural abnormalities of the labyrinth are the dominant etiologic factor.","dc:creator":"van Beeck Calkoen EA","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"The etiological evaluation of sensorineural hearing loss in children."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31152317","rdfs:label":"Calkoen proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Waiting to hear from corresponding author with further methods and phenotypic data.

They also show similarities to Ntrk neurotrophin receptors in their carboxy-termini, sharing a conserved tyrosine residue. Among 6 Slitrk family genes in mammals, Slitrk6 has a unique expression pattern, with strong expression in the sensory epithelia of the inner ear. We generated Slitrk6-knockout mice and investigated the development of their auditory and vestibular sensory organs. Slitrk6-deficient mice showed pronounced reduction in the cochlear innervation. In the vestibule, the innervation to the posterior crista was often lost, reduced, or sometimes misguided. These defects were accompanied by the loss of neurons in the spiral and vestibular ganglia. Cochlear sensory epithelia from Slitrk6-knockout mice have reduced ability in promoting neurite outgrowth of spiral ganglion neurons. Indeed the Slitrk6-deficient inner ear showed a mild but significant decrease in the expression of Bdnf and Ntf3, both of which are essential for the innervation and survival of sensory neurons. In addition, the expression of Ntrk receptors, including their phosphorylated forms was decreased in Slitrk6-knockout cochlea. These results suggest that Slitrk6 promotes innervation and survival of inner ear sensory neurons by regulating the expression of trophic and/or tropic factors including neurotrophins from sensory epithelia.","dc:creator":"Katayama K","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Disorganized innervation and neuronal loss in the inner ear of Slitrk6-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Katayama Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e9b9e41c-1b12-4159-9729-8de648e747b0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:21f5f1b5-e19d-4822-9190-813c9c7183ac","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9355a716-61c4-4b49-95aa-0fd9d3a412da","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Investigated ocular phenotype of null mice.
