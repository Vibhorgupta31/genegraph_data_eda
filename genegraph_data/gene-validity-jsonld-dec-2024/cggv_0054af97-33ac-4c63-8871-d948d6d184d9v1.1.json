Recently, mutations in five genes from the pre-replication complex (ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6), crucial in cell-cycle progression and growth, were identified in individuals with MGS. Here, we report on genotype-phenotype studies in 45 individuals with MGS (27 females, 18 males; age 3 months-47 years). Thirty-five individuals had biallelic mutations in one of the five causative pre-replication genes. No homozygous or compound heterozygous null mutations were detected. In 10 individuals, no definitive molecular diagnosis was made. The triad of microtia, absent/hypoplastic patellae, and short stature was observed in 82% of individuals with MGS. Additional frequent clinical features were mammary hypoplasia (100%) and abnormal genitalia (42%; predominantly cryptorchidism and hypoplastic labia minora/majora). One individual with ORC1 mutations only had short stature, emphasizing the highly variable clinical spectrum of MGS. Individuals with ORC1 mutations had significantly shorter stature and smaller head circumferences than individuals from other gene categories. Furthermore, compared with homozygous missense mutations, compound heterozygous mutations appeared to have a more severe effect on phenotype, causing more severe growth retardation in ORC4 and more frequently pulmonary emphysema in CDT1. A lethal phenotype was seen in four individuals with compound heterozygous ORC1 and CDT1 mutations. No other clear genotype-phenotype association was observed. Growth hormone and estrogen treatment may be of some benefit, respectively, to growth retardation and breast hypoplasia, though further studies in this patient group are needed.","dc:creator":"de Munnik SA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Meier-Gorlin syndrome genotype-phenotype studies: 35 individuals with pre-replication complex gene mutations and 10 without molecular diagnosis."}},{"id":"cggv:d70a734e-bff0-4389-9d71-dc9ac20ffae9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:22b46a52-40e9-41c2-9d6d-33efbec73973"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22333897"}],"rdfs:label":"de Munnik proband 2"},{"id":"cggv:11c05c9e-8722-49b5-903c-fb1c5fd789f5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11c05c9e-8722-49b5-903c-fb1c5fd789f5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:11c05c9e-8722-49b5-903c-fb1c5fd789f5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 36012502- in vitro minigene assay in transfected confirmed elimination of exon 4 in HEK293T cells transfected with variant "}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d70a734e-bff0-4389-9d71-dc9ac20ffae9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d70a734e-bff0-4389-9d71-dc9ac20ffae9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:07f89863-2925-4a19-888f-df3ca3cd1b53_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07f89863-2925-4a19-888f-df3ca3cd1b53","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:22b46a52-40e9-41c2-9d6d-33efbec73973"},{"id":"cggv:5f08845f-4a62-4ec4-ad92-fcb5ab168269"}],"detectionMethod":"proband-only exome sequencing; targeted genotyping in parents","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0008551","obo:HP_0006498","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0002983"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"prenatal karyotype: 46, XY","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:fbcc9859-d3fa-4c8e-b618-1650a842455e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:22b46a52-40e9-41c2-9d6d-33efbec73973"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36012502","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Meier−Gorlin syndrome (MGS) is a rare genetic developmental disorder that causes primordial proportional dwarfism, microtia, the absence of or hypoplastic patellae and other skeletal anomalies. Skeletal symptoms overlapping with other syndromes make MGS difficult to diagnose clinically. We describe a 3-year-old boy with short stature, recurrent respiratory infections, short-rib dysplasia, tower head and facial dysmorphisms who was admitted to the Tomsk Genetic Clinic to verify a clinical diagnosis of Jeune syndrome. Clinical exome sequencing revealed two variants (compound heterozygosity) in the ORC6 gene: c.2T>C(p.Met1Thr) and c.449+5G>A. In silico analysis showed the pathogenicity of these two mutations and predicted a decrease in donor splicing site strength for c.449+5G>A. An in vitro minigene assay indicated that variant c.449+5G>A causes complete skipping of exon 4 in the ORC6 gene. The parents requested urgent prenatal testing for MGS for the next pregnancy, but it ended in a miscarriage. Our results may help prevent MGS misdiagnosis in the future. We also performed in silico and functional analyses of ORC6 mutations and developed a restriction fragment length polymorphism and haplotype-based short-tandem-repeat assay for prenatal genetic testing for MGS. These findings should elucidate MGS etiology and improve the quality of genetic counselling for affected families.","dc:creator":"Nazarenko MS","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Meier-Gorlin Syndrome:

This six-protein complex binds replication origin DNA, recruits other initiation factors, and facilitates loading of the DNA helicase. Studying the function of individual ORC subunits during pre-RC formation has been hampered by the requirement of most subunits for DNA binding. In this study, we investigate the function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Orc6, the only ORC subunit not required for DNA binding. In vivo, depletion of Orc6 inhibits prereplicative complex (pre-RC) assembly and maintenance. In vitro, ORC lacking Orc6 fails to interact with Cdt1 and to load the Mcm2-7 helicase onto origin DNA. We demonstrate that two regions of Orc6 bind Cdt1 directly, and that the extreme C terminus of Orc6 (Orc6-CTD) interacts tightly with the remaining five ORC subunits. Replacing Orc6 with a fusion protein linking Cdt1 to the Orc6-CTD results in an ORC complex that loads Mcm2-7 onto DNA. Interestingly, this complex can only perform a single round of Mcm2-7 loading, suggesting that a dynamic association of Cdt1 with ORC is required for multiple rounds of Mcm2-7 loading.","dc:creator":"Chen S","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Orc6 is required for dynamic recruitment of Cdt1 during repeated Mcm2-7 loading."},"rdfs:label":"yeast-2-hybrid"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f0bea289-b50f-4e1f-a2b2-73a8a4f03b3d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c875a038-15bf-46be-8834-0315b9923433","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"DNA replication defects cause growth deficiency","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17283052","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) is a DNA replication initiator protein in eukaryotes that defines the localization of the origins of replication.

Orc6 binds DNA fragments containing Drosophila origins of DNA replication and prefers poly(dA) sequences. We have defined the core replication domain of the Orc6 protein which does not include the C-terminal domain. Further analysis of the core replication domain identified amino acids that are important for DNA binding by Orc6. Alterations of these amino acids render reconstituted Drosophila ORC inactive in DNA binding and DNA replication. We show that mutant Orc6 proteins do not associate with chromosomes in vivo and have dominant negative effects in Drosophila tissue culture cells.

Lethal alleles of orc6 are defective in DNA replication and also show abnormal chromosome condensation and segregation. The analysis of cells containing the orc6 deletion revealed that they arrest in both the G(1) and mitotic stages of the cell cycle. Orc6 deletion can be rescued to viability by a full-length Orc6 transgene. The expression of mutant transgenes of Orc6 with deleted or mutated C-terminal domain results in a release of mutant cells from G(1) arrest and restoration of DNA replication, indicating that the DNA replication function of Orc6 is associated with its N-terminal domain. However, these mutant cells accumulate at mitosis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of Orc6 is important for the passage through the M phase.

The origin recognition complex (ORC) assembles at origins of replication and recruits additional proteins of the pre-replication complex needed to initiate DNA replication (Klingseisen and Jackson, 2011, PMID: 21979914). ORC6 was first reported in relation to Meier-Gorlin syndrome 3 in 2011 (Bicknell et al., PMID: 21358632). Meier-Gorlin syndrome 3 is an autosomal recessive primordial dwarfism characterized by a clinical triad of ​patellar aplasia or hypoplasia, microtia, and prenatal-onset growth deficiency. Additional common features include microcephaly, cryptorchidism, breast agenesis, feeding problems, pulmonary emphysema, skeletal anomalies, and distinctive facial features described as microstomia, micrognathia, full lips, high forehead, and narrow nose with a high nasal bridge (Nielsen-Dandoroff et al., 2023, PMID:37059840). At least 3 missense, 1 splice region, 1 start-loss, and 1 nonsense variant have been reported in nine affected individuals in six families described in four publications and included in this curation (PMID: 21358632; De Munnik et al., 2012, PMID: 22333897; Nazarenko et al. 2022,, PMID: 36012502; Li et al., 2022, PMID: 34850017). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence of ORC6 biochemical function, protein interaction, functional alteration, and animal models (Prasanth et al., 2002, PMID: 12169736; Basalov et al., 2007, PMID: 17283052; Chen et al., 2007, PMID: 18006685; Basalov et al., 2009, PMID: 19541634; Basalov et al., 2015, PMID: 26139588; Basalov et al., 2020, PMID: 33037049). The proposed mechanism of disease is partial loss-of-function. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between ORC6 and Meier-Gorlin syndrome 3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Syndromic Disorders GCEP on July 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0054af97-33ac-4c63-8871-d948d6d184d9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
