OI results from mutations affecting the pro alpha 1 or pro alpha 2 gene of type I collagen. We describe a strain of mice with a nonlethal recessively inherited mutation (oim) that results in phenotypic and biochemical features that simulate moderate to severe human OI. The phenotype of homozygous oim mice includes skeletal fractures, limb deformities, generalized osteopenia, and small body size. Their femurs are smaller and demonstrate marked cortical thinning and fewer medullary trabeculae than those of wild-type mice. Breeding studies show the mutation is inherited in most crosses as a single recessive gene on chromosome 6, near the murine Cola-2 gene. Biochemical analysis of skin and bone, as well as isolated dermal fibroblast cultures, demonstrate that alpha 1(I) homotrimeric collagen accumulates in these tissues and is secreted by fibroblasts. Short labeling studies in fibroblasts demonstrate an absence of pro alpha 2(I) collagen chains. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA encoding the COOH-propeptide reveals a G deletion at pro alpha 2(I) nucleotide 3983; this results in an alteration of the sequence of the last 48 amino acids. The oim mouse will facilitate the study of type I collagen-related skeletal disease.","dc:creator":"Chipman SD","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Defective pro alpha 2(I) collagen synthesis in a recessive mutation in mice: a model of human osteogenesis imperfecta."},"rdfs:label":"OIM mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6987,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d62ef3df-60f1-4f9d-a546-73bc49c4bf6a","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009804","gene":"hgnc:2198","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*COL1A2* has been repeatedly described in association with autosomal dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type 3. OI Type 3 is characterized by the presence of severe bone fragility, multiple fractures present at birth, bone malformations, short stature, dentinogenesis imperfecta, macrocephaly, hearing loss, and blue sclerae that can normalize with age. At least 15 missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. *COL1A2* has been noted to be associated with multiple disease entities. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities,  osteogenesis imperfecta type II (OMIM:166210), osteogenesis imperfecta type III (OMIM:259420), osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV (OMIM:166220), Combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 2 (OMIM:619120), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 2 (OMIM:617821), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cardiac valvular type (OMIM:225320), and Osteoporosis, postmenopausal. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 21 probands across 10 papers.(PMIDs: 8081394, 7860070, 7749416, 19208385, 19208385, 8950681, 10807697, 24668929, 34306033, 10408781). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models (PMID: 8446583). OIM mice demonstrate phenotypic and biochemical features similar to those seen in moderate to severe human OI Type 3. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COL1A2* and autosomal dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 3/2/22 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:55bdf3bb-05f8-49e8-bc3a-d1c66cbbdeca"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
