Recently, we used homozygosity mapping in consanguineous Middle Eastern kindreds to localize the AE gene to an approximately 3.5-cM region on 8q24. In this article, we identify a gene, SLC39A4, located in the candidate region and, in patients with AE, document mutations that likely lead to the disease. The gene encodes a histidine-rich protein, which we refer to as \"hZIP4,\" which is a member of a large family of transmembrane proteins, some of which are known to serve as zinc-uptake proteins. We show that Slc39A4 is abundantly expressed in mouse enterocytes and that the protein resides in the apical membrane of these cells.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of ZIP4 in the pathogenesis of this condition has yet to be established. In this study, we report the role of ZIP4 in human epidermis. ZIP4 is predominantly expressed in human keratinocytes, and its expression is dramatically reduced on epidermal differentiation. ZIP4 knockdown in human keratinocytes down-regulates zinc (Zn) levels and the transcriptional activity of a key epidermal Zn-binding protein, ΔNp63, and dysregulates epidermal differentiation in a reconstituted human skin model, resulting in the appearance of proliferating keratinocytes even in the uppermost layers of the skin. We verified that, among the amino acid residues in its Zn-binding motif, Cys205 is critical for the processing and nuclear distribution of ΔNp63 and, therefore, Zn-dependent transcriptional activity. Our results suggest that ZIP4 is essential for maintaining human epidermal homeostasis through the regulation of Zn-dependent ΔNp63 activity and can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the cutaneous symptoms observed in Acrodermatitis enteropathica patients.","dc:creator":"Bin BH","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"An Acrodermatitis Enteropathica-Associated Zn Transporter, ZIP4, Regulates Human Epidermal Homeostasis."},"rdfs:label":"ZIP4 contributes epidermis formation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c7c59cc4-8756-459a-8ab7-36202ccce1b7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1adccea8-dfba-4b5a-8bb2-4e2d2edf52df","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Skin lesion is the most common phenotype observed in AE patient due to zinc deficiny caused by ZIP4 mutations.

Loss-of-function mutations of human ZIP4 (hZIP4) drastically reduce zinc absorption, causing a life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE). These mutations occur not only in the conserved transmembrane zinc transport machinery, but also in the extracellular domain (ECD) of hZIP4, which is only present in a fraction of mammalian ZIPs. How these AE-causing ECD mutations lead to ZIP4 malfunction has not be fully clarified. In this work, we characterized all seven confirmed AE-causing missense mutations in hZIP4-ECD and found that the variants exhibited completely abolished zinc transport activity in a cell-based transport assay. Although the variants were able to be expressed in HEK293T cells, they failed to traffic to the cell surface and were largely retained in the ER with immature glycosylation. When the corresponding mutations were introduced in the ECD of ZIP4 from Pteropus Alecto, a close homolog of hZIP4, the variants exhibited structural defects or reduced thermal stability, which likely accounts for intracellular mistrafficking of the AE-associated variants and as such a total loss of zinc uptake activity.

The human ZIP4 gene (SLC39A4) was identified because of its association with acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE), a genetic disorder of zinc absorption. To date, several SLC39A4 mutations have been identified in AE patients. To investigate the effects of these mutations on function of the Zip4 transporter, we introduced six AE-associated missense mutations into the orthologous mouse ZIP4 gene for functional expression in cultured cells. All mutations decreased 65Zn uptake activity of mZip4, thereby providing a causal link to AE. The mutants fell into two groups based on their phenotypic effects. Several alleles (G340D, L382P, G384R, G643R) failed to localize on the cell surface at high levels. These defects were attributable to misfolding and/or mislocalization in the secretory pathway. Two other alleles (P200L and G539R) accumulated to high levels in the plasma membrane and had wild-type apparent Km values for 65Zn uptake. However, these mutations decreased the Vmax of uptake to approximately 30% of wild-type. We showed previously that wild-type mZip4 is regulated post-translationally in response to zinc status. In zinc-replete cells, mZip4 is found largely in intracellular compartments. In zinc-limited cells, surface levels increase markedly because the rate of endocytosis decreases. Surprisingly, endocytosis of both P200L and G539R is no longer zinc responsive; these proteins are endocytosed at a slow rate regardless of zinc status. These effects suggest a zinc sensing mechanism for regulating Zip4 trafficking in response to zinc.","dc:creator":"Wang F","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Acrodermatitis enteropathica mutations affect transport activity, localization and zinc-responsive trafficking of the mouse ZIP4 zinc transporter."},"rdfs:label":"ZIP4 mutants in TMD affected zinc tranport activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:738c3299-f18b-42d7-b854-df5d37a968c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50841c3f-a7c6-4d79-81e4-13cf5a046233","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mutant protein was trapped in ER and immaturely glycosylated, which caused the protein mislocation and lost its normal function.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33837739","rdfs:label":"Mutant proteins were processed incorrectly"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:246a0a3a-42ea-4c21-bfcd-2b970ea4328b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cbd42be9-f256-4761-a797-7ce4180fe0d7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The AE-associated variants had significantly diminished cell surface expression, which is likely responsible for loss of zinc transport activity.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33837739","rdfs:label":"The mutants diminished cell surface expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:6ba5370e-bfdd-4341-8486-b49e1e2eb4af_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c046297-07b7-43a8-a89c-4d67e40c383c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c70b753-17e1-436d-9c92-92b58383c6a7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"1.

We created a tamoxifen-inducible, enterocyte-specific knockout of this gene in mice which mimics this human disorder. We found that the enterocyte Zip4 gene in mice is essential throughout life, and loss-of-function of this gene rapidly leads to wasting and death unless mice are nursed or provided excess dietary zinc. An initial effect of the knockout was the reprogramming of Paneth cells, which contribute to the intestinal stem cell niche in the crypts. Labile zinc in Paneth cells was lost, followed by diminished Sox9 (sex determining region Y-box 9) and lysozyme expression, and accumulation of mucin, which is normally found in goblet cells. This was accompanied by dysplasia of the intestinal crypts and significantly diminished small intestine cell division, and attenuated mTOR1 activity in villus enterocytes, indicative of increased catabolic metabolism, and diminished protein synthesis. This was followed by disorganization of the absorptive epithelium. Elemental analyses of small intestine, liver, and pancreas from Zip4-intestine knockout mice revealed that total zinc was dramatically and rapidly decreased in these organs whereas iron, manganese, and copper slowly accumulated to high levels in the liver as the disease progressed. These studies strongly suggest that wasting and lethality in acrodermatitis enteropathica patients reflects the loss-of-function of the intestine zinc transporter ZIP4, which leads to abnormal Paneth cell gene expression, disruption of the intestinal stem cell niche, and diminished function of the intestinal mucosa. These changes, in turn, cause a switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism and altered homeostasis of several essential metals, which, if untreated by excess dietary zinc, leads to dramatic weight loss and death.","dc:creator":"Geiser J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A mouse model of acrodermatitis enteropathica: loss of intestine zinc transporter ZIP4 (Slc39a4) disrupts the stem cell niche and

We successfully treated the patient with zinc gluconate and vitamin C, and we detected a novel homozygous c.541_551dup (p.Leu186fsX38) mutation in the exon 3 of her SLC39A4 gene.","dc:creator":"Kilic M","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A Zinc Sulphate-Resistant Acrodermatitis Enteropathica Patient with a Novel Mutation in SLC39A4 Gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Kilic patient III-4"},{"id":"cggv:689df398-9e9c-482c-9af2-87c6d6e55a13","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:689df398-9e9c-482c-9af2-87c6d6e55a13_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"non-consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6ba5370e-bfdd-4341-8486-b49e1e2eb4af_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:85ca2b0b-d1ba-4758-a818-c446de23c2fd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85ca2b0b-d1ba-4758-a818-c446de23c2fd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:82bc9491-e048-45f2-a1b1-149591e0468d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_130849.4(SLC39A4):c.71del (p.Pro24ArgfsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA585824946"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002014","obo:HP_0011123","obo:HP_0011355","obo:HP_0008066","obo:HP_0007473","obo:HP_0031831","obo:HP_0033425"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:032c77c4-1f12-4665-a6a5-cf1fa215eb31_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:82bc9491-e048-45f2-a1b1-149591e0468d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056538","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Hammersen J","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Sustained Need for High-Dose Zinc Supplementation in Children With Acrodermatitis Enteropathica."}},"rdfs:label":"Hammersen Patient 4"},{"id":"cggv:032c77c4-1f12-4665-a6a5-cf1fa215eb31","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:032c77c4-1f12-4665-a6a5-cf1fa215eb31_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"consnafuinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:daae4bb7-557a-437d-b7e0-a7c195e97ba6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:daae4bb7-557a-437d-b7e0-a7c195e97ba6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a6bfe98a-7034-4a8a-ad71-2058f3a60dff","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_130849.4(SLC39A4):c.909G>C (p.Gln303His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116341"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008066","obo:HP_0003282","obo:HP_0025474","obo:HP_0031831"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:877e05e9-c469-4397-b8da-3ba86a8f811f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a6bfe98a-7034-4a8a-ad71-2058f3a60dff"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12787121","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by skin involvement due to defective intestinal zinc absorption. Usually, the skin lesions include erythema, erosions, and small blisters in perioral, perianal regions, and hands and feet, which develop soon after weaning from the breast. The acrodermatitis enteropathica gene has been localized to chromosomal region 8q24.3 and subsequently the SLC39A4 gene has been disclosed as the acrodermatitis enteropathica gene. SLC39A4 mutations have been demonstrated in several acrodermatitis enteropathica families, and in this study we have examined two Japanese acrodermatitis enteropathica families for SLC39A4 mutations. The mutation detection strategy consisted of polymerase chain reaction amplification of all 12 exons and flanking intronic sequences, followed by direct nucleotide sequencing. It revealed three novel mutations, 1017ins53, which creates a premature termination codon, and two mis-sense mutations, R95C and Q303H.","dc:creator":"Nakano A","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Novel

Blood tests revealed a markedly decreased level of plasma zinc, and his symptoms improved on oral zinc replacement. To confirm the diagnosis of AE from congenital zinc deficiency, direct sequencing analysis of SLC39A4 was performed and revealed that he was compound heterozygous for a known missense mutation (Arg95Cys) and a novel splicing mutation in the donor site of intron 7 (c.1287+2T>C).

11-month-old boy was brought to our clinic with superinfected, sharply-defined, symmetrical, erythematous macules and vesicles, some with yellowish-brownish crusts, on the cheeks, fingers, and in the diaper region. The suspected impetigo contagiosa had failed to respond to both topical antiseptic therapy and systemic antibiotics. Because of the unusual clinical picture and course, we measured the serum zinc level. A significantly reduced level of 2 μmol/l (normal range 9.2-18.4 μmol/l) was identified. Initial skin lesions had appeared one week after weaning (5th week after birth). Since the age of 8 months the infant had also had recurrent diarrhea. Two weeks after zinc-histidine substitution, the diarrhea ceased and skin lesions slowly disappeared. Molecular genetic testing for the SLC39A4 (zinc transporter) gene revealed compound heterozygosity for the previously unidentified mutations c.1465_1474+4del (p.?) and c.295G>A (p.Ala99Thr). The parents are healthy heterozygous gene carriers. The same compound heterozygosity was later detected in the newborn brother of our patient shortly after birth. A zinc deficiency could therefore be identified and treated before symptoms occurred. The inherited autosomal recessive zinc transporter deficiency is termed acrodermatitis enteropathica. Lifelong zinc substitution is recommended. A differential diagnosis can be difficult because bacterial and fungal superinfection is common in zinc deficiency. Precise diagnosis requires testing family members for the gene.","dc:creator":"Jung AG","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Acrodermatitis enteropathica: an uncommon differential diagnosis in childhood - first description of a new sequence variant."}},{"id":"cggv:62967e41-3e4d-4a61-b683-2d38d70a400c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fa8f8420-fb10-4fb4-83cd-1b87f2a4dbe5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21762381"}],"rdfs:label":"Jung Patient"},{"id":"cggv:62967e41-3e4d-4a61-b683-2d38d70a400c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62967e41-3e4d-4a61-b683-2d38d70a400c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:cc648d82-dc81-4de8-8275-0213a6c9b836","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc648d82-dc81-4de8-8275-0213a6c9b836_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c4fe6116-e4ca-4c4a-a203-b9307d3a5ba8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c4fe6116-e4ca-4c4a-a203-b9307d3a5ba8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":12,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:8d9eb6e7-e918-426d-967f-80718edefeb9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_130849.4(SLC39A4):c.926G>T (p.Cys309Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA372621691"}},{"id":"cggv:eea4e4dc-3fbf-49f6-8b2a-7c6f18ef7790","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_130849.4(SLC39A4):c.976+2T>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA372621422"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"poor metal state and weak cry","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0200041","obo:HP_0007473","obo:HP_0000737","obo:HP_0011355","obo:HP_0002164","obo:HP_0033425","obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0001508"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:cfa57353-28b7-499e-9b39-980c1308e83a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:eea4e4dc-3fbf-49f6-8b2a-7c6f18ef7790"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31987033","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary skin disease caused by mutations in the SLC39A4 gene and is characterized by periorificial dermatitis, alopecia and diarrhoea due to insufficient zinc absorption.

SLC39A4 gene encodes the Zrt-/Irt-like protein 4 (ZIP4) that is highly expressed in the small intestine and kidney. ZIP4 transports dietary zinc into enterocytes, and eventually arrive to target tissues and organs through blood circulation system. \nSLC39A4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) in 2002 (Wang et al., PMID: 11254458). The affected individuals typically present early onset erosive, inflammatory, erythematous and psoriatic skin lesions at periorofacial, perianal and acral regions. They may also exhibit sparse hair or alopecia, diarrhea, irritability, and growth delay. Most patients show reduced serum zinc levels. Twenty-one unique variants including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants that have been reported in 19 unrelated probands are included in this curation  (PMIDs: 11254458, 12032886, 12787121, 23430849, 26351177, 36479285, 32442281, 34625996, 31987033, 21165302, 21762381, 17573886, 28056538, 19416256, 18684156, 24962159, 30980548). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. Tamoxifen-induced intestine-ZIP4 knockout (KO) mice showed rapid weight loss, growth failure and early death, which could be rescued by addition of zinc in drinking water (PMID: 22737083). Zinc levels in the intestine, pancreas and liver were lower in KO mice than the control littermates. Loss-of-function of intestine ZIP4 leads to progressive and profound disorganization of villus and crypt architecture in intestine (PMID 22737083). Studies in cultured human keratinocytes and reconstituted skin model demonstrated that knockdown ZIP4 decreased the zinc in basal layer of epidermis, disrupted normal skin cell differentiation and epidermis formation, downregulated p63 expression and trafficking. This suggested that ZIP4 is involved in maintaining zinc homeostasis and epidermis development through regulating p63 activity and localization, and p63 downstream target genes (PMID: 27940220). Overexpression of AE-associated ZIP4 variants located in extracellular domain or transmembrane domains led to reduced zinc uptake and diminished membrane surface localization. The dysfunction of the ZIP4 mutant protein resulted from impaired glycosylation and retention in the ER (PMID: 14709598, 33837739). \nIn summary, SLC39A4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP on the meeting date September 13, 2024.
