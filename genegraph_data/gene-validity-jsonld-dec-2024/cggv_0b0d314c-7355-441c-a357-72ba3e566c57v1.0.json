Presently, at least 4 genes of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, DLD and DBT have been reported to cause MSUD. Furthermore, more than 265 mutations have been identified as the cause across different populations worldwide. Some studies have reported the data of gene mutations in Chinese people with MSUD. In this study, we present clinical characteristics and mutational analyses in five Chinese Han child with MSUD, which had been screened out by tandem mass spectrometry detection of amino acids in blood samples. High-throughput sequencing, Sanger sequence and real-time qualitative PCR were performed to detect and verify the genetic mutations. Six different novel genetic variants were validated in BCKDHB gene and BCKDHA gene, including c.523 T > C, c.659delA, c.550delT, c.863G > A and two gross deletions. Interestingly, 3 cases had identical mutation of BCKDHB gene (c.659delA). We predicted the pathogenicity and analyzed the clinical characteristics.

In contrast to classic MSUD, children with the intermittent form usually have an atypical clinical manifestation. Here, we describe the presenting symptoms and clinical course of a Chinese boy with intermittent MSUD. Mutation analysis identified two previously unreported mutations in exon 7 of the BCKDHB gene: c.767A > G (p.Y256C) and c.768C > G (p.Y256X); the parents were each heterozygous for one of these mutations. In silico analysis predicted Y256C probably affects protein structure; Y256X leads to a premature stop codon. This case demonstrates intermittent MSUD should be suspected in cases with symptoms of recurrent encephalopathy, especially ataxia or marked drowsiness, which usually present after the neonatal period and in conjunction with infection. symmetrical basal ganglia damage but normal myelination in the posterior limb will assist differential diagnosis; alloisoleucine is a useful diagnostic marker and mutation analysis may be of prognostic value.

Three novel mutations were identified in seven unrelated AJ patients with MSUD. The locations of the affected residues in the crystal structure of the E1beta subunit suggested possible mechanisms for the deleterious effects of these mutations. Large-scale population screening of AJ individuals for R183P, the mutation present in six of seven patients, revealed that the carrier frequency of the mutant allele was approximately 1/113; the patient not carrying R183P had a previously described homozygous mutation in the gene encoding the E2 subunit.

The disorder varies in severity and the clinical spectrum is quite broad with five recognized clinical variants that have no known association with genotype. The classic presentation occurs in the neonatal period with developmental delay, failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and maple syrup odor in the cerumen and urine, and can lead to irreversible neurological complications, including stereotypical movements, metabolic decompensation, and death if left untreated. Treatment consists of dietary restriction of BCAAs and close metabolic monitoring. Clinical outcomes are generally good in patients where treatment is initiated early. Newborn screening for MSUD is now commonplace in the United States and is included on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).

In a refined human E1b active-site structure, His291-alpha, which aligns with His407 in Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase and His263 in yeast transketolase, is on a largely ordered phosphorylation loop. The imidazole ring of His291-alpha in E1b coordinates to the terminal phosphate oxygen atoms of bound ThDP. The N3 atom of wild-type His146-beta', which can be protonated, binds a water molecule and points toward the aminopyrimidine ring of ThDP. Remarkably, the H291A-alpha mutation results in a complete order-to-disorder transition of the loop region, which precludes the binding of the substrate lipoyl-bearing domain to E1b. The H146A-beta' mutation, on the other hand, does not alter the loop structure, but nullifies the reductive acylation activity of E1b. Our results suggest that: 1) His291-alpha plays a structural rather than a catalytic role in the binding of cofactor ThDP and the lipoyl-bearing domain to E1b, and 2) His146-beta' is an essential catalytic residue, probably functioning as a proton donor in the reductive acylation of lipoamide on the lipoyl-bearing domain.","dc:creator":"Wynn RM","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Roles of His291-alpha and His146-beta' in the reductive acylation reaction catalyzed by human branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase: refined phosphorylation loop structure in the active site."},"rdfs:label":"Wynn 2003 Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Alterations in the active site of E1b resulted in a loss of overall activity of the BCKD complex.

In this study, we identified seven novel mutations in MSUD patients from Israel. These include C219W-alpha (TGC to TGG) in the E1alpha subunit; H156Y-beta (CAT to TAT), V69G-beta (GTT to GGT), IVS 9 del[-7:-4], and 1109 ins 8bp (exon 10) in the E1beta subunit; and H391R (CAC to CGC) and S133stop (TCA to TGA) affecting the E2 subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Recombinant E1 proteins carrying the C219W-alpha or H156Y-beta mutation show no catalytic activity with defective subunit assembly and reduced binding affinity for cofactor thiamin diphosphate. The mutant E1 harboring the V69G-beta substitution cannot be expressed, suggesting aberrant folding caused by this mutation. These E1 mutations are ubiquitously associated with the classic phenotype in homozygous-affected patients. The H391R substitution in the E2 subunit abolishes the key catalytic residue that functions as a general base in the acyltransfer reaction, resulting in a completely inactive E2 component. However, wild-type E1 activity is enhanced by E1 binding to this full-length mutant E2 in vitro. We propose that the augmented E1 activity is responsible for robust thiamin responsiveness in homozygous patients carrying the H391R E2 mutation and that the presence of a full-length mutant E2 is diagnostic of this MSUD phenotype. The present results offer a structural and biochemical basis for these novel mutations and will facilitate DNA-based diagnosis for MSUD in the Israeli population.","dc:creator":"Chuang JL","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Structural and biochemical basis for novel mutations in homozygous Israeli maple syrup urine disease patients: a proposed mechanism for the thiamin-responsive phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"Activity of BCKD Complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"E1 component of the BCKD complex carrying a missense variant was expressed in E. coli."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":350,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c7afdd73-d87c-4961-9d99-a39b26b6a9c5","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0023692","gene":"hgnc:987","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between BCKDHB and maple syrup urine disease (autosomal recessive) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September, 2018.

At least 15 variants ( missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes  case-level and experimental data. Approximately 35% of maple syrup urine disease cases can be attributed to pathogenic variants in BCKDHB (Strauss et al., 2006, PMID 20301495).  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical and in vitro assays.
