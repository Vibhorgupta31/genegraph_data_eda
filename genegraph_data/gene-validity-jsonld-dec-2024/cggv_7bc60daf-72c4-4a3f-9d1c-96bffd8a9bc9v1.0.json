In the present study, we performed mutation analysis of the GALNT3 gene in a multigenerational family, which was originally described to have an autosomal dominant form of tumoral calcinosis. We identified a novel splice site mutation in intron 1 (IVS1-2a-->t), likely leading to skipping of exon 2. The proband was a compound heterozygote for the splice site mutation and the previously reported nonsense mutation (484C-->T; R162X). His affected maternal great uncle was homozygous for the splice site mutation. Biallelic mutations found in two generations demonstrated that the family had pseudoautosomal dominant inheritance, confirming that tumoral calcinosis is in fact an autosomal recessive trait. However, genetic and biochemical findings suggest that carriers of a single mutation may also manifest subtle biochemical abnormalities. Furthermore, coexpression of GALNT3 and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a key regulator of phosphate homeostasis, in certain tissues suggests that O-glycosylation of FGF23 by GALNT3 may be necessary for proper function of FGF23.","dc:creator":"Ichikawa S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"A novel GALNT3 mutation in a pseudoautosomal dominant form of tumoral calcinosis: evidence that the disorder is autosomal recessive."}},{"id":"cggv:fac63183-2d51-47cd-9411-8aeaebfa6ef6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:35565302-33d3-4904-8c51-c35ee6dc2154"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15687324"}],"rdfs:label":"Ichikawa Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:97a4041b-7e37-4929-bf45-6ffe4fc9d4d3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97a4041b-7e37-4929-bf45-6ffe4fc9d4d3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:fac63183-2d51-47cd-9411-8aeaebfa6ef6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fac63183-2d51-47cd-9411-8aeaebfa6ef6_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d9dd63b7-ae5c-499a-aead-ecde73b560af_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9dd63b7-ae5c-499a-aead-ecde73b560af","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d081c569-35b9-4be4-b346-76fcc287981d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004482.4(GALNT3):c.485G>A (p.Arg162Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1941232"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Presented with a painful firm mass over the left lateral gluteal region, which was surgically excised.

Thus, inactivating GALNT3 mutations render FGF23 susceptible to proteolysis, thereby reducing circulating intact hormone levels and leading to hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis. To further delineate the role of glycosylation in the Fgf23 function, we generated an inducible FGF23 transgenic mouse expressing human mutant FGF23 (R176Q and R179Q) found in patients with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) and bred this animal to Galnt3 knockout mice, a model of familial tumoral calcinosis. Due to the low intact Fgf23 level, Galnt3 knockout mice with wild-type Fgf23 alleles were hyperphosphatemic. In contrast, carriers of the mutant FGF23 transgene, regardless of Galnt3 mutation status, had significantly higher serum intact FGF23, resulting in severe hypophosphatemia. Importantly, serum phosphorus and FGF23 were comparable between transgenic mice with or without normal Galnt3 alleles. To determine whether the presence of the ADHR mutation could improve biochemical and skeletal abnormalities in Galnt3-null mice, these mice were also mated to Fgf23 knock-in mice, carrying heterozygous or homozygous R176Q ADHR Fgf23 mutations. The knock-in mice with functional Galnt3 had normal Fgf23 but were slightly hypophosphatemic. The stabilized Fgf23 ADHR allele reversed the Galnt3-null phenotype and normalized total Fgf23, serum phosphorus, and bone Fgf23 mRNA. However, the skeletal phenotype was unaffected. In summary, these data demonstrate that O-glycosylation by ppGaINAc-T3 is only necessary for proper secretion of intact Fgf23 and, once secreted, does not affect Fgf23 function.

Galnt3-deficient mice also exhibited an inappropriately normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level and decreased alkaline phosphatase activity. Furthermore, renal expression of sodium-phosphate cotransporters and Kl were elevated in Galnt3-deficient mice. Interestingly, there were sex-specific phenotypes; only Galnt3-deficient males showed growth retardation, infertility, and significantly increased bone mineral density. In summary, ablation of Galnt3 impaired secretion of intact Fgf23, leading to decreased circulating Fgf23 and hyperphosphatemia, despite increased Fgf23 expression. Our findings indicate that Galnt3-deficient mice have a biochemical phenotype of tumoral calcinosis and provide in vivo evidence that Galnt3 plays an essential role in proper secretion of Fgf23 in mice.","dc:creator":"Ichikawa S","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Ablation of the Galnt3 gene leads to low-circulating intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23) concentrations and hyperphosphatemia despite increased Fgf23 expression."},"rdfs:label":"Galnt3 Gene Leads to Low-Circulating Intact Fibroblast Growt"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"Galnt3-deficient mice provide in vivo evidence that Galnt3 plays an essential role in proper secretion of Fgf23.

HFTC is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by the progressive deposition of basic calcium phosphate crystals in periarticular spaces, soft tissues, and sometimes bone. The disease can be caused by recessive mutations in at least two different genes: GalNAc transferase 3 (GALNT3), encoding a glycosyltransferase that initiates mucin-type O-glycosylation, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which encodes a regulator of phosphate circulating levels. The biochemical hallmark of tumoral calcinosis is hyperphosphatemia caused by increased renal absorption of phosphate due to loss-of-function mutations in the FGF23 (OMIM:605380) or GALNT3 gene (Kato et al., 2006, PMID:16638743). The GALNT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ppGalNacT3, which is found in many types of cells. This protein plays a leading role in regulating phosphate levels within the body (phosphate homeostasis). Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled by the kidneys. The kidneys normally rid the body of excess phosphate by excreting it in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed. \n\n \n\nMore than 220 unique variants (e.g., synonymous, missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans by ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Seven variants (1 nonsense, 1 missense, 2 splice donors, 1 splice acceptor, 1 frame-shift and 1 intron) that have been reported in approximately 6 probands in 3 publications (Topaz O et al., 2004, PMID:15133511; Ichikawa S et al., 2005, PMID: 15687324; and Ichikawa S et al. 2010; PMID:20358599), are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by protein interaction, and animal models studies (Kato et al., 2006, PMID: 16638743; Ichikawa et al., 2009, PMID: 19213845; Ichikawa et al., 2014, PMID: 25051439). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between GALNT3 and Tumoral calcinosis, hyperphosphatemic, familial, 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
