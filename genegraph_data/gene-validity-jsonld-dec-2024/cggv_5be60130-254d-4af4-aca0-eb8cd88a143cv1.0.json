We detected a clear cV biochemical defect in TMEM70 patients' fibroblasts, whereas the assay was not reliable in frozen muscle. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the amount of holocomplexes in patients with TMEM70 mutations showed a nearly absent cV in muscles and a strong decrease of cV with accumulation of sub-assembly species in fibroblasts. In our cohort we found not only cV deficiencies but also impairment of other OXPHOS complexes. By ultrastructural analysis of muscle tissue from one patient with isolated cV deficiency, we found a severely impaired mitochondrial morphology with loss of the cristae.

Mutations of the TMEM70 gene represent the most frequent cause of isolated ATP synthase deficiency resulting in a severe mitochondrial disease presenting as neonatal encephalo-cardiomyopathy (OMIM 604273). To better understand the biological role of this factor, we generated Tmem70-deficient mice and found that the homozygous Tmem70-/- knockouts exhibited profound growth retardation and embryonic lethality at ∼9.5 days post coitum. Blue-Native electrophoresis demonstrated an isolated deficiency in fully assembled ATP synthase in the Tmem70-/- embryos (80% decrease) and a marked accumulation of F1 complexes indicative of impairment in ATP synthase biogenesis that was stalled at the early stage, following the formation of F1 oligomer. Consequently, a decrease in ADP-stimulated State 3 respiration, respiratory control ratio and ATP/ADP ratios, indicated compromised mitochondrial ATP production. Tmem70-/- embryos exhibited delayed development of the cardiovascular system and a disturbed heart mitochondrial ultrastructure, with concentric or irregular cristae structures. Tmem70+/- heterozygous mice were fully viable and displayed normal postnatal growth and development of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Nevertheless, they presented with mild deterioration of heart function. Our results demonstrated that Tmem70 knockout in the mouse results in embryonic lethality due to the lack of ATP synthase and impairment of mitochondrial energy provision. This is analogous to TMEM70 dysfunction in humans and verifies the crucial role of this factor in the biosynthesis and assembly of mammalian ATP synthase.","dc:creator":"Vrbacký M","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Knockout of Tmem70 alters biogenesis of ATP synthase and leads to embryonal lethality in mice."},"rdfs:label":"TMTM70 KO mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"In KO embryos: IUGR, developmental delay, lack ATP synthase complex measured multiple ways, abnormal mito morphology "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:5be60130-254d-4af4-aca0-eb8cd88a143c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f35ec36-f2f9-48a3-82b8-1f1d2d3e6347_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f35ec36-f2f9-48a3-82b8-1f1d2d3e6347","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:5f6ff01c-4d9a-4bf9-a224-e9c2c81c7565","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017866.6(TMEM70):c.238C>T (p.Arg80Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129563"}},"detectionMethod":"TMEM70 sequence analyses of the three exons and their flanking splice junction consensus sequences were performed in the DNA samples of the patients and their parents.","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Female who died at 7 days old; oligohydramnios; immediately after birth was cyanotic, hypotonic, bradycardic, lacked spontaneous respiration; hypoplastic lungs; lactic acidosis, metabolic acidosis, elevated LFTs, hyperammonemia; elevated blood/urine lactate, elevated pyruvate; 3MGA","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003128","obo:HP_0001562","obo:HP_0003535","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001942","obo:HP_0001987","obo:HP_0002910"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:06dd4aea-abe9-4e27-9881-4348dadfb744_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5f6ff01c-4d9a-4bf9-a224-e9c2c81c7565"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21147908","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The TMEM70 gene defect was recently identified as a novel cause of autosomal recessive ATP synthase deficiency.

The *TMEM70* gene encodes a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V assembly factor that likely works in complex I assembly (PMIDs: 32275929, 33753518), as well.\n\nThe *TMEM70* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18953340). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TMEM70*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TMEM70* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (two splice site, two nonsense, one frameshift) identified in eight individuals from two publications (PMIDs: 18953340, 21147908). More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The majority of cases reported had nonsense or splice variants. Affected individuals typically presented in utero to shortly after birth and outcomes varied from death in the first days of life to still being alive at the time of report in their 20s. Affected individuals had variable features including microcephaly, developmental delay, episodic encephalopathy with febrile illness, hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension, hepatopathy, short stature, and cataract; at least one report included an individual with normal cognitive abilities. Brain imaging in affected individuals ranged from normal to hypoplastic corpus callosum, cerebellar atrophy, and cortical atrophy; and metabolic screening labs variably showed lactic acidosis, increased CSF lactate, and lactate excretion in urine; metabolic acidosis; hyperammonemia; and 3MGA. Other features seen in affected individuals include oligohydramnios, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and dysmorphic features (high forehead, low set ears, long philtrum, broad nasal bridge, thin lips). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in patient cells, rescue in patient cells, knock-out mouse model, and rescue in a knock-out rat model (PMIDs: 24740313, 21945727, 28173120, 35203486).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 16, 2022 (SOP Version 8).
