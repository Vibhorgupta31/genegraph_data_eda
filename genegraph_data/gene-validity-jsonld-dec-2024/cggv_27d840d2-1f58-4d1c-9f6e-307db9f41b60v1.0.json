Mutations of the gene KIAA1199 are associated with progressive hearing loss. Its expression is abundant in human cochlea, but interestingly the spatial expression patterns are different between mouse and rat cochleae; the pattern in humans has not been fully investigated. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of a nonhuman primate, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), cochlea with a KIAA1199-specific antibody. In the common marmoset cochlea, KIAA1199 protein expression was more widespread than in rodents, with all epithelial cells, including hair cells, expressing KIAA1199. Our results suggest that the primate pattern of KIAA1199 expression is wider in comparison with rodents and may play an essential role in the maintenance of cochlear epithelial cells.

Those that are expressed specifically in auditory tissues are likely to be good candidates to screen for genetic alterations in patients with deafness, and several genes have been successfully identified as responsible for hereditary hearing loss. To understand the detailed mechanisms of the hearing loss caused by the mutations in these genes, the present study examined the immunocytochemical localization of the proteins encoded by Crym, KIAA1199 homolog, Uba52, Col9a3, and Col9a1 in the cochlea of rats and mice. Confocal microscopic immunocytochemistry was performed on cryostat sections. Ultrastructurally, postembedding immunogold cytochemistry was applied using Lowicryl sections. Crym protein was predominantly distributed in the fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, as well as the stria vascularis in rats. KIAA1199 protein homolog was localized in various supporting cells, including inner phalangeal, border, inner and outer pillar, and Deiters' cells. Uba52 protein was restrictedly localized within the surface of the marginal cells of the stria vascularis. Collagen type IX was found within the tectorial membrane as well as fibrocytes in the spiral ligament. The present results showed cell-specific localization of the encoded proteins of these highly expressed genes, indicating that the coordinated actions of various molecules distributed in different parts of the cochlea are essential for maintenance of auditory processing in the cochlea.","dc:creator":"Usami S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The localization of proteins encoded by CRYM, KIAA1199, UBA52, COL9A3, and COL9A1, genes highly expressed in the cochlea."},"rdfs:label":"Usami Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4f75c314-dffb-4635-860e-9775ab98ea4b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af484e6c-96e1-4f87-9a84-b2f4613bdb8e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"This study looked at the expression and localization of KIAA1199 and some variants in mice and COS-7 cells.

We identified an R187C mutation in one family, an R187H mutation in two unrelated families, and an H783Y mutation in one sporadic case of nonsyndromic hearing loss. In situ hybridization indicated that the murine homolog of KIAA1199 mRNA is expressed specifically in Deiters' cells in the organ of Corti at postnatal day zero (P n) P0 before the onset of hearing, but expression in those cells disappears by day P7. The signal of KIAA1199 was also observed in fibrocytes of the spiral ligament and the spiral limbus through to P21, when the murine cochlea matures. Thus, the gene product may be involved in uptake of potassium ions or trophic factors with a particular role in auditory development. Although the R187C and R187H mutations did not appear to affect subcellular localization of the gene product in vitro, the H783Y mutation did present an unusual cytoplasmic distribution pattern that could underlie the molecular mechanism of hearing impairment.

At least 1 synonymous and 3 missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Two probands were noted to have affected siblings, however these siblings were not sequenced or well phenotyped. One individual was reported as compound heterozygous, and shown to have inherited one variant from each unaffected parent. The other 3 cases are reported as heterozygous, with no inheritance information or parental sequencing. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies that show the gene to be expressed in the cochlea of the mouse, rat and marmoset. In summary, there is no convincing genetic evidence supporting the association between KIAA1199 and nonsyndromic hearing loss, so this association is disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role KIAA1199 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 7/17/2018.\nOnly one paper claims to have found pathogenic variants in the gene in patients with NSHL (Abe et al. 2003 PMID 14577002). The study offered little evidence for the pathogenicity of the variants other than their absence from controls. In the absence of convincing genetic evidence, the association between KIAA1199 and ARNSHL is Disputed.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:27d840d2-1f58-4d1c-9f6e-307db9f41b60"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
