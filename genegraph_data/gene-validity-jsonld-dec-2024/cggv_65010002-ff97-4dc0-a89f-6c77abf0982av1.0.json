Deletional analysis of individuals with the WAGR syndrome (for, Wilms' tumour, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities and mental retardation) showed that a Wilms' tumour gene lies at chromosomal position 11p13.

Wt1 is expressed in a rich pattern during renal development suggesting that it acts at three stages: determination of the kidney area, the differentiation of nephrons and maturation of glomeruli. Wt1-/- mice confirm that Wt1 is essential for the inception of kidney development; cells that ought to form kidneys die by apoptosis instead. Specific human WT1 mutations cause defects of glomerular maturation (Denys-Drash and Frasier syndromes), providing circumstantial evidence for action of Wt1 during glomerular maturation. There is, however, no genetic evidence for a function during nephron differentiation because this stage is never reached in Wt1-/- mice. We have therefore developed a novel technique, based on small interfering RNA (siRNA), to repress the expression of Wt1 and other specific genes at different stages of kidney development in culture. We find that early repression of Wt1 phenocopies the Wt1-/- mouse, but later repression prevents cells differentiating into nephrons and causes them instead to proliferate abnormally, possibly mimicking aspects of Wilms' tumour. In line with established hypotheses about genetic pathways that control kidney development, we find that repressing Pax2 using siRNAs represses Wt1 expression and blocks both bud growth and nephron differentiation, but that repressing Wnt4 blocks nephron differentiation without affecting Wt1 expression.

Importantly, a subset of human tumors similarly displayed upregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which suggests ERK signaling might contribute to WT development.

Wilms tumours are thought to develop from abnormally persistent embryonal cells within nephrogenic rests (PMID: 19948536). The WT1 gene encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the cellular or chromosomal context (PMID: 1127846). The relationship between WT1 and Wilms tumor type 1 (autosomal dominant) was first reported in 1991 (Pelletier et al., PMID: 1654525). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Seven variants (nonsense, frameshift) in this gene reported in at least 8 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 15483024, 1654525, 18688870) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, cell culture and mouse models (PMIDs: 2164159, 26035382, 21123950, 14645201). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability between Wilms tumor type 1 and congenital malformation syndromes associated with WT1 variants (Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome, Meacham syndrome, and nephrotic syndrome, type 4). For example, many individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome harbor heterozygous missense variants in exon 8 or 9 and may act in a dominant-negative manner (Royer-Pokora et al., 2004; PMID: 15150775), while the majority of variants reported for Wilms tumor type 1 are loss-of-function variants. Therefore, we have split curations for WT1 into Wilms tumor type 1 and congenital malformation syndromes associated with variants in WT1.  In summary, loss of function variants in WT1 are definitively associated with autosomal dominant Wilms tumor type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:65010002-ff97-4dc0-a89f-6c77abf0982a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
