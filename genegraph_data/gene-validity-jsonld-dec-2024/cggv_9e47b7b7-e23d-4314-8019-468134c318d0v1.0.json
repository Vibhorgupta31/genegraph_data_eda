To test the specificity of the rnf20 MO, they depleted rnf20 using CRISPR. Targeting the first rnf20 exon resulted in abnormal pitx2c expression in 22% of injected embryos and partially rescued the rnf20 MO phenotype with human Rnf20 mRNA, demonstrating specificity of the rnf20 MO. RNF40 MO specificity was also tested by mRNA rescue and reduction of H2Bub1/H2B ratio.

Only one splice site variant reported in an individual with congenital heart disease was included in this curation (PMID: 28991257, 31235600). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a MO knockdown of *rnf20/rnf40* in Xenopus which showed abnormal heart looping, defective development of left–right (LR) asymmetry, and impaired cilia motility (PMID: 31235600). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *RNF40* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
