We have examined the patterns of expression of both CD2AP and nephrin in developing mouse and human kidney. Both proteins were first detected in developing podocytes at the capillary loop stage of glomerulogenesis and eventually became concentrated near the glomerular basement membrane. CD2AP was also observed diffusely in collecting duct and apically in many cells of proximal and distal tubule. Kidneys from Cd2ap -/- mice initially exhibited normal nephrin localization, but as the mice aged and foot processes became effaced, nephrin disappeared. In laminin-beta(2) mutant mice exhibiting nephrotic syndrome, CD2AP in glomeruli was aberrantly localized in a primarily punctate pattern. Extensive extrarenal expression of CD2AP was observed in endothelial and epithelial cells, in many cases with a specific subcellular localization. Together, these results suggest that CD2AP is not only involved in maintaining the slit diaphragm but may also have a general role in maintaining specialized subcellular architecture.

We selected adult patients with non-syndromic, biopsy-proven FSGS or SRNS in the absence of known family history. Strict clinical criteria included lack of response to glucocorticoids and cyclosporine, and no recurrence after kidney transplantation.

Sixteen of 135 tested participants (11.8%) carried pathogenic mutations in monogenic SRNS genes, and 14 others (10.4%) carried two APOL1 high-risk alleles. Autosomal recessive disease was diagnosed in 5 participants, autosomal dominant disease in 9, and X-linked disease in 2. Four participants carried a de novo heterozygous mutation. Among the 16 participants with identified mutations in monogenic SNRS genes, 7 (43.7%) had type IV collagen mutations. Mutations in monogenic SNRS genes were identified primarily in participants with proteinuria onset before 25 years of age, while the age at disease onset was variable in those with APOL1 high-risk genotype. Mean age at diagnosis was lower and renal survival was worse in participants with identified mutations in SNRS genes than in those without mutations.

Provides structure/regulation to the foot process of podocytes and the slit diaphragm (PMID: 11733557). In the kidney, *CD2AP* is primarily expressed in glomerular podocytes, and its absence results in improper formation of the slit diaphragm (PMID: 10514378) and the protein filtration barrier of the kidney (PMID: 16889564).\n\nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (OMIM:607832) and autosomal recessive FSGS (OMIM:607832). Autosomal dominant FSGS has been curated separately.\n\n*CD2AP* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive FSGS in 2007 (LÃ¶wik et al., PMID: 17713465). FSGS is a pathologic entity associated clinically with proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome (NPHS), and progressive loss of renal function. It is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (PMID: 16932363). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nFour variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 17713465, 30348286, 30612599, 36964972) included in this curation. A total of 7.1/12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional studies, expression studies, and animal models. One mouse model with homozygous knock-in of c.592_593insTCAC (p.Ser198IlefsTer3), which is also observed in a patient with FSGS, phenocopied FSGS (PMIDs: 30612599). Additionally, *CD2AP* expression is observed in the glomerular basement membrane and is required for proper formation of the slit diaphragm and the protein filtration barrier of the kidney (PMID: 10514378, 10997929, 16889564). A total of 5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CD2AP* and autosomal recessive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Glomerulopathy GCEP on the meeting date April 8, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e4bd2904-da48-4a7d-875e-bc90d56f59da"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
