Here we show that missense mutations in NEDD4L mapping to the HECT domain of the encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase lead to PNH associated with toe syndactyly, cleft palate and neurodevelopmental delay. Cellular and expression data showed sensitivity of PNH-associated mutants to proteasome degradation. Moreover, an in utero electroporation approach showed that PNH-related mutants and excess wild-type NEDD4L affect neurogenesis, neuronal positioning and terminal translocation. Further investigations, including rapamycin-based experiments, found differential deregulation of pathways involved. Excess wild-type NEDD4L leads to disruption of Dab1 and mTORC1 pathways, while PNH-related mutations are associated with deregulation of mTORC1 and AKT activities. Altogether, these data provide insights into the critical role of NEDD4L in the regulation of mTOR pathways and their contributions in cortical development.","dc:creator":"Broix L","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in the HECT domain of NEDD4L lead to AKT-mTOR pathway deregulation and cause periventricular nodular heterotopia."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse embryo expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b131d46a-069b-4c2e-a290-e7df2519a2df_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7ee8476-6ded-48eb-acfa-ddadbaa31afc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02a24e20-fe38-4d31-ad1b-2ba16d319cfb","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"PVNH related point mutations result in increased pS6 and pAKT in cell culture","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27694961","rdfs:label":"Signaling pathway derangement"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b131d46a-069b-4c2e-a290-e7df2519a2df_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:22072c94-50fc-4176-b18f-a44619b06231","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05b3294a-71cf-40d9-8269-2d0418e94d58","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"PVNH associated mutations did not migrate to cortical plate properly, analogous to gray matter heterotopia.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship include case level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 5 publications, including at least 6 de novo missense variants (PMIDs: 27694961, 28515470, 30393983, 32117442, 34087865). To date, all reported cases have demonstrated periventricular nodular heterotopia and developmental delay; 13 of 15 probands demonstrated syndactyly, 8 demonstrated a cleft palate, and at least 5 demonstrated additional malformations of cortical development such as polymicrogyria. Recurrent variants are found in 11 of the reported cases (6 for one and 5 for the other). The mechanism of disease is dominant negative (PMID: 27694961). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, in vitro studies of biochemical function, and cell culture assays using non-patient derived cells. More experimental evidence is available in the literature but not cited here, as a classification of definitive has been reached. In summary, NEDD4L is definitively associated with autosomal dominant periventricular nodular heterotopia 7. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/30/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b131d46a-069b-4c2e-a290-e7df2519a2df"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
