The 13 MRX genes identified to date account for less than one-fifth of all MRX, suggesting that numerous gene defects cause the disorder in other families. In a female patient with severe nonsyndromic mental retardation and a de novo balanced translocation t(X;7)(p11.3;q11.21), we have cloned the DNA fragment that contains the X-chromosomal and the autosomal breakpoint. In silico sequence analysis provided no indication of a causative role for the chromosome 7 breakpoint in mental retardation (MR), whereas, on the X chromosome, a zinc-finger gene, ZNF41, was found to be disrupted. Expression studies indicated that ZNF41 transcripts are absent in the patient cell line, suggesting that the mental disorder in this patient results from loss of functional ZNF41. Moreover, screening of a panel of patients with MRX led to the identification of two other ZNF41 mutations that were not found in healthy control individuals. A proline-to-leucine amino acid exchange is present in affected members of one family with MRX. A second family carries an intronic splice-site mutation that results in loss of specific ZNF41 splice variants. Wild-type ZNF41 contains a highly conserved transcriptional repressor domain that is linked to mechanisms of chromatin remodeling, a process that is defective in various other forms of MR. Our results suggest that ZNF41 is critical for cognitive development; further studies aim to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which ZNF41 alterations lead to MR.","dc:creator":"Shoichet SA","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in the ZNF41 gene are associated with cognitive deficits: identification of a new candidate for X-linked mental retardation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14628291","rdfs:label":"II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4edc7663-bcbf-4b33-82f9-1ace1b93a70e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2aac8104-b547-4fc1-b0b1-d413b7763848","type":"Proband","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4edc7663-bcbf-4b33-82f9-1ace1b93a70e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:e4f6322d-574e-4294-af0c-a86d873256af","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001324156.1(ZNF41):c.302-72C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA229251"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14628291"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14628291","rdfs:label":"III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":2415,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bdd8902f-62dd-4ee7-9f75-9fe66e51e01e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019181","gene":"hgnc:13107","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The association between ZNF41 and X-linked non-syndromic intellectual disability was first suggested in 2013 (Shoichet et al., PMID: 14628291). This study reported three unrelated families with intellectual disability and variants involving ZNF41. One female was found to have a de novo balanced X;7 translocation disrupting ZNF41. This translocation was not counted as evidence because the impact of the breakpoints on neighboring genes cannot be ruled out. The second family had two affected brothers with a maternally inherited missense variant in ZNF41. The third family included an affected male proband and an affected sister with borderline ID with a maternally inherited deep intronic variant in ZNF41 that resulted in loss of specific ZNF41 splice variants. The two ZNF41 sequence variants were found to have high population frequencies in gnomAD (v2.1.1) and were not scored as evidence. No additional studies have been reported since then with causative ZNF41 variants in affected individuals. In summary, there is no valid genetic evidence to support an association between ZNF41 and X-linked nonsyndromic intellectual disability, so this gene-disease association is disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 09/02/2020 (SOP Version 7). \nNone of the reported variants are convincing enough to be scored.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6d705685-78a3-4925-8a1b-e00d39d63f87"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
