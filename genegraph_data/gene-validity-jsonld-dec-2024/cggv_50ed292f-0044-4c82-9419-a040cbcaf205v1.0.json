It is caused by defects of motile cilia and sperm flagella. We screened a cohort of affected individuals that lack an obvious axonemal defect for pathogenic variants using whole exome capture, next generation sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis assuming an autosomal recessive trait. We identified one subject with an apparently homozygous nonsense variant [(c.1762C>T), p.(Arg588*)] in the uncharacterized CFAP57 gene. Interestingly, the variant results in the skipping of exon 11 (58 amino acids), which may be due to disruption of an exonic splicing enhancer. In normal human nasal epithelial cells, CFAP57 localizes throughout the ciliary axoneme. Nasal cells from the PCD patient express a shorter, mutant version of CFAP57 and the protein is not incorporated into the axoneme. The missing 58 amino acids include portions of WD repeats that may be important for loading onto the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complexes for transport or docking onto the axoneme. A reduced beat frequency and an alteration in ciliary waveform was observed. Knockdown of CFAP57 in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTECs) recapitulates these findings. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CFAP57 is highly conserved in organisms that assemble motile cilia. CFAP57 is allelic with the BOP2/IDA8/FAP57 gene identified previously in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Two independent, insertional fap57 Chlamydomonas mutant strains show reduced swimming velocity and altered waveforms. Tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectroscopy shows that FAP57 is missing, and the \"g\" inner dyneins (DHC7 and DHC3) and the \"d\" inner dynein (DHC2) are reduced, but the FAP57 paralog FBB7 is increased. Together, our data identify a homozygous variant in CFAP57 that causes PCD that is likely due to a defect in the inner dynein arm assembly process.","dc:creator":"Bustamante-Marin XM","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Mutation of CFAP57, a protein required for the asymmetric targeting of a subset of inner dynein arms in Chlamydomonas, causes primary ciliary dyskinesia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50ed292f-0044-4c82-9419-a040cbcaf205_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50ed292f-0044-4c82-9419-a040cbcaf205_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:3875c13a-c893-45cc-8ae8-d3cc94c42c02_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3875c13a-c893-45cc-8ae8-d3cc94c42c02","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":35,"allele":{"id":"cggv:75099287-9f14-43d7-a211-23a19fcde42f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001378189.1(CFAP57):c.1762C>T (p.Arg588Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1344738"}},"detectionMethod":"Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) identified the variant, and then was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000388","obo:HP_0002110","obo:HP_0000246","obo:HP_0002643","obo:HP_0033036"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Previously screened and found negative for mutations in genes known to be associated with\nPCD (no other details).","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ed225121-f0a7-42e7-a06f-50fc67863167_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:75099287-9f14-43d7-a211-23a19fcde42f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32764743"},"rdfs:label":"2-II"},{"id":"cggv:ed225121-f0a7-42e7-a06f-50fc67863167","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed225121-f0a7-42e7-a06f-50fc67863167_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ed225121-f0a7-42e7-a06f-50fc67863167_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"mRNA analysis shows variant results in skipping of exon 11, and an in-frame loss of 58 amino acids (p.Ile586_Lys643del).

A homozygous nonsense variant, c.1762C>T (p.Arg588*), was identified in a proband with a classic PCD phenotype including neonatal respiratory distress, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and low nasal nitric oxide. Biopsies from nasal epithelia showed normal axonemal ultrastructure. Ciliary beat frequency was reduced, and most cilia exhibited abnormal waveforms with no clear effective and recovery strokes. Functional studies showed that the variant results in the skipping of exon 11 and a shorter protein that does not assemble into the axoneme. The genetic evidence for this curation is scarce, therefore, the maximum score was not reached (3/12 pts.).\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that human tissues exhibiting the highest levels of CFAP57 expression include tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the lung, fallopian tube, brain, and testis (PMID: 23715323), biochemical function as a component that localises throughout the ciliary axoneme, functional alterations in patient cells consistent with a critical role in motile cilia function, altered expression in PCD patient tissue, and silencing of CFAP57 in control cells exhibiting cilia beat frequency and pattern defects (PMID: 32764743). More experimental evidence includes a Chlamydomonas model: the ortholog FAP57 has been shown to form an extended structure that interconnects multiple IDAs and regulatory complexes, and mutant FAP57 Chlamydomonas strains show reduced swimming velocity and altered waveforms (reduced bend amplitude and increased average curvature) (PMID: 32764743, PMID: 31483737).\nIn summary, biallelic loss of CFAP57 is likely to cause PCD due to a failure to assemble a subset of IDAs. However, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
