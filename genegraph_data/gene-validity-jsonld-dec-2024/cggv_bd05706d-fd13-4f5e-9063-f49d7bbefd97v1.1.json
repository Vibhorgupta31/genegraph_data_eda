NAC1 is increased by cocaine selectively in the nucleus accumbens, a CNS region important for drug addiction. NAC1's role in the cell, however, is not known. Each of the two NAC1 isoforms, sNAC1 (short NAC1) and lNAC1 (long NAC1), may serve as corepressors for other POZ/BTB proteins. This study investigated whether sNAC1 and lNAC1 demonstrated protein-protein interactions with other corepressors. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition reversed sNAC1 and lNAC1 repression of Gal4 luciferase, but only in neuronal-like cultures. Because these inhibitors do not distinguish among histone deacetylases, two histone deacetylases were selected for further study. HDAC 3 and 4 both demonstrated protein-protein interactions with sNAC1 and lNAC1. This was shown using coimmunoprecipitations, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldowns and mammalian two-hybrids. Importantly, either the POZ domain or NAC1 without the POZ domain can bind these two HDACs. Other corepressors, specifically NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor) and mSin3a, do not exhibit protein-protein interactions with sNAC1 and lNAC1. None showed protein-protein interactions in GST pulldowns or mammalian two-hybrids. Taken together, the results of these experiments indicate sNAC1 and lNAC1 recruit histone deacetylases for transcriptional repression, further enhancing POZ/BTB protein mediated repression.","dc:creator":"Korutla L","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"The POZ/BTB protein NAC1 interacts with two different histone deacetylases in neuronal-like cultures."},"rdfs:label":"NACC1 mediates transcriptional repression in neurons"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:bd05706d-fd13-4f5e-9063-f49d7bbefd97_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:df8d5df6-7166-48b1-a397-1c948d0da831","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:26b21982-e779-4ef5-af2e-e1325b4b2a57","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In mouse neurons, Nacc1 R248W (murine homology of human R298W) exhibits increased SUMO conjugation, resulting in impaired protein interaction with SynGAP1, a post-synaptic ptrotein\n\nInhibition of Nacc1 R248W SUMOylation partially restores protein interaction with SynGAP1.

Over 15 individuals with a recurrent *de novo* missense variant, c.892C>T, p.Arg298Trp, have been reported (PMIDs: 27479843, 28132692, 30842647, 31231135, 33057194, 34869110, 35719373, 37667351). They presented with severe to profound developmental delay or intellectual disability, epilepsy, feeding difficulties, and periodic extreme irritability and inconsolability (PMID: 37667351). Other frequent features include hypotonia, microcephaly, bilateral cataracts, brain MRI abnormalities, and sleep disorder. Only 12 probands are included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity of this variant is reported to be dominant negative (PMID: 37533751). Other *NACC1* missense (PMIDs: 31618753, 31785789, 33057194, 35982159, 36028527) or splice (PMID: 31981491) variants have also been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, however, they were not scored in the current curation due to a lack of evidence supporting variant pathogenicity.\n \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of NACC1 as a transcriptional repressor (PMID: 16033423), protein interactions with key synaptic proteins involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (PMID: 37533751), and in vitro studies in mouse neurons expressing the murine homolog of the human mutant showing that the p.Arg298Trp variant impairs glutamatergic neurotransmission (PMID: 37533751).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between the *NACC1* recurrent variant p.Arg298Trp and *NACC1*-related neurodevelopmental disorder with epilepsy, cataracts, and episodic irritability.
