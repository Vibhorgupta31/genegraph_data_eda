Those affected also have hepatomegaly in infancy, which improves with age. A liver biopsy in one reported case showed increased glycogen levels in the liver and decreased Phk activity in muscle.

A diversity of signals accelerate glycogen degradation that are mediated by phosphorylase b kinase (Phk), which phosphorylates and thereby activates glycogen phosphorylase. Phk is among the most complex of the protein kinases so far elucidated. It has one catalytic (gamma) subunit and three different regulatory (alpha, beta, and delta) subunits, a molecular mass of 1.3 X 106 daltons, and each holoenzyme molecule is presumed to contain four molecules of each subunit. The three regulatory subunits inhibit the phosphotransferase activity of the gamma subunit. Ca2+ relieves inhibition via the delta subunit, which is identical to calmodulin but remains an integral component of the holoenzyme even when the [Ca2+] is lowered to nanomolar levels. Phosphorylation of the alpha and beta subunits by the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) also relieves inhibition of the gamma subunit and thereby activates the enzyme. The stimulatory effects of Ca2+ and phosphorylation appear to be structurally coupled and are cooperative. In addition, Phk is activated in vitro by autophosphorylation, limited proteolysis of the regulatory subunits, and various allosteric effectors and these may also be mechanisms of physiological importance. The molecular mechanisms of regulation are currently poorly understood, but new insights are beginning to emerge. This review discusses current knowledge and concepts of the structure, function and regulation of Phk.","dc:creator":"Brushia RJ","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Phosphorylase kinase: the complexity of its regulation is reflected in the complexity of its structure."},"rdfs:label":"Mechanism of Phosphorylase Kinase"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0bc221ef-fafa-41c6-9b59-fab2b34241c4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:394f1159-1fa3-4751-aed5-569c90237f67","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e3c98ad-1db1-4ac4-a75e-5976b16069a9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The phenotype in humans is hepatomegaly which typically has clinical improvement with increasing age.

This ketotic form of GSD is caused by mutations in phosphorylase kinase (PhK), which is composed of four subunits (α, β, γ, δ). PhK is required for the activation of the liver isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL), which generates free glucose-1-phosphate monomers to be used as energy via cleavage of the α -(1,4) glycosidic linkages in glycogen chains. Mutations in any of the PhK subunits can negatively affect the regulatory and catalytic activity of PhK during glycogenolysis. To understand the pathogenesis of GSD-IX-beta, we characterized a newly created PHKB knockout (Phkb−/−) mouse model. In this study, we assessed fasting blood glucose and ketone levels, serum metabolite concentrations, glycogen phosphorylase activity, and gene expression of gluconeogenic genes and fibrotic genes. Phkb−/− mice displayed hepatomegaly with lower fasting blood glucose concentrations. Phkb−/− mice showed partial liver glycogen phosphorylase activity and increased sensitivity to pyruvate, indicative of partial glycogenolytic activity and upregulation of gluconeogenesis. Additionally, gene expression analysis demonstrated increased lipid metabolism in Phkb−/− mice. Gene expression analysis and liver histology in the livers of old Phkb−/− mice (>40 weeks) showed minimal profibrogenic features when analyzed with age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Collectively, the Phkb−/− mouse recapitulates mild clinical features in patients with GSD-IX-beta. Metabolic and molecular analysis confirmed that Phkb−/− mice were capable of sustaining energy homeostasis during prolonged fasting by using partial glycogenolysis, increased gluconeogenesis, and potentially fatty acid oxidation in the liver.","dc:creator":"Arends CJ","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"A Mouse Model of Glycogen Storage Disease Type IX-Beta: A Role for "},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model of Glycogen Storage Disease Type IXB"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:0bc221ef-fafa-41c6-9b59-fab2b34241c4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d899b90-1656-48f0-9a71-e7ecbf240621_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d899b90-1656-48f0-9a71-e7ecbf240621","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":22,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:ab8d251e-5192-4850-ac0c-f5a006958d4c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000293.3(PHKB):c.1969C>T (p.Gln657Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256911"}},{"id":"cggv:aef0a8e8-4194-43d0-aefa-a0f767b4d7c7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000293.3(PHKB):c.1266T>A (p.Asn422Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA395799867"}}],"detectionMethod":"The authors report: \"Purification of RNA and genomic DNA from deep-frozen blood samples was performed according to conventional procedures.

The phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme is made up of four copies of each of four subunits (alpha, beta, gamma and delta). The liver isoforms of the alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunits are encoded by PHKA2, PHKB and PHKG2, respectively. Mutation within these genes has been shown to result in GSD type IX. The diagnosis of GSD type IX is complicated by the spectrum of clinical symptoms, variation in tissue specificity and severity, and its inheritance, either X-linked or autosomal recessive. We investigated 15 patients from 12 families with suspected GSD type IX. Accurate diagnosis had been hampered by enzymology not being diagnostic in five cases. Clinical symptoms included combinations of hypoglycaemia, hepatosplenomegaly, short stature, hepatopathy, weakness, fatigue and motor delay. Biochemical findings included elevated lactate, urate and lipids. We characterised causative mutations in the PHKA2 gene in ten patients from eight families, in PHKG2 in two unrelated patients and in the PHKB gene in three patients from two families. Seven novel mutations were identified in PHKA2 (p.I337X, p.P498L, p.P869R, p.Y116_T120dup, p.R1070del, p.R916W and p.M113I), two in PHKG2 (p.L144P and p.H48QfsX5) and two in PHKB (p.Y419X and c.2336+965A>C). There was a severe phenotype in patients with PHKG2 mutations, a mild phenotype with patients PHKB mutations and a broad spectrum associated with PHKA2 mutations. Molecular analysis allows accurate diagnosis where enzymology is uninformative and identifies the pattern of inheritance permitting counselling and family studies.","dc:creator":"Beauchamp NJ","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Glycogen storage disease type IX: High variability in clinical phenotype."}},{"id":"cggv:0aa27a46-0a60-43d4-bb8a-8f5cbf1dabbc_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c12652b0-80d8-48b2-b691-d31a9fac9337"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17689125"}],"rdfs:label":"20070614_beauchamp_p14"},{"id":"cggv:0aa27a46-0a60-43d4-bb8a-8f5cbf1dabbc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0aa27a46-0a60-43d4-bb8a-8f5cbf1dabbc_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Splice Site Variant"},{"id":"cggv:bb34fd49-72f7-4001-8da0-34c417469cd3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb34fd49-72f7-4001-8da0-34c417469cd3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:149ec39a-7f95-4355-839f-e6891e9a3500_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:149ec39a-7f95-4355-839f-e6891e9a3500","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":22,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:20697fb0-de47-487c-a762-cd43675b3528","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000293.3(PHKB):c.306-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256913"}},{"id":"cggv:28edae2d-3893-42cc-8ebe-45fb13db9896","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000293.3(PHKB):c.352G>C (p.Ala118Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256916"}}],"detectionMethod":"Direct cycle-sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Slightly disturbed liver function tests.

The patient's DNA has been analyzed for mutations in the genes encoding the alpha L, beta, and gamma TL subunits of Phk, all of which can be responsible for liver glycogenosis, by a strategy primarily based on reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction of blood RNA and complemented by analysis of genomic DNA. His alpha L and gamma TL coding sequences are normal, whereas he is compound-heterozygous for two mutations in the beta subunit gene, PHKB. The first is a splice-site mutation (IVS4 [-2A-->G]) causing the reading-frame-disrupting deletion of exon 5 in the mRNA from this allele. The second is an Ala117Pro missense mutation, also in exon 5. This is the first missense mutation identified in PHKB, as opposed to nine translation-terminating mutations described to date. It offers an explanation for the unique biochemical phenotype of this patient. In his leukocytes, low Phk activity is measured when tested with the endogenous liver isoform of phosphorylase as the protein substrate, but normal activity is observed when tested with muscle phosphorylase added in vitro. In contrast, Phk activity in his erythrocytes is low with both substrates. The missense mutation may selectively impair the interaction of Phk with one isoform of its substrate protein and may destabilize the enzyme in a cell-type-specific way. This phenotype shares some aspects with X-linked liver glycogenosis subtype 2 (XLG2), a variant of liver Phk deficiency arising from missense mutations in the alpha L subunit gene (PHKA2), but differs from XLG2 in other respects. The present case demonstrates that mutations in Phk genes other than PHKA2 can also be associated with untypically high activity in certain blood cell types. Moreover, it emphasizes that missense mutations in Phk may cause unusual patterns of tissue involvement that would not be predicted a priori from the tissue specificity of expression of the mutated gene sequences.","dc:creator":"Burwinkel B","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Phosphorylase-kinase-deficient liver glycogenosis with an unusual biochemical phenotype in blood cells associated with a missense mutation in the beta subunit gene (PHKB)."}},{"id":"cggv:7109dbe8-99df-49ba-a048-286fced0559f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:20697fb0-de47-487c-a762-cd43675b3528"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9402963"}],"rdfs:label":"19970811_burwinkel_p1"},{"id":"cggv:7109dbe8-99df-49ba-a048-286fced0559f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7109dbe8-99df-49ba-a048-286fced0559f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Splice Site Mutation"},{"id":"cggv:a1803cba-1d7e-4e95-889b-9a35f777b575","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1803cba-1d7e-4e95-889b-9a35f777b575_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7905,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b8b7526f-90a0-49e3-8fc7-eae64c13f35e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009868","gene":"hgnc:8927","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The gene *PHKB* which codes for subunit b of Phosphorylase b kinase (Phk) has been definitively associated with Glycogen Storage Disease 9B (GSD 9B or GSD IXB) according to the gene-disease validity curation process (Standard Operating Procedures Version 10) of ClinGen.\n\nContext for *PHKB*: Phk’s functional role is to activate glycogen phosphorylase through phosphorylation. Glycogen phosphorylase hydrolyzes glycogen thereby releasing free glucose for utilization under fasting conditions. Therefore improper activation of glycogen phosphorylase can result in glycogen buildup in the liver, hypoglycemia, exercise intolerance and progressive muscle weakness. The hexadecameric structure of Phk is created by the association of four copies of each of the α-, β-, ɣ-, and δ-subunits. The regulatory subunits are α, β and δ, while ɣ contains the active site. Subunit α is encoded *PHKA1* and *PHKA2* are found on the X-chromosome and encode the muscle and liver isoform of the subunit. Pathogenic mutations in *PHKA2* cause the most frequent type of GSD 9. *PHKB* is found on chromosome 16 and can be alternatively spliced to produce tissue isoforms. *PHKG1* and *PHKG2* encode the muscle and liver isoforms of ɣ, respectively, and are found on chromosomes 7 and 16. Mutations in *PHKG1* and *PHKG2* are associated with the more severe version GSD 9c. *CALM1*, *CALM2*, and *CALM3* are three separate genes that encode the δ subunit. Mutations in these genes have not been linked to the disease. Phk has widespread tissue distribution but primarily causes disease in the liver and muscle.\n\n*PHKB* performs a regulatory role in Phk and is similar to the α subunit. In an autosomal recessive manner mutations in this subunit have been associated with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia only after prolonged fasting and in some cases mild muscle hypotonia and growth retardation. Manifestation can be highly variable ranging from mild to aggressive.(PMID: 33858366) The average age of onset is 3.8 years.(PMID: 33858366) Most all patients present with hepatomegaly and elevated hepatic transaminase. Less than half of reported cases have reported hypoglycemia.(PMID: 33858366) And only about 15% of cases report short stature. Liver cirrhosis has also been reported in one case.(PMID: 33858366) Most variants reported to date affect primarily the liver with no symptoms of muscle involvement being reported. While symptoms improve with age, individuals should be monitored life-long for complications such as liver fibrosis.
