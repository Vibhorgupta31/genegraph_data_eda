Consistent with the known heterogeneity of mitochondrial diseases in general and that of LS in particular, several phenotypic features were markedly distinguished between the affected siblings and in relation to previous reports of COX15 mutations. Interestingly, of the previously reported five cases of COX15-mutated patients, all of different ethnic origins, three had a p.R217W mutation.

With new therapeutic options being proposed, assessing the mortality and clinical condition of Leigh syndrome patients is crucial for evaluating therapeutics. As data are scarce in Japan, we analysed the mortality rate and clinical condition of Japanese Leigh syndrome patients that we diagnosed since 2007. Data from 166 Japanese patients diagnosed with Leigh syndrome from 2007 to 2017 were reviewed. Patients' present status, method of ventilation and feeding, and degree of disability as of April 2018 was analysed. Overall, 124 (74.7%) were living, 40 (24.1%) were deceased, and 2 (1.2%) were lost to follow-up. Median age of living patients was 8 years (1-39 years). Median length of disease course was 91 months for living patients and 23.5 months for deceased patients. Nearly 90% of deaths occurred by age 6. Mortality rate of patients with onset before 6 months of age was significantly higher than that of onset after 6 months. All patients with neonatal onset were either deceased or bedridden. MT-ATP6 deficiency caused by m.8993T>G mutation and MT-ND5 deficiency induced a severe form of Leigh syndrome. Patients with NDUFAF6, ECHS1, and SURF1 deficiency had relatively mild symptoms and better survival. The impact of onset age on prognosis varied across the genetic diagnoses. The clinical condition of many patients was poor; however, few did not require mechanical ventilation or tube-feeding and were not physically dependent.

These patients are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and all defects so far identified in this group have been found in genes coding for accessory proteins that play important roles in the assembly of the COX holoenzyme complex. Many patients, however, remain without a molecular diagnosis. We have used a panel of retroviral vectors expressing human COX assembly factors in these patients to identify the molecular basis for the COX deficiency by functional complementation. Here we show that overexpression of COX15, a protein involved in the synthesis of heme A, the heme prosthetic group for COX, can functionally complement the isolated COX deficiency in fibroblasts from a patient with fatal, infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mutation analysis of COX15 in the patient identified a missense mutation (C700T) on one allele, changing a conserved arginine to tryptophan (R217W), and a splice-site mutation in intron 3 on the other allele (C447-3G), resulting in a deletion of exon 4. This splicing error introduces a frameshift and a premature stop codon, resulting in an unstable mRNA and, likely, a null allele. Mitochondrial heme A content was reduced in the patient's heart and fibroblast mitochondria, and levels of heme O were increased in the patient's heart. COX activity and the total amount of fully assembled enzyme were reduced by 50%-70% in patient fibroblasts. Expression of COX15 increased heme A content and rescued COX activity. These results suggest that reduced availability of heme A stalls the assembly of COX. This study establishes COX15 as an additional cause, along with SCO2, of fatal infantile, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with isolated COX deficiency.","dc:creator":"Antonicka H","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in COX15 produce a defect in the mitochondrial heme biosynthetic pathway, causing early-onset fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."}},{"id":"cggv:cd300e42-a85b-4794-9eea-4c99fddc5a20_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:af4844eb-05a3-4004-8be1-107b93744d21"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12474143"}],"rdfs:label":"Antonicka 2003 Case report"},{"id":"cggv:2c35b3d9-c4eb-4525-a9be-49964b0386c0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c35b3d9-c4eb-4525-a9be-49964b0386c0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2c35b3d9-c4eb-4525-a9be-49964b0386c0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Referred to as c.447-3G in the report.

Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features.

Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency. \n\n*COX15* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2003 in an individual with fatal, infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (PMID: 12474143). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX15*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX15* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *COX15* was previously curated by this GCEP on April 22, 2019 (SOP Version 6) as having a Limited association with Leigh Syndrome Spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.   \n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *COX15* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes six unique variants (four missense including the p.Arg217Trp variant that appears to be recurrent as it was scored in five probands from different populations, one nonsense, one splicing) in nine probands from nine publications (PMIDs: 15235026, 12474143, 15863660, 21412973, 26959537, 32232962, 33746038, 34440436, 31967322). Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of disease which may include seizures, hypotonia, ataxia, psychomotor retardation, vision loss, dysphagia, microcephaly, encephalopathy, and gliosis as well as cardiomyopathy. MRI findings are often consistent with LSS. The age of onset ranges from birth to early childhood. Where assessed, affected individuals present with persistent lactic acidosis and complex IV deficiency. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient fibroblasts, and a mouse model which recapitulates aspects of mitochondrial disease (PMIDs: 33340416, 12474143, 21723506, 26039449).    \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
