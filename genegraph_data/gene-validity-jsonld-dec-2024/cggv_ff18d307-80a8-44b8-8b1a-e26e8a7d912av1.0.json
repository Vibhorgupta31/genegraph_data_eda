These channels are critical intercellular pathways through which ions or small molecules are passed, regulating a variety of physiological and developmental processes. One of these processes is hearing. In the current study, a genetic survey was made on 380 Taiwanese individuals, 260 with nonsyndromic deafness and 120 with normal hearing. All the 380 Taiwanese were screened for the presence of mutations in 8 genes of the Cx gene family. These genes included Cx26 (GJB2), Cx29 (GJE1), Cx30 (GJB6), Cx30.3 (GJB4), Cx31 (GJB3), Cx32 (GJB1), Cx43 (GJA1) and pseudogene [rho] of Cx43 (rho GJA1). Mutations were identified in 7 out of the 8 screened genes of the Cx family from 62 of the 260 deaf subjects (23.85%). Of the 17 mutations observed in the Cx gene family, 11 were novel mutations. Fourteen polymorphisms that were not associated with hearing loss were identified in the Cx gene family. The first 2 most frequently occurring mutations were found in the Cx26 (28/62; 45.16%) and the rho Cx43 (17/62; 27.42%), respectively. Nine cases of mutations were found in the Cx30.3 (9/62; 14.52%). In the Cx30, 1 novel mutation was identified in 1 case (1/62; 1.61%). Two patients with mutations of each of Cx29 and Cx43 were found (2/62; 3.23%). One novel mutation of Cx31 was identified in 3 patients with nonsyndromic deafness (3/62; 4.84%).

Dominant mutations in the Cx26 gene GJB2 have been shown to cause keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, palmoplantar keratoderma associated with hearing loss, and Vohwinkel syndrome. Missense mutations in the closely related Cx30 gene GJB6 underlie Clouston syndrome (autosomal dominant hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia). We report a 6-y-old boy with phenotypic characteristics of KID syndrome as well as atrichia. In contrast to other KID syndrome patients, molecular analysis of the connexin gene GJB2 did not disclose a pathogenic mutation, although the patient was homozygous for a common polymorphism (V27I) in the coding sequence of Cx26. Nevertheless, screening of GJB6 revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (V37E) predicted to alter sequence and charge of the first transmembrane helix of Cx30, which was previously implicated in Clouston syndrome (Smith et al, 2002). The presence of a pathogenic Cx30 mutation and the lack of a pathologic molecular change in Cx26 in this patient, whose clinical features predominantly resemble KID syndrome, suggest genetic heterogeneity of KID syndrome and underscore that mutations in Cx30, similar to those in Cx26 or Cx31, can cause different phenotypes. Based on our results, connexin gene mutations should be considered in patients presenting with congenital sensorineural hearing loss and disorders of cornification, and screening of several connexin genes with known cutaneous phenotype, such as those for Cx26, Cx30, Cx30.3, and Cx31, may be required.","dc:creator":"Jan AY","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Genetic heterogeneity of KID syndrome: identification of a Cx30 gene (GJB6) mutation in a patient with KID syndrome and congenital atrichia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15140211","rdfs:label":"Jan Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored, because variant scored in other Scottish proband (Smith 2002)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:ff18d307-80a8-44b8-8b1a-e26e8a7d912a_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b79b895-d782-480c-b741-9c98954ebe05_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:471a8555-d1aa-49d0-85c2-3c32f1965bb5","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0007529","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0b79b895-d782-480c-b741-9c98954ebe05_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:14499323-6430-4d66-9b0e-527efe3ae775","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000013.11:g.20223333C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA387468744"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18717672","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Baris HN","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"A novel GJB6 missense mutation in hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia 2 (Clouston syndrome) broadens its genotypic basis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18717672","rdfs:label":"Baris Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because maternity and paternity was not confirmed.

Here, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of four autosomal dominant Cx30 gene mutations that are linked to hearing loss and/or various skin diseases. First, the T5M mutant linked to non-syndromic hearing loss formed functional gap junction channels and hemichannels, similar to wild-type Cx30. The loss-of-function V37E mutant associated with Clouston syndrome or keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and significantly induced apoptosis. The G59R mutant linked to the Vohwinkel and Bart-Pumphrey syndromes was retained primarily in the Golgi apparatus and exhibited loss of gap junction channel and hemichannel function but did not cause cell death. Lastly, the A88V mutant, which is linked to the development of Clouston syndrome, also significantly induced apoptosis but through an endoplasmic-reticulum-independent mechanism. Collectively, we discovered that four unique Cx30 mutants might cause disease through different mechanisms that also likely include their selective trans-dominant effects on coexpressed connexins, highlighting the overall complexity of connexin-linked diseases and the importance of GJIC in disease prevention.","dc:creator":"Berger AC","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mutations in Cx30 that are linked to skin disease and non-syndromic hearing loss exhibit several distinct cellular pathologies."},"rdfs:label":"Berger Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded for multiple expression experiments"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":151,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":10.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e055960a-a364-4c03-85ff-30f93730c380","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007510","gene":"hgnc:4288","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The GJB6 gene has been associated with autosomal dominant Clouston syndrome using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 4/13/18. This association was made using case-level data. At least 8 missense variants have been reported in humans. GJB6 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2000 (Lemartine et al.​). Association is seen in at least 13 probands in 8 publications (11017065, 23219093, 11874494, 18717672, 27137747, 25808784, 19416251, 26620415). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 65 additional family members. The GJB6 and autosomal dominant Clouston syndrome association is supported by expression studies. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss. Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss has been​ assessed separately. There was not enough evidence to split out and curate for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, however it should be noted this curation did not score any AD nonsyndromic hearing loss cases. Expert review upgraded the GJB6-Clouston syndrome association to Definitive. In summary, GJB6 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Clouston syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 4/17/18.\nExpert review upgraded the GJB6-Clouson syndrome association to Definitive after reviewing the available evidence.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ff18d307-80a8-44b8-8b1a-e26e8a7d912a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
