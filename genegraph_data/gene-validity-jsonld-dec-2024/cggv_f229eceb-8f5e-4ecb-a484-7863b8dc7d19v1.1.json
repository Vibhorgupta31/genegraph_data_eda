However, due to lack of further evidence for impact of these variants as well as variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals, these cases were not scored and, therefore, this gene-disease association is classified as Disputed. Furthermore, the HRAS gene is believed to be the only gene definitively associated with Costello syndrome (Aoki et al., 2005; Estep, Tidyman, Teitell, Cotter, & Rauen, 2006; Gripp et al., 2006; Kerr et al., 2006; Zampino et al., 2007). Of note, BRAF has also been classified as definitive in association with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, moderate in association with Noonan syndrome (NS), and limited in association with NS with multiple lentigines. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating BRAF with NS with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).\nNo score-able cases have been described but there have been assertions made.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f229eceb-8f5e-4ecb-a484-7863b8dc7d19"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
