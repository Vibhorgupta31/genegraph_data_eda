This family comprises, in order of increasing severity, dominant brachyolmia, spondylo-metaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type, and metatropic dysplasia. We tested the hypothesis that a further condition, Spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia (SED), Maroteaux type (MIM 184095; also known as pseudo-Morquio syndrome type 2), could be caused by TRPV4 mutations. We analyzed six individuals with Maroteaux type SED, including three who had previously been reported. All six patients were found to have heterozygous TRPV4 mutations; three patients had unreported mutations, while three patients had mutations previously described in association with metatropic dysplasia. In addition, we tested one individual with a distinct rare disorder, parastremmatic dysplasia (MIM 168400). This patient had a common, recurrent mutation seen in several patients with Kozlowski type spondylo-metaphyseal dysplasia. We conclude that SED Maroteaux type and parastremmatic dysplasia are part of the TRPV4 dysplasia family and that TRPV4 mutations show considerable variability in phenotypic expression resulting in distinct clinical-radiographic phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Nishimura G","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia, Maroteaux type (pseudo-Morquio syndrome type 2), and parastremmatic dysplasia are caused by TRPV4 mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20503319","rdfs:label":"Patient 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded for functional evidence showing increased intracellular calcium (Camacho et al. 2010, PMID: 20425821).

However, the Ca(2+) channels involved remain largely unidentified. Here we show that genetic ablation in mice of Trpv4, a Ca(2+)-permeable channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, increases bone mass by impairing bone resorption. TRPV4 mediates basolateral Ca(2+) influx specifically in large osteoclasts when Ca(2+) oscillations decline. TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) influx hereby secures intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, ensures NFATc1-regulated gene transcription, and regulates the terminal differentiation and activity of osteoclasts. In conclusion, our data indicate that Ca(2+) oscillations and TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) influx are sequentially required to sustain NFATc1-dependent gene expression throughout osteoclast differentiation, and we propose TRPV4 as a therapeutic target for bone diseases.","dc:creator":"Masuyama R","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"TRPV4-mediated calcium influx regulates terminal differentiation of osteoclasts."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in mouse osteoclasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:89cd3c97-39b1-468c-a433-810b4405f73f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0ec183a-e30e-419e-af7f-49fbd09a4e6c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that TRPV4 mRNA and protein were expressed in mature porcine articular cartilage.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19790068","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel that can be gated by tonicity (osmolarity) and mechanical stimuli.

This disorder includes the parastremmatic dwarfism phenotype and is also known as pseudo-Morquio syndrome type 2. At least 6 variants (missense, frameshift) in TRPV4 have been reported in probands diagnosed with SEMD-M. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 6 variants in 7 probands reported in 3 publications (PMIDs: 20503319, 14755468, 12884428). The mechanism of pathogenicity is suggested to be gain of function (PMIDs: 31463371). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 18762026, 19790068, 21964574). Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause metatropic dysplasia, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type (SMD-K), brachyolmia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes and will be curated separately. In some cases, there is overlap between skeletal and neuromuscular phenotypes caused by variants in TRPV4 (PMID: 31191204). Patients presenting with skeletal dysplasias may benefit from neurological, respiratory, and audiological evaluations. In summary, there is moderate but suggestive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more published evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has been published, and the overlap in phenotypes with metatropic dysplasia and SMD-K are supportive of the association between TRPV4 and SEMD-M.
