We screened the AGPAT2 gene in two siblings who presented with pseudoacromegaly, diabetes and severe dyslipidaemia and identified a novel mutation in AGPAT2 causing a single amino acid substitution, p.Cys48Arg. We subsequently investigated the molecular pathogenic mechanism linking both this mutation and the previously reported p.Leu228Pro mutation to clinical disease. Wild-type and mutant AGPAT2 were expressed in control and AGPAT2-deficient preadipocyte cell lines. mRNA and protein expression was determined, and the ability of each AGPAT2 species to rescue adipocyte differentiation in AGPAT2-deficient cells was assessed. Protein levels of both p.Cys48Arg and p.Leu228Pro AGPAT2 were significantly reduced compared with that of wild-type AGPAT2 despite equivalent mRNA levels. Stable expression of wild-type AGPAT2 partially rescued adipogenesis in AGPAT2 deficient preadipocytes, whereas stable expression of p.Cys48Arg or p.Leu228Pro AGPAT2 did not. In conclusion, unusually severe dyslipidaemia and pseudoacromegaloid overgrowth in patients with diabetes should alert physicians to the possibility of lipodystrophy. Both the previously unreported pathogenic p.Cys48Arg mutation in AGPAT2, and the known p.Leu228Pro mutation result in decreased AGPAT2 protein expression in developing adipocytes. It is most likely that the CGL seen in homozygous carriers of these mutations is largely accounted for by loss of protein expression.","dc:creator":"Ramanathan N","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Identification and Characterisation of a Novel Pathogenic Mutation in the Human Lipodystrophy Gene AGPAT2 : C48R: A Novel Mutation in AGPAT2."}},"rdfs:label":"Ramanathan Patient A"},{"id":"cggv:17851721-ea6b-4fb0-9a09-8529ef32e763","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17851721-ea6b-4fb0-9a09-8529ef32e763_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:17851721-ea6b-4fb0-9a09-8529ef32e763_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Cys48Arg AGPAT2 proteins stably transfected into 3T3-L1 cells showed significantly reduced expression and enzymatic activity compared to wild-type."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Homozygous, inherited missense variant with supportive functional\nevidence will be scored 1 point"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:133281f8-2a82-4e4e-8073-394954237003_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:133281f8-2a82-4e4e-8073-394954237003","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:8641373c-4c97-4444-9cca-701f23b4d0a8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006412.4(AGPAT2):c.158del (p.Gly53AlafsTer8)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573053146"}},"detectionMethod":"AGPAT2 sequecning","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:dd496859-d5e1-4727-8681-de07803e8d85_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8641373c-4c97-4444-9cca-701f23b4d0a8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38231342","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Lipodystrophy is a relatively rare, complex disease characterised by a deficiency of adipose tissue and can present as either generalised lipodystrophy (GLD) or partial lipodystrophy (PLD).

In this study, we have performed mutation screening in AGPAT2 and the related AGPAT1 in patients with BSCL or other forms of lipodystrophy who have no detectable mutation in the seipin gene. We found 38 BSCL patients from 30 families with mutations in AGPAT2. Three of the known mutations were frequently found in our families. Of the eight new alterations, six are null mutations and two are missense mutations (Glu172Lys and Ala238Gly). All the patients harboring AGPAT2 mutations presented with typical features of BSCL. We did not find mutations in patients with other forms of lipodystrophies, including the syndromes of Lawrence, Dunnigan, and Barraquer-Simons, or with type A insulin resistance. In conclusion, mutations in the seipin gene and AGPAT2 are confined to the BSCL phenotype.

Of these, autosomal recessive Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL) is characterized by the absence of metabolically active subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. Metabolic abnormalities associated with lipodystrophy include insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and diabetes. One form of BSCL has been linked to genetic mutations affecting the lipid biosynthetic enzyme 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2), which is highly expressed in adipose tissue. Precisely how AGPAT2 deficiency causes lipodystrophy remains unresolved, but possible mechanisms include impaired lipogenesis (triglyceride synthesis and storage), blocked adipogenesis (differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes), or apoptosis/necrosis of adipocytes. Agpat2(-/-) mice share important pathophysiologic features of CGL previously reported in humans. However, the small white adipose tissue (WAT) depots consisting largely of amoeboid adipocytes with microvesiculated basophilic cytoplasm showed that adipogenesis with deficient lipogenesis was present in all usual locations. Although well-defined lobules of brown adipose tissue (BAT) were present, massive necrosis resulted in early ablation of BAT. Although necrotic or apoptotic adipocytes were not detected in WAT of 10-day-old Agpat2(-/-), the absence of adipocytes in aged mice indicates that these cells must undergo necrosis/apoptosis at some point. Another significant finding in aged lipodystrophic mice was massive pancreatic islet hypertrophy in the face of chronic hyperglycemia, which suggests that glucotoxicity is insufficient by itself to cause β-cell loss and that adipocyte-derived factors help regulate total β-cell mass.","dc:creator":"Vogel P","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Pathology of congenital generalized lipodystrophy in Agpat2-/- mice."},"rdfs:label":"AGPAT2 Knockout mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ccb7250b-60d3-451c-81d0-7f5b3988f71d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b93295c1-5aa2-426e-a172-05c1c4c29b25","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Lysophosphatidic acid is a key mediator of liver and white adipose tissue inflammation and lipodystrophy due to AGPAT2 deficiency as well as liver inflammation due to overnutrition","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38127985","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"AGPAT2 (1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate-acyltransferase-2) converts lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) into phosphatidic acid (PA), and mutations of the ","dc:creator":"Sakuma I","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Lysophosphatidic acid triggers inflammation in the liver and white adipose tissue in rat models of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2 deficiency and overnutrition."},"rdfs:label":"Knockdown expression of Agpat2 in the rat"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:104beaeb-7d02-4df6-ad44-6eb02960d8bc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48354678-73ba-45de-9a4c-16bfaae4e22e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Turning off the expression of human AGPAT2 in vivo resulted in total loss of adipose tissue in the mice.

We have curated the inheritance pattern for *AGPAT2* - related lipodystrophy as autosomal recessive because a recessive mode of inheritance has been consistently reported since 2002 (Agarwal et al, PMIDs:12765973; 11967537; Gorin et al, PMID:32412105). \n\nHomozygous or compound heterozygous variants, including nonsense, splice site, frameshift variants and small deletions have been reported. Typical autosomal recessive cases due to homozygous or compound heterozygous variants presented with hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, hyperinsulinemia, pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus features even in early childhood and adolescence (Magre et al, PMID: 12765973; Gorin et al et al, PMID:32412105; Abuzenadah et al, PMID:38231342).   \n\nAt least 50 lipodystrophy-causing *AGPAT2* variants (primarily nonsense or frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting the association of this gene with lipodystrophy includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. The aggregated score for case-level and segregation data is 12 points. Variants in this gene were curated for this summary in 12 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 38231342,35474974, 32153340, 32412105, 32280377, 23430550, 22902344,12765973), with cases presenting as congenital, generalized lipodystrophy. More evidence is available to support the gene-disease association in the literature, but as the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached; this has not been curated exhaustively. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays (both individual and massively parallel), knockout mouse models, expression studies and functional alterations (PMIDs: 21051554, 38127985, 27408775, 37752957, 38623324). Total points for the experimental evidence are 5. Total points for genetic and experimental evidence together are 17.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, we curated AGPAT2 as associated with autosomal recessive congenital, generalized lipodystrophy (OMIM: 608594) and have been lumped in a single gene curation of lipodystrophy (MONDO: 0006573).  \n\nIn summary, *AGPAT2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive, congenital generalized lipodystrophy from birth or early infancy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes GCEP on November 13, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dfa30e7e-e750-4b65-bcd5-9421cc34fc43"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
