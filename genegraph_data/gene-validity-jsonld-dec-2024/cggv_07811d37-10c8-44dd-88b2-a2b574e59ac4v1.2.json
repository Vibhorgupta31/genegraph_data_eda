Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for DOCK8 deficiency. While previous reports have described clinical outcomes for DOCK8 deficiency following HSCT, the effect on lymphocyte reconstitution and function has not been investigated. Our study determined whether defects in lymphocyte differentiation and function in DOCK8-deficient patients were restored following HSCT. DOCK8-deficient T and B lymphocytes exhibited aberrant activation and effector function in vivo and in vitro. Frequencies of αβ T and MAIT cells were reduced while γδT cells were increased in DOCK8-deficient patients. HSCT improved, abnormal lymphocyte function in DOCK8-deficient patients. Elevated total and allergen-specific IgE in DOCK8-deficient patients decreased over time following HSCT. Our results document the extensive catalogue of cellular defects in DOCK8-deficient patients, and the efficacy of HSCT to correct these defects, concurrent with improvements in clinical phenotypes. Overall, our findings provide mechanisms at a functional cellular level for improvements in clinical features of DOCK8 deficiency post-HSCT, identify biomarkers that correlate with improved clinical outcomes, and inform the general dynamics of immune reconstitution in patients with monogenic immune disorders following HSCT.","dc:creator":"Pillay BA","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplant effectively rescues lymphocyte differentiation and function in DOCK8-deficient patients."},"rdfs:label":"DOCK8 expression in PBMCs of AR-HIES patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Show expression of DOCK8 in PBMCs in patients with AR-HIES and healthy controls"},{"id":"cggv:e2954996-8aac-4089-bfdf-c4a13ca36396","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:994689ab-50a7-49fe-872f-52e7c84421cc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Western blots for DOCK8 protein expression in family 1 and patient 2 of family 8 from primary T cell lysates.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19776401","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recurrent sinopulmonary and cutaneous viral infections with elevated serum levels of IgE are features of some variants of combined immunodeficiency.

DOCK8 deficiency is associated with a combined immunodeficiency (CID) phenotype characterized by recurrent cutaneous infections, increased serum IgE levels, and severe atopic disease. Deficiency of DOCK8 is associated with defects in immune cell differentiation, migration, survival and activation. Heterogeneity of disease phenotype severity has been reported and is most likely due to germline variant reversion due to somatic repair (PMIDs:24797421, 33290277). These germline reversions of DOCK8 variants have been shown to reduce eosinophilia and atopy in patients, with rare patients being effectively cured of disease. However, only hematopoietic stem cell transplant has been shown to be curative in the majority of patients. Over 30 unique DOCK8 variants have been reported and are predominantly composed of frameshift, nonsense, splicing, indel variants along with large deletions. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Fifteen unique variants from 14 probands in 4 publications were curated (PMIDs:19776401, 20622910, 20004785, 33290277). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (12 pts). Experimentally, in-vitro studies and animal models deficient for DOCK8 support this gene-disease relationship. DOCK8 null mouse models recapitulate defects of lymphocytes seen in patients (PMIDs:19898472, 22006977, 25422492), with in-vitro studies of patient cells showing abnormalities in DOCK8 protein expression and lymphocyte function, morphology and survival (PMID: 27554822, 25422492, 31021819). Somatic reversion of DOCK8 variants have shown to reduce disease phenotype severity and are correlative with the quantity of lymphocytes containing the reverted allele (PMIDs: 24797421, 33290277). In summary, DOCK8 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive hyper IgE syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on DATE (SOP Version 8). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:07811d37-10c8-44dd-88b2-a2b574e59ac4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
