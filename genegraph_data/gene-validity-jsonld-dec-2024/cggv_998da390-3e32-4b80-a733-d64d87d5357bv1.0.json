Prevalence of COCH mutations worldwide is unknown, as there is no systematic screening effort for late-onset hearing disorders; however, to date, COCH mutations have been found on four continents and the possibility of COCH playing an important role in presbycusis and disorders of imbalance has been considered. Cochlin (encoded by COCH) has also been shown as a major target antigen for autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss. In this report, we present histopathology, immunohistochemistry and proteomic analyses of inner ear tissues from post-mortem DFNA9 temporal bone samples of an individual from a large Dutch kindred segregating the P51S mutation and adult human unaffected controls, and wild-type (+/+) and Coch null (-/-) knock-out mice. DFNA9 is an inner ear disorder with a unique histopathology showing loss of cellularity and aggregation of abundant homogeneous acellular eosinophilic deposits in the cochlear and vestibular labyrinths, similar to protein aggregation in well-known neurodegenerative disorders. By immunohistochemistry on the DFNA9 temporal bone sections, we have shown cochlin staining of the characteristic cochlear and vestibular deposits, indicating aggregation of cochlin in the same structures in which it is normally expressed. Proteomic analysis identified cochlin as the most abundant protein in mouse and human cochleae. The high-level expression and stability of cochlin in the inner ear, even in the absence and severe atrophy of the fibrocytes that normally express COCH, are shown through these studies and further elucidate the pathobiologic events occurring in DFNA9 leading to hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Robertson NG","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Cochlin immunostaining of inner ear pathologic deposits and proteomic analysis in DFNA9 deafness and vestibular dysfunction."},"rdfs:label":"Robertson 2006 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded for human expression."},{"id":"cggv:670e3929-c8f0-441c-b96a-763e67e0907d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dcb2076b-c053-47e3-9c6f-2737d71595bb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Coch was detected in chicken cochlea by in situ hybridization.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9806553","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"DFNA9 is an autosomal dominant, nonsyndromic, progressive sensorineural hearing loss with vestibular pathology.

Mutations in the COCH (coagulation factor C homology) gene encoding cochlin are etiologically linked to DFNA9. Previous studies have shown that cochlin is cleaved by aggrecanase-1 during inflammation in the spleen and that the cleaved LCCL domain functions as an innate immune mediator. However, the physiological role of cochlin in the inner ear is not completely understood. Here, we report that cochlins containing DFNA9-linked mutations (p.P51S, p.V66G, p.G88E, p.I109T, p.W117R, p.V123E, and p.C162Y) demonstrate reduced cleavage by aggrecanase. Notably, in families affected with DFNA9, we found a novel COCH mutation causing p.V123E substitution in cochlin, which significantly reduced protein susceptibility to cleavage by aggrecanase (to about 20.5% of the wild-type). These results suggest that the impaired post-translational cleavage of cochlin mutants may be associated with pathological mechanisms underlying DFNA9-related sensorineural hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Jung J","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Novel COCH p.V123E Mutation, Causative of DFNA9 Sensorineural Hearing Loss and Vestibular Disorder, Shows Impaired Cochlin Post-Translational Cleavage and Secretion."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26256111","rdfs:label":"YUHL5 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD."},{"id":"cggv:94d71492-d8d8-4f0c-92cb-dd718e15372c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9614be1-8a88-461b-94a4-f3b0a7780371","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"genome wide linkage to locus DFNA9.

Here, we report identification of a novel missense mutation, p.F527C, located in the vWFA2 domain in members of a Korean family with late-onset and progressive hearing loss. To assess the molecular characteristics of this cochlin mutant, we constructed both wild-type and mutant cochlin constructs and transfected these into mammalian cell lines. Results of immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated localization of the cochlin mutant in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex, whereas western blot analyses of cell lysates revealed that the mutant cochlin tends to form covalent complexes that are retained in the cell. Biochemical analyses of recombinant vWFA2 domain of cochlin carrying the p.F527C mutation revealed that the mutation increases propensity of the protein to form covalent disulfide-bonded dimers and affects the structural stability but not the collagen-affinity of the vWFA2 domain. We suggest that the instability of mutant cochlin is the major driving force for cochlin aggregation in the inner ear in DFNA9 patients carrying the COCH p.F527C mutation.","dc:creator":"Cho HJ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A novel COCH mutation associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss disrupts the structural stability of the vWFA2 domain."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22610276","rdfs:label":"SD39 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD."},{"id":"cggv:4b62ef55-9a71-4bf9-b384-c29c922a5ab6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bac367d-a1e8-46c9-aa81-088ad78cf745","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis of large family, sequencing of COCH","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0005101","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:4b62ef55-9a71-4bf9-b384-c29c922a5ab6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b4c46701-36f4-47ae-9b56-127c4694e7d0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004086.2(COCH):c.1625G>A (p.Cys542Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6615"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18312449","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Yuan HJ","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Novel mutations in the vWFA2 domain of COCH in two Chinese DFNA9 families."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18312449","rdfs:label":"SD-Z001 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Proband is part of a large Chinese family segregating with progressive hearing loss.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 11 missense variants have been reported in humans. COCH was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1998 (Robertson et al.). Association is seen in at least 13 probands in 11 publications (16151338, 28116169, 28099493, 9806553, 17561763, 21046548, 26256111, 22931125, 22610276, 18312449, 28733840). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >50 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by a knock-in mouse model with the p.Gly88Glu variant, expression in human postmortem temporal bones and chicken cochlea, as well as approved localization and Western blot assessment. In summary, COCH is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 1/5/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:998da390-3e32-4b80-a733-d64d87d5357b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
