We observe co-purification of FAM36A and COX2 proteins, supporting that the FAM36A defect hampers the early step of complex IV assembly at the incorporation of the COX2 subunit. Lentiviral complementation of patient's fibroblasts with wild-type FAM36A increases the complex IV activity as well as the amount of holocomplex IV and of individual subunits.

Even though our affinity-purified anti-COX20 antibody cross-reacts strongly and non-specifically with larger proteins, it clearly detects a protein that migrates at the predicted molecular weight of COX20 (15 kDa) whose steady-state levels are markedly attenuated in COX20-silenced cells (Fig. 1D). \n\nThe net effect of COX20 silencing on mitochondrial metabolism was a decrease in endogenous cell respiratory capacity (Fig. 1E). The abundance of COX2 and COX3 subunits was significantly decreased in COX20-silenced cells, whereas the levels of COX1 or of subunits of other oxidative phosphorylation complexes were not affected (Fig. 1F). Consistent with these observations, Blue Native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analyses showed that COX20 silencing produced an isolated CIV deficiency (Fig. 1G) \n\n\nand led to the accumulation of assembly intermediates containing COX1 alone (S1) or at least COX1 and COX4 (S2 and S3) (Fig. 1H). These subassemblies correspond to the intermediates observed in cell lines derived from patients with mutations in the COX2 metallochaperone SCO1 or in the CIV assembly factor SURF1 (Fig. 1I). The CIV assembly defect in COX20-silenced cells is not due to a gross defect in COX2 synthesis as assessed by in vivo pulse-labeling of mitochondrial translation products. Rather, chase-labeling experiments showed that when COX20 levels are limiting, newly synthesized COX2 is unstable and most of it is rapidly degraded within 2 h of the chase (Fig. 1J). ATP6 was also found to be labile in this chase assay, although we did not observe any effect on the steady-state levels of the F1Fo ATPase (Fig. 1G). These results are consistent with the recently reported phenotype in fibroblasts derived from a COX20 patient (23), and suggest that COX2 is less stable upon depletion of COX20 because of a defect in its membrane insertion, maturation of its CuA site and/or a block in its incorporation into the S2 assembly intermediate.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24403053","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cytochrome c oxidase (CIV) deficiency is one of the most common respiratory chain defects in patients presenting with mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathies. CIV biogenesis is complicated by the dual genetic origin of its structural subunits, and assembly of a functional holoenzyme complex requires a large number of nucleus-encoded assembly factors. In general, the functions of these assembly factors remain poorly understood, and mechanistic investigations of human CIV biogenesis have been limited by the availability of model cell lines. Here, we have used small interference RNA and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) technology to create knockdown and knockout human cell lines, respectively, to study the function of the CIV assembly factor COX20 (FAM36A). These cell lines exhibit a severe, isolated CIV deficiency due to instability of COX2, a mitochondrion-encoded CIV subunit. Mitochondria lacking COX20 accumulate CIV subassemblies containing COX1 and COX4, similar to those detected in fibroblasts from patients carrying mutations in the COX2 copper chaperones SCO1 and SCO2. These results imply that in the absence of COX20, COX2 is inefficiently incorporated into early CIV subassemblies. Immunoprecipitation assays using a stable COX20 knockout cell line expressing functional COX20-FLAG allowed us to identify an interaction between COX20 and newly synthesized COX2. Additionally, we show that SCO1 and SCO2 act on COX20-bound COX2. We propose that COX20 acts as a chaperone in the early steps of COX2 maturation, stabilizing the newly synthesized protein and presenting COX2 to its metallochaperone module, which in turn facilitates the incorporation of mature COX2 into the CIV assembly line.

Processing is chaperoned by Cox20, an integral inner membrane protein whose hydrophilic domains are located in the intermembrane space, and Cox20 remains associated with mature, unassembled Cox2. The Cox2 C-tail domain is exported post-translationally by the highly conserved translocase Cox18 and associated proteins. We have found that Cox20 is required for efficient export of the Cox2 C-tail. Furthermore, Cox20 interacts by co-immune precipitation with Cox18, and this interaction requires the presence of Cox2. We therefore propose that Cox20 binding to Cox2 on the trans side of the inner membrane accelerates dissociation of newly exported Cox2 from the Cox18 translocase, promoting efficient cycling of the translocase. The requirement for Cox20 in cytochrome c oxidase assembly and respiratory growth is partially bypassed by yme1, mgr1 or mgr3 mutations, each of which reduce i-AAA protease activity in the intermembrane space. Thus, Cox20 also appears to stabilize unassembled Cox2 against degradation by the i-AAA protease. Pre-Cox2 leader peptide processing by Imp1 occurs in the absence of Cox20 and i-AAA protease activity, but is greatly reduced in efficiency. Under these conditions some mature Cox2 is assembled into cytochrome c oxidase allowing weak respiratory growth. Thus, the Cox20 chaperone has important roles in leader peptide processing, C-tail export, and stabilization of Cox2.","dc:creator":"Elliott LE","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Multiple roles of the Cox20 chaperone in assembly of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome c oxidase."},"rdfs:label":"Cox20 Chaperoning Activity of Cox2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Down weighted because specific complex IV activity was not measured "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:2391b81d-cfd2-4862-b71b-0418794539c3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:907955f1-2cba-41ca-8e4d-5849518e3aa5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:907955f1-2cba-41ca-8e4d-5849518e3aa5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:c5a4483e-f024-4f10-acce-e0a56c900fac","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198076.6(COX20):c.41A>G (p.Lys14Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16603677"}},{"id":"cggv:7f269d38-9824-413b-997b-6113f1121ab1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198076.6(COX20):c.98C>T (p.Ser33Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345676289"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000763","obo:HP_0010871"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:50a49ffc-26ce-4b17-b6b2-404796f6d20b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c5a4483e-f024-4f10-acce-e0a56c900fac"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33751098","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sensory neuronopathies are a rare and distinct subgroup of peripheral neuropathies, characterized by degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia neurons. About 50% of sensory neuronopathies are idiopathic and genetic causes remain to be clarified. Through a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing, we linked an autosomal recessive sensory neuronopathy to pathogenic variants in the COX20 gene. We identified eight unrelated families from the eastern Chinese population carrying a founder variant c.41A>G (p.Lys14Arg) within COX20 in either a homozygous or compound heterozygous state. All patients displayed sensory ataxia with a decrease in non-length-dependent sensory potentials. COX20 encodes a key transmembrane protein implicated in the assembly of mitochondrial complex IV. We showed that COX20 variants lead to reduction of COX20 protein in patient's fibroblasts and transfected cell lines, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism. Knockdown of COX20 expression in ND7/23 sensory neuron cells resulted in complex IV deficiency and perturbed assembly of complex IV, which subsequently compromised cell spare respiratory capacity and reduced cell proliferation under metabolic stress. Consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in knockdown cells, reduced complex IV assembly, enzyme activity and oxygen consumption rate were also found in patients' fibroblasts. We speculated that the mechanism of COX20 was similar to other causative genes (e.g. SURF1, COX6A1, COA3 and SCO2) for peripheral neuropathies, all of which are functionally important in the structure and assembly of complex IV. Our study identifies a novel causative gene for the autosomal recessive sensory neuronopathy, whose vital function in complex IV and high expression in the proprioceptive sensory neuron further underlines loss of COX20 contributing to mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction as a mechanism in peripheral sensory neuron disease.","dc:creator":"Dong HL","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Bi-allelic

is a syndrome that is characterized by predominant dystonia and mild cerebellar ataxia. We examined two affected siblings with healthy, consanguineous, Turkish parents. Both patients presented with a combination of childhood-onset cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, and sensory axonal neuropathy. In the brother, dystonic features were most pronounced in the legs, while his sister developed torticollis. Routine diagnostic investigations excluded known genetic causes. Biochemical analyses revealed a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV and a coenzyme Q10 deficiency in a muscle biopsy. By exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.154A >C; p.Thr52Pro) in both patients in exon 2 of the COX20 (FAM36A) gene, which encodes a complex IV assembly factor. This variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was heterozygous in both parents, and was absent from 427 healthy controls. The exact same mutation was recently reported in a patient with ataxia and muscle hypotonia. Among 128 early-onset dystonia and/or ataxia patients, we did not detect any other patient with a COX20 mutation. cDNA sequencing and semi-quantitative analysis were performed in fibroblasts from one of our homozygous mutation carriers and six controls. In addition to the exchange of an amino acid, the mutation led to a shift in splicing. In conclusion, we extend the phenotypic spectrum of a recently identified mutation in COX20 to a recessively inherited, early-onset dystonia-ataxia syndrome that is characterized by reduced complex IV activity. Further, we confirm a pathogenic role of this mutation in cerebellar ataxia, but this mutation seems to be a rather rare cause.","dc:creator":"Doss S","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Recessive

A homozygous mutation (p.Thr52Pro) in COX20 gene has been previously described to cause muscle hypotonia and ataxia. In this study, we describe two patients from a non-consanguineous family exhibiting autosomal recessive sensory-dominant axonal neuropathy and static encephalopathy. The whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed that both patients harbored compound heterozygous mutations (p.Lys14Arg and p.Trp74Cys) of COX20 gene. The pathogenicity of the variants was further supported by morphological alternations of mitochondria observed in sural nerve and decreased COX20 protein level of peripheral blood leucocytes derived from the patients. In conclusion, COX20 might be considered as a candidate gene for the complex inherited disease. This observation broadens the clinical and genetic spectrum of COX20-related disease. However, due to the limitation of a single-family study, additional cases and studies are definitely needed to further confirm the association.","dc:creator":"Xu H","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Observation of novel COX20 mutations related to autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy and static encephalopathy."}},{"id":"cggv:e9ffd2b5-addf-4256-b640-c6029c13d47d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c5a4483e-f024-4f10-acce-e0a56c900fac"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31079202"}],"rdfs:label":"II-3"},{"id":"cggv:e9ffd2b5-addf-4256-b640-c6029c13d47d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9ffd2b5-addf-4256-b640-c6029c13d47d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e9ffd2b5-addf-4256-b640-c6029c13d47d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"See Otero et al 2019"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Founder variant default scoring\nPMID: 33751098"},{"id":"cggv:960fe8e8-683e-4432-b7c9-e85e2e6f0056","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:960fe8e8-683e-4432-b7c9-e85e2e6f0056_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"AF of p.W74C 0.000006579 , 1 allele in gnomADv3.1.2\nhttps://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-244843041-G-T?dataset=gnomad_r3\n\n0.1 (default) + 0 (not de novo) + 0 (no fxnal evidence)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5a4ee588-a2b2-4943-acd5-e51644dcda23_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5a4ee588-a2b2-4943-acd5-e51644dcda23","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:66391759-c953-4e7f-8ab7-8520d5cf9d76"},"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the index patient as well as nuclear genes known and postulated to be involved in complex IV deficiency did not reveal any mutations\nNuclear genes: (including COX10, COX15, SCO1, SCO2 and SURF1).

sensory polyneuropathy of genetic origin is rare in childhood and hence important to document the clinical and genetic etiologies from single or multi-center studies. This study focuses on a retrospective chart-review of neurological examinations and genetic and electrodiagnostic data of confirmed sensory polyneuropathy in subjects at a tertiary-care Children's Hospital from 2013 to 2019. Twenty subjects were identified and included. Neurological examination and electrodiagnostic testing showed gait-difficulties, absent tendon reflexes, decreased joint-position, positive Romberg's test and large fiber sensory polyneuropathy on sensory nerve conduction studies in all patients associated with lower-extremity spasticity (6), cardiac abnormalities or cardiomyopathy (5), developmental delay (4), scoliosis (3), epilepsy (3) and hearing-difficulties (2). Confirmation of genetic diagnosis in correlation with clinical presentation was obtained in all cases (COX20 n = 2, HADHA n = 2, POLG n = 1, FXN n = 4, ATXN2 n = 3, ATM n = 3, GAN n = 2, SPG7 n = 1, ZFYVE26 n = 1, FH n = 1). Our single-center study shows genetic sensory polyneuropathies associated with progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as mitochondrial ataxia, Friedreich ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, ataxia telangiectasia, spastic paraplegia, giant axonal neuropathy, and fumarate hydratase deficiency. We also present our cohort data in light of clinical features reported for each gene-specific disease subtype in the literature and highlight the importance of genetic testing in the relevant clinical context of electrophysiological findings of peripheral sensory polyneuropathy.","dc:creator":"Chakravorty S","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Expanding the genotype-phenotype correlation of childhood sensory polyneuropathy of genetic origin."}},{"id":"cggv:e098ea2c-d1c2-41c3-8c3d-4ec887ca5085_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c5a4483e-f024-4f10-acce-e0a56c900fac"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32999401"}],"rdfs:label":"Case 4"},{"id":"cggv:d04f07a8-f26d-4ea8-bf02-33d7e6d939c7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d04f07a8-f26d-4ea8-bf02-33d7e6d939c7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d04f07a8-f26d-4ea8-bf02-33d7e6d939c7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NOT DESCRIBED AS FOUNDER YET"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"NOT DESCRIBED AS FOUNDER YET"},{"id":"cggv:e098ea2c-d1c2-41c3-8c3d-4ec887ca5085","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e098ea2c-d1c2-41c3-8c3d-4ec887ca5085_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e098ea2c-d1c2-41c3-8c3d-4ec887ca5085_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"FOUNDER VARIANT"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"FOUNDER VARIANT"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4735,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:27e6f46e-2a60-45b4-8aee-76940ec7b4d1","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:26970","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *COX20* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 17, 2022. *COX20* encodes a Cytochrome *c* oxidase (complex IV) assembly factor. \n\n*COX20* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 23125284). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX20*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX20 *phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven unique variants, including one nonsense (occurring in the last exon, 4/4), two intronic, and four missense variants, in 16 probands across seven publications from 2013-2021 (PMIDs: 23125284, 30656193, 32606554, 24202787, 31079202, 32999401, 33751098). Of note, the p.Arg14Lys and p.Thr52Pro variants appear to be founder variants, in the Eastern Chinese and Turkish populations, respectively, while the c.157+3G>C and p.Trp74Cys variants appear to be recurrent. *COX20* pathogenic variants were first reported in a child with ataxia, hypotonia, developmental delay, and short stature in the setting of complex IV deficiency in muscle and skin.  Subsequent publications have shown expansion of the phenotypic spectrum that ranges from childhood to adolescent onset sensory neuropathy, dystonia, and sensory ataxia, as well as muscle weakness, intellectual disability, and cerebellar atrophy. Loss-of-function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 22095077, 24403053, 23125284). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 17, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2391b81d-cfd2-4862-b71b-0418794539c3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
