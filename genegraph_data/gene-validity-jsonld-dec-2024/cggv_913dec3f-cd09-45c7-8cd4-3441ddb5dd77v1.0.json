The predominance of autosomal-recessive causes allowed us to make several key observations. We highlight 155 genes that we propose to be recessive, disease-related candidates. We report additional mutational events in 64 previously reported candidates (40 recessive), and these events support their candidacy. We report recessive forms of genes that were previously associated only with dominant disorders and that have phenotypes ranging from consistent with to conspicuously distinct from the known dominant phenotypes. We also report homozygous loss-of-function events that can inform the genetics of complex diseases. We were also able to deduce the likely causal variant in most couples who presented after the loss of one or more children, but we lack samples from those children. Although a similar pattern of mostly recessive causes was observed in the prenatal setting, the higher proportion of loss-of-function events in these cases was notable. The allelic series presented by the wealth of recessive variants greatly expanded the phenotypic expression of the respective genes. We also make important observations about dominant disorders; these observations include the pattern of de novo variants, the identification of 74 candidate dominant, disease-related genes, and the potential confirmation of 21 previously reported candidates. Finally, we describe the influence of a predominantly autosomal-recessive landscape on the clinical utility of rapid sequencing (Flash Exome). Our cohort's genotypic and phenotypic data represent a unique resource that can contribute to improved variant interpretation through data sharing.","dc:creator":"Monies D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Lessons Learned from Large-Scale, First-Tier Clinical Exome Sequencing in a Highly Consanguineous Population."}},"rdfs:label":"Monies REQ18-1959"},{"id":"cggv:8da66e7a-409a-46be-b388-1faa7745fdb9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8da66e7a-409a-46be-b388-1faa7745fdb9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Even though this is a nonsense variant, it is decreased to a missense variant score due to the termination being in the last exon and presumably escaping nonsense mediated decay."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.2},{"id":"cggv:913dec3f-cd09-45c7-8cd4-3441ddb5dd77_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:913dec3f-cd09-45c7-8cd4-3441ddb5dd77_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3fe5a779-53ad-4555-83b9-13ac6bb84977","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a59e7182-7cae-4f55-a3ac-b7e0f50cac46","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Western blot analysis shows expression in mouse embryonic heart tissue","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31784580","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"TBX5 is a T-box family transcription factor that regulates heart and forelimb development in vertebrates and functional deficiencies in this protein result in Holt-Oram syndrome. Recently, we have shown that acetylation of TBX5 potentiates its activity and is important for heart and limb development. Here we report that class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5 associate with TBX5 and repress its role in cardiac gene transcription. Both HDAC4 and HDAC5 deacetylate TBX5, which promotes its relocation to the cytoplasm and HDAC4 antagonizes the physical association and functional cooperation between TBX5 and MEF2C. We also show that protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) relieves the HDAC4/5-mediated repression of TBX5.

Exome sequencing in large CHD cohorts has been performed to provide insights into the genetic aetiology of CHD. This includes a study of 1891 probands by our group in collaboration with others, which identified three novel genes-CDK13, PRKD1, and CHD4, in patients with syndromic CHD. PRKD1 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is important in a variety of fundamental cellular functions. Individuals with a heterozygous mutation in PRKD1 may have facial dysmorphism, ectodermal dysplasia and may have CHDs such as pulmonary stenosis, atrioventricular septal defects, coarctation of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve.
