These EV-HPVs cause warts and increase the risk of skin carcinomas in otherwise healthy individuals. Inactivating mutations in epidermodysplasia verruciformis 1 (EVER1) or EVER2 have been identified in most, but not all, patients with autosomal recessive EV. We found that 2 young adult siblings presenting with T cell deficiency and various infectious diseases, including persistent EV-HPV infections, were homozygous for a mutation creating a stop codon in the ras homolog gene family member H (RHOH) gene. RHOH encodes an atypical Rho GTPase expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells. Patients' circulating T cells contained predominantly effector memory T cells, which displayed impaired TCR signaling. Additionally, very few circulating T cells expressed the β7 integrin subunit, which homes T cells to specific tissues. Similarly, Rhoh-null mice exhibited a severe overall T cell defect and abnormally small numbers of circulating β7-positive cells. Expression of the WT, but not of the mutated RHOH, allele in Rhoh-/- hematopoietic stem cells corrected the T cell lymphopenia in mice after bone marrow transplantation. We conclude that RHOH deficiency leads to T cell defects and persistent EV-HPV infections, suggesting that T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic EV-HPV infections.","dc:creator":"Crequer A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Human RHOH deficiency causes T cell defects and susceptibility to EV-HPV infections."}},"rdfs:label":"IV.1"},{"id":"cggv:34e81104-d7e8-47d1-a06f-959c0d2f3731","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34e81104-d7e8-47d1-a06f-959c0d2f3731_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:34e81104-d7e8-47d1-a06f-959c0d2f3731_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Immunoblot analysis of NIH/3T3 cells transfected with WT RHOH, Y38X RHOH, or 139-C RHOH.

RhoH deficiency resulted in defective CD3zeta phosphorylation, impaired translocation of the signaling molecule Zap70 to the immunological synapse and reduced activation of Zap70-mediated signaling in thymic and peripheral T cells. Proteomic analyses demonstrated that RhoH is a component of TCR signaling and is required for recruitment of Zap70 to the TCR through interaction with RhoH noncanonical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). In vivo reconstitution studies also demonstrated that RhoH function depends on phosphorylation of the RhoH ITAMs. These findings suggest that RhoH is a critical regulator of thymocyte development and TCR signaling by mediating recruitment and activation of Zap70.","dc:creator":"Gu Y","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"RhoH GTPase recruits and activates Zap70 required for T cell receptor signaling and thymocyte development."},"rdfs:label":"RHOH -/- mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":5981,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f3216b6f-d1c1-4723-b516-c4a3b13562b0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0032666","gene":"hgnc:686","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"•\tRas homolog family member H (RHOH) was first identified in Dallery et al in 1995 (PMID 7784061). Variant in RHOH was first reported in patients in 2012 (Crequer A, et al., 2012, PMID: 22850876). RHOH is a gene encoding for an atypical Rho GTPase specific for hematopoietic cells (PMID: 30156265). Canonical Rho GTPases function as intracellular switches, transducing signals from various membrane receptors, including T and B cell receptors. Atypical Rho GTPases, including RHOH, lack GTPase activity and therefore remain in the active, GTP-bound conformation(PMID: 22850876). One nonsense variant has been reported in 1 proband in 1 publication (PMIDs: 22850876). Affected individuals present persistent EV-HPV infections in early ages, naïve T cell lymphopenia. Patients’ T cells in PBMCs failed to proliferate in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, but showed weak proliferation to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 Ab, PHA, or PMA/ionomycin. Moreover, although RHOH is normally expressed in all leukocytes, the T cell lymphopenia is clearly the strongest phenotype in mice and human lacking RHOH (PMID: 17028588). Bone marrow cells from Rhoh–/– mice transduced with WT RHOH cDNA has significantly larger numbers of T cells, resulting in the partial rescue of Rhoh–/– T cell lymphopenia. In summary, RHOH is moderately associated with autosomal recessive RHOH deficiency. This has been demonstrated in both the research and the clinical diagnostic setting, but is not upheld over time because no more clinical diagnostic reported to date. Due to very limited genetic evidence, the classification is Limited. Classification approved by SCID-CID GCEP on Feb 17, 2023.\n\nDue to very limited genetic evidence, the classification is modified to Limited.
