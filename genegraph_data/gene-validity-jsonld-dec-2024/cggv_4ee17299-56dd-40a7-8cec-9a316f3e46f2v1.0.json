The molecular mechanisms underlying ALS are poorly understood. Mutations in SOD1 is one of the known causes of ALS but occur only in a very small number of cases of ALS. Interestingly, mutations in human angiogenin (hANG), a member of the ribonuclease A (RNase A) superfamily known to be involved in neovascularization, have been recently reported in patients with ALS, but the effects of these mutations on MN differentiation and survival has not been investigated. We have used the well-characterized pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell culture model of neuro-ectodermal differentiation to study the effects of hANG-ALS variants on MN differentiation and survival. Here we report that P19 EC cells induced to differentiate in the presence of hANG and hANG-ALS-associated variants internalize the wild-type and variant proteins. The P19 EC cells differentiate to form neurons but the ability of the neurites to extend and make contacts with neighbouring neurites is compromised when treated with the hANG-ALS variants. In addition, hANG-ALS variants also have a cytotoxic effect on MNs leading to their degeneration. hANG was able to protect neurons from hypoxia-induced cell death, but the variants of hANG implicated in ALS lacked the neuroprotective activity. Our findings show that ANG plays an important role in neurite extension/pathfinding and survival providing a causal link between mutations in hANG and ALS.","dc:creator":"Subramanian V","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Human angiogenin is a neuroprotective factor and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated angiogenin variants affect neurite extension/pathfinding and survival of motor neurons."},"rdfs:label":"Hypoxia induced motor neuron degeneration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not clear that there is a big difference between WT ANG and the variants, and there is some heterogeneity in variant effect.

ANG was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2004 (Greenway et al., PMID 15557516). At least 31 unique missense variants have been reported in humans, of these 16 were eligible for scoring using a minor allele frequency threshold of <0.000005 in the gnomAD v2.1.1 non-neurological conditions dataset. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship consists mostly of individual case reports with evidence of angiogenin expression in spinal motor neurons making up the experimental data. \nSummary of Case Level Data: 2.7 POINTS\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 70 probands in 21 publications (PMIDs 15557516, 16501576, 17886298, 17703939, 18087731, 18852347, 19153377, 19363631, 20577002, 21621297, 22190368, 22292798, 22292843, 22645277, 22752089, 23155438, 23228179, 28160950, 28444446, 31025543, 31432357) of which 23 probands from 6 studies (PMIDs 15557516, 16501576, 17886298, 18087731, 22190368, 22292843) contribute to the case level data score due to many of the most highly reported variants also being present at high frequencies in control datasets and gnomAD v2.1.1 non-neuro. Common functional assays demonstrating the effect of variants on the gene product included nuclear translocation, ribonuclease activity, angiogenic activity and morphology of cultured motor neurons co-cultured with angiogenin with ALS associated variants (PMIDs 17916583, 17886298, 23047679, 22292843, 31025543, 31432357). These assays were not used to increase case-level evidence as functional changes were observed in benign variants for example K41I [K17I]. Evidence of disruption to stress granule formation of variant K64I [K40I] was the only eligible functional data to increase the score of a case-level variant report (PMID 23047679).    \nSummary of Experimental Data: 0.5 POINTS\nAngiogenin is expressed in fetal and adult spinal motor neurons and endothelial cells (PMID 17886298). A phenotype rescue study was performed on SOD1 G93D mice. In this experiment it was shown that delivery of recombinant angiogenin ameliorated motor symptoms and extended lifespan. However, the phenotype was not fully rescued, and it was not clear what cellular process caused the underlying the results, so this evidence did not contribute towards the overall score (PMID 19109488).\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4ee17299-56dd-40a7-8cec-9a316f3e46f2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
