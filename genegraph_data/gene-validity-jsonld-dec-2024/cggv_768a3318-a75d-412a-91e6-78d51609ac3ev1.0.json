Whole exome sequencing (WES) in ten sporadic and one familial case of EIMFS revealed compound heterozygous SLC12A5 (encoding the neuronal K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter KCC2) mutations in two families: c.279 + 1G > C causing skipping of exon 3 in the transcript (p.E50_Q93del) and c.572 C >T (p.A191V) in individuals 1 and 2, and c.967T > C (p.S323P) and c.1243 A > G (p.M415V) in individual 3. Another patient (individual 4) with migrating multifocal seizures and compound heterozygous mutations [c.953G > C (p.W318S) and c.2242_2244del (p.S748del)] was identified by searching WES data from 526 patients and SLC12A5-targeted resequencing data from 141 patients with infantile epilepsy. Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp analysis demonstrated strongly suppressed Cl(-) extrusion function of E50_Q93del and M415V mutants, with mildly impaired function of A191V and S323P mutants. Cell surface expression levels of these KCC2 mutants were similar to wildtype KCC2. Heterologous expression of two KCC2 mutants, mimicking the patient status, produced a significantly greater intracellular Cl(-) level than with wildtype KCC2, but less than without KCC2. These data clearly demonstrated that partially disrupted neuronal Cl(-) extrusion, mediated by two types of differentially impaired KCC2 mutant in an individual, causes EIMFS.","dc:creator":"Saitsu H","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Impaired neuronal KCC2 function by biallelic SLC12A5 mutations in migrating focal seizures and severe developmental delay."}},{"id":"cggv:f73667d6-22a6-4a3e-ac8d-2ba3f640071b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7b52a24e-8320-4be0-9761-33d1e512582f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436767"}],"rdfs:label":"Individual 1"},{"id":"cggv:a82c6b47-ab77-4a48-b290-727c67976667","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a82c6b47-ab77-4a48-b290-727c67976667_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a82c6b47-ab77-4a48-b290-727c67976667_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Chloride equilibrium potential was measured in cells expressing the variant protein, and it was not significantly positive compared to cells expressing the WT protein, but seemed to be a little more positive.

In contrast, in cases from non-consanguineous families, genes that cause disorders in a recessive manner should remain as potential candidates. Herein, we performed gene panel sequencing of a patient with EIMFS from a non-consanguineous family, and found a compound heterozygous constellation consisting of a maternally inherited p.Ser399Leu and a de novo p.Arg880Leu in SLC12A5, which encodes the neuronal KCC2 cotransporter.

KCC2 mutants, however, exhibited a depolarized ECl relative to wildtype KCC2. The estimated ECl for all three mutants was similar and did not differ significantly from that in cells solely expressing GlyR a2 and eGFP (Fig. 3c), consistent with passive equilibration of Cl  ions as predicted from the pipette and extracellular solutions.

KCC2, is exclusively expressed in neurons where it is thought to drive intracellular Cl- to low concentrations and shift the reversal potential for Cl- conductances such as GABA(A) or glycine receptor channels, thus participating in the postnatal development of inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. Indeed, expression of the cotransporter is low at birth and increases postnatally, at a time when the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons decreases and gamma-aminobutyric acid switches its effect from excitatory to inhibitory. To assert the significance of KCC2 in neuronal function, we disrupted the mouse gene encoding this neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter. We demonstrate that animals deficient in KCC2 exhibit frequent generalized seizures and die shortly after birth. We also show upregulation of Fos, the product of the immediate early gene c-fos, and the significant loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, both indicative of brain injury. The regions most affected are the hippocampus and temporal and entorhinal cortices. Extracellular field potential measurements in the CA1 hippocampus exhibited hyperexcitability. Application of picrotoxin, a blocker of the GABA(A) receptor, further increased hyperexcitability in homozygous hippocampal sections. Pharmacological treatment of pups showed that diazepam relieved the seizures while phenytoin prevented them between postnatal ages P4-P12. Finally, we demonstrate that adult heterozygote animals show increased susceptibility for epileptic seizure and increased resistance to the anticonvulsant effect of propofol. Taken together, these results indicate that KCC2 plays an important role in controlling CNS excitability during both postnatal development and adult life.","dc:creator":"Woo NS","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Hyperexcitability and epilepsy associated with disruption of the mouse neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter gene."},"rdfs:label":"KCC2b-specific mouse knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6057,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":4.8,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e9954683-d9ed-4cb3-b7ff-08e91dffc5f6","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100062","gene":"hgnc:13818","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*SLC12A5* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy in 2015 (Stödberg et al., PMID:26333769). Typical phenotypes of these probands include infantile-onset focal seizures, which are often epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, global developmental delay, hypotonia, progressive microcephaly, delayed myelination and cerebral atrophy (PMIDs: 26333769, 27436767, and 31618474). Of note, there has been an assertion made for autosomal dominant susceptibility to idiopathic generalized epilepsy (OMIM:616685). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. The Epilepsy GCEP does not curate for disease susceptibility, so the information about epilepsy susceptibility will not be curated at this time. This entry will only cover autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (MONDO:0100062).\n\nTen variants (missense, small in-frame deletions, and splicing) that have been reported in six probands in three publications (PMIDs: 26333769, 27436767, 31618474) are included in this curation. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that the mechanism of pathogenicity may be loss of function. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced transporter activity of proteins with some variants, although few studies are available at this time (PMIDs: 26333769, 27436767). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knockout mouse model in which gentle handling or movement of the mother and littermates triggered seizures (PMID: 12000122). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 7, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:768a3318-a75d-412a-91e6-78d51609ac3e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
