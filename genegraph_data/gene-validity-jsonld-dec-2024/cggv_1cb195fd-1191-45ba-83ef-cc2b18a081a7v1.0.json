To date, mutations in only two nuclear genes causing COX deficiency have been described. We report here a genetic linkage study of a consanguineous family with an isolated COX defect and subsequent identification of a mutation in a third nuclear gene causing a deficiency of the enzyme. A genome-wide search for homozygosity allowed us to map the disease gene to chromosome 17p13.1-q11.1 (Z (max)= 2.46; theta = 0.00 at the locus D17S799). This region encompasses two genes, SCO1 and COX10, encoding proteins involved in COX assembly. Mutation analysis followed by a complementation study in yeast permitted us to ascribe the COX deficiency to a homozygous missense mutation in the COX10 gene. This gene encodes heme A:farnesyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step in the conversion of protoheme to the heme A prosthetic groups of the enzyme. All three nuclear genes now linked to isolated COX deficiency are involved in the maturation and assembly of COX, emphasizing the major role of such genes in COX pathology.","dc:creator":"Valnot I","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"A mutation in the human heme A:farnesyltransferase gene (COX10 ) causes cytochrome c oxidase deficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1cb195fd-1191-45ba-83ef-cc2b18a081a7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1cb195fd-1191-45ba-83ef-cc2b18a081a7_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0435d9dc-b657-46e0-9542-95f0c73dfe71_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0435d9dc-b657-46e0-9542-95f0c73dfe71","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5b793a0e-8cea-4906-a156-bdad74f85649","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001303.4(COX10):c.612C>A (p.Asn204Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118859"}},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide homozygosity mapping with single-gene sequencing of all candidate genes in region\n","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosis: mitochondrial encephalopathy with COX deficiency\nAt 18 months presented with ataxia, with neurological deterioration over the next 6 months\nAt 2 years, poor eye contact, muscle weakness, hypotonia, ataxia, ptosis, pyramidal syndrome and epilepsy\nTwo similarly affected sisters with progressive neurological deterioration with COX deficiency (died at 5 and 3 years of age)\n\nLaboratory findings\nBlood and CSF lactate elevated (3.8 and 3.1 mmol/l)\nGC/MS urinary lactate and Kreb’s cycle intermediates\n\nBiochemical testing:\nPatient-derived fibroblasts, muscle, and lymphoblasts showed isolated COX deficiency (Fig. 2)\nWestern blot from patent and control fibroblasts – reduced COX subunit steady-state levels of subunits III and VI (50% of control) and subunit II (<3%)\n","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Prior testing of mtDNA deletions, and several known mtDNA variants, COXI, COXII, COXIII genes\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:676fe84e-4244-47fc-a866-b25e0b804736_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5b793a0e-8cea-4906-a156-bdad74f85649"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10767350"},"rdfs:label":"Valnot proband"},{"id":"cggv:676fe84e-4244-47fc-a866-b25e0b804736","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:676fe84e-4244-47fc-a866-b25e0b804736_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:676fe84e-4244-47fc-a866-b25e0b804736_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional study of N204K in yeast – tested ability to complement the respiratory defect of yeast cox10 null mutant.

Patients with isolated COX deficiency are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in several different assembly factors have been found to cause specific clinical phenotypes. Two of the most common clinical presentations, Leigh Syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, have so far only been associated with mutations in SURF1 or SCO2 and COX15, respectively. Here we show that expression of COX10 from a retroviral vector complements the COX deficiency in a patient with anemia and Leigh Syndrome, and in a patient with anemia, sensorineural deafness and fatal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A partial rescue was also obtained following microcell-mediated transfer of mouse chromosomes into patient fibroblasts. COX10 functions in the first step of the mitochondrial heme A biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing the conversion of protoheme (heme B) to heme O via the farnesylation of a vinyl group at position C2. Heme A content was reduced in mitochondria from patient muscle and fibroblasts in proportion to the reduction in COX enzyme activity and the amount of fully assembled enzyme. Mutation analysis of COX10 identified four different missense alleles, predicting amino acid substitutions at evolutionarily conserved residues. A topological model places these residues in regions of the protein shown to have important catalytic functions by mutation analysis of a prokaryotic ortholog. Mutations in COX10 have previously been reported in a single family with tubulopathy and leukodystrophy. This study shows that mutations in this gene can cause nearly the full range of clinical phenotypes associated with early onset isolated COX deficiency.","dc:creator":"Antonicka H","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in COX10 result in a defect in mitochondrial heme A biosynthesis and account for multiple, early-onset clinical phenotypes associated with isolated COX deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:0ac4fc07-09c4-458c-b4a7-8b85e00acfb2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:59253b3a-1582-4696-9337-ff06ea4c90b5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12928484"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient S"},{"id":"cggv:64ed596d-9cc1-4c64-a956-1421851ecfcc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64ed596d-9cc1-4c64-a956-1421851ecfcc_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:64ed596d-9cc1-4c64-a956-1421851ecfcc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Muscle and fibroblast mitochondria show reduced COX activity, protein levels, and heme A"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0ac4fc07-09c4-458c-b4a7-8b85e00acfb2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ac4fc07-09c4-458c-b4a7-8b85e00acfb2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0ac4fc07-09c4-458c-b4a7-8b85e00acfb2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Muscle and fibroblast mitochondria show reduced COX activity, protein levels, and heme A\n"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ba36f2c5-c584-47a4-a727-006afd0eaeed_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba36f2c5-c584-47a4-a727-006afd0eaeed","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:190e9aad-f777-4076-8518-b286cf067a3a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001303.4(COX10):c.862G>A (p.Gly288Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8402445"}},{"id":"cggv:b6447d95-ccd2-44b9-8920-01074b09da74","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001303.4(COX10):c.1259C>T (p.Pro420Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8402588"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosis: cardiomyopathy and combined complex deficiencies\nPresented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, renal failure, pulmonary valve stenosis, and lactic acidosis\n\nLaboratory findings: combined RC deficiencies (COXI, II, and IV; values not provided).\n","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"mtDNA sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:7398ac81-632b-4d38-a125-4729102e9d68_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:190e9aad-f777-4076-8518-b286cf067a3a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26741492","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial disorders have the highest incidence among congenital metabolic disorders characterized by biochemical respiratory chain complex deficiencies. It occurs at a rate of 1 in 5,000 births, and has phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in about 1,500 nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins may cause mitochondrial dysfunction of energy production and mitochondrial disorders. More than 250 genes that cause mitochondrial disorders have been reported to date. However exact genetic diagnosis for patients still remained largely unknown. To reveal this heterogeneity, we performed comprehensive genomic analyses for 142 patients with childhood-onset mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies. The approach includes whole mtDNA and exome analyses using high-throughput sequencing, and chromosomal aberration analyses using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We identified 37 novel mutations in known mitochondrial disease genes and 3 mitochondria-related genes (MRPS23, QRSL1, and PNPLA4) as novel causative genes. We also identified 2 genes known to cause monogenic diseases (MECP2 and TNNI3) and 3 chromosomal aberrations (6q24.3-q25.1, 17p12, and 22q11.21) as causes in this cohort. Our approaches enhance the ability to identify pathogenic gene mutations in patients with biochemically defined mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies in clinical settings. They also underscore clinical and genetic heterogeneity and will improve patient care of this complex disorder.

Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"COX10 Biochemical function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Applied per GCEP guidelines (max points for number of genes also implicated in disease)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1cb195fd-1191-45ba-83ef-cc2b18a081a7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d0935da4-1285-4470-adec-93f296d769d2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e24e34f-27b4-401b-a778-e5887ef11e49","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Fibroblast mitochondria from patients D and S showed reduced COX activity, protein levels, and heme A (Fig.1, 4, 5 Table 2).

Cox10p is a protoheme:heme-O-farnesyl transferase required for the synthesis of heme a, the prosthetic group of the catalytic center of COX. COX10 conditional knockout mice were generated by crossing a LoxP-tagged COX10 mouse with a transgenic mouse expressing cre recombinase under the myosin light chain 1f promoter. The COX10 knockout mice were healthy until approximately 3 months of age when they started developing a slowly progressive myopathy. Surprisingly, even though COX activity in COX10 KO muscles was <5% of control muscle at 2.5 months, these muscles were still able to contract at 80-100% of control maximal forces and showed only a 10% increase in fatigability, and no signs of oxidative damage or apoptosis were detected. However, the myopathy worsened with time, particularly in female animals.

COX10 functions in the mitochondrial heme biosynthetic pathway by catalyzing the conversion of protoheme IX (heme B) and farnesyl diphosphate to heme O, via the farnesylation of a vinyl group at position C2 of heme B. Heme O is in turn converted to heme A, one of the prosthetic groups critical to COX function.    \n\nThe *COX10* gene was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2000 (PMID: 10767350), in a consanguineous African family with mitochondrial encephalopathy and COX deficiency. Subsequent publications reported eight additional probands with a similar early onset, severe, progressive mitochondrial disorder. One adult with later onset and a mild phenotype including myopathy, muscle weakness, and exercise intolerance has also been reported (PMID: 24100867). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX10*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX10* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *COX10* was previously curated by this GCEP on April 22, 2019 (SOP Version 6) as having a moderate association with Leigh Syndrome Spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.   \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 13 unique variants reported in 10 cases from eight publications (PMIDs: 10767350; 12928484; 15455402; 24100867; 26741492; 27290639; 30588737; 32313153). Variants included 12 missense and one frameshift variant. Segregation could be scored in one large consanguineous family (PMID: 10767350). Reported individuals were generally severely affected with features including LSS, neurologic deterioration, ataxia, epilepsy, myopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, macrocytic anemia, failure to thrive, lactic acidosis, and metabolic acidosis. There is one report of an adult who was more mildly affected with muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, demyelinating neuropathy, premature ovarian failure, short stature, renal failure, hearing loss, pigmentary maculopathy, and renal tubular dysfunction (PMID: 24100867).  Skeletal muscle, fibroblasts, and/or liver showed decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, rescue of COX activity and heme A levels in patient derived fibroblast cell lines, and a conditional knockout mouse model that showed complex IV deficiency and a muscle myopathy phenotype (PMIDs: 12928484, 16103131, 33340416).   \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COX10* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 10).
