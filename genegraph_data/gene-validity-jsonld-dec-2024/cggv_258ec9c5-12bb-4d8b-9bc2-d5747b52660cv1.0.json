Genetic linkage analysis, exome sequencing, tumor studies, and functional investigations of 4 generations of a FCCX family led to the identification of a truncating germline mutation in RPS20, which encodes a component (S20) of the small ribosomal subunit and is a new colon cancer predisposition gene. The mutation was associated with a defect in pre-ribosomal RNA maturation. Our findings show that mutations in a gene encoding a ribosomal protein can predispose individuals to microsatellite-stable colon cancer. Evaluation of additional FCCX families for mutations in RPS20 and other ribosome-associated genes is warranted.","dc:creator":"Nieminen TT","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Germline mutation of RPS20, encoding a ribosomal protein, causes predisposition to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma without DNA mismatch repair deficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9286ec5-ed73-47ec-bdca-10dabf5f2ce7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f8e479b-5b08-483c-9757-212efefd0f7c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"a significant increase of 21S pre-rRNAs (which are distributed in 2 close bands in this cell type), as well as an accumulation of 18S-E pre-rRNAs","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24941021","rdfs:label":"small interfering RNA depletion of RPS20 in HeLa cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":8163,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:db91d094-9e87-4e34-a213-0113f01365e8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005835","gene":"hgnc:10405","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The *RPS20* gene encodes a protein required during the late steps of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) formation. RPS20 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dominate Lynch syndrome in 2014 (Nieminen et al., PMID: 24941021). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found Lynch syndrome (MONDO: 0005835) is the only one disease entity associated with this gene at the time of this curation. This curation is based on this disease entity only. This gene-disease association is supported by genetic evidence (4.5 Points). Three variants (frameshift, splicing, missense) that have been reported in three probands in the first report and two recent publications (PMIDs: 24941021, 32424863, 33193653) are included in this curation. Segregation evidence from PMID: 24941021 is also included to support this gene-disease relationship. In addition, in vitro experiments showed that the RPS20 mutation led to a defect in pre–ribosomal RNA maturation and may further disturb the stabilization of p53 (0.5 Point). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship of RPS20 and autosomal dominant Lynch Syndrome. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Colon Cancer GCEP on 06/08/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 3/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
