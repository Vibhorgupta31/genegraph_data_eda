A 16-bp frameshift duplication, the result of an apparent founder effect, is nearly ubiquitous among Puerto Rican patients. A frameshift at codon 322 may be the most frequent HPS mutation in Europeans. We also describe six novel HPS mutations: a 5' splice-junction mutation of IVS5, three frameshifts, a nonsense mutation, and a one-codon in-frame deletion. These mutations define an apparent frameshift hot spot at codons 321-322.

Genetic correction directed to the lungs, bone marrow and/or gastro-intestinal tract might provide alternative forms of treatment for the diseases multi-systemic complications. We demonstrate that lentiviral-mediated gene transfer corrects the expression and function of the HPS1 gene in patient dermal melanocytes, which opens the way to development of gene therapy for HPS.

A positional cloning strategy using yeast artificial chromosomes spanning the HPS locus was used to identify the HPS gene and its murine counterpart. These genes and their predicted proteins are highly conserved at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Sequence analysis of the mutant ep gene revealed the insertion of an intracisternal A particle element in a protein-coding 3' exon. Here we demonstrate that mice with the ep mutation exhibit abnormalities similar to human HPS patients in melanosomes and platelet-dense granules. These results establish an animal model of HPS and will facilitate biochemical and molecular analyses of the functions of this protein in the membranes of specialized intracellular organelles.","dc:creator":"Gardner JM","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"The mouse pale ear (ep) mutation is the homologue of human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Gardner_Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"The mouse model is awarded increased points as two mutations have been shown as causative in the ep mice on different backgrounds.

At least 36 unique variants including missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, and large deletions have been reported in humans. HPS1 is involved in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 1 is characterized by severe oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis, but in some cases, also pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n  \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 Points \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 8896559, 9497254, 9705234, 27593200). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n  \nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 9256466)  \t \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data: 5.5 Points \nThis gene-disease association is supported by mouse models and in vitro functional assays. The \"pale ear\" or ep mouse that carries a spontaneously occurring mutation in Hps1 recapitulates the human HPS phenotype (PMID: 9256466, 9158155). HPS1 interacts with HPS4 to form BLOC-3, which is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (PMID: 12847290, 29190429, 25468649).  \n\nIn summary, HPS1 is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Hermasky-Pudlak syndrome 1. \nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on June 26, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f6d44a89-527f-4864-a1e1-dcd0a17000ca"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
