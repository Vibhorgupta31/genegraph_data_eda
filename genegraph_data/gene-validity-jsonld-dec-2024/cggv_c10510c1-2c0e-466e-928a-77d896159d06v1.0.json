Recently, mutation of PCNT was reported in the context of two overlapping forms of PD: Seckel syndrome and Majewskiosteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPDII). AIM To clinically and molecularly characterise a consanguineous family with Seckel syndrome. METHODS Clinical evaluation, linkage analysis, homozygosity mapping and mutation analysis. RESULTS Unexpectedly, linkage analysis led to the identification of a novel splice-site mutation in CENPJ that segregates with the phenotype in this family. CONCLUSION This report establishes for the first time that mutation of CENPJ can lead to Seckel syndrome and calls for further investigation of the role played by other microcephaly related genes in the pathogenesis of PD.","dc:creator":"Al-Dosari MS","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Novel CENPJ mutation causes Seckel syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:ace262ab-a70d-4123-a0b1-7e2ad6791f25","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ace262ab-a70d-4123-a0b1-7e2ad6791f25_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 points were subtracted for both consanguinity and homozygosity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3e466832-baf7-482e-a60e-422403ee8738_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e466832-baf7-482e-a60e-422403ee8738","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6edea7ff-e0ae-4a3a-a5ef-2968426f15e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018451.5(CENPJ):c.125_126del (p.Lys42ArgfsTer15)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA608986659"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001347","obo:HP_0001276","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001845"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:747c1af4-cec0-4aa0-aa56-225d8ddac921_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6edea7ff-e0ae-4a3a-a5ef-2968426f15e6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30214071","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital microcephaly (CM) is an important birth defect with long term neurological sequelae.

WDR62 missense mutations that retain protein expression represent partial loss-of-function mutants that may therefore provide specific insights into radial glial cell processes critical for brain growth. Here we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to generate three strains of WDR62 mutant mice; WDR62 V66M/V66M and WDR62R439H/R439H mice recapitulate conserved missense mutations found in humans with microcephaly, with the third strain being a null allele (WDR62stop/stop). Each of these mutations resulted in embryonic lethality to varying degrees and gross morphological defects consistent with ciliopathies (dwarfism, anophthalmia and microcephaly). We find that WDR62 mutant proteins (V66M and R439H) localize to the basal body but fail to recruit CPAP. As a consequence, we observe deficient recruitment of IFT88, a protein that is required for cilia formation. This underpins the maintenance of radial glia as WDR62 mutations caused premature differentiation of radial glia resulting in reduced generation of neurons and cortical thinning.

Centrioles and basal bodies are structurally similar, barrel-shaped organelles composed of MTs. In proliferating cells, two new centrioles, termed procentrioles, form during the S phase of the cell cycle in close proximity to the proximal ends of the two preexisting parental centrioles, often at a near-orthogonal angle. Considerable progress has been made toward understanding the biogenesis of centrioles, but the mechanisms that determine their lengths remain unknown. Here we show that overexpression of the centriolar protein CPAP in human cells enhances the accumulation of centriolar tubulin, leading to centrioles of strikingly increased length. Consistent with earlier work, we also find that elongated MT structures can be induced by depletion of the distal end-capping protein CP110 from centrioles. Importantly, though, these structures differ from genuine primary cilia. We thus propose that CPAP and CP110 play antagonistic roles in determining the extent of tubulin addition during centriole elongation, thereby controlling the length of newly formed centrioles.","dc:creator":"Schmidt TI","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Control of centriole length by CPAP and CP110."},"rdfs:label":"Overexpression of CENPJ in human cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:c10510c1-2c0e-466e-928a-77d896159d06_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf4bd40d-c53e-40a3-823b-a9154f755be4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eafbd4a6-8d72-4f89-a648-bf54623a26ff","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"McIntyre et al.

By generating a hypomorphic allele of Cenpj, we have developed a mouse (Cenpj(tm/tm)) that recapitulates many of the clinical features of Seckel syndrome, including intrauterine dwarfism, microcephaly with memory impairment, ossification defects, and ocular and skeletal abnormalities, thus providing clear confirmation that specific mutations of CENPJ can cause Seckel syndrome. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased levels of DNA damage and apoptosis throughout Cenpj(tm/tm) embryos and adult mice showed an elevated frequency of micronucleus induction, suggesting that Cenpj-deficiency results in genomic instability. Notably, however, genomic instability was not the result of defective ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling, as is the case for the majority of genes associated with Seckel syndrome. Instead, Cenpj(tm/tm) embryonic fibroblasts exhibited irregular centriole and centrosome numbers and mono- and multipolar spindles, and many were near-tetraploid with numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities when compared to passage-matched wild-type cells.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no differences in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities, microcephaly 6, primary, autosomal recessive (OMIM: 608393) and Seckel syndrome 4 (OMIM: 613676), have been lumped into one disease entity, autosomal recessive microcephaly 6 with or without short stature. Clinical features of primary microcephaly may include microcephaly, intellectual disability, short stature, and/or mild seizures. In some individuals the presentation has phenotypic overlap with Seckel syndrome, a condition characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, dwarfism, microcephaly with intellectual disability, and a characteristic 'bird-headed' facial appearance (Shanske et al., 1997, PMID: 9128935). CENPJ-related microcephaly is associated with a simplification of the cerebral cortical gyral pattern and a slight reduction in the volume of the white matter, consistent with the small size of the brain, but the architecture of the brain in general is normal, with no evidence of a neuronal migration defect (Woods et al., 2005, PMID: 15806441). Seckel syndrome 4 and autosomal recessive primary microcephaly 6 are currently lumped together into one disease entity per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, while more published literature detailing Seckel syndrome 4 may support two split disease entities in the future. 13 variants (including missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants) have been reported in 12 probands across 8 publications (PMID: 15793586; Gul et al., 2006, PMID: 16900296; Al-Dosari et al., 2010, PMID: 20522431; Darvish et al., 2010, PMID: 20978018; Stals et al., 2018, PMID: 29096039; Shaheen et al., 2019, PMID: 30214071; Cueto-González et al., 2020, PMID: 32549991; Makhdoom et al., 2021, PMID: 34068194) and are included in this curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays) (PMID: 15793586; Schmidt et al., 2009, PMID: 19481458; McIntyre et al., 2012, PMID: 23166506; Garcez et al., 2015, PMID: 25753651; Ding et al., 2019, PMID: 30626697; Shohayeb et al., 2020, PMID: 31816041). Two independent mouse models phenocopied patients with microcephaly 6 with or without short stature. This was supported by expression of CENPJ in the developing neuroepithelium of mice as well as the biochemical function of CENPJ promoting neuronal division and migration. In summary, CENPJ is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly 6 with or without short stature. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
