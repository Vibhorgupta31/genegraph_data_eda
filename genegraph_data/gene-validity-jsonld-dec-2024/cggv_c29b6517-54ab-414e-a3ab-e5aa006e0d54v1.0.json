DC is a clinically heterogeneous disorder diagnosed by the triad of dysplastic nails, abnormal skin pigmentation, and oral leukoplakia; Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH), a clinically severe variant of DC, also includes cerebellar hypoplasia, immunodeficiency, and intrauterine growth retardation. Approximately 70% of DC cases are associated with a germline mutation in one of nine genes, the products of which are all involved in telomere biology. Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations in Adrenocortical Dysplasia Homolog (ACD) (encoding TPP1), a component of the telomeric shelterin complex, in one family affected by HH. The proband inherited a deletion from his father and a missense mutation from his mother, resulting in extremely short telomeres and a severe clinical phenotype. Characterization of the mutations revealed that the single-amino-acid deletion affecting the TEL patch surface of the TPP1 protein significantly compromises both telomerase recruitment and processivity, while the missense mutation in the TIN2-binding region of TPP1 is not as clearly deleterious to TPP1 function. Our results emphasize the critical roles of the TEL patch in proper stem cell function and demonstrate that TPP1 is the second shelterin component (in addition to TIN2) to be implicated in DC.","dc:creator":"Kocak H","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome caused by a germline mutation in the TEL patch of the telomere protein TPP1."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c29b6517-54ab-414e-a3ab-e5aa006e0d54_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a8ca7c4-ccc4-41bb-ac6d-c58adca1affe_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a8ca7c4-ccc4-41bb-ac6d-c58adca1affe","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":33,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3d30dd92-614a-41df-b9f5-41f884cf0f9c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001082486.2(ACD):c.250_252del (p.Lys84del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA214612"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"gastrointestinal mucositis, hyperpigmentation of the skin on the neck, bilateral subpleural reticulation, minor traction bronchiectasis in the left lung, leukocyte telomere length below the first percentile, smoking history of 8-pack years","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0025175","obo:HP_0002875","obo:HP_0002206","obo:HP_0002216","obo:HP_0007588","obo:HP_0005528"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Results were filtered for exonic variants with a population frequency <0.5% in 36 genes related to telomere syndromes or pulmonary fibrosis (ABCA3, ACD, AP3B1, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, CTC1, DKC1, FAM111B, HPS1, HPS4, ITGA4, LIG4, MARS, NAF1, NKX2-1, NOP10, PARN, POT1, RNF168, RTEL1, SAMD9L, SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPB, SFTPC, SFTPD, STN1, TEN1, TERC, TERF1, TERF2, TERT, TINF2, TMEM173, USB1 and WRAP53).

Mutations in telomerase or other telomere-maintenance proteins can lead to diseases characterized by depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow failure (BMF). Telomerase localization to telomeres requires an interaction with a region on the surface of the telomere-binding protein TPP1 known as the TEL patch. Here, we identify a family with aplastic anemia and other related hematopoietic disorders in which a 1-amino-acid deletion in the TEL patch of TPP1 (ΔK170) segregates with disease. All family members carrying this mutation, but not those with wild-type TPP1, have short telomeres. When introduced into 293T cells, TPP1 with the ΔK170 mutation is able to localize to telomeres but fails to recruit telomerase to telomeres, supporting a causal relationship between this TPP1 mutation and bone marrow disorders. ACD/TPP1 is thus a newly identified telomere-related gene in which mutations cause aplastic anemia and related BMF disorders.","dc:creator":"Guo Y","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Inherited bone marrow failure associated with germline mutation of ACD, the gene encoding telomere protein TPP1."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Guo Proband V:1"},{"id":"cggv:72351982-80c5-4714-807b-526b271bfe32","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72351982-80c5-4714-807b-526b271bfe32_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:72351982-80c5-4714-807b-526b271bfe32_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transfection of the mutant protein into 293T cells showed that it localized properly onto telomeres similar to wildtype, but was unable to recruit telomerase to the telomeres.

In surviving adult mutants, adrenocortical dysplasia and hypofunction are predominant features. Adults are infertile due to lack of mature germ cells, and 50% develop hydronephrosis due to ureteral hyperplasia. We report the identification of a splice donor mutation in a novel gene, which is the mouse ortholog of a newly discovered telomeric regulator. This gene (Acd) has recently been characterized as a novel component of the TRF1 protein complex that controls telomere elongation by telomerase. Characterization of Acd transcripts in mutant animals reveals two abnormal transcripts, consistent with a splicing defect. Expression of a wild-type Acd transgene in acd mutants rescues the observed phenotype. Most mutants die within 1-2 days of life on the original genetic background. Analysis of these mutant embryos reveals variable, yet striking defects in caudal specification, limb patterning and axial skeleton formation. In the tail bud, reduced expression of Wnt3a and Dll1 correlates with phenotypic severity of caudal regression. In the limbs, expression of Fgf8 is expanded in the dorsal-ventral axis of the apical ectodermal ridge and shortened in the anterior-posterior axis, consistent with the observed loss of anterior digits in older embryos. The axial skeleton of mutant embryos shows abnormal vertebral fusions in cervical, lumbar and caudal regions.

However, these studies do not resolve whether the TPP1 TEL patch is the only mechanism for telomerase recruitment and whether telomerase regulation studied in tumor cells is representative of nontransformed cells such as stem cells. Using genome engineering of human embryonic stem cells, which have physiological telomere length homeostasis, we establish that the TPP1 TEL patch is genetically essential for telomere elongation and thus long-term cell viability. Furthermore, genetic bypass, protein fusion, and intragenic complementation assays define two distinct additional mechanisms of TPP1 involvement in telomerase action at telomeres. We demonstrate that TPP1 provides an essential step of telomerase activation as well as feedback regulation of telomerase by telomere length, which is necessary to determine the appropriate telomere length set point in human embryonic stem cells.

This complex functions to regulate telomerase and telomere end protection (PMID: 32674474). Individuals with variants in *ACD* have variable phenotypes including oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, abnormal skin pigmentation, premature graying of the hair, cerebellar hypoplasia, bone marrow failure, aplastic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis, and short telomere length (PMIDs: 30064976, 30995915, 31515401). Pulmonary phenotypes have been seen both in isolation and as part of a syndromic presentation (PMID: 31515401). There is typically a pediatric age of onset for patients with a diagnosis of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome or dyskeratosis congenita, whereas there is an adult age of onset for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nVariants in *ACD* have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: dyskeratosis congenita, autosomal dominant 6, dyskeratosis congenita, autosomal recessive 7, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, hereditary isolated aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, *ACD*-related short telomere syndrome (OMIM: 616553). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in familial melanoma and long telomeres. Variants associated with long and short telomeres are distinct and the long telomere phenotype will be assessed separately.  \n\nNine variants (6 missense, 2 in-frame indels, 1 frameshift) that have been reported in 10 probands across 6 publications (PMIDs: 25233904, 25205116, 30064976, 31515401, 30995915, 33446513) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function assays, expression studies, functional alteration assays, cell culture models, animal models, and rescue models (PMIDs: 33446513, 25205116, 27807141, 25128433, 15537664). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ACD* and semidominant *ACD*-related short telomere syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
