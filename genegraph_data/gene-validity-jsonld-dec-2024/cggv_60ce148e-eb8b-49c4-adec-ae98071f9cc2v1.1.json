To determine whether rENaC could account for sodium absorption in vivo, we studied the cellular localization of the sodium channel messenger RNA subunits by in situ hybridization and their cellular and subcellular distribution by immunocytochemistry in the kidney, colon, salivary, and sweat glands of the rat. In the kidney, we show that the three subunit mRNAs are specifically co-expressed in the renal distal convoluted tubules (DCT), connecting tubules (CNT), cortical collecting ducts (CCD), and outer medullary collecting ducts (OMCD), but not in the inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD). We demonstrate co-localization of alpha, beta, and gamma subunit proteins in the apical membrane of a majority of cells of CCD and OMCD. Our data indicate that alpha, beta, and gamma subunit mRNAs and proteins are co-expressed in the distal nephron (excepting IMCD), a localization that correlates with the previously described physiological expression of amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium transport. Our data, however, suggest that another sodium transport protein mediates electrogenic amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption in IMCD. We also localized rENaC to the surface epithelial cells of the distal colon and to the secretory ducts of the salivary gland and sweat gland, providing further evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the highly selective, amiloride-sensitive sodium channel is physiologically expressed in aldosterone-responsive cells.","dc:creator":"Duc C","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Cell-specific expression of epithelial sodium channel alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in aldosterone-responsive epithelia from the rat: localization by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry."},"rdfs:label":"In situ hydridization and Immunocytochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ae7421d8-f697-4909-b604-315fe1b4da08","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d87f8959-a1a9-461a-8008-81b5d3e81c6c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Three homologous subunits of the epithelial sodium channel","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775436","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a member of the ENaC/degenerin superfamily.

Detailed analysis of ENaC channel properties and the functional consequences of mutations causing Liddle syndrome has been, so far, limited by lack of a method allowing specific and quantitative detection of cell-surface-expressed ENaC. We have developed a quantitative assay based on the binding of 125I-labeled M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2Ab*) directed against a FLAG reporter epitope introduced in the extracellular loop of each of the alpha, beta, and gamma ENaC subunits. Insertion of the FLAG epitope into ENaC sequences did not change its functional and pharmacological properties. The binding specificity and affinity (Kd = 3 nM) allowed us to correlate in individual Xenopus oocytes the macroscopic amiloride-sensitive sodium current (INa) with the number of ENaC wild-type and mutant subunits expressed at the cell surface. These experiments demonstrate that: (i) only heteromultimeric channels made of alpha, beta, and gamma ENaC subunits are maximally and efficiently expressed at the cell surface; (ii) the overall ENaC open probability is one order of magnitude lower than previously observed in single-channel recordings; (iii) the mutation causing Liddle syndrome (beta R564stop) enhances channel activity by two mechanisms, i.e., by increasing ENaC cell surface expression and by changing channel open probability.

ENaC is composed of three subunits (alpha, beta, gamma), each containing a COOH-terminal PY motif (xPPxY). Mutations causing Liddle's syndrome alter or delete the PY motifs of beta- or gamma-ENaC. We recently demonstrated that the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4 binds these PY motifs and that ENaC is regulated by ubiquitination. Here, we investigate, using the Xenopus oocyte system, whether Nedd4 affects ENaC function. Overexpression of wild-type Nedd4, together with ENaC, inhibited channel activity, whereas a catalytically inactive Nedd4 stimulated it, likely by acting as a competitive antagonist to endogenous Nedd4. These effects were dependant on the PY motifs, because no Nedd4-mediated changes in channel activity were observed in ENaC lacking them. The effect of Nedd4 on ENaC missing only one PY motif (of beta-ENaC), as originally described in patients with Liddle's syndrome, was intermediate. Changes were due entirely to alterations in ENaC numbers at the plasma membrane, as determined by surface binding and immunofluorescence. Our results demonstrate that Nedd4 is a negative regulator of ENaC and suggest that the loss of Nedd4 binding sites in ENaC observed in Liddle's syndrome may explain the increase in channel number at the cell surface, increased Na+ reabsorption by the distal nephron, and hence the hypertension.","dc:creator":"Abriel H","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Defective regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel by Nedd4 in Liddle's syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Whole-Oocyte Macroscopic I-Na "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4e7bcaae-4269-48cd-8f19-86689788d681","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0dd9289b-c3c4-4da8-b933-c248281cd3c6","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Increase in sodium current","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777572","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have studied the functional consequences of a mutation in the epithelial Na+ channel that causes a heritable form of salt-sensitive hypertension, Liddle disease.

Coexpression of the mutant beta subunit with wild-type alpha and gamma subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in the macroscopic amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) compared with the wild-type channel. This change in INa reflected an increase in the overall channel activity characterized by a higher number of active channels in membrane patches. The truncation mutation in the beta subunit of epithelial Na+ channel did not alter the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the channel--including unitary conductance, ion selectivity, or sensitivity to amiloride block. These results provide direct physiological evidence that Liddle disease is related to constitutive channel hyperactivity in the cell membrane.

The epithelial sodium channel is a heteromeric complex composed of the gamma subunit and two additional homologous subunits; alpha and beta, encoded by the *SCNN1A* and *SCNN1B* genes, respectively. The channel is localized in the apical portion of epithelial cells of the distal nephron, distal colon, lung, and ducts of exocrine glands (Canessa 1994 PMID: 8107805). It is crucial for Na+ reabsorption and, thus, electrolyte homeostasis (Hanukoglu 2016, PMID: 26772908). \n*SCNN1G* mutation was first reported in association with autosomal dominant Liddle Syndrome in 1995 (Hansson PMID:7550319). Liddle syndrome is characterized by early-onset (teenage) salt-sensitive hypertension. Laboratory evaluation shows hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, suppressed plasma renin activity and low plasma aldosterone (Tetti 2018 PMID: 29534496). \n*SCNN1G* mutation has also been reported in association with the autosomal recessive condition, Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, and a Cystic Fibrosis-like condition referred to as ‘Bronchiectasis with or without elevated sweat chloride 3’ with an unclear inheritance pattern. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was sufficient phenotypic variability and differences in the molecular mechanisms to support splitting these disorders into three distinct disease entities; Liddle Syndrome (OMIM:618114), Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (OMIM:264350) and Bronchiectasis with or without elevated sweat chloride 3 (OMIM:613071). Autosomal recessive Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I has been curated separately. \nAt least seven unique variants across as many publications have been reported in *SCNN1G* in association with Liddle Syndrome. Six of these variants cause a late truncation eliminating the PY domain and the seventh is a missense variant within the PY domain. Degradation of the protein via the ubiquitination-proteasomal pathway is mediated through the PY domain and loss of this domain allows the accumulation of ENaC in the distal nephron apical membrane leading to an increase in sodium reabsorption (Rotin 2008 PMID: 18691017). Probands with Liddle Syndrome and their families described in the literature display a consistent phenotype with variable expressivity and almost complete penetrance as one family displayed normokalemia and one parent, positive for the familial variant, was unaffected (Fan P 2020 PMID: 32161960). In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and *in vitro* functional assays. The protein product has also been identified to co-localize with, bind to, and function with SCNN1B and SCNN1A (Duc 1994 PMID: 7806569, Stewart 2011. PMID: 21775436, Schild 1995 PMID: 7777572). \nIn summary, *SCNN1G* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Liddle Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:60ce148e-eb8b-49c4-adec-ae98071f9cc2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
