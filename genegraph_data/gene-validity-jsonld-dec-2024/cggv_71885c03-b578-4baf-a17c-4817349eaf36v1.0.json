SGS is caused by de novo germline mutations clustering to a 12bp hotspot in exon 4 of SETBP1. Mutations in this hotspot disrupt a degron, a signal for the regulation of protein degradation, and lead to the accumulation of SETBP1 protein. Overlapping SETBP1 hotspot mutations have been observed recurrently as somatic events in leukemia. We collected clinical information of 47 SGS patients (including 26 novel cases) with germline SETBP1 mutations and of four individuals with a milder phenotype caused by de novo germline mutations adjacent to the SETBP1 hotspot. Different mutations within and around the SETBP1 hotspot have varying effects on SETBP1 stability and protein levels in vitro and in in silico modeling. Substitutions in SETBP1 residue I871 result in a weak increase in protein levels and mutations affecting this residue are significantly more frequent in SGS than in leukemia. On the other hand, substitutions in residue D868 lead to the largest increase in protein levels. Individuals with germline mutations affecting D868 have enhanced cell proliferation in vitro and higher incidence of cancer compared to patients with other germline SETBP1 mutations. Our findings substantiate that, despite their overlap, somatic SETBP1 mutations driving malignancy are more disruptive to the degron than germline SETBP1 mutations causing SGS. Additionally, this suggests that the functional threshold for the development of cancer driven by the disruption of the SETBP1 degron is higher than for the alteration in prenatal development in SGS. Drawing on previous studies of somatic SETBP1 mutations in leukemia, our results reveal a genotype-phenotype correlation in germline SETBP1 mutations spanning a molecular, cellular and clinical phenotype.","dc:creator":"Acuna-Hidalgo R","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Overlapping SETBP1 gain-of-function mutations in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome and hematologic malignancies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28346496","rdfs:label":"Case 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded de novo variant to 0.5 points for consistency with SOP v8; added 0.5 points for functional evidence in this paper."},{"id":"cggv:24972a54-849c-4e66-b4b6-29fabdc513bd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93c70007-11ca-4861-9a25-98e6450d04b2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"DD, seizures, spasticity/hypertonia, vision impairment, ventriculomegaly, typical facial dysmorphisms, hydronephrosis, cardiac defects, choanal stenosis, skeletal anomalies, repeated infections.

Recently, SETBP1 was identified as the causative gene. Herein, we present a Japanese boy with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome resulting from a novel mutation in SETBP1 in order to establish the clinical features and serial MRI findings associated with the syndrome. On the third day of life, the boy was referred to our hospital because of facial abnormalities and feeding difficulty. Midfacial retraction, frontal bossing, deep groove under the eyes, upturned nose, low-set ears, bilateral cryptorchidism, and generalized hypertrichosis were identified on admission. At the age of 7 months, epileptic spasms in series occurred. Based on characteristic facial and skeletal abnormalities and severe developmental delay, we clinically diagnosed him with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. Direct sequencing of the SETBP1 gene revealed a heterozygous mutation (p.Ile871Ser) in exon 4. Although neither cardiac defect nor choanal stenosis were present in our case, the phenotype of our case was nearly identical to those of previously reported cases confirmed by genetic analysis. Serial MRI from the age of 1 month-3 years revealed progressive brain atrophy, especially in the white matter and basal ganglia. However, myelination was age-appropriate and no obvious abnormal signals in the white matter were seen. Diffusion weighted imaging revealed no abnormal findings. Accumulation of MRI data including diffusion weighted imaging from Schinzel-Giedion syndrome cases is needed to understand the mechanism underlying progressive brain atrophy in this syndrome.

Clinical features of this disorder include developmental delay, seizures, facial dysmorphisms, and genitourinary and skeletal anomalies. At least 13 unique missense variants have been reported in humans, and more than 50 individuals with a genetic diagnosis of SGS have been described in the literature (PMID: 28346496). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and variant-level functional assays. This curation includes 15 probands described in 10 publications to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points; PMIDs: 20436468, 26188272, 32460883, 22473152, 25028416, 25082129, 25663181, 26096993, 32445275, 28346496); however, more evidence is available in the literature. The mechanism of disease is proposed to be gain of function resulting in an increase in SETBP1 protein (PMID: 28346496).\n\nOf note, loss of function variants in SETBP1 have been definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by intellectual disability, autism, speech difficulty, motor and developmental delays, seizures, hypotonia, behavior challenges, and less severe facial dysmorphisms (described as “autosomal dominant mental retardation 29” in OMIM [MIM: 616078]).  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these disorders have been curated separately due to differences in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability.  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SETBP1 and autosomal dominant Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
