We mapped the locus causing a novel disorder characterized by camptodactyly, tall stature, scoliosis, and hearing loss (CATSHL syndrome) to chromosome 4p. Because this syndrome recapitulated the phenotype of the Fgfr3 knockout mouse, we screened FGFR3 and subsequently identified a heterozygous missense mutation that is predicted to cause a p.R621H substitution in the tyrosine kinase domain and partial loss of FGFR3 function. These findings indicate that abnormal FGFR3 signaling can cause human anomalies by promoting as well as inhibiting endochondral bone growth.","dc:creator":"Toydemir RM","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"A novel mutation in FGFR3 causes camptodactyly, tall stature, and hearing loss (CATSHL) syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:90130560-3e24-46a9-beaa-c67792773d3d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:90130560-3e24-46a9-beaa-c67792773d3d_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:90130560-3e24-46a9-beaa-c67792773d3d_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:0483a050-ccb3-4a18-8c37-4b6f9744b611_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0483a050-ccb3-4a18-8c37-4b6f9744b611","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7798f42-2de4-4ee7-be9a-3422381c8110","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000142.5(FGFR3):c.1862G>A (p.Arg621His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA126386"}},"detectionMethod":"genome-wide linkage scan, then direct DNA sequencing of 20 affected individuals","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"Height of males: >97th percentile (in 5 of 5); Height of females: >97th percentile (in 8 of 9).

We have identified a role for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) in this process by disrupting the murine Fgfr-3 gene to produce severe and progressive bone dysplasia with enhanced and prolonged endochondral bone growth. This growth is accompanied by expansion of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes within the cartilaginous growth plate. Thus, FGFR-3 appears to regulate endochondral ossification by an essentially negative mechanism, limiting rather than promoting osteogenesis. In light of these mouse results, certain human disorders, such as achondroplasia, can be interpreted as gain-of-function mutations that activate the fundamentally negative growth control exerted by the FGFR-3 kinase.","dc:creator":"Deng C","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 is a negative regulator of bone growth."},"rdfs:label":"Deng Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Recapitulates skeletal phenotypes but not auditory/HL phenotypes."},{"id":"cggv:67d5dcc6-6a9e-4184-a101-5aeaa0de48ef","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6bc417a9-319b-4713-b8b8-de7df6f83180","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This mouse model shows similar severe skeletal phenotypes as mentioned previously in Deng et al.

Contrasts between the skeletal phenotype and achondroplasia suggest that activation of FGFR3 causes achondroplasia.

CATSHL syndrome shows a continuum of disorder with more severe phenotypes in biallelic cases, and less severe phenotypes in monoallelic cases. 2 missense variants are associated with CATSHL syndrome and have been reported in 3 probands in\n3 publications (PMIDs: 17033969, 27139183, 24864036). When inherited monoallelically, the missense variants might form heterodimers with wild type FGFR3 protein, inhibiting kinase activity needed for normal activation and binding to regulate bone growth, ultimately leading to a dominant negative LOF mechanism pathogenicity (Toydemir et al. 2006; PMID: 17033969). This gene-disease association is also supported by 2 mouse models and a zebrafish model (PMIDs: 8601314, 8630492, 32641982). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
