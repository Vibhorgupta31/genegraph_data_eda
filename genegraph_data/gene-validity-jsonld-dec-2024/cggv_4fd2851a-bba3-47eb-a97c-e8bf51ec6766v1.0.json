An increasing number of studies have suggested that the dynamic regulation of microtubules in the growth cone plays an essential role in growth cone steering. The dynamic properties of microtubules are considered to be regulated by variegated cellular factors but, in particular, through microtubule-interacting proteins. Here, we examined the functional role of adenomatous polyposis coli-like molecule 2 (APC2) in the development of axonal projections by using the chick retinotectal topographic projection system. APC2 is preferentially expressed in the nervous system from early developmental stages through to adulthood. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that APC2 is distributed along microtubules in growth cones as well as axon shafts of retinal axons. Overexpression of APC2 in cultured cells induced the stabilization of microtubules, whereas the knockdown of APC2 in chick retinas with specific short hairpin RNA reduced the stability of microtubules in retinal axons. APC2 knockdown retinal axons showed abnormal growth attributable to a reduced response to ephrin-A2 in vitro. Furthermore, they showed drastic alterations in retinotectal projections without making clear target zones in the tectum in vivo. These results suggest that APC2 plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system through the regulation of microtubule stability.","dc:creator":"Shintani T","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"APC2 plays an essential role in axonal projections through the regulation of microtubule stability."},"rdfs:label":"APC2 plays an essential role in axonal projections"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4fd2851a-bba3-47eb-a97c-e8bf51ec6766_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc441e3f-d379-4d49-90e5-fe55ae668acd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4897d450-4e9d-473b-8fb4-c035bc9d2821","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Apc2-/- mice showed impaired learning and memory abilities in the conditioned-fear test and in the Morris Water Maze analysis.

In vivo BrdU labeling and immunohistochemical analyses with specific markers revealed that the laminary abnormalities are a result of dysregulated neuronal migration by a cell-autonomous mechanism. Using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy, we found that APC2 is distributed along actin fibers as well as microtubules. Cerebellar granule cells in dissociated cultures and in vivo showed that BDNF-stimulated directional migration is impaired in Apc2-deficient neurons. We revealed that this impairment stems from the dysregulations of Rho family GTPase activation and TrkB localization, which disrupts the formation of BDNF-stimulated F-actin at the leading edge.

It is often associated with microcephaly, profound intellectual disability, epilepsy, and impaired motor abilities. Twenty-two genes are associated with lissencephaly, accounting for approximately 80% of disease. Here we report on 12 individuals with a unique form of lissencephaly; these individuals come from eight unrelated families and have bi-allelic mutations in APC2, encoding adenomatous polyposis coli protein 2. Brain imaging studies demonstrate extensive posterior predominant lissencephaly, similar to PAFAH1B1-associated lissencephaly, as well as co-occurrence of subcortical heterotopia posterior to the caudate nuclei, \"ribbon-like\" heterotopia in the posterior frontal region, and dysplastic in-folding of the mesial occipital cortex. The established role of APC2 in integrating the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons to mediate cellular morphological changes suggests shared function with other lissencephaly-encoded cytoskeletal proteins such as α-N-catenin (CTNNA2) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b regulatory subunit 1 (PAFAH1B1, also known as LIS1).

Individuals with lissencephaly spectrum disorders related to APC2 pathogenic variants present with posterior predominant lissencephaly +/- corpus callosum dysgenesis, hypoplasia of the cerebellum, severe developmental delay , epilepsy with myoclonic or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. At least 9 unique variants predicted to cause loss of function have been reported in humans in association with autosomal recessive lissencephaly spectrum disorders . Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes experimental data implicating APC2 plays a role in microtubule function at the axonal growth cone and Apc2 -/- mouse models demonstrating defects in the cortical lamina, as well as the cerebellum. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Sotos Syndrome Type 3 which features intellectual disability and characteristic facial features. This association will be assessed separately in the future. Three years have elapsed since the first association between APC2 and lissencephaly spectrum disorders, so a definitive classification is warranted. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations gene curation expert panel on October 11, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4fd2851a-bba3-47eb-a97c-e8bf51ec6766"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
