The underlying disease mechanisms of autosomal recessive (ar)CD are largely unknown. Our aim was to identify causative genes for these disorders by genome-wide homozygosity mapping. We investigated 75 ACHM, 97 arCD, and 20 early-onset arCD probands and excluded the involvement of known genes for ACHM and arCD. Subsequently, we performed high-resolution SNP analysis and identified large homozygous regions spanning the PDE6C gene in one sibling pair with early-onset arCD and one sibling pair with incomplete ACHM. The PDE6C gene encodes the cone alpha subunit of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase, which converts cGMP to 5'-GMP, and thereby plays an essential role in cone phototransduction. Sequence analysis of the coding region of PDE6C revealed homozygous missense mutations (p.R29W, p.Y323N) in both sibling pairs. Sequence analysis of 104 probands with arCD and 10 probands with ACHM revealed compound heterozygous PDE6C mutations in three complete ACHM patients from two families. One patient had a frameshift mutation and a splice defect; the other two had a splice defect and a missense variant (p.M455V). Cross-sectional retinal imaging via optical coherence tomography revealed a more pronounced absence of cone photoreceptors in patients with ACHM compared to patients with early-onset arCD. Our findings identify PDE6C as a gene for cone photoreceptor disorders and show that arCD and ACHM constitute genetically and clinically overlapping phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Thiadens AA","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Homozygosity mapping reveals PDE6C mutations in patients with early-onset cone photoreceptor disorders."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:106c290b-66a1-4a0c-821c-35b61910f769","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5216c14-100d-4311-8c17-e346392ac804","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Transcriptomic profiling of more than 70 human tissues shows that retinal tissues exhibit the highest levels of PDE6C mRNA (https://eyeintegration.nei.nih.gov/).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239781","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The human eye is built from several specialized tissues which direct, capture and pre-process information to provide vision.

A major limitation to the development of effective therapies is the lack of availability of animal models that fully replicate the human condition. Particularly for cone disorders, rodent, canine, and feline models with no true macula have substantive limitations. By contrast, the cone-rich macula of a nonhuman primate (NHP) closely mirrors that of the human retina. Consequently, well-defined NHP models of heritable retinal diseases, particularly cone disorders that are predictive of human conditions, are necessary to more efficiently advance new therapies for patients. We have identified 4 related NHPs at the California National Primate Research Center with visual impairment and findings from clinical ophthalmic examination, advanced retinal imaging, and electrophysiology consistent with achromatopsia. Genetic sequencing confirmed a homozygous R565Q missense mutation in the catalytic domain of PDE6C, a cone-specific phototransduction enzyme associated with achromatopsia in humans. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the mutant mRNA is translated into a stable protein that displays normal cellular localization but is unable to hydrolyze cyclic GMP (cGMP). This NHP model of a cone disorder will not only serve as a therapeutic testing ground for achromatopsia gene replacement, but also for optimization of gene editing in the macula and of cone cell replacement in general.","dc:creator":"Moshiri A","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A nonhuman primate model of inherited retinal disease."},"rdfs:label":"The macaque model harbors a homozygous LOF variant in PDE6C."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"The model has been up-scored as its phenotypes are comprehensive and represent a nearly complete match to the human patient clinical features."},{"id":"cggv:cbff89a0-50a6-489c-ac9f-ecd500092a8f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0aa28b2a-e5db-4256-b8e1-e142919a0659","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This is a naturally occurring zebrafish model that matches the mode of inheritance from the human patients and exhibits lack of light-adapted ERG responses (Figures 1K, 1M) and normal dark-adapted ERG responses.

However, the molecular mechanisms that link phototransduction with photoreceptor degeneration remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that a mutation in the gene encoding a central effector of the phototransduction cascade, cGMP phosphodiesterase 6alpha'-subunit (PDE6alpha'), affects not only the vision but also the survival of cone photoreceptors in zebrafish. We isolated a zebrafish mutant, called eclipse (els), which shows no visual behavior such as optokinetic response (OKR). The cloning of the els mutant gene revealed that a missense mutation occurred in the pde6alpha' gene, resulting in a change in a conserved amino acid. The PDE6 expressed in rod photoreceptors is a heterotetramer comprising two closely related similar hydrolytic alpha and beta subunits and two identical inhibitory gamma subunits, while the PDE6 expressed in cone photoreceptors consists of two homodimers of alpha' subunits, each with gamma subunits. The els mutant displays no visual response to bright light, where cones are active, but shows relatively normal OKR to dim light, where only rods function, suggesting that only the cone-specific phototransduction pathway is disrupted in the els mutant. Furthermore, in the els mutant, cones are selectively eliminated but rods are retained at the adult stage, suggesting that cones undergo a progressive degeneration in the els mutant retinas. Taken together, these data suggest that PDE6alpha' activity is important for the survival of cones in zebrafish.","dc:creator":"Nishiwaki Y","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Mutation of cGMP phosphodiesterase 6alpha'-subunit gene causes progressive degeneration of cone photoreceptors in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"The els zebrafish mutant is homozygous for a PDE6C variant."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The model recapitulates the cone loss and other cellular features of the human patients, as well as inability to respond to stimuli under light conditions."},{"id":"cggv:3355b893-f259-45f6-a956-a5875333225c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e6f345e2-4446-4477-aff8-f8f668f4b869","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This is a naturally occurring mouse model with lack of light-adapted ERG responses and normal dark-adapted ERG responses (Figure 1).

Affected individuals with biallelic causal variants in *PDE6C* have since been identified in a number of subsequent publications. Phenotypes generally occur with congenital or early childhood onset and include severe color vision defects, progressive loss of visual acuity over the course of decades, reduced or absent cone/photopic ERG responses, normal rod/scotopic ERG responses, photophobia, myopia, and/or nystagmus. At least one patient has been reported with central scotoma and macular retinal pigment epithelium atrophy (PMID: 19887631). These cases with causal variants in *PDE6C* are specifically described as cone dystrophy 4 or achromatopsia 5 (MIM#: 613093), depending on the extent of disease progression at the time of diagnosis. Additional case reports have suggested an expanded spectrum of disease that includes phenotypes consistent with cone-rod dystrophy, including electroretinograms with decreased amplitude on both phototopic and scotopic waveforms and mild/moderate constrictions to visual field (PMID: 33001157). Because these diagnoses are considered part of the same phenotypic spectrum, this curation has evaluated a combination of cases under the disease term PDE6C-related retinopathy.\n\nThirteen suspected deleterious variants in *PDE6C* were scored as part of this curation (five nonsense, 1 frameshift, four missense, and three affecting splicing). These variants have been collectively reported in eight probands in three publications (PMID: 19615668, PMID: 19887631, PMID: 30080950). Three probands were homozygous for the variant of interest, but were not reported to be members of consanguineous families. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function in *PDE6C*, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of the gene product or loss of the majority of its enzymatic activity. Additional genetic evidence was available (PMID: 32306724, PMID: 33001157, PMID: 37433860) but not included in this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by evidence that *PDE6C* is highly expressed specifically in retinal tissues (PMID: 30239781). Biochemical data show that *PDE6C* encodes a cGMP phosphodiesterase that is part of the phototransduction cascade and is associated specifically with cone photoreceptor cells, consistent with the cone-specific dysfunction observed in the human patients (PMID: 19801642). This biochemical function parallels that of the *PDE6A* gene, which encodes a rod-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase and harbors loss-of-function variants associated with retinal dystrophy (PMID: 7493036). Naturally occurring zebrafish, mice, and rhesus macaque models harboring biallelic loss-of-function variants in the gene orthologous to *PDE6C* recapitulate many of the features of the human patients such as reduced visual acuity, particularly under normal lighting conditions, lack of light-adapted ERG responses, and normal dark-adapted ERG responses (PMID: 18824093, PMID: 19887631, PMID: 30667376). These models also collectively exhibit progressive thinning of the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor outer segments within the macula, caused by rapid and progressive loss of cone photoreceptors (PMID: 18824093, PMID: 19887631, PMID: 30667376).\n\nIn summary, *PDE6C* is definitively associated with PDE6C-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on November 2nd, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
