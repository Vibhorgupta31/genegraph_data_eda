These two steps are reflected by the complementation groups A and B and the two formally distinguished types of MoCo deficiency that have an identical phenotype. Both types of MoCo deficiency result in a pleiotropic loss of all molybdoenzyme activities and cause severe neurological damage. MOCS1 is defective in patients with group A deficiency and has been shown to encode two enzymes for early synthesis via a bicistronic transcript with two consecutive open reading frames (ORFs). MOCS2 encodes the small and large subunits of molybdopterin synthase via a single transcript with two overlapping reading frames. This gene was mapped to 5q and comprises seven exons. The coding sequence and all splice site-junction sequences were screened for mutations, in MoCo-deficient patients in whom a previous search for MOCS1 mutations had been negative. In seven of the eight patients whom we investigated, we identified MOCS2 mutations that, by their nature, are most likely responsible for the deficiency. Three different frameshift mutations were observed, with one of them found on 7 of 14 identified alleles. Furthermore, a start-codon mutation and a missense mutation of a highly conserved amino acid residue were found. The locations of the mutations confirm the functional role of both ORFs. One of the patients with identified MOCS2 mutations had been classified as type B, in complementation studies. These findings support the hypothetical mechanism, for both forms of MoCo deficiency, that formerly had been established by cell-culture experiments.","dc:creator":"Reiss J","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Human molybdopterin synthase gene: genomic structure and mutations in molybdenum cofactor deficiency type B."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42a79c49-fff6-4ff7-8f10-66119595d1e7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:27660b38-ab6b-408d-8a09-4f805e843d9b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The authors performed both RT-PCR and Western blots in wt mice to detect expression of Mocs2 in various tissues (Fig. 2).

Patients with MoCo deficiency present with neonatal seizures, feeding difficulties, severe developmental delay, brain atrophy and early childhood death. Although substitution therapy with cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) has been successfully used in both Mocs1 knockout mice and in patients with MoCo deficiency type A, there is currently no Mocs2 knockout mouse and no curative therapy for patients with MoCo deficiency type B. Therefore, we generated and characterized a Mocs2-null mouse model of MoCo deficiency type B. Expression analyses of Mocs2 revealed a ubiquitous expression pattern; however, at the cellular level, specific cells show prominent Mocs2 expression, e.g., neuronal cells in cortex, hippocampus and brainstem. Phenotypic analyses demonstrated that Mocs2 knockout mice failed to thrive and died within 11 days after birth. None of the tested MoCo-dependent enzymes were active in Mocs2-deficient mice, leading to elevated concentrations of purines, such as hypoxanthine and xanthine, and non-detectable levels of uric acid in the serum and urine. Moreover, elevated concentrations of S-sulfocysteine were measured in the serum and urine. Increased levels of xanthine resulted in bladder and kidney stone formation, whereas increased concentrations of toxic sulfite triggered neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, Mocs2-deficient mice recapitulate the severe phenotype observed in humans and can now serve as a model for preclinical therapeutic approaches for MoCo deficiency type B.","dc:creator":"Jakubiczka-Smorag J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mouse model for molybdenum cofactor deficiency type B recapitulates the phenotype observed in molybdenum cofactor deficient patients."},"rdfs:label":"MOCS2 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7d30956c-e766-4f49-8734-4a9480a4d94c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e582acf3-0456-4595-8969-58afbaba1756","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Mo-cofactor (MoCo) is necessary for the function of four enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component.

Symptoms, signs and cerebral images can resemble those attributed to intrapartum hypoxia. In humans, molybdenum cofactor (MOCO) has been found to participate in four metabolic reactions: aldehyde dehydrogenase (or oxidase), xanthine oxidoreductase (or oxidase) and sulfite oxidase, and some of the components of molybdenum cofactor synthesis participate in amidoxime reductase. A newborn girl developed refractory seizures, opisthotonus, exaggerated startle reflexes and vomiting on the second day of life. Treatment included intravenous fluid, glucose supplementation, empiric antibiotic therapy and anticonvulsant medication. Her encephalopathy progressed, and she was given palliative care and died aged 1 week. There were no dysmorphic features, including ectopia lentis but ultrasonography revealed a thin corpus callosum.","dc:creator":"Edwards M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Investigation of molybdenum cofactor deficiency due to MOCS2 deficiency in a newborn baby."}},{"id":"cggv:ddd3804e-9bb1-4a6b-b1a5-5e227d9e2c21_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:410b6389-faf3-4390-ae6f-836d1b55be50"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25709896"}],"rdfs:label":"Edwards 2015 - Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:4a6eccb1-71fe-4b92-b832-75c07829eaa4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4a6eccb1-71fe-4b92-b832-75c07829eaa4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ddd3804e-9bb1-4a6b-b1a5-5e227d9e2c21","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ddd3804e-9bb1-4a6b-b1a5-5e227d9e2c21_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ddd3804e-9bb1-4a6b-b1a5-5e227d9e2c21_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"CD spectral analysis demonstrated disruptions to MOCS2B secondary structure due to the presence of the p.Ser140Phe variant (Fig. 2B).

Molybdenum cofactor deficiency type B is characterized by refractory neonatal seizures, dysmorphic features, ocular lens dislocation, and a characteristic urinary profile indicative of an underlying biochemical dysfunction (PMID:33017596). The underlying mechanism is a failure to synthesize molybdenum cofactor, leading to loss of function of the enzymes sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase (PMID:33017596).\n\nEight variants (two missense, one nonsense, three frameshift, one splice-acceptor site, one start-loss) that have been reported in seven probands in three publications (PMID: 10053004, 25709896, 16021469) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be biallelic loss-of-function. The *MOCS2* gene encodes both the large and small subunits of the homotetrameric molybdopterin synthase enzyme. Biallelic loss of function of either subunit is sufficient to cause disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and an animal model (PMID: 27138983, 33017596). Expression of this gene is enriched in the liver, kidney, and brain. Homozygous knock-out of the homologous gene in mice leads to the combined loss of sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase activities. Further, these mice fail to thrive and have a significantly reduced lifespan.\n\nIn summary, *MOCS2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive molybdenum cofactor deficiency type B. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 12/9/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
