In this review, focused on eukaryotic Moco biology, we elucidate the benefits of gene fusions on Moco biosynthesis and beyond. While originally the gene fusions were driven by biosynthetic advantages such as coordinated expression of functionally related proteins and product/substrate channeling, they also served as origin for the development of novel functions. Today, Moco biosynthetic genes are involved in a multitude of cellular processes and loss of the according gene products result in severe disorders, both related to Moco biosynthesis and secondary enzyme functions.","dc:creator":"Mayr SJ","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Molybdenum cofactor biology, evolution and deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"GPHN - biochemical function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Given the existing body of work, the thoroughness of the review, and the fact that the authors directly address the mechanism of disease due to loss of gene function, this score has been upgraded."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c00a7bf8-5c82-4bd2-973a-cd41ddc212f3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e7b63f7-8f9d-42e6-9412-8b32a8aada95","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The authors assayed molybdopterin levels in fibroblasts from two molybdenum cofactor deficiency patients and an unaffected control using HPLC.

A sequence comparison revealed homologies between gephyrin and proteins necessary for the biosynthesis of the universal molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). Because gephyrin expression can rescue a MoCo-deficient mutation in bacteria, plants, and a murine cell line, it became clear that gephyrin also plays a role in MoCo biosynthesis. Human MoCo deficiency is a fatal disease resulting in severe neurological damage and death in early childhood. Most patients harbor MOCS1 mutations, which prohibit formation of a precursor, or carry MOCS2 mutations, which abrogate precursor conversion to molybdopterin. The present report describes the identification of a gephyrin gene (GEPH) deletion in a patient with symptoms typical of MoCo deficiency. Biochemical studies of the patient's fibroblasts demonstrate that gephyrin catalyzes the insertion of molybdenum into molybdopterin and suggest that this novel form of MoCo deficiency might be curable by molybdate supplementation.","dc:creator":"Reiss J","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A mutation in the gene for the neurotransmitter receptor-clustering protein gephyrin causes a novel form of molybdenum cofactor deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"GPHN - FA in patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:22fc58f5-3082-4dcf-8802-718a3b1ba6b3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1c6cf7c-5075-4e73-ad44-00b5afcb25b5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Molybdenum cofactor deficiency patients present with hypotonia and neonatal seizures with or without opisthotonus due to the combined loss of molybdoenzyme activity.

Molybdenum cofactor deficiency type C (MOCODC) is characterized by refractory neonatal seizures, dysmorphic features, ocular lens dislocation, and a characteristic urinary profile indicative of an underlying biochemical dysfunction (PMID: 33017596). The underlying mechanism is a failure to synthesize molybdenum cofactor, leading to loss of function of the enzymes sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase (PMID: 33017596).\n\nLumping and Splitting: \n\n*GPHN* encodes the gephyrin protein, which has two catalytically active domains that both participate in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. This protein also forms oligomeric clusters that act as scaffolds to promote the clustering of glycine and GABA type A receptors at the postsynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons, a process that occurs independent of enzymatic activity. Heterozygous *GPHN* variants have been reported in individuals with complex neurodevelopmental disorders, but it is unclear at this time whether these variants are truly causative. Conversely, MOCODC is an autosomal recessive disease driven by loss of gephyrin enzyme activity. Therefore, this split curation only includes cases of confirmed molybdenum cofactor deficiency type C.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in two probands in two publications (PMID: 11095995, 22040219). Co-segregation with disease has not been observed in the literature. The mechanism of disease is biallelic loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by in vitro functional assays and an animal model (PMID: 9812897, 11095995, 33017596). Molybdenum cofactor synthesis was completely absent in fibroblasts from a MOCODC patient homozygous for a predicted null *GPHN* allele. Homozygous knock-out of the homologous gene in mice leads to the combined loss of sulfite oxidase and xanthine reductase. Further, these mice fail to thrive, have a significantly reduced lifespan, and exhibit spasticity reminiscent of the seizures observed in MOCODC patients.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between *GPHN* and autosomal recessive molybdenum cofactor deficiency type C. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has yet emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 5/12/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
