The GPI anchor precursor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-translationally linked to protein. We cloned a human gene termed PIG-B (phosphatidylinositol glycan of complementation class B) that is involved in transferring the third mannose. PIG-B encodes a 554 amino acid, ER transmembrane protein with an amino-terminal portion of approximately 60 amino acids on the cytoplasmic side and a large carboxy-terminal portion of 470 amino acids within the ER lumen. A mutant PIG-B lacking the cytoplasmic portion remains active, indicating that the functional site of PIG-B resides on the lumenal side of the ER membrane. The PIG-B gene was localized to chromosome 15 at q21-q22. This autosomal location would explain why PIG-B is not involved in the defective GPI anchor synthesis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which is always caused by a somatic mutation of the X-linked PIG-A gene.","dc:creator":"Takahashi M","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"PIG-B, a membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum with a large lumenal domain, is involved in transferring the third mannose of the GPI anchor."},"rdfs:label":"PIG-B involvedin transferring the third mannose of the GPI a"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Mouse cell line did not display any human phenotypes with this evidence.

As such, many developmental disorders are caused by mutations in genes involved in the GPI biosynthesis and remodeling pathway. We describe ten unrelated families with bi-allelic mutations in PIGB, a gene that encodes phosphatidylinositol glycan class B, which transfers the third mannose to the GPI. Ten different PIGB variants were found in these individuals. Flow cytometric analysis of blood cells and fibroblasts from the affected individuals showed decreased cell surface presence of GPI-anchored proteins. Most of the affected individuals have global developmental and/or intellectual delay, all had seizures, two had polymicrogyria, and four had a peripheral neuropathy. Eight children passed away before four years old. Two of them had a clinical diagnosis of DOORS syndrome (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures), a condition that includes sensorineural deafness, shortened terminal phalanges with small finger and toenails, intellectual disability, and seizures; this condition overlaps with the severe phenotypes associated with inherited GPI deficiency. Most individuals tested showed elevated alkaline phosphatase, which is a characteristic of the inherited GPI deficiency but not DOORS syndrome. It is notable that two severely affected individuals showed 2-oxoglutaric aciduria, which can be seen in DOORS syndrome, suggesting that severe cases of inherited GPI deficiency and DOORS syndrome might share some molecular pathway disruptions.","dc:creator":"Murakami Y","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Mutations in PIGB Cause an Inherited GPI Biosynthesis Defect with an Axonal Neuropathy and Metabolic Abnormality in Severe Cases."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband 8"},{"id":"cggv:b26d6518-94d7-434e-8102-fc653fd850e4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b26d6518-94d7-434e-8102-fc653fd850e4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.05,"dc:description":"Downscored due to Consanguinity reported. This variant is absent in gnomAD.

DEVELOPMENTAL AND EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY 80 is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by the onset of refractory seizures in the first year of life. Patients have severe global developmental delay and may have additional variable features, including dysmorphic or coarse facial features, distal skeletal abnormalities, and impaired hearing or vision. At the cellular level, the disorder is caused by a defect in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and thus affects the expression of GPI-anchored proteins at the cell surface (summary by Murakami et al., 2019). The *PIGB* gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in GPI-anchor biosynthesis. The GPI anchor is a glycolipid found on many blood cells and serves to anchor proteins to the cell surface. This gene is thought to encode a member of a family of dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) dependent mannosyltransferases. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]. \n\nMore than 350 unique variants (e.g., frameshift, missense, in-frame indel, nonsense and splice sites) have been reported in humans by ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Ten variants that have been reported in 8 probands in 1 publication (Murakami et al., 2019; PMID: 31256876), are included in this curation. A model system that describes restored function of the GPI anchor synthesis pathway in a mutant mouse cell line (Takahashi et al., 1996, PMID:8861954) also supports this gene-disease relationship. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support *PIGB* in association with DEVELOPMENTAL AND EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY 80. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on meeting date December 5, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
