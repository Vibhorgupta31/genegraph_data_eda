This mutation was subsequently found in all the 20 analyzed Finnish AGU patients, in the heterozygous form in all 53 carriers and in none of 67 control individuals, suggesting that it represents the major AGU causing mutation enriched in this isolated population. Since the mutation produces a change in the predicted flexibility of the AGA polypeptide chain and removes an intramolecular S-S bridge, it most probably explains the deficient enzyme activity found in cells and tissues of AGU patients.","dc:creator":"Ikonen E","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Aspartylglucosaminuria: cDNA encoding human aspartylglucosaminidase and the missense mutation causing the disease."},"rdfs:label":"AGA encodes aspartylglucosaminidase"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Per ClinGen LD GCEP guidelines, gene products that have a well-established function in a metabolic pathway are scored 2 points"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1f315b4a-1a3b-4deb-90fd-2b73f732a4ba_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0299d5b9-5419-49dd-868b-7c2559f80437","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7fd61a9a-fe77-4585-b2c0-161325b95813","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Knockout mice treated with ERT showed restored AGA enzyme activity, complete degradation of accumulated substrate (GlcNac-Asn) in the liver and spleen, and 93% reduction in urinary aspartylglucosamine.

Elsewhere in the world, we and others have described 18 different sporadic AGU mutations. Many of these are predicted to interfere with the complex intracellular maturation and processing of the AGA polypeptide. Proper initial folding of AGA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is dependent on intramolecular disulfide bridge formation and dimerization of two precursor polypeptides. The subsequent activation of AGA occurs autocatalytically in the ER and the protein is transported via the Golgi to the lysosomal compartment using the mannose-6-phosphate receptor pathway. Here we use the three-dimensional structure of AGA to predict structural consequences of AGU mutations, including six novel mutations, and make an effort to characterize every known disease mutation by dissecting the effect of mutations on intracellular stability, maturation, transport and the activity of AGA. Most mutations are substitutions replacing the original amino acid with a bulkier residue. Mutations of the dimer interface prevent dimerization in the ER, whereas active site mutations not only destroy the activity but also affect maturation of the precursor. Depending on their effects on the AGA polypeptide the mutations can be categorized as mild, moderate or severe. These data contribute to the expanding body of knowledge pertaining to molecular pathogenesis of AGU.","dc:creator":"Saarela J","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Molecular pathogenesis of a disease: structural consequences of aspartylglucosaminuria mutations."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 - Saarela"},{"id":"cggv:b5d13c4a-1378-4ed6-bf88-4fb7514c511b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5d13c4a-1378-4ed6-bf88-4fb7514c511b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Scored 0.75pts/variant to yield 1.5pts total and prevent double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5d69c145-09ed-4d8a-aa56-b5ac4b0df422_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d69c145-09ed-4d8a-aa56-b5ac4b0df422","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ddaefab0-5391-46af-8861-92bcccc6a260","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000027.4(AGA):c.800del (p.Leu267fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212729"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:0e9ef6fe-5ece-4f4f-bd4c-2df136ade4b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ddaefab0-5391-46af-8861-92bcccc6a260"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1722323","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase.

This enzyme participates in glycoprotein degradation in lysosomes. AGU results in progressive mental retardation, and no curative therapy is currently available. We have here characterized the consequences of AGA gene mutations in a compound heterozygous patient who exhibits a missense mutation producing a Ser72Pro substitution in one allele, and a nonsense mutation Trp168X in the other. Ser72 is not a catalytic residue, but is required for the stabilization of the active site conformation. Thus, Ser72Pro exchange impairs the autocatalytic activation of the AGA precursor, and results in a considerable reduction of the enzyme activity and in altered AGA precursor processing. Betaine, which can partially rescue the AGA activity in AGU patients carrying certain missense mutations, turned out to be ineffective in the case of Ser72Pro substitution. The Trp168X nonsense allele results in complete lack of AGA polypeptide due to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mRNA. Amlexanox, which inhibits NMD and causes a translational read-through, facilitated the synthesis of a full-length, functional AGA protein from the nonsense allele. This could be demonstrated as presence of the AGA polypeptide and increased enzyme activity upon Amlexanox treatment. Furthermore, in the Ser72Pro/Trp168X expressing cells, Amlexanox induced a synergistic increase in AGA activity and polypeptide processing due to enhanced processing of the Ser72Pro polypeptide. Our data show for the first time that Amlexanox might provide a valid therapy for AGU.","dc:creator":"Banning A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Amlexanox provides a potential therapy for nonsense mutations in the lysosomal storage disorder Aspartylglucosaminuria."}},{"id":"cggv:7221f135-0e77-4156-84a3-c5ce85c6370a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:323ffeb9-b3cd-4c6e-a080-e1be91e472b2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29247835"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1-Banning"},{"id":"cggv:a8decd5e-4988-40d4-bb95-d87919d7da4c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8decd5e-4988-40d4-bb95-d87919d7da4c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a8decd5e-4988-40d4-bb95-d87919d7da4c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 8776587: when expressed in COS-1 cells, altered proteolytic processing - resulted in the precursor polypeptide being cleaved being into two subunits corresponding to the 24 kDa α subunit and ‘an abnormally large β subunit, which migrated more slowly than the 17 kDa β subunit of the wild-type enzyme’"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7221f135-0e77-4156-84a3-c5ce85c6370a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7221f135-0e77-4156-84a3-c5ce85c6370a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5101,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bd81ce2b-1dca-4ffd-9eab-cbc041cdf466","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008830","gene":"hgnc:318","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between the AGA gene and aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 7, 2022. AGA encodes aspartylglucosaminidase, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins via cleaving asparagine from the N-acetylglucosamine (PMID: 1703489). Individuals with AGU show deficient aspartylglucosaminidase enzyme activity, leading to accumulation of aspartylglucosamine and other glycoasparagines in multiple tissues and in the urine (PMID: 8405810, PMID: 27906067), which results in the characteristic disease manifestations including progressive neurological impairment and skeletal and connective tissue anomalies (as reviewed in PMID: 27906067). \n\nThe disease mechanism of AGU is loss of function. AGU was first reported in 1967 by Jenner and Pollitt (Jenner, F. A., Pollitt, R. J. Large quantities of 2-acetamido-1-(beta-L-aspartamido)-1,2-dideoxyglucose in the urine of mentally retarded siblings. Biochem. J. 103: 48P-49P, 1967.) and 1968 by Pollitt et al. (PMID: 4173687) and the first reports of biallelic variants in AGA among cases with AGU in 1991 by Ikonen et al. (PMID: 1703489) and Fisher and Aronson (PMID: 1904874). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between AGA and AGU. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 1703489, PMID: 1722323, PMID: 8830180, PMID: 7627186, PMID: 29247835, PMID: 11309371). In total, ten variants from eight probands in six publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between AGA and AGU includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (aspartylglucosaminidase) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with AGU (PMID: 8405810, PMID: 27906067); the biochemical and clinical features of AGA knockout mice (PMID: 8946839); and rescue of systemic accumulation of mannose N-linked oligosaccharides via enzyme replacement therapy in AGA knockout mice (PMID: 20607610). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, AGA is definitively associated with AGU. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on September 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1f315b4a-1a3b-4deb-90fd-2b73f732a4ba"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
