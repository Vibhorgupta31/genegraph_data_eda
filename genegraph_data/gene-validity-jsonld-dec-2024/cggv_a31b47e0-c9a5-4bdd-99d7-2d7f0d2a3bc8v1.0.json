The development and maturation of the spine and its physiology involve the integration of multiple musculoskeletal tissues including bone, cartilage, and fibrocartilaginous joints, as well as innervation and control by the nervous system. One of the most common disorders of the spine in human is adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), which is characterized by the onset of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine of <10Â° around adolescence, in otherwise healthy children. The genetic basis of AIS is largely unknown. Systematic genome-wide mutagenesis screens for embryonic phenotypes in zebrafish have been instrumental in the understanding of early patterning of embryonic tissues necessary to build and pattern the embryonic spine. However, the mechanisms required for postembryonic maturation and homeostasis of the spine remain poorly understood. Here we report the results from a small-scale forward genetic screen for adult-viable recessive and dominant zebrafish mutations, leading to overt morphological abnormalities of the adult spine. Germline mutations induced with N-ethyl N-nitrosourea (ENU) were transmitted and screened for dominant phenotypes in 1229 F1 animals, and subsequently bred to homozygosity in F3 families; from these, 314 haploid genomes were screened for adult-viable recessive phenotypes affecting general body shape. We cumulatively found 40 adult-viable (3 dominant and 37 recessive) mutations each leading to a defect in the morphogenesis of the spine. The largest phenotypic group displayed larval onset axial curvatures, leading to whole-body scoliosis without vertebral dysplasia in adult fish. Pairwise complementation testing of 16 mutant lines within this phenotypic group revealed at least 9 independent mutant loci. Using massively-parallel whole genome or whole exome sequencing and meiotic mapping we defined the molecular identity of several loci for larval onset whole-body scoliosis in zebrafish. We identified a new mutation in the skolios/kinesin family member 6 (kif6) gene, causing neurodevelopmental and ependymal cilia defects in mouse and zebrafish. We also report multiple recessive alleles of the scospondin and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 9 (adamts9) genes, which all display defects in spine morphogenesis. Our results provide evidence of monogenic traits that are essential for normal spine development in zebrafish, that may help to establish new candidate risk loci for spine disorders in humans.","dc:creator":"Gray RS","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Postembryonic screen for mutations affecting spine development in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"ENU Screen-Fig8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Since this model has extra renal features, this evidence is curated but not reviewed."},{"id":"cggv:5ff7b4a2-975f-490d-b67d-fb2a6bc1bb43","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac9a9afa-cae1-443f-8f49-07e0f4630bc7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Patients with biallelic ADAMTS9 variants exhibited septal defects like the mice with adamts9 haploinsufficiency.

Analysis of Adamts9(+/LacZ) adult mice revealed anomalies in the aortic wall, valvulosinus and valve leaflets. Abnormal myocardial projections and 'spongy' myocardium consistent with non-compaction of the left ventricle were also found in Adamts9(+/LacZ) mice. During development, Adamts9 was expressed in derivatives of the Secondary Heart Field, vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall, mesenchymal cells of the valves, and non-myocardial cells of the ventricles, but expression also continued in the adult heart and ascending aorta. Thus, the adult cardiovascular anomalies found in Adamts9(+/LacZ) hearts could result from subtle developmental alterations in extracellular matrix remodeling or defects in adult homeostasis. The valvular and aortic anomalies of Adamts9(+/LacZ) hearts were associated with accumulation of versican and a decrease in cleaved versican relative to WT littermates. These data suggest a potentially important role for ADAMTS9 cleavage of versican, or other, as yet undefined substrates in development and allostasis of cardiovascular extracellular matrix. In addition, these studies identify ADAMTS9 as a potential candidate gene for congenital cardiac anomalies.

This is a recent association, first proposed in 2019 (Choi et al., 2019; PMID: 30609407) and currently does not have an official OMIM disease association. Patients in this study shared common phenotypes including proteinuria, end stage renal disease, gross morphological defects in the kidneys and extra-renal features including deafness, and short stature. In contrast, another study (PMID: 34750010) describes bi-allelic variants in *ADAMTS9* being associated with Joubert syndrome-like presentation (complete with the neurological and ocular features) without the renal manifestations.\nIn total, three unrelated individuals harboring bi-allelic variants (missense as well as loss of function) in *ADAMTS9* have been reported in the literature (consisting of the above two studies) presenting with renal and/or extra-renal symptoms. To date, four unique variants have been described associated with disease and were scored in the curation. However, these variants were not all assigned the default points owing to verified consanguinity, population frequency of the variants in databases such as gnomAD, or in silico predictions indicating the variantâs impact on the protein to be likely benign. Taken together, *ADAMTS9* currently has limited genetic case-level data to establish a clear gene-disease relationship.\nFunctional studies performed with transgenic animal models (reviewed but not scored in the curation) have investigated the role of *Adamts9* in development, particularly in the context of the cardiac, cartilage, bone development. However, there are currently no studies that have explored the role of this gene in the renal system. The first study linking *ADAMTS9* to disease (PMID: 30609407) performed functional studies using patient-derived fibroblasts. These studies demonstrated that patient fibroblasts have reduced primary cilia, suggesting a role for ADAMTS9 in cilia formation. Further lines of evidence in mouse epithelial cells indicate a dysfunction in signaling pathways, such as Shh signaling, and impaired spheroid formation. However, these phenotypes have not been directly implicated in the human disease and such findings have also not been demonstrated in a relevant cell line of human origin, although it should be noted that overexpression of human ADAMTS9 was demonstrated to rescue spheroid formation, strongly suggesting a direct involvement of the protein in this process. In addition, a study (PMID: 30814516) has explored the role of Adamts9 in ciliary trafficking using mice models, but the genetic background of this model is not consistent with the human disease context. Therefore, in keeping with the gene curation SOP guidelines, this evidence has been either only reviewed or scored with reduced points. Default points were given to the morpholino-mediated knockdown of *Adamts9* in zebrafish that caused curved body axis, hydrocephalus, and pronephric cysts (PMID: 30609407).\nIn summary, due to the limited genetic evidence as well as the absence of renal-specific experimental evidence, the causal relationship between the bi-allelic variants in *ADAMTS9* and its associated disease ciliopathy cannot be unequivocally determined at this time. Therefore, this gene-disease relationship, based on our scoring of currently available information has been determined as limited. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 05/11/22 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a31b47e0-c9a5-4bdd-99d7-2d7f0d2a3bc8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
