We investigated five families affected with these skin neoplasms and identified four premature stop codons and the novel missense mutation D681G in a family in which 11 of 12 investigated tumors were trichoepitheliomas. CYLD protein harboring this missense mutation had a significant reduced ability to inhibit TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2- and TRAF6-mediated NF-kappaB activation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced JNK signaling, and to deubiquitinate TRAF2.

The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis.","dc:creator":"Brummelkamp TR","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Loss of the cylindromatosis tumour suppressor inhibits apoptosis by activating NF-kappaB."},"rdfs:label":"Loss of CYLD inhibits apoptosis by activating NF-kappaB."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:434ddb72-ee88-47af-9fa2-8dee9fa0a388_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f4cdd590-b320-4fcc-8ee6-e11537f5d3c8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a39c1c4-e90f-4ee5-b0db-055cd75b8940","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"TPA or UV-B treatment significantly stimulated the proliferation of Cyld-\u0001/-\u0001, but not Cyld+/+, keratinocytes after 48 hr (Figure 3C) and induced a strong and progressive increase of cyclin D1 expression in Cyld\u0001-/-\u0001 keratinocytes, while cyclin D1 levels in Cyld+/+ keratinocytes decreased 12 hr after TPA treatment (Figure 3D).

The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinase that removes lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains from TRAF2 and inhibits p65/p50 NF-kappaB activation. Here we show that mice lacking Cyld are highly susceptible to chemically induced skin tumors. Cyld-/- tumors and keratinocytes treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) or UV light are hyperproliferative and have elevated cyclin D1 levels. The cyclin D1 elevation is caused not by increased p65/p50 action but rather by increased nuclear activity of Bcl-3-associated NF-kappaB p50 and p52. In Cyld+/+ keratinocytes, TPA or UV light triggers the translocation of Cyld from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region, where Cyld binds and deubiquitinates Bcl-3, thereby preventing nuclear accumulation of Bcl-3 and p50/Bcl-3- or p52/Bcl-3-dependent proliferation. These data indicate that, depending on the external signals, Cyld can negatively regulate different NF-kappaB pathways; inactivation of TRAF2 controls survival and inflammation, while inhibition of Bcl-3 controls proliferation and tumor growth.","dc:creator":"Massoumi R","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Cyld inhibits tumor cell proliferation by blocking Bcl-3-dependent NF-kappaB signaling."},"rdfs:label":"Cyld negatively regulate cell proliferation in keratinocytes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Increase points because at least three independent assays were performed."},{"id":"cggv:0c152063-08e4-4340-b27f-c918cf8a05c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6805be75-5707-4f88-9b74-91773d469504","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"All cylindroma tumors showed accumulation of nuclear b-catenin, a hallmark of hyperactive Wnt signaling (Figures 3A and 3B and Table S1).

Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD, the familial cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene, as a negative regulator of proximal events in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Depletion of CYLD from cultured cells markedly enhances Wnt-induced accumulation of beta-catenin and target gene activation. Moreover, we demonstrate hyperactive Wnt signaling in human cylindroma skin tumors that arise from mutations in CYLD. At the molecular level, CYLD interacts with and regulates K63-linked ubiquitination of Dvl. Enhanced ubiquitination of the polymerization-prone DIX domain in CYLD-deficient cells positively links to the signaling activity of Dvl. Together, our results argue that loss of CYLD instigates tumor growth in human cylindromatosis through a mechanism in which hyperubiquitination of polymerized Dvl drives enhancement of Wnt responses.","dc:creator":"Tauriello DV","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Loss of the tumor suppressor CYLD enhances Wnt/beta-catenin signaling through K63-linked ubiquitination of Dvl."},"rdfs:label":"Human Cylindroma Tumors Display Hyperactive Wnt Signaling"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:434ddb72-ee88-47af-9fa2-8dee9fa0a388_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94b3903e-d835-4952-a7e4-2fbc62797005","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58f52571-7c1f-43e3-a9e6-17f29a4a9aa1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"They induced skin tumors by treating Cyld\u0001-/-\u0001 mice and littermate controls with a single initiation dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) followed by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) twice per week.
