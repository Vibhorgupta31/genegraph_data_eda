report on 2 patients with compound heterozygous mutations in forkhead box N1 (FOXN1), a transcription factor essential for thymic epithelial cell (TEC) differentiation. TECs are critical for T cell development. Both patients had a presentation consistent with T-/loB+NK+ SCID, with normal hair and nails, distinct from the classic nude/SCID phenotype in individuals with autosomal-recessive FOXN1 mutations. To understand the basis of this phenotype and the effects of the mutations on FOXN1, we generated mice using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to genocopy mutations in 1 of the patients. The mice with the Foxn1 compound heterozygous mutations had thymic hypoplasia, causing a T-B+NK+ SCID phenotype, whereas the hair and nails of these mice were normal. Characterization of the functional changes due to the Foxn1 mutations revealed a 5-amino acid segment at the end of the DNA-binding domain essential for the development of TECs but not keratinocytes. The transcriptional activity of this Foxn1 mutant was partly retained, indicating a region that specifies TEC functions. Analysis of an additional 9 FOXN1 mutations identified in multiple unrelated patients revealed distinct functional consequences contingent on the impact of the mutation on the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of FOXN1.","dc:creator":"Du Q","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"FOXN1 compound heterozygous mutations cause selective thymic hypoplasia in humans."}},{"id":"cggv:e39971cd-2a66-4c28-abe4-a4123418919e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4c5e940e-4a41-41ef-b6d8-9df43416582f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31566583"}],"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Du P1"},{"id":"cggv:e39971cd-2a66-4c28-abe4-a4123418919e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e39971cd-2a66-4c28-abe4-a4123418919e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e39971cd-2a66-4c28-abe4-a4123418919e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When the variant is introduced into mice, they showed a runted, nude phenotype."}],"strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:c6b2873a-a82b-4a54-b398-86861a4e859a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6b2873a-a82b-4a54-b398-86861a4e859a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c6b2873a-a82b-4a54-b398-86861a4e859a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When the variant was introduced into mice, they had thymic aplasia."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9f4a0e02-2022-4888-9935-ccd050f8c794_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f4a0e02-2022-4888-9935-ccd050f8c794","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:fbd8211c-7088-4ca5-99c9-d940c5566332","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001369369.1(FOXN1):c.1392_1401del (p.Pro465fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915949641"}},"detectionMethod":"All the patients underwent genetic evaluation by linkage analysis, Sanger sequencing, or NGS.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002090","obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0012191","obo:HP_0002719","obo:HP_0002014","obo:HP_0001508"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:aa88f96a-a815-426b-9edc-003294126922_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fbd8211c-7088-4ca5-99c9-d940c5566332"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33464451","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Human nude SCID is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of immunity (IEI) characterized by congenital athymia, alopecia, and nail dystrophy. Few cases have been reported to date. However, the recent introduction of newborn screening for IEIs and high-throughput sequencing has led to the identification of novel and atypical cases. Moreover, immunological alterations have been recently described in patients carrying heterozygous mutations. The aim of this paper is to describe the extended phenotype associated with FOXN1 homozygous, compound heterozygous, or heterozygous mutations. We collected clinical and laboratory information of a cohort of 11 homozygous, 2 compound heterozygous, and 5 heterozygous patients with recurrent severe infections. All, except one heterozygous patient, had signs of CID or SCID. Nail dystrophy and alopecia, that represent the hallmarks of the syndrome, were not always present, while almost 50% of the patients developed Omenn syndrome. One patient with hypomorphic compound heterozygous mutations had a late-onset atypical phenotype. A SCID-like phenotype was observed in 4 heterozygous patients coming from the same family. A spectrum of clinical manifestations may be associated with different mutations. The severity of the clinical phenotype likely depends on the amount of residual activity of the gene product, as previously observed for other SCID-related genes. The severity of the manifestations in this heterozygous family may suggest a mechanism of negative dominance of the specific mutation or the presence of additional mutations in noncoding regions.","dc:creator":"Giardino G","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Expanding the Nude SCID/CID Phenotype Associated with FOXN1 Homozygous, Compound Heterozygous, or Heterozygous Mutations."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"P14"},{"id":"cggv:aa88f96a-a815-426b-9edc-003294126922","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa88f96a-a815-426b-9edc-003294126922_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Note this variant is NMD-"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c7680be2-d14a-452b-b26d-1be52832a148_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7680be2-d14a-452b-b26d-1be52832a148","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:47c12406-6985-49ac-bc68-3a5867ec802b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001369369.1(FOXN1):c.1579_1580del (p.Thr527Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2497028946"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0033185","obo:HP_0010515","obo:HP_0012191","obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0008404","obo:HP_0009098","obo:HP_0001873","obo:HP_0002716"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:44e41482-954d-484e-9747-fbed3bb77c3e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:47c12406-6985-49ac-bc68-3a5867ec802b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31151968","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is an extremely rare disease caused by a disruption in the forkhead box N1 (","dc:creator":"Albar R","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Epstein-Barr virus associated with high-grade B-cell lymphoma in nude severe combined immunodeficiency."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Albar proband"},{"id":"cggv:44e41482-954d-484e-9747-fbed3bb77c3e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:44e41482-954d-484e-9747-fbed3bb77c3e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"NMD+"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:617892da-0f18-4f00-bf6c-5f36102ae364_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:617892da-0f18-4f00-bf6c-5f36102ae364","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:d6b87727-dd39-4599-ba15-45cd9055584a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001369369.1(FOXN1):c.1465del (p.Gln489fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA645592050"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"T-/loB+NK+ leaky SCID","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0005403","obo:HP_0005435"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:1fae59dd-e90a-4b23-be61-d9dcd6712561_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d6b87727-dd39-4599-ba15-45cd9055584a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31566583"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Du P2"},{"id":"cggv:1fae59dd-e90a-4b23-be61-d9dcd6712561","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1fae59dd-e90a-4b23-be61-d9dcd6712561_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1fae59dd-e90a-4b23-be61-d9dcd6712561_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Variant shows protein function 18% of WT by luciferase assay.

We found no definitive difference in the molecular mechanisms of these two, and there is significant overlap in their phenotypes suggestive of a disease spectrum. Therefore, per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these have been lumped into one disease entity, semidominant T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy.\n\nFOXN1 was first reported in relation to T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy in 1999 (Frank et al., PMID: 10206641). In this report two siblings from a small village in southern Italy were identified as homozygous for the variant c.763C>T (p.R255*). In 2004, population screening of this Italian village identified 55 heterozygous carriers of p.R255* representing 6.5% of the individuals tested. Genealogical study of these individuals identified a common ancestor, and haplotype analysis supported this to be an ancestral founder variant (Adriani et al., PMID: 15180707). Additional study of some of these heterozygous adults in 2019 found several with a mild phenotype including nail dystrophy and CD8+ T cell lymphopenia (Bosticardo et al., PMID: 31447097).\n\nEleven variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in 9 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 10206641, 25173801, 30903456, 31566583, 20978268, 33464451, 31447097, 31151968) are included in this curation. These probands include those with biallelic pathogenic variants as well as those with monoallelic pathogenic variants. Probands with biallelic pathogenic variants have T-B+NK+ severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Some, but not all, have associated congenital alopecia and/or nail dystrophy (PMID: 10206641, 25173801, 30903456, 20978268, 31151968). The phenotype of those with monoallelic pathogenic variants is typically milder but spans a broad range from some who are apparently unaffected to others with only subtle features such as nail dystrophy to others with SCID (PMID: 31447097, 33464451, 31566583). It has been suggested that the heterozygotes’ CD4+ T cell lymphopenia normalizes in adulthood (PMID: 31447097). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, functional assays, animal models, and rescue assays (PMIDs: 10206641, 8629026, 21507891, 7969402). FOXN1 encodes a protein that acts as a transcription factor and is expressed in both the thymus and skin (PMID: 10206641, 8629026). In human cells with biallelic pathogenic variants, there is a total blockage of CD4+ T cell maturation (PMID: 21507891). In mice, biallelic disruption of FOXN1 results in a “nude” phenotype characterized by hairlessness as well as athymia and immunodeficiency (PMID: 7969402, 8629026). Insertion of a wild-type FOXN1 transgene has been demonstrated to rescue this phenotype, restoring both thymus function and hair growth (PMID: 12016512). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. There was no experimental evidence supporting a dominant negative molecular mechanism at the time of curation.\n\nIn summary, FOXN1 is definitively associated with semidominant T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date October 21, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4518c986-fb1d-4f9a-a24a-ab38891a0162"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
