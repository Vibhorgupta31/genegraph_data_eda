This has been amply documented for early-onset cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability, one of the most complex disorders known and a very important health care problem worldwide. More than 90 different gene defects have been identified for X-chromosome-linked intellectual disability alone, but research into the more frequent autosomal forms of intellectual disability is still in its infancy. To expedite the molecular elucidation of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability, we have now performed homozygosity mapping, exon enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families with autosomal-recessive intellectual disability from Iran and elsewhere. This study, the largest published so far, has revealed additional mutations in 23 genes previously implicated in intellectual disability or related neurological disorders, as well as single, probably disease-causing variants in 50 novel candidate genes. Proteins encoded by several of these genes interact directly with products of known intellectual disability genes, and many are involved in fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and translation, cell-cycle control, energy metabolism and fatty-acid synthesis, which seem to be pivotal for normal brain development and function.","dc:creator":"Najmabadi H","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Deep sequencing reveals 50 novel genes for recessive cognitive disorders."}},"rdfs:label":"8303971-1"},{"id":"cggv:67984e06-734e-4b46-b78e-d7d3e4726504","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67984e06-734e-4b46-b78e-d7d3e4726504_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Homozygous missense variant in a consanguineous family with 4 affected children with moderate ID and dysmorphic features.

Utility of CES in consanguineous populations has not yet been determined on a large scale. A clinical cohort of 149 probands from Qatar with suspected Mendelian, mainly neurocognitive phenotypes, underwent CES from July 2012 to June 2014. Intellectual disability and global developmental delay were the most common clinical presentations but our cohort displayed other phenotypes, such as epilepsy, dysmorphism, microcephaly and other structural brain anomalies and autism. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation, including pathogenic CNVs, was identified in 89 probands for a diagnostic yield of 60%. Consanguinity and positive family history predicted a higher diagnostic yield. In 5% (7/149) of cases, CES implicated novel candidate disease genes (MANF, GJA9, GLG1, COL15A1, SLC35F5, MAGE4, NEUROG1). CES uncovered two coexisting genetic disorders in 4% (6/149) and actionable incidental findings in 2% (3/149) of cases. Average time to diagnosis was reduced from 27 to 5 months. CES, which already has the highest diagnostic yield among all available diagnostic tools in the setting of Mendelian disorders, appears to be particularly helpful diagnostically in the highly consanguineous Middle Eastern population.","dc:creator":"Yavarna T","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"High diagnostic yield of clinical exome sequencing in Middle Eastern patients with Mendelian disorders."}},"rdfs:label":"1,301,181-1"},{"id":"cggv:7ea060f5-ec99-431f-b7c1-e3836e6013b0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ea060f5-ec99-431f-b7c1-e3836e6013b0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Homozygous splice region variant in an individual from Qatar, no information about how many affected individuals were in the family.
