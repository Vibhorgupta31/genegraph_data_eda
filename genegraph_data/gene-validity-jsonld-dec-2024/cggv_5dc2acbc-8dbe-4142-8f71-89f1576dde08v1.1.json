In addition, the T75M mutation caused alteration of gating kinetics of the mutated KCNJ2 channels, i.e., increased sensitivity to intracellular Mg2+ and resultant enhancement of inward rectification.

The screening was performed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and DNA sequencing. Two novel mutations of the KCNJ2 gene were detected: a missense threonine to alanine mutation (T75A) in the N-terminal region (family 1) and an in-frame deletion of two amino acids (DeltaFQ163-164) in the M2 transmembrane region (family 2).

encodes the alpha subunit of Ik1, the inward rectifier cardiac potassium channel. Pathogenic variants in KCNJ2 are the cause of Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS), a multisystem disorder whose manifestations include dysmorphic features and periodic paralysis. Although patients with ATS are at risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias, these are not typically torsades de pointes, the hallmark of LQTS. Furthermore, ECGs of patients with ATS demonstrate QT-U prolongation and not QT prolongation. Accordingly, the Expert Panel classified the level of evidence for this association as limited. \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams.
