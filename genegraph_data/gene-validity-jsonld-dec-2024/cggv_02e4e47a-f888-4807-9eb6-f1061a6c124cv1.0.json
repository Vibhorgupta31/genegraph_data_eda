In 2005, homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous family identified KIAA1279 as the disease-causing gene. KIAA1279 encodes KIF-binding protein (KBP), whose function is incompletely understood. Studies have identified either the mitochondria or the cytoskeleton as the site of KBP localization and interactions. To better delineate the KIAA1279-related clinical spectrum and the molecular mechanisms involved in GOSHS, we studied five new patients from three different families. The homozygous KIAA1279 mutations in these patients (p.Arg90X, p.Ser200X or p.Arg202IlefsX2) led to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of KBP function. Despite the absence of functional KBP, respiratory chain complex activity in patient fibroblasts was normal. KBP did not co-localize with mitochondria in control human fibroblasts, but interacted with the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton. KBP expression directly affected neurite growth in a neuron-like cell line (human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y), in keeping with the central (polymicrogyria) and enteric (HSCR) neuronal developmental defects seen in GOSHS patients. The KBP interactions with actin filaments and microtubules (MTs) demonstrated in our study constitute the first evidence that an actin MT cross-link protein is involved in neuronal development in humans.","dc:creator":"DrÃ©villon L","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"KBP-cytoskeleton interactions underlie developmental anomalies in Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"KBP is involved in neurite outgrowth"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"downgraded due to indirect phenotype match between cell culture and clinical presentation."},{"id":"cggv:aa5ea381-ef34-4e10-b678-80c91b9ca6bf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5812b977-d70e-45da-b87d-a5c6fcba9d4c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Disruption of white matter tracts is a consistent feature of Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome in humans, zebrafish kbpst23 mutation provides a model of these defects in myelinated axons.

In vivo time-lapse analysis of neuronal development shows that the speed of early axonal outgrowth is reduced in both the peripheral and central nervous systems in kbp mutants. Ultrastructural studies reveal that kbp mutants have disruption to axonal microtubules during outgrowth. These results together suggest that kbp is an important regulator of the microtubule dynamics that drive the forward propulsion of axons. At later stages, we observe that many affected axons degenerate. Ultrastructural analyses at these stages demonstrate mislocalization of axonal mitochondria and a reduction in axonal number in the peripheral, central and enteric nervous systems.

Here, we document nine new patients with variants in KIFBP: seven with nonsense variants and two with missense variants. To our knowledge, this is the first time that missense variants have been reported in GOSHS. We functionally investigated the effect of the variants identified, in an attempt to find a genotype-phenotype correlation. We also determined whether common Hirschsprung disease (HSCR)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), could explain the presence of HSCR in GOSHS. Our results showed that the missense variants led to reduced expression of KIFBP, while the truncating variants resulted in lack of protein. However, no correlation was found between the severity of GOSHS and the location of the variants. We were also unable to find a correlation between common HSCR-associated SNPs, and HSCR development in GOSHS.

GOSHS is characterized by intellectual disability and microcephaly, frequently seen with Hirschsprung disease and/or gyral abnormalities of the brain. Nine homozygous loss of function variants (nonsense, frameshift, intragenic deletion) that have been reported in ten probands in six publications (PMIDs: 15883926, 23427148, 24072599, 28277559, 32939943, 34421502) are included in this curation. All of these ten probands were homozygous variant carriers, eight of which were from families known to be  consanguineous, many of which had more than one affected homozygote. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. While missense variants have been reported in cases with atypical presentations (PMID: 32939943), there is insufficient evidence to support a pathogenic role for missense variants in this disease at this time. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a zebrafish kbp mutant model organism that displays disruption in axonal structure (PMID: 23427148) and a human cell culture model that shows abnormal neurite outgrowth (PMID: 18192286), mirroring the central and enteric neuronal developmental defects seen in GOSHS. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between KIFBP and autosomal recessive GOSHS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations GCEP on the meeting date July 25, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
