More than 13 genes are implicated in its pathogenesis to date, accounting for only 40 % of all cases. High-throughput mutation screenings of large patient cohorts represent a powerful tool for diagnostics and identification of novel NPHP genes. We here performed a new high-throughput mutation analysis method to study 13 established NPHP genes (NPHP1-NPHP13) in a worldwide cohort of 1,056 patients diagnosed with NPHP-RC. We first applied multiplexed PCR-based amplification using Fluidigm Access-Array™ technology followed by barcoding and next-generation resequencing on an Illumina platform. As a result, we established the molecular diagnosis in 127/1,056 independent individuals (12.0 %) and identified a single heterozygous truncating mutation in an additional 31 individuals (2.9 %). Altogether, we detected 159 different mutations in 11 out of 13 different NPHP genes, 99 of which were novel. Phenotypically most remarkable were two patients with truncating mutations in INVS/NPHP2 who did not present as infants and did not exhibit extrarenal manifestations. In addition, we present the first case of Caroli disease due to mutations in WDR19/NPHP13 and the second case ever with a recessive mutation in GLIS2/NPHP7.

The zinc-finger protein GLIS2/NPHP7 represents an exception as it has been implicated in transcriptional regulation; only two families with GLIS2/NPHP7 mutations and typical NPH manifestations have been identified so far.

To date, mutations in >25 genes have been identified as causes of this disease that, in several cases, result in chronic DNA damage in kidney tubular cells. Among such mutations, those in the transcription factor-encoding GLIS2 cause NPHP type 7. Loss of function of mouse Glis2 causes senescence of kidney tubular cells. Senescent cells secrete proinflammatory molecules that induce progressive organ damage through several pathways, among which NF-κB signaling is prevalent. Herein, we show that the NF-κB signaling is active in Glis2 knockout kidney epithelial cells and that genetic inactivation of the toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1 receptor or pharmacologic elimination of senescent cells (senolytic therapy) reduces tubule damage, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the Glis2 mouse model of NPHP. Notably, in Glis2, Tlr2 double knockouts, senescence was also reduced and proliferation was increased, suggesting that loss of TLR2 activity improves the regenerative potential of tubular cells in Glis2 knockout kidneys. Our results further suggest that a combination of TLR/IL-1 receptor inhibition and senolytic therapy may delay the progression of kidney disease in NPHP type 7 and other forms of this disease.","dc:creator":"Jin H","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Innate Immune Signaling Contributes to Tubular Cell Senescence in the Glis2 Knockout Mouse Model of Nephronophthisis."},"rdfs:label":"Inactivation of Myd88 protects Glis2 knockout kidneys "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1fde370e-0f1e-46bf-a8c5-77ab7aa00007","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fbdb49c4-b6cb-40a3-97bf-10b512f1d99a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Increased apoptosis and a-smooth muscle actin expression in Glis2lacZ/lacZ mutant kidneys.

Affected children may have growth restriction. Their kidneys are small or normal-sized and hyperechoic with corticomedullary cysts and tubular basement membrane abnormalities. \n\n*GLIS2* was first reported in association with  nephronophthisis in 2007 (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285). At least 3 unique variants, c.775+1G>T ; p.Cys175Arg, and (NM_032,575.3: c.560_574del, p.H188_Y192del) have been reported in humans (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285; Halbritter et al., 2013 PMID 23559409; Al Alawi et al. 2021 PMID 34917135). The disease mechanism is reported to be a loss of function. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found there is only one molecular mechanism underlying nephronophthisis 7 (MIM: 611498). Evidence supporting this *GLIS2*-nephronophthisis 7 relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nGenetic evidence on case-level data contributes 4.2 points. Variants in *GLIS2* have been reported in at least 3 probands in 3 publications (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285; Halbritter et al., 2013 PMID 23559409; Al Alawi et al. 2021 PMID 34917135). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members in one of these publications (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285). This gene-disease relationship has not been studied in any case-control studies at the single or aggregate variant level. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence. Zhang et al. cloned *Glis2* from mouse kidney RNA (Zhang et al., 2002 PMID 11741991), and the deduced 521-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kD. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected highest expression in the kidney. Immunohistochemical staining in a mouse model has revealed GLIS2 expression throughout all renal tubule segments and epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule (Attanasio M et al.,  2007 PMID 17618285; Halbritter et al., 2013 PMID 23559409). Zhang et al. concluded that *Glis2* behaves as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator (Zhang et al., 2002 PMID 11741991). In a zebrafish model, knockdown of the zebrafish isoform *nphp7.2* resulted in cyst formation, which was rescued by zebrafish *nphp7.2* mRNA. However, forced nuclear import did not rescue the transcriptional defects of *GLIS2* p.Cys175Arg, indicating additional defects of the DNA-binding protein (Ramachandran H et al. 2016, PMID 26374130). Thus, the score for experimental evidence for a gene-disease association was 5.5 points. \n\nIn summary, there is Moderate evidence to support this *GLIS2*-nephronophthisis relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 05/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c51be76f-59d3-4884-9df3-4416686848ab"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
