Treacher-Collins syndrome 4 is disorder of craniofacial development characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms including downslanting palpebral fissures, malar and mandibular hypoplasia, and microtia. Most patients have conductive deafness with atretic external ear canals. Choanal atresia and cleft palate have also been observed. At least three missense variants have been reported in six probands in two publications. Though the points scored lead to a limited classification, the expert panel believes there is sufficient evidence to classify missense variants at the position p.Arg1003 as moderate. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes expression data and animal models (PMID: 31649276). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/16/2023.
