Substrate specificity and a detailed kinetic analysis (Na, Pi, H+ concentrations) suggested that expressed uptake activities relate to proximal tubular brush border membrane Na/Pi cotransport. NaPi-2 cDNA contains 2464 bp encoding a protein of 637 aa; NaPi-3 cDNA contains 2573 bp encoding a protein of 639 aa. NaPi-2- and NaPi-3-deduced protein sequences show high homology to each other but are different from the protein sequence deduced from the previously cloned NaPi-1 cDNA (from rabbit proximal tubules). Hydropathy profile predictions suggest at least eight membrane-spanning regions in NaPi-2/3-related proteins. In vitro translation results in proteins of the expected size and suggests glycosylation. Northern blot analysis shows corresponding mRNA species (approximately 2.7 kb) in kidney cortex of various species but no hybridization with RNAs isolated from a variety of other tissues (including intestinal segments); a hybridization signal (approximately 4.8 kb) was observed only in the lung (human).

Recently, mutations in the vitamin D catabolizing enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) were described that lead to increased sensitivity to vitamin D due to accumulation of the active metabolite 1,25-(OH)2D3. In a subgroup of patients who presented in early infancy with renal phosphate wasting and symptomatic hypercalcemia, mutations in CYP24A1 were excluded. Four patients from families with parental consanguinity were subjected to homozygosity mapping that identified a second IIH gene locus on chromosome 5q35 with a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 6.79. The sequence analysis of the most promising candidate gene, SLC34A1 encoding renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), revealed autosomal-recessive mutations in the four index cases and in 12 patients with sporadic IIH. Functional studies of mutant NaPi-IIa in Xenopus oocytes and opossum kidney (OK) cells demonstrated disturbed trafficking to the plasma membrane and loss of phosphate transport activity. Analysis of calcium and phosphate metabolism in Slc34a1-knockout mice highlighted the effect of phosphate depletion and fibroblast growth factor-23 suppression on the development of the IIH phenotype. The human and mice data together demonstrate that primary renal phosphate wasting caused by defective NaPi-IIa function induces inappropriate production of 1,25-(OH)2D3 with subsequent symptomatic hypercalcemia. Clinical and laboratory findings persist despite cessation of vitamin D prophylaxis but rapidly respond to phosphate supplementation. Therefore, early differentiation between SLC34A1 (NaPi-IIa) and CYP24A1 (24-hydroxylase) defects appears critical for targeted therapy in patients with IIH.","dc:creator":"Schlingmann KP","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Autosomal-Recessive Mutations in SLC34A1 Encoding Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter 2A Cause Idiopathic Infantile Hypercalcemia."},"rdfs:label":"Variant NaPi-IIa cRNA did not produce Pi uptakes pt. 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 is scored for both variants."},{"id":"cggv:9c5f6e5a-d24f-43bc-8dc8-3fb63649a44f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42bb940f-a0cb-4e26-a915-758ab092ca18","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Overexpression of WT NaPi-IIa induced a significant Pi uptake while injection of variant (G153A and G153V) NaPi-IIa cRNA did not produce Pi uptakes significantly different from non-injected controls, compatible with a loss of function and/or defective trafficking to the membrane of identified mutations.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26047794","rdfs:label":"Variant NaPi-IIa cRNA did not produce Pi uptakes pt. 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 is scored for both variants."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1b164a17-9f7b-43b2-88b2-2adb8e458c08_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8187854c-b8b9-4e33-948a-cff59921b35c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f05d5406-b6d0-4584-9ff6-699df1e1f5b8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"SLC34A1 KO mice fed lowP diets led to severe hypophosphatemia in KO but not WT.

Homozygous mutants (Npt2(-/-)) exhibit increased urinary Pi excretion, hypophosphatemia, an appropriate elevation in the serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D with attendant hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and decreased serum parathyroid hormone levels, and increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity. These biochemical features are typical of patients with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), a Mendelian disorder of renal Pi reabsorption. However, unlike HHRH patients, Npt2(-/-) mice do not have rickets or osteomalacia. At weaning, Npt2(-/-) mice have poorly developed trabecular bone and retarded secondary ossification, but, with increasing age, there is a dramatic reversal and eventual overcompensation of the skeletal phenotype.

Recently, mutations in sodium-phosphate cotransporter (SLC34A1) expressed in the kidney were discovered as an additional cause of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. This report describes a female infant admitted for evaluation of nephrocalcinosis. She presented with hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, low intact parathyroid hormone level, and high 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 level. Exome sequencing identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in SLC34A1 (c.1337G&gt;A, c.1483C&gt;T). The patient was treated with fluids for hydration, furosemide, a corticosteroid, and restriction of calcium/vitamin D intake. At the age of 7 months, the patient&apos;s calcium level was within the normal range, and hypercalciuria waxed and waned. Renal echogenicity improved on the follow-up ultrasonogram, and developmental delay was not noted. In cases of hypercalcemia with subsequent hypercalciuria, DNA analysis for SLC34A1 gene mutations and CYP24A1 gene mutations should be performed. Further studies are required to obtain long-term data on hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.","dc:creator":"Kang SJ","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Infantile hypercalcemia with novel compound

*SLC34A1* gene is located on chromosome 5 at q35.3 and encodes the Solute Carrier Family 34 Member 1. \n\nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Hypercalcemia, infantile, 2 (OMIM: 616963) and Nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis, hypophosphatemic, 1 (OMIM:612286), and split from Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 (OMIM:613388). The preferred disease name suggested for this lumped autosomal recessive disorder is ‘Infantile hypercalcemia - *SLC34A1*’. Heterozygous carriers of pathogenic variants are at an increased risk of developing nephrolithiasis, as associated with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1. Autosomal recessive Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 has been curated separately. \n\n*SLC34A1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive infantile hypercalcemia in 2014 (Rajagopal et al., PMID: 25050900). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. Infantile hypercalcemia is characterized by severe hypercalcemia, with failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, and nephrocalcinosis.\n\nAt least 15 variants (missense, deletions, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) have been reported in 10 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 25050900, 26047794, 30943683 included in this curation). Of note, the c.272_292del (p.Val91_Ala97del) variant included in this curation is a noted polymorphism that can be causative of disease when inherited in trans with another pathogenic variant. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by mouse models phenocopying disease in human patients, expression studies at the brush border of proximal tubule cells in humans, biochemical function critical to actively transporting phosphate into cells via Na+ cotransport, and functional alteration demonstrating multiple variants are unable to produce Pi uptakes comparable to the wild type (PMIDs: 8327470, 9560283, 20335586, 26047794). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between SLC34A1 and autosomal recessive infantile hypercalcemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
