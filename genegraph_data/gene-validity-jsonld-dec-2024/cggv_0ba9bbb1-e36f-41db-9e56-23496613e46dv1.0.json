The disease comprises pure and complex forms that clinically include slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity resulting from degeneration of the corticospinal tract. At least 48 loci accounting for these diseases have been mapped to date, and mutations have been identified in 22 genes, most of which play a role in intracellular trafficking. Here, we identified mutations in two functionally related genes (DDHD1 and CYP2U1) in individuals with autosomal-recessive forms of HSP by using either the classical positional cloning or a combination of whole-genome linkage mapping and next-generation sequencing. Interestingly, three subjects with CYP2U1 mutations presented with a thin corpus callosum, white-matter abnormalities, and/or calcification of the basal ganglia. These genes code for two enzymes involved in fatty-acid metabolism, and we have demonstrated in human cells that the HSP pathophysiology includes alteration of mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics with increased oxidative stress. Our combined results focus attention on lipid metabolism as a critical HSP pathway with a deleterious impact on mitochondrial bioenergetic function.","dc:creator":"Tesson C","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Alteration of fatty-acid-metabolizing enzymes affects mitochondrial form and function in hereditary spastic paraplegia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ba9bbb1-e36f-41db-9e56-23496613e46d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ba9bbb1-e36f-41db-9e56-23496613e46d_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:4d8e5e49-f3bf-4a9a-b072-0bf87b4b82d5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d8e5e49-f3bf-4a9a-b072-0bf87b4b82d5","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:58f49003-fa7f-4278-9faa-10cce78a5008","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001160148.2(DDHD1):c.*2218C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA706791935"}},"detectionMethod":"Targeted next generation sequencing was carried out with 149 genes known to be involved in HSP on 418 HSP patients from 140 families and 200 unrelated control individuals.

The variant causes a frameshift, resulting in a functionally null allele in the patient. DDHD1 encodes phospholipase A1 (PLA1) catalyzing phosphatidylinositol to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). To clarify the pathogenic mechanism of SPG28, we established Ddhd1 knockout mice (Ddhd1[-/-]) carrying a 5-bp deletion in Ddhd1, resulting in a premature termination of translation at a position similar to that of the patient. We observed a significant decrease in foot-base angle (FBA) in aged Ddhd1(-/-) (24 months of age) and a significant decrease in LPI 20:4 (sn-2) in Ddhd1(-/-) cerebra (26 months of age). These changes in FBA were not observed in 14 months of age. We also observed significant changes of expression levels of 22 genes in the Ddhd1(-/-) cerebra (26 months of age). Gene Ontology (GO) terms relating to the nervous system and cell-cell communications were significantly enriched. We conclude that the reduced signaling of LPI 20:4 (sn-2) by PLA1 dysfunction is responsible for the locomotive abnormality in SPG28, further suggesting that the reduction of downstream signaling such as GPR55 which is agonized by LPI is involved in the pathogenesis of SPG28.","dc:creator":"Morikawa T","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Ddhd1 knockout mouse as a model of locomotive and physiological abnormality in familial spastic paraplegia."},"rdfs:label":"Ddhd1 KO mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5409,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:fb5722a2-97f2-4a0a-ac7a-c11fac1b236b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019064","gene":"hgnc:19714","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The DDHD1 gene belongs to the intracellular phospholipase A1 gene family and is thought to be involved in mitochondrial function. DDHD1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia in 2012 (Tesson et al., PMID: 23176821). This slowly progressive disorder is associated with phenotypes of lower limb spasticity and weakness, mild upper limb involvement, gait difficulties, hyperreflexia, pyramidal signs, extensor plantar responses, and distal sensory impairment in lower limbs. Some patients also show phenotypes of axonal neuropathy, saccadic eye pursuit, scoliosis, and pes cavus. Age of onset typically ranges from infancy to childhood or adolescence. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes genetic evidence from 4 probands that reached the maximum score of 12 points. Additional evidence is available in the literature; overall, there are at least 11 loss of function variants (e.g. frameshift and nonsense) reported in 14 individuals across 9 families in 8 publications (PMIDs: 15786464, 23176821, 24989667, 27216551, 26944165, 28818478, 29980238, and 27999540). The mechanism of disease is presumed to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the Ddhd1 knockout mouse model that showed reduced foot-base angle indicative of locomotive abnormality (PMID: 33600578).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between DDHD1 and  autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 1, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0ba9bbb1-e36f-41db-9e56-23496613e46d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
