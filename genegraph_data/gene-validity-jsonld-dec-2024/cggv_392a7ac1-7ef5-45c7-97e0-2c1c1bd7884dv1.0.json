Genetic etiology of this disorder remains unknown. The present study was aimed at identifying genomic mutations in patients with dysplastic spondylolysis as well as the potential pathogenesis of the abnormalities. Whole-exome sequencing and functional analysis were performed for patients with spondylolysis. We identified a novel heterozygous mutation (c.2286A > T; p.D673V) in the sulfate transporter gene SLC26A2 in five affected subjects of a Chinese family. Two additional mutations (e.g., c.1922A > G; p.H641R and g.18654T > C in the intron 1) in the gene were identified by screening a cohort of 30 unrelated patients with the disease. In situ hybridization analysis showed that SLC26A2 is abundantly expressed in the lumbosacral spine of the mouse embryo at day 14.5. Sulfate uptake activities in CHO cells transfected with mutant SLC26A2 were dramatically reduced compared with the wild type, confirming the pathogenicity of the two missense mutations. Further analysis of the gene-disease network revealed a convergent pathogenic network for the development of lumbosacral spine. To our knowledge, our findings provide the first identification of autosomal dominant SLC26A2 mutations in patients with dysplastic spondylolysis, suggesting a new clinical entity in the pathogenesis of chondrodysplasia involving lumbosacral spine. The analysis of the gene-disease network may shed new light on the study of patients with dysplastic spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis as well as high-risk individuals who are asymptomatic.

Abundant SLC26A2 expression has previously been detected in normal human colon by in situ hybridization. We have used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to examine multiple normal tissues for the expression of human SLC26A2. As expected, a strong signal for SLC26A2 mRNA and protein immunostaining were detected in developing fetal hyaline cartilage, while bronchial cartilage showed mRNA expression in adult tissues. SLC26A2 expression could also be detected in eccrine sweat glands, in bronchial glands, and in placental villi. In addition, immunoreactivity for the SLC26A2 protein was observed in exocrine pancreas. Our results suggest a more limited expression pattern for SLC26A2 than that found by Northern analysis.

However, the functional properties of the gene product have yet to be elucidated. We cloned rat DTDST cDNA from rat UMR-106 osteoblastic cells. Northern blot analysis suggested that cartilage and intestine were the major expression sites for DTDST mRNA. Analysis of the genomic sequence revealed that the rat DTDST gene was composed of at least five exons. Two distinct transcripts were expressed in chondrocytes due to alternative utilization of the third exon, corresponding to an internal portion of the 5'-untranslated region of the cDNA. Injection of rat and human DTDST cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes induced Na+-independent sulfate transport. Transport activity of the expressed DTDST was markedly inhibited by extracellular chloride and bicarbonate. In contrast, canalicular Na+-independent sulfate transporter Sat-1 required the presence of extracellular chloride in the cRNA-injected oocytes. The activity profile of sulfate transport in growth plate chondrocytes was studied in the extracellular presence of various anions and found substantially identical to DTDST expressed in oocytes. Thus, sulfate transport of chondrocytes is dominantly dependent on the DTDST system. Finally, we demonstrate that undersulfation of proteoglycans by the chlorate treatment of chondrocytes significantly impaired growth response of the cells to fibroblast growth factor, suggesting a role for DTDST in endochondral bone formation.","dc:creator":"Satoh H","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Functional analysis of diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter.

To ascertain the consequences of the sulfate transport defect on proteoglycan synthesis, we studied the structure and sulfation of proteoglycans in cartilage tissue and in fibroblast and chondrocyte cultures from a fetus with achondrogenesis 1B. Proteoglycans extracted from epiphyseal cartilage and separated on agarose gels migrated more slowly than controls and stained poorly with alcian blue. The patient's cultured cells showed reduced incorporation of [35S]sulfate relative to [3H]glucosamine, impaired uptake of sulfate, and higher resistance to chromate toxicity compared to control cells. Epiphyseal chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads synthesized proteoglycans of normal molecular size as judged by gel filtration chromatography, but undersulfated as judged by ion exchange chromatography and by the amount of nonsulfated disaccharide. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of chondroitinase-digested proteoglycans showed that sulfated disaccharides were present, although in reduced amounts, indicating that at least in vitro, other sources of sulfate can partially compensate for sulfate deficiency. A t1475c transition causing a L483P substitution in the eleventh transmembrane domain of the sulfate/chloride antiporter was present on both alleles in the patient who was the product of a consanguineous marriage.

These data suggest that delVal340 is associated with achondrogenesis type 1B in the Japanese, whereas a serine to threonine substitution is most likely polymorphic.","dc:creator":"Cai G","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutational analysis of the DTDST gene in a fetus with achondrogenesis type 1B."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9637425","rdfs:label":"Cai et al. proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This proband was awarded the default score due to functional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of the pl.Val341del variant (Karniski et al. 2004, PMID: 15294877)."},{"id":"cggv:0b6c6082-05b5-4a55-888d-3ff7e2878300_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4470ec95-40b2-41e9-bd40-55bfe243ebdf","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0b6c6082-05b5-4a55-888d-3ff7e2878300_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:a6afec49-27e4-442c-a87c-a41a4717b98d"},{"id":"cggv:f83d8d35-6f16-46ee-9a7e-b53cd5c9935c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000112.4(SLC26A2):c.1194del (p.Ser399HisfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139532190"}}],"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8528239"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8528239","rdfs:label":"Patient 5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:200da69e-8d33-48a9-b743-c7b17d4e90c8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c863f6e-8166-4bf6-8b0a-1115342a1049","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":19,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:200da69e-8d33-48a9-b743-c7b17d4e90c8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:a6afec49-27e4-442c-a87c-a41a4717b98d"},{"id":"cggv:6a0982c5-053c-4316-a165-df7d289b31fc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000112.3(SLC26A2):c.2033G>T (p.Gly678Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA259844"}}],"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8528239"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8528239","rdfs:label":"Patient 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The p.Gly678Val variant was awarded 0.5 points due to functional evidence (Karniski et al. 2004, PMID: 15294877)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1383,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:19c1595c-514e-487e-a87f-52d56a807d3f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010966","gene":"hgnc:10994","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"SLC26A2 was first associated with autosomal recessive achondrogenesis type 1B as early as 1996 (Superti-Furga et al., PMID: 8528239). This disorder is perinatal lethal and includes clinical features such as extremely short limbs, fingers, and toes; hypoplasia of the thorax, protuberant abdomen, fetal hydrops, flat face, and a short and thick neck (GeneReviews, Bonafé et al., 2013). However, radiographic analysis and histopathology are also important in arriving at a diagnosis. At least 8 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants as well as in-frame indels) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 8528239, 9637425, 8702490). More evidence is available in the literature; however, the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause atelosteogenesis type 2, diastrophic dysplasia, and recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes (depending on level of residual sulfate transport) and have been definitively associated with SLC26A2. This gene-disease association is supported by a knock-out mouse model, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, SLC26A2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive achondrogenesis type 1B.
