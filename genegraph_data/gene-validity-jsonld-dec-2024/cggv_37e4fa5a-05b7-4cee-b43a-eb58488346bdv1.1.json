Although *KDM6B* variants were initially observed in large-scale sequencing studies in autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (ID) between 2014 and 2017 (PMIDs: 25363760, 25363768, 27479843, 28263302), the first report focusing on variants in *KDM6B* as a cause of autosomal dominant syndromic ID was published in 2019 (PMID: 31124279). Heterozygous *KDM6B* *de novo* truncating variants have been reported in at least 12 individuals (PMIDs: 25363768, 31124279). Affected individuals present with motor and speech delays, ID, and dysmorphic facial features; variable features include autism spectrum disorder and mild hand and feet anomalies (PMID: 31124279). Heterozygous *de novo KDM6B* missense and in-frame variants have also been reported, but no functional studies were performed to assess their pathogenicity (PMIDs: 25363760, 25363768, 27479843, 31124279). According to gnomAD (v2.1.1), *KDM6B* is intolerant to truncating variants (pLI = 1) but not to missense variants (Z = 1.32). Homozygous *KDM6B* variants have been reported in three consanguineous families with syndromic ID (PMIDs: 21937992, 26077850, 28097321); the disease association in these cases is not clear and will be curated separately.\n\nIn summary, *KDM6B* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant syndromic ID. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 19 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:37e4fa5a-05b7-4cee-b43a-eb58488346bd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
