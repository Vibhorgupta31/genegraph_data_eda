The full-length hMSH6 cDNA and genomic locus were isolated and characterized, and it was demonstrated that the hMSH6 gene consisted of 10 exons and mapped to chromosome 2p15-16. The hMSH3 cDNA was in some cases found to contain a 27-bp deletion resulting in a loss of nine amino acids, depending on the individual from which the cDNA was isolated. hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6 all showed similar tissue-specific expression patterns. hMSH2 protein formed a complex with both hMSH3 and hMSH6 proteins, similar to protein complexes demonstrated by studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6. hMSH2 was also found to form a homomultimer complex, but neither hMSH3 nor hMSH6 appear to interact with themselves or each other. Analysis of the mismatched nucleotide-binding specificity of the hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 protein complexes showed that they have overlapping but not identical binding specificity.

Germline mutations in several members of these families, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2, but not MSH3, are responsible for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. To examine the role of MSH3, we generated a mouse with a null mutation in this gene. Cells from Msh3-/- mice are defective in repair of insertion/ deletion mismatches but can repair base-base mismatches. Msh3-/- mice develop tumors at a late age. When the Msh3-/- and Msh6-/- mutations are combined, the tumor predisposition phenotype is indistinguishable from Msh2-/- or Mlh1-/- mice. These results suggest that MSH3 cooperates with MSH6 in tumor suppression.","dc:creator":"Edelmann W","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"The DNA mismatch repair genes Msh3 and Msh6 cooperate in intestinal tumor suppression."},"rdfs:label":"Msh3 -/- mosue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Proposing removing this from the AD curation, as it is more consistent with MSH3 biallelic AR disease."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":8911,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":0.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8b752381-9a41-41fd-8257-74d5186694bd","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005835","gene":"hgnc:7326","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"MSH3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome in 2011 (Duraturo et al., PMID:21128252). Of note, this gene has also been associated with autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis 4 (MSH3-related FAP4). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the gene-disease relationship between MSH3 Lynch syndrome and autosomal recessive FAP4 was curated separately. Although several MSH3 missense variants have been identified from probands with colorectal cancer in published literature (PMIDs 21128252, 25142776, 27300758, 29212164, 28944238), the pedigrees did not show significant segregation, many variants were considered too high population frequency to cause disease, and no functional assays supported a damaging effect on the gene or protein product. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least one case-control studies (PMID 34250384) at the aggregate variant level. This study found no association of any cancer in individuals with heterozygous MSH3 variants (OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.4-1.9]) (PMID 34250384). Therefore, no points were assigned to the genetic evidence and it provides contradictory evidence. Only experimental evidence is scored in this curation (0.5 Points). Acharya et al showed a physical interaction of MSH3 with MSH2 and MSH6, two MMR genes associated with colorectal cancer. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification has been downgraded due to lack of significant evidence in association with Lynch syndrome and new case control data (PMID 34250384). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between MSH3 and autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role MSH3 plays in this disease. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Colon Cancer GCEP on November 13, 2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on May 24, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\nOnly 0.5 score comes from experimental function. Proposing move to Disputed based on case control study and no convincing scorable evidence in any publications since 2011.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e9216399-2779-43fa-8b95-b10020753f43"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
