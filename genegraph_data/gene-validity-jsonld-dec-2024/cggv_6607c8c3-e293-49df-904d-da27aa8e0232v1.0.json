Particularly challenging are those disorders rare enough to have eluded recognition as a discrete clinical entity, those with highly variable clinical manifestations, and those that are difficult to distinguish from other, very similar, disorders. Here we demonstrate the power of using an unbiased genotype-driven approach to identify subsets of patients with similar disorders. By studying 1,133 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders, and their parents, using a combination of exome sequencing and array-based detection of chromosomal rearrangements, we discovered 12 novel genes associated with developmental disorders. These newly implicated genes increase by 10% (from 28% to 31%) the proportion of children that could be diagnosed. Clustering of missense mutations in six of these newly implicated genes suggests that normal development is being perturbed by an activating or dominant-negative mechanism. Our findings demonstrate the value of adopting a comprehensive strategy, both genome-wide and nationwide, to elucidate the underlying causes of rare genetic disorders.","dc:creator":"Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Large-scale discovery of novel genetic causes of developmental disorders."}},"rdfs:label":"262192"},{"id":"cggv:42dd1afa-90f3-41f4-a8d6-a5f7e1839219","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42dd1afa-90f3-41f4-a8d6-a5f7e1839219_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"European (non-Finnish): 11016/1179666 (0.009338)\n\n57 observed homozygotes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1f6d8b6e-6883-48cf-8552-22f8ed1d9f33_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f6d8b6e-6883-48cf-8552-22f8ed1d9f33","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:1b7c9981-15d5-4da4-8b2c-5d5eb8032ee6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018714.3(COG1):c.1070+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913190523"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":" Long filtrum, low hairline, clefting of the helix and antihelix, Shallow acetabular roofs; Surgical correction for extreme left-side hydronephrosis at 6 months of age; Delayed development with walking at 20 months and speaking since 2 years\nMRI findings at 5 years: Brain atrophy of the temporal cortex and floculonodular lobe of the cerebellum, dilatation of the lateral ventricles, fourth ventricle, and cisterna magna","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0012106","obo:HP_0000494","obo:HP_0002943","obo:HP_0003422","obo:HP_0000431","obo:HP_0012741","obo:HP_0000126","obo:HP_0012444","obo:HP_0006956","obo:HP_0002673","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000200","obo:HP_0000436","obo:HP_0002751","obo:HP_0008551","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0020045","obo:HP_0000902","obo:HP_0000047","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000946","obo:HP_0000470","obo:HP_0000410","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0006499","obo:HP_0009465","obo:HP_0006429","obo:HP_0000160","obo:HP_0000274","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0000368","obo:HP_0001215","obo:HP_0003177"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:9a8b39dc-7137-4da3-a0c8-c3d8803c06ea_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1b7c9981-15d5-4da4-8b2c-5d5eb8032ee6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19008299","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We describe two patients with a cerebrocostomandibular-like syndrome and a novel mutation in conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) subunit 1, one of the subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex.

Here, we describe a patient with a mild form of congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II) that is caused by a deficiency in the Cog1 subunit of the complex. This patient has a defect in both N- and O-glycosylation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the structures of the N-linked glycans released from glycoproteins from the patient's serum revealed a reduction in sialic acid and galactose residues. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin staining revealed a decrease in sialic acids on core 1 mucin type O-glycans, indicating a combined defect in N- and O-glycosylation. Sequence analysis of the COG1 cDNA and gene identified a homozygous insertion of a single nucleotide (2659-2660insC), which is predicted to lead to a premature translation stop and truncation of the C terminus of the Cog1 protein by 80 amino acids. This mutation destabilizes several other COG subunits and alters their subcellular localization and hence the overall integrity of the COG complex. This results in reduced levels and/or altered Golgi localization of alpha-mannosidase II and beta-1,4 galactosyltransferase I, which links it to the glycosylation deficiency. Transfection of primary fibroblasts of this patient with the full length hemagglutinin-tagged Cog1 indeed restored beta-1,4 galactosyltransferase Golgi localization. We propose naming this disorder CDG-II/Cog1, or CDG-II caused by Cog1 deficiency.","dc:creator":"Foulquier F","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Conserved oligomeric Golgi complex subunit 1 deficiency reveals a previously uncharacterized congenital disorder of glycosylation type II."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient (Foulquier F et al.)"},{"id":"cggv:8d1034b3-1c01-4f84-8389-c67b24487b5f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d1034b3-1c01-4f84-8389-c67b24487b5f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8d1034b3-1c01-4f84-8389-c67b24487b5f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Experiments using a co-translation/co-immunoprecipitation assay.

We show that these three complexes are identical and rename them the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex.

In vitro assays revealed binary interactions between Cog2p and Cog3p, Cog2p and Cog4p, and Cog6p and Cog8p and a strong interaction between Cog5p and Cog7p.

The COG complex interacts with core vesicle docking and fusion machinery at the Golgi; however, its exact mechanism of action is still an enigma. Previous studies of COG complex were limited to the use of CDGII (Congenital disorders of glycosylation type II)-COG patient fibroblasts, siRNA mediated knockdowns, or protein relocalization approaches. In this study we have used the CRISPR approach to generate HEK293T knock-out (KO) cell lines missing individual COG subunits. These cell lines were characterized for glycosylation and trafficking defects, cell proliferation rates, stability of COG subunits, localization of Golgi markers, changes in Golgi structure, and N-glycan profiling. We found that all KO cell lines were uniformly deficient in cis/medial-Golgi glycosylation and each had nearly abolished binding of Cholera toxin. In addition, all cell lines showed defects in Golgi morphology, retrograde trafficking and sorting, sialylation and fucosylation, but severities varied according to the affected subunit. Lobe A and Cog6 subunit KOs displayed a more severely distorted Golgi structure, while Cog2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 knock outs had the most hypo glycosylated form of Lamp2. These results led us to conclude that every subunit is essential for COG complex function in Golgi trafficking, though to varying extents. We believe that this study and further analyses of these cells will help further elucidate the roles of individual COG subunits and bring a greater understanding to the class of MTCs as a whole.","dc:creator":"Bailey Blackburn J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"COG Complex Complexities: Detailed Characterization of a Complete Set of HEK293T Cells Lacking Individual COG Subunits."},"rdfs:label":"Knockout of COG1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:30d7ed17-7514-4166-8b51-97595e9202d4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e21c675a-aa8a-41de-af90-38a829010eef","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Deletion of Cog1p did not affect the recovery of Cog3p and Cog4p with TAP-Cog2p, but Lobe B subunits were almost undetectable in the eluates from the Δcog1 mutant lysate.

At least 5 unique variants, some missense and intronic variants, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental findings. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands from publications (PMIDs: 16537452, 19008299, 25533962, 33960418, 34625039). Mutations in *COG1* can lead to Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), type Iig. CDGs result in a wide variety of clinical features, such as defects in the nervous system development, psychomotor delay, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, coagulation disorders, and immunodeficiency. The broad spectrum of features reflects the critical role of N-glycoproteins during embryonic development, differentiation, and maintenance of cell functions. Clinical features of CDG-II caused by Cog1 deficiency include failure to thrive, generalized hypotonia, growth delay and mild psychomotor delay. No supporting segregation information is available, and the disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of *COG1*, the protein encoded by this gene is one of eight proteins (Cog1-8) which form a Golgi-localized complex (COG) required for normal Golgi morphology and function. Knockout of *COG1* exhibited distribution of the interaction of the subunits in the complex (PMID: 15932880). A different knockout experiment done in HEK293T displayed morphological changes in the Golgi structure, similar if not more serve changes that were previously observed in CHO cells (PMID: 27066481). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed interaction with other proteins in the COG complex, specifically its interaction with *COG2*, *COG3*, and *COG5 *(PMID: 11980916). In addition, the rescue of patient cells showed that overexpression of *COG1* can restore the localization of the β-1,4 galactosyltransferase (PMID: 16537452). In summary, there is strong evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship. Although additional genetic and experimental evidence is needed to establish a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
