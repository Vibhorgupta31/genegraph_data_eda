De novo truncating and missense mutations disrupt multiple aspects of TBR1 function, including subcellular localization, interactions with co-regulators and transcriptional repression. Missense mutations inherited from unaffected parents did not disturb function in our assays. We show that TBR1 homodimerizes, that it interacts with FOXP2, a transcription factor implicated in speech/language disorders, and that this interaction is disrupted by pathogenic mutations affecting either protein. These findings support the hypothesis that de novo mutations in sporadic autism have severe functional consequences. Moreover, they uncover neurogenetic mechanisms that bridge different neurodevelopmental disorders involving language deficits.

In adult rat brain, CASK is concentrated at neuronal synapses and binds to the cell-surface proteins neurexin and syndecan and the cytoplasmic proteins Mint/LIN-10 and Veli/LIN-7. Here we report that, through its guanylate kinase domain, CASK interacts with Tbr-1, a T-box transcription factor that is involved in forebrain development. CASK enters the nucleus and binds to a specific DNA sequence (the T-element) in a complex with Tbr-1. CASK acts as a coactivator of Tbr-1 to induce transcription of T-element containing genes, including reelin, a gene that is essential for cerebrocortical development.

Currently, the neurodevelopmental disorders and structural brain anomalies associated with TBR1 variants are not well characterized. Through international data sharing, we collected data from 25 unreported individuals and compared them with data from the literature. We evaluated structural brain anomalies in seven individuals by analysis of MRI images, and compared these with anomalies observed in TBR1 mutant mice. The phenotype included ID in all individuals, associated to autistic traits in 76% of them. No recognizable facial phenotype could be identified. MRI analysis revealed a reduction of the anterior commissure and suggested new features including dysplastic hippocampus and subtle neocortical dysgenesis.

(PMID: 25232744). TBR1 has also been associated with intellectual developmental disorder with autism and speech delay (OMIM #606053), 2q24 microdeletion syndrome, occipital pachygyria and polymicrogyria. Since then, phenotypes associated with variants in TBR1 have been expanded and range from autism spectrum disorder, delayed speech and language development, joint hypermobility, severe intellectual disability/global developmental delay, abnormality of the skull, cerebral palsy, etc. (Deriziotis et al., 2014 PMID: 25232744; Huang et al., 2014 PMID: 24441682; Palumbo et al., 2014 PMID:24458984).Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the ID/Autism GCEP decided to lump into one disease entity, complex neurodevelopmental disorder (Mondo:0100038). There are individuals that have been reported with other phenotypes including joint hypermobility and muscle dysfunction. It is unclear at this time whether these phenotypes are related to variants in TBR1 or are due to other circumstances. Most proband information was collected from large case control studies where other phenotypic features are not reported, therefore making the phenotypic profile unclear.\n\nTwenty-six variants (missense, in-frame indel, frameshift) have been included in this curation. These variants have been reported in thirty-two individuals across two publications (PMIDs: 25232744, 32005960).More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by protein interactions, expression studies, animal models, and biochemical function studies (PMIDs: 25232744, 24309898, 10749215, 32005960). In summary, TBR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
