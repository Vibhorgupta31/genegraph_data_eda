We genotyped 450 controls of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and identified only 5 individuals who are heterozygous for this variant (minor allele frequency: 0.0056). SLC1A4 (ASCT1) encodes a transporter for neutral aminoacids such as alanine, serine, cysteine and threonine. L-Serine is essential for neuronal survival and differentiation. Indeed, L-serine biosynthesis disorders affect brain development and cause severe ID. In the brain, L-serine is synthesized in astrocytes but not in neurons. It has been proposed that ASCT1 mediates the uptake of L-serine into neurons and the release of glia-borne L-serine to neighboring cells.

At early developmental stages, neuroepithelial cells constituting the ventricular zone expressed ASCT1 mRNA and protein ubiquitously. Thereafter, ASCT1 expression was gradually downregulated in neuronal populations during the late embryonic and neonatal periods, whereas its high expression was transmitted to radial glial cells and then to astrocytes.

Moreover, high cellular contents of L-Ser were revealed in these glial cells by using a specific antibody to L-Ser.

We first cloned neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1 from rat neurons in primary culture as a transporter candidate for L-serine uptake in the brain. The predicted amino acid sequence from rat ASCT1 exhibited significant homology with mouse and human ASCT1s. The amino acid sequence of rat ASCT1 was 92 and 84% identical to that of mouse and of human ASCT1, respectively. HEK293 cells expressing the rat ASCT1 cDNA showed a saturable dose-dependent and Na(+)-dependent increase in L-[(3)H] serine uptake by high affinity ( K(m) = 67 microM). The substrate selectivity of rat ASCT1 was the same as those of the mouse and human transporter. Northern blot analysis revealed that ASCT1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the brain, with its highest concentration in the striatum and hippocampus. When the uptake of L -[(3)H] serine into rat primary neurons or astrocytes was compared with that of HEK293 cells expressing rat ASCT1 or rat ASCT2 cDNA, the inhibition profile of amino acids for the rat neurons quite resembled that for HEK293 cells expressing rat ASCT1. In contrast, the profile for rat astrocytes was a mixture of that for HEK293 cells expressing rat ASCT1 and that for the cells expressing rat ASCT2. Furthermore, L-[(3)H] serine uptake in neurons was fully Na(+)-dependent. ASCT1 mRNA was expressed in both primary neurons and astrocytes, whereas ASCT2 mRNA was expressed only in astrocytes, as determined by using RT-PCR with primers specific for the rat ASCT1 or rat ASCT2 transporter.

Using ASCT1 and ASCT2 KO mice, we report that ASCT1, rather than ASCT2, is a physiologic regulator of d-serine metabolism. ASCT1 is a major d-serine uptake system in astrocytes and can also export l-serine via heteroexchange, supplying neurons with the substrate for d-serine synthesis. ASCT1-KO mice display lower levels of brain d-serine along with higher levels of l-alanine, l-threonine, and glycine. Deletion of ASCT1 was associated with neurodevelopmental alterations including lower hippocampal and striatal volumes and changes in the expression of neurodevelopmental-relevant genes. Furthermore, ASCT1-KO mice exhibited deficits in motor function, spatial learning, and affective behavior, along with changes in the relative contributions of d-serine vs. glycine in mediating NMDA receptor activity. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated lower levels of extracellular d-serine in ASCT1-KO mice, confirming altered d-serine metabolism.

At least 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense and small deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25930971, 27711071, 29989513, 29652076, 26041762, 27193218, 30125339). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More evidence of additional individuals with these 9 variants are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of ASCT1, an L-serine transporter (PMID: 15099708) expressed in the brain (PMID: 12533615), as well as its functional alteration and phenotypic recapitulation in a knockout mouse model (PMID: 30185558). L-serine is a non-essential amino acid in extra-neural tissues; however, its de novo synthesis within the brain is essential because of the limited permeability of the blood–brain barrier for L-serine. Within the brain, its synthesis is confined to astrocytes, and its shuttle to neuronal cells is performed by a dedicated neutral amino acid transporter, ASCT1 (encoded by SLC1A4). SLC1A4 disruption impairs brain development and function by decreasing its export from astrocytes. In summary, SLC1A4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive spastic tetraplegia-thin corpus callosum-progressive postnatal microcephaly syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8cff4bb6-caab-4696-a061-1f9a40c56c80"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
