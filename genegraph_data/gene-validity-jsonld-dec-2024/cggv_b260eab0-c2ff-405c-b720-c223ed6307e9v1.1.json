We have linked the disorder to a 0.98-cM (1.5-Mb) region on chromosome 9p24, flanked by rs1112534 and rs1074449, using homozygosity mapping in one large consanguineous pedigree. Analysis of one gene within this region, KCNV2, showed a homozygous nonsense mutation. Mutations were also found in 17 alleles of 10 other unrelated families with the same disorder. In situ hybridization demonstrated KCNV2 expression in human rod and cone photoreceptors. The precise function of KCNV2 in human photoreceptors remains to be determined, although this work suggests that mutations might perturb or abrogate I(KX), the potassium current within vertebrate photoreceptor inner segments, which has been shown to set their resting potential and voltage response.","dc:creator":"Wu H","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene KCNV2 encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit cause \"cone dystrophy with supernormal rod electroretinogram\" in humans."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b260eab0-c2ff-405c-b720-c223ed6307e9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b260eab0-c2ff-405c-b720-c223ed6307e9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33cde31e-50da-4ff8-9731-da8d80fbb74e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fbe106a7-fbf0-4e92-89f1-c14e896bf3fc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Within the human retina, in situ hybridization with a KCNV2 antisense riboprobe showed a positive signal in the inner segments of both cone and rod photoreceptors, which was not seen with the control sense probe","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16909397","rdfs:label":"in situ hybridization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b260eab0-c2ff-405c-b720-c223ed6307e9_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:169eda29-9080-47ef-9da5-40479a9cd511","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ecbaf7b4-7ae0-41b6-9bef-ac8fbe8e39e3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"loss of interaction, as well as altered electrophysiological function","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23115240","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in KCNV2 have been proposed as the molecular basis for cone dystrophy with supernormal rod electroretinogram. KCNV2 codes for the modulatory voltage-gated potassium channel α-subunit, Kv8.2, which is incapable of forming functional channels on its own. Functional heteromeric channels are however formed with Kv2.1 in heterologous expression systems, with both α-subunit genes expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors. Of the 30 mutations identified in the KCNV2 gene, we have selected three missense mutations localized in the potassium channel pore and two missense mutations localized in the tetramerization domain for analysis. We characterized the differences between homomeric Kv2.1 and heteromeric Kv2.1/Kv8.2 channels and investigated the influence of the selected mutations on the function of heteromeric channels. We found that two pore mutations (W467G and G478R) led to the formation of nonconducting heteromeric Kv2.1/Kv8.2 channels, whereas the mutations localized in the tetramerization domain prevented heteromer generation and resulted in the formation of homomeric Kv2.1 channels only. Consequently, our study suggests the existence of two distinct molecular mechanisms involved in the disease pathology.","dc:creator":"Smith KE","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Functional analysis of missense mutations in Kv8.2 causing cone dystrophy with supernormal rod electroretinogram."},"rdfs:label":"expression of wt and mutants in a cell system"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b260eab0-c2ff-405c-b720-c223ed6307e9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad750356-bd97-4a66-b56c-92d0a3f49e31","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9bcdb51-9ee5-41e1-9693-9c037f799b1e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"the model system shows that by the introduction of the missense mutations the interaction between the known interacting proteins is lost.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21882291","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response (CDSRR) is considered to be a very rare autosomal recessive retinal disorder. CDSRR is associated with mutations in KCNV2, a gene that encodes a modulatory subunit (Kv8.2) of a voltage-gated potassium channel. In this study, we found that KCNV2 mutations are present in a substantial fraction (2.2-4.3%) of a sample of 367 independent patients with a variety of initial clinical diagnoses of cone malfunction, indicating that CDSRR is underdiagnosed and more common than previously thought. In total, we identified 20 different KCNV2 mutations; 15 of them are novel. A new finding of this study is the substantial proportion of large deletions at the KCNV2 locus that accounts for 15.5% of the mutant alleles in our sample. We determined the breakpoints and size of all five different deletions, which ranged between 10.9 and 236.8 kb. Two deletions encompass the entire KCNV2 gene and one also includes the adjacent VLDLR gene. Furthermore, we investigated N-terminal amino acid substitution mutations for its effect on interaction with Kv2.1 using yeast two-hybrid technology. We found that these mutations dramatically reduce or abolish this interaction suggesting a lack of assembly of heteromeric Kv channels as one underlying pathomechanism of CDSRR.","dc:creator":"Wissinger B","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Large deletions of the KCNV2 gene are common in patients with cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response."},"rdfs:label":"yeast two hybrid technology"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:5fdedcc5-215f-486e-a461-6054d52cc4bb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1db7043c-75c0-4831-9b3d-80779f2f9bcd","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The loss of both Kv8.2 (KCNV2) as well as Kv2.1 (KCNB1) is assessed in a KO mice. a boulbe KO mouse was also created.

*KCNV2* gene was first reported in relation to \"cone dystrophy with supernormal rod responses\" (CDSRR) with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in 2005 (PMID: 15722315, PMID:16909397). This disease is also referred to as retinal cone dystrophy 3B (MIM#: 610356). Probands have also been reported with similar diagnoses such as cone dystrophy or \"achromatopsia and congenital cone dysfunction\" (PMID: 18235024), so all of these cases have been lumped for the purposes of this gene curation under the more general disease term KCNV2-related retinopathy.\n\nThis curation has scored genetic evidence from the first paper linking the phenotype with variants in the *KCNV2* gene by linkage analysis and Sanger sequencing in one family, followed by the analysis of a cohort of 10 additional probands (PMID:16909397). These probands have been included in the present curation, along with others from a cohort of 17 patients from 13 families ((PMID: 18235024). Numerous publications have collectively reported over 180 disease-causing variants, all of which are inferred to lead to loss-of-function. The variant types range from missense, in-frame indels, nonsense, and frameshift variants to large deletions and complex rearrangements. More cases were availbable in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence had already been reached.\n\nThe *KCNV2* encodes the regulatory subunit (Kv8.2) of voltage-gated potassium channels. These channels control the excitability of electrically active cells, and are made up of 4 subunits that create the central ion channel (PMID: 34063002). Disease-associated missense variants in yeast two-hybrid studies exhibit defective protein interaction with the *KCNB1* gene product Kv2.1 (PMID: 21882291), consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism of pathogenicity. Disease-associated missense variants also exhibit loss of interaction and altered electrophysiological function when exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells (PMID: 23115240). *Kcnv2* knockout mice exhibit a depressed a-wave and elevated b-wave, recapitulating the human abnormal response, accompanied by retinal changes including increased TUNEL-positive cells (PMID: 30820446).\n\nIn summary, *KCNV2* is definitively associated with KCNV2-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on September 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b260eab0-c2ff-405c-b720-c223ed6307e9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
