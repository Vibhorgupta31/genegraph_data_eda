In the epidermis, this methyltransferase is found in a defined sub-population of hair follicle stem cells poised to undergo lineage commitment, and its depletion results in enhanced quiescence and aberrant stem cell differentiation. Our results reveal that post-transcriptional RNA methylation can play a previously unappreciated role in controlling stem cell fate.","dc:creator":"Blanco S","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"The RNA-methyltransferase Misu (NSun2) poises epidermal stem cells to differentiate."},"rdfs:label":"Knockout mouse model (heterozygous and homozygous)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Short stature and craniofacial anomalies could be indicative of a NS phenotype but is barely specific to RASopathies\nOf note, no claim was made in this paper but Fahiminya made the claim that this was a model for NS.\n\nWill be counted on the ID/Autism curation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:6442d764-3ff8-41f4-984d-776254226b05_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6442d764-3ff8-41f4-984d-776254226b05_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b30c9ecd-d120-452f-8dde-9b12418b6a3e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b29b44a3-f4e3-4d4e-b805-b8796185532b","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"whole exome sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Dubowitz-like syndrome:  small stature,  intellectual disability  mild microcephaly  distinct facial appearance (blepharophimosis, broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism, smooth philtrum, downturning upper lip, sloping forehead and micrognathia, eczema.

Using WES approach, we identified the definitive disease-causing mutations in four families: (i) a novel nonsense homozygous (c.1034C>G) in PHKG2 causing glycogen storage disease type 9C (GSD9C) in a male with initial diagnosis of GSD3; (ii) a novel homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.915del) in NSUN2 in a male proband with Noonan-like syndrome; (iii) a homozygous SNV (c.1598C>G) in exon 11 of IDUA causing Hurler syndrome in a female proband with unknown clinical diagnosis; (iv) a de novo known splicing mutation (c.1645+1G>A) in PHEX in a female proband with initial diagnosis of autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets.

At least 2 variants (e.g. frameshift, splice site) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, and experimental data but only the mouse model supporting this association could be scored (PMIDs: 24102521, 22144916, 22577224). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs 22577224, 24102521). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model indicating that homozygous deletion of the NSUN2 gene caused short stature and craniofacial anomalies (PMIDs: 22144916). However, the patients reported with NSUN2 variants did not possess convincing clinical features consistent with Noonan syndrome, despite the reports from Fahiminiya et al. 2014 suggesting that the condition was Noonan-like. Therefore, using the expert judgment of the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel these cases were not scored. In summary,  the relationship between NSUN2 and autosomal recessive RASopathies is disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role NSUN2 plays in this disease. Additionally, this gene will be separately assessed by the ClinGen ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel for complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/4/2019 (SOP Version 5).\nThe patients reported with NSUN2 variants did not possess convincing clinical features consistent with Noonan syndrome, despite the reports from Fahiminiya et al. 2014 suggesting that the condition was Noonan-like.
