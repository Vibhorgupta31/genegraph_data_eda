Based on clinical and electrophysiological properties, they can be subdivided into three main groups: HMSN, dHMN, and HSN. At present, more than 50 IPN genes have been identified. Still, many patients and families with IPN have not yet received a molecular genetic diagnosis because clinical genetic testing usually only covers a subset of IPN genes. Moreover, a considerable proportion of IPN genes has to be identified. Here we present results of WES in 27 IPN patients excluded for mutations in many known IPN genes. Eight of the patients received a definite diagnosis. While six of these patients carried bona fide pathogenic mutations in known IPN genes, two patients had mutations in genes known to be involved in other types of neuromuscular disorders. A further group of eight patients carried sequence variations in IPN genes that could not unequivocally be classified as pathogenic. In addition, combining data of WES and linkage analysis identified SH3BP4, ITPR3, and KLHL13 as novel IPN candidate genes. Moreover, there was evidence that particular mutations in PEX12, a gene known to cause Zellweger syndrome, could also lead to an IPN phenotype. We show that WES is a useful tool for diagnosing IPN and we suggest an expanded phenotypic spectrum of some genes involved in other neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. Nevertheless, interpretation of variants in known and potential novel disease genes has remained challenging.","dc:creator":"SchabhÃ¼ttl M","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing in patients with inherited neuropathies: outcome and challenges."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24627108","rdfs:label":"HMSN-D3-II.1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No functional evidence on this variant, classified as VUS in ClinVar and Varsome, GnomAD: 4 heterozygotes, AF: 0.00001628"},{"id":"cggv:d3453c8f-ff06-43ae-90db-5a699475a441_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b16e20f-7857-4fe3-8dbe-95767edf71f9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":54,"detectionMethod":"10-cM density genomewide linkage analysis, within a thereby identified area: genomic sequencing of exons and flanking splice sites in two affected individuals and two control individuals","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003693","obo:HP_0001761"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"PMP22 duplication/deletion (southern blot), single gene sequencing in PMP22, MPZ, and GJB1","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:d3453c8f-ff06-43ae-90db-5a699475a441_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4f0f29be-1b53-48b8-b649-4f5eeb3cc177","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014629.4(ARHGEF10):c.995C>T (p.Thr332Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115598"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14508709","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Slowed nerve-conduction velocities (NCVs) are a biological endophenotype in the majority of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN).

ARHGEF10 was found to localize to vesicles containing Rab6 (of which there are three isoforms, Rab6a, Rab6b and Rab6c), Rab8 (of which there are two isoforms, Rab8a and Rab8b), and/or the secretion marker neuropeptide Y (NPY)-Venus in a Rab6-dependent manner. These vesicles were known to originate from the Golgi and contain secreted or membrane proteins. Ectopic expression of an N-terminal-truncated ARHGEF10 mutant led to the generation of large vesicle-like structures containing both Rab6 and Rab8. Additionally, small interfering (si)RNA-mediated knockdown of ARHGEF10 impaired the localization of Rab8 to these exocytotic vesicles. Furthermore, the invasiveness of MDA-MB231 cells was markedly decreased by knockdown of ARHGEF10, as well as of Rab8.

The Leonberger disorder is a severe, juvenile-onset, chronic, progressive, and mixed PN, characterized by exercise intolerance, gait abnormalities and muscle atrophy of the pelvic limbs, as well as inspiratory stridor and dyspnea. We mapped a PN locus in Leonbergers to a 250 kb region on canine chromosome 16 (Prawâ=â1.16Ã10-10, Pgenome, correctedâ=â0.006) utilizing a high-density SNP array. Within this interval is the ARHGEF10 gene, a member of the rho family of GTPases known to be involved in neuronal growth and axonal migration, and implicated in human hypomyelination. ARHGEF10 sequencing identified a 10 bp deletion in affected dogs that removes four nucleotides from the 3'-end of exon 17 and six nucleotides from the 5'-end of intron 17 (c.1955_1958+6delCACGGTGAGC). This eliminates the 3'-splice junction of exon 17, creates an alternate splice site immediately downstream in which the processed mRNA contains a frame shift, and generates a premature stop codon predicted to truncate approximately 50% of the protein. Homozygosity for the deletion was highly associated with the severe juvenile-onset PN phenotype in both Leonberger and Saint Bernard dogs. The overall clinical picture of PN in these breeds, and the effects of sex and heterozygosity of the ARHGEF10 deletion, are less clear due to the likely presence of other forms of PN with variable ages of onset and severity of clinical signs.

Clinically, the affected individuals did not develop a clinical Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) phenotype, but an electrophysiological phenotype of NCV slowing (Nelis et al., PMID: 9678704; de Jonghe et al., PMID: 10520946). With a LOD score of 9.93, the variant p.Thr332Ile co-segregated in 12 affected family members (Verhoeven et al., PMID: 14508709) and is supported by functional evidence (Chaya et al., PMID: 21719701). Due to incomplete phenotype and lacking co-segregation and functional evidence, other reported variants (e.g. PMID: 24627108) did not further support the gene-disease relationship.\nARHGEF10 encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and vesicle trafficking. Rho GTPase pathways and membrane recycling are both common mechanisms in hereditary neuropathies. In an immunofluorescence assay of HeLa cells, ARHGEF10 colocalized with exocytotic vesicle proteins (Shibata et al., PMID: 27550519).  Genome-wide association studies performed in 4074 dogs with a profound CMT phenotype revealed biallelic loss-of-function mutations in ARHGEF10 in 1.3% of the cases (Ekenstedt et al., PMID: 25275565). In contrast to this, knock-out mice did not develop a clear neuropathy (Lu et al., PMID: 29456827). In patients, a constitutive activation of the Rho GTPase is hypothesized as the underlying gain-of-function mechanism (Chaya et al., PMID: 21719701). However with one affected family only, the overall evidence to establish a clear gene-disease relationship has not been upheld over time. The panel therefore classifies ARHGEF10 in the category âLimited evidenceâ.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b23121f9-57e1-48ac-a2bc-d5a293829530"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
