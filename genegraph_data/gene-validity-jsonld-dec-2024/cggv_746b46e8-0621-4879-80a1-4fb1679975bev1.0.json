The regulatory mechanisms that ensure assembly of the V-ATPase holoenzyme on synaptic vesicles are unknown. Rabconnectin3α (Rbc3α) is a potential candidate for regulation of V-ATPase activity because of its association with synaptic vesicles and its requirement for acidification of intracellular compartments. Here, we provide the first evidence for a role of Rbc3α in synaptic vesicle acidification and neurotransmission. In this study, we characterized mutant alleles of rbc3α isolated from a large-scale screen for zebrafish with auditory/vestibular defects. We show that Rbc3α is localized to basal regions of hair cells in which synaptic vesicles are present. To determine whether Rbc3α regulates V-ATPase activity, we examined the acidification of synaptic vesicles and localization of the V-ATPase in hair cells. In contrast to wild-type hair cells, we observed that synaptic vesicles had elevated pH, and a cytosolic subunit of the V-ATPase was no longer enriched in synaptic regions of mutant hair cells. As a consequence of defective acidification of synaptic vesicles, afferent neurons in rbc3α mutants had reduced firing rates and reduced accuracy of phase-locked action potentials in response to mechanical stimulation of hair cells. Collectively, our data suggest that Rbc3α modulates synaptic transmission in hair cells by promoting V-ATPase activity in synaptic vesicles.","dc:creator":"Einhorn Z","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Rabconnectin3α promotes stable activity of the H+ pump on synaptic vesicles in hair cells."},"rdfs:label":"zebrafish expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8aafb740-b53e-4a40-b280-86ca161e1b46","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d42ca5e-fe6d-4cca-b89b-76a87d29ce7e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"hearing loss","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22875945","rdfs:label":"zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Model system is zebrafish."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5bf8c254-6a0f-43a5-847d-642f5274702c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb9f108a-8296-4bb1-a56a-43852eaef736","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis in 10 affected (II-2 not included) and 11 unaffected.

Of note, this gene has also been implicated in other diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders; these will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies (PMID: 27657680, 22875945). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
