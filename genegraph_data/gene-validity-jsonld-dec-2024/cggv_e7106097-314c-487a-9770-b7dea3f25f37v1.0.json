Impaired motor performance in the rotarod test was also noted in both compared to the controls, and a decrease in the tail-flick test showed reduced sensory perception. Further investigation revealed decreases in both motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities in both lines of mice, as well as decreased CMAPs, with SIMPLE WT transgenic mice displaying none of the aforementioned symptoms showing clear deficits that are consistent with human CMT. Histological analysis of sciatic nerves and ventral/dorsal roots revealed a demyelinating phenotype in the homozygous W116G mice with abnormal myelin infolding more prominent in the sciatic nerves. The axon caliber/area was much smaller than that of non-transgenic controls but no axon loss was noted. Analysis displayed that these axons with infoldings were displaced or deformed causing axonal damage and degeneration.

Despite human genetic evidence linking missense mutations in SIMPLE to CMT1C, the in vivo role of CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutations remains undetermined. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying CMT1C pathogenesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing either wild-type or CMT1C-linked W116G human SIMPLE. Mice expressing mutant, but not wild type, SIMPLE develop a late-onset motor and sensory neuropathy that recapitulates key clinical features of CMT1C disease. SIMPLE mutant mice exhibit motor and sensory behavioral impairments accompanied by decreased motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and reduced compound muscle action potential amplitude. This neuropathy phenotype is associated with focally infolded myelin loops that protrude into the axons at paranodal regions and near Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of peripheral nerves. We find that myelin infolding is often linked to constricted axons with signs of impaired axonal transport and to paranodal defects and abnormal organization of the node of Ranvier. Our findings support that SIMPLE mutation disrupts myelin homeostasis and causes peripheral neuropathy via a combination of toxic gain-of-function and dominant-negative mechanisms. The results from this study suggest that myelin infolding and paranodal damage may represent pathogenic precursors preceding demyelination and axonal degeneration in CMT1C patients.","dc:creator":"Lee SM","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Motor and sensory neuropathy due to myelin infolding and paranodal damage in a transgenic mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C."},"rdfs:label":"Transgenic W116G Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Although the mice with the expressed transgene do display signs clearly indicative of CMT1, the lack of specificity in the transfection and the promoter used do not allow for a preponderance of evidence to be met particularly as the heterozygous mice showed significantly less of a phenotype than the homozygous for an Autosomal Dominant disorder.

Recently, SIMPLE/LITAF was shown to be responsible for an autosomal dominant demyelinating form of CMT linked to 16p (CMT1C). Although two transcripts encoding different proteins (SIMPLE and LITAF) have been reported from the same gene, we could not confirm the existence of LITAF. Here we show that the LITAF transcript appears to result from a DNA sequencing error. We screened the SIMPLE gene for mutations in a cohort of 192 patients with CMT or related neuropathies, each of whom tested negative for other known genetic causes of CMT. In 16 unrelated CMT families we identified nine different nucleotide variations in SIMPLE that were not detected in control chromosomes. SIMPLE mutations can occur de novo, associated with sporadic CMT1 and may convey both demyelinating and axonal forms. Bioinformatics analyses and other observations of SIMPLE suggest that 1) it could be a member of the RING finger motif-containing subfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases that are associated with the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome processing pathway, 2) it could interact through its PPXY motifs with a WW domain containing protein, for instance with NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and 3) it could interact through the PSAP motif with TSG10, a protein associated with endosomal multivesicular protein sorting. Since both SIMPLE and Hrs are endosomal proteins and have both PPXY and P(S/T)AP motifs, we hypothesize that SIMPLE, like Hrs, is potentially a clathrin adaptor aiding in the retention of ubiquitinated proteins on to the endosomes. Thus the potential E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of SIMPLE, alteration in its interactions with NEDD4 or TSG101, or changes in its properties as a clathrin coat adaptor may underlie the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.","dc:creator":"Saifi GM","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"SIMPLE mutations in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and the potential role of its protein product in protein degradation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15776429","rdfs:label":"BAB2104"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Phenotypic evidence combined with variant-level evidence (PMID: 12525712 shows mislocalization and structural alterations) gives this proband default points."},{"id":"cggv:1787e85f-d906-4335-b4c5-6a1e3ad190b4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:916bfb57-1101-44af-8ba8-f8d7f18ef830","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"detectionMethod":"","phenotypeFreeText":"Median nerve MCV interval 22 m/s","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1787e85f-d906-4335-b4c5-6a1e3ad190b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:0ac0fde0-3f3f-4c67-b32a-aa8521ee5c20","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001136473.1(LITAF):c.*42C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344236"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16787513"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16787513","rdfs:label":"Ly2210:III-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Phenotypic and segregation evidence combined with variant-level evidence for a variant altering the same codon (PMID: 12525712 shows mislocalization and structural alterations) gives this proband 0.25 points."},{"id":"cggv:c8fce112-1527-4920-9d2f-07988dfa3da3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b90fb09b-c021-4632-bcf1-c7c5424cd3c7","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was obtained and exons 2-4 of LITAF were PCR amplified and sequenced with variants found in Exon 3.

Herein, we report the clinical, electrophysiological, and neuropathological findings of an Italian CMT1 family with a novel SIMPLE missense mutation. The family exhibited electrophysiological signs of demyelination, predominantly affecting the lower limbs, with conduction blocks, and a wide variability of age of onset among the members. Molecular analysis identified the novel heterozygous missense mutation p.Pro135Arg in SIMPLE which co-segregated with the disease within the pedigree. In conclusion, our findings confirm that the genetic analysis of LITAF/SIMPLE should be considered for the diagnostic flow-chart of CMT1 patient, especially when nerve conduction studies show the presence of conduction blocks.

The phenotypes associated with LITAF/SIMPLE variants include distal muscle weakness, pes cavus, decreased motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, and impaired vibration or pain sensation in the lower limbs. At least 15 unique missense variants have been reported in humans, with few other types of mutations reported. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in over 25 probands in 6 different publications, although no confirmed de novo or null variants have been observed in the literature (PMIDs: 24880540, 19541485, 28211240, 16787513, 15776429, 12525712). Variants in this gene also segregated with disease in over 50 additional family members across seven different families. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, functional studies, and an animal model. LITAF/SIMPLE was once predicted to have a role in protein degradation pathways, however recent research has shown that it is instead a zinc-binding membrane protein that embeds itself with an anchor located within the LITAF domain where most of the pathogenic mutations cluster (PMID: 27927196). Additionally, LITAF/SIMPLE is present in both developing and adult rat/mouse schwann cells and not in the axons supporting a demyelinating neuropathy phenotype (PMID:12525712). In summary, LITAF/SIMPLE is MODERATELY associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Charcot Marie Tooth Gene Curation Expert Panel on Apr 7, 2020.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e7106097-314c-487a-9770-b7dea3f25f37"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
