However, they suffer increased mortality and show progressive hearing loss during adulthood despite compensatory up-regulation of beta(cyto)-actin. The surprising viability and normal hearing of young Actg1(-/-) mice means that beta(cyto)-actin can likely build all essential non-muscle actin-based cytoskeletal structures including mechanosensory stereocilia of hair cells that are necessary for hearing. Although gamma(cyto)-actin-deficient stereocilia form normally, we found that they cannot maintain the integrity of the stereocilia actin core. In the wild-type, gamma(cyto)-actin localizes along the length of stereocilia but re-distributes to sites of F-actin core disruptions resulting from animal exposure to damaging noise. In Actg1(-/-) stereocilia similar disruptions are observed even without noise exposure.

The genetic contribution to age-related hearing loss is estimated to be 40%-50%. Gene mutations that cause nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss with early onset may provide insight into the etiology of presbycusis. We have identified four families segregating an autosomal dominant, progressive, sensorineural hearing loss phenotype that has been linked to chromosome 17q25.3. The critical interval containing the causative gene was narrowed to approximately 2 million bp between markers D17S914 and D17S668. Cochlear-expressed genes were sequenced in affected family members. Sequence analysis of the gamma-actin gene (ACTG1) revealed missense mutations in highly conserved actin domains in all four families. These mutations change amino acids that are conserved in all actins, from protozoa to mammals, and were not found in >100 chromosomes from normal hearing individuals. Much of the specialized ultrastructural organization of the cells in the cochlea is based on the actin cytoskeleton. Many of the mutations known to cause either syndromic or nonsyndromic deafness occur in genes that interact with actin (e.g., the myosins, espin, and harmonin). The mutations we have identified are in various binding domains of actin and are predicted to mildly interfere with bundling, gelation, polymerization, or myosin movement and may cause hearing loss by hindering the repair or stability of cochlear cell structures damaged by noise or aging.

Recently, mutations in ACTG1 were found to cause autosomal dominant, progressive, sensorineural hearing impairment linked to the DFNA20/26 locus on chromosome 17q25.3 in four American families and in one Dutch family. We report here the linkage of autosomal dominant, progressive, sensorineural hearing impairment in a large Norwegian family to the DFNA20/26 locus. Sequencing of ACTG1 identified a novel missense mutation (c.1109T>C; p.V370A) segregating with the hearing loss. Functional analysis in yeast showed that the p.V370A mutation restricts cell growth at elevated temperature or under hyperosmolar stress. Molecular modelling suggested that the p.V370A mutation modestly alters a site for protein-protein interaction in gamma-actin and thereby modestly alters gamma-actin-based cytoskeletal structures. Nineteen Norwegian and Danish families with autosomal, dominant hearing impairment were analyzed for mutations in ACTG1 by sequencing, but no disease-associated mutations were identified. Finally, a long-term follow-up of the hearing loss progression associated with the p.V370A mutation in ACTG1 is provided. The present study expands our understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship of this deafness gene and provides a sensitive and simple functional assay for missense mutations in this gene, which may assist future molecular diagnosis of autosomal-dominant hearing impairment.

In this study, a Thr278Ile mutation was identified in helix 9 of the modelled protein structure. The alteration of residue Thr278 is predicted to have a small but significant effect on the gamma 1 actin structure owing to its close proximity to a methionine residue at position 313 in helix 11. Met313 has no space in the structure to move away. Moreover, the Thr278 residue is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.

The latter feature is consistent with the highly unusual spontaneous tendency of the E241K mutant to form bundles in vitro, although this propensity to bundle was neutralized by tropomyosin and the E241K filament bundles were hypersensitive to severing in the presence of cofilin.

Here, we report on seven unrelated patients with six mutations in ACTG1-four novel and two previously reported. Only one of seven patients was clinically diagnosed with this disorder and underwent ACTB/ACTG1 targeted sequencing, four patients were screened as a part of the large lissencephaly cohort and two were tested with exome sequencing. Retrospectively, facial features were compatible with the diagnosis but significantly milder than previously reported in four patients, and non-specific in one. The pattern of malformations of cortical development was highly similar in four of six patients with available MRI images and encompassed frontal predominant pachygyria merging with the posterior predominant band heterotopia. Two remaining patients showed mild involvement consistent with bilaterally simplified gyration over the frontal lobes.

The ACTG1 gene has been reported in both autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) DFNA20/26 with or without vestibular involvement and Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFFS), whose primary features include intellectual disability, trigonocephaly, hypertelorism, ptosis, arched eyebrows and secondary features include pachygyria/lissencephaly, coloboma, hearing loss, epilepsy, microphthalmia, agenesis or thickened corpus callosum (Yates 2017). 62% (8/13) of reported probands with a BWCFFS diagnosis for whom clinical information was available had some degree of hearing loss, though severity, progressivity, and age-of-onset of hearing loss were variable. Variable expressivity has been reported in one family that with hearing loss, seizures, estropia, and ocular coloboma (Kemerley 2017), as has isolated coloboma (Rainger 2017). In general, reported cases of BWCFFS are caused by missense variants that arose de novo and those causing nonsyndromic hearing loss segregate in families, however one de novo variant has been observed in an individual with NSHL (LMM unpublished data). There is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation, suggesting that phenotypes are variant-specific. This is supported by functional evidence in cell lines derived from BWCFFS patients (Riviere 2012) and in yeast containing hearing loss-causing variants (Bryan 2006). No loss-of-function variants have been reported in affected individuals, and one individual with a large deletion on chromosome 17 encompassing the ACTG1 gene did not have any of the major features of BWCFFS (Riviere 2012). Additionally, no changes in protein levels of ACTG1 in patient cell lines containing pathogenic variants in ACTG1  were observed (Riviere 2012). These data suggest dominant-negative or gain-of-function variants in ACTG1, and not haploinsufficiency, are disease-causing. An ACTG1-null mouse model has been reported (Belyantseva 2009) with progressive sensorineural hearing loss and some evidence of reduced survival and development that was absent in heterozygotes, however no loss-of-function variants have been reported in humans and all reported phenotypes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, so the validity of this model is uncertain. According to the ClinGen guidelines for Lumping and Splitting, there is insufficient evidence to split NSHL and BWCFFS, so we propose these disorders exist along a spectrum of ACTG1-related disorders. In summary, ACTG1 is definitively associated with a spectrum of diseases that range from nonsyndromic hearing loss to severe BWCFFS. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 3/20/18.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4244332d-e074-4ff7-96ac-549407ce14bb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
