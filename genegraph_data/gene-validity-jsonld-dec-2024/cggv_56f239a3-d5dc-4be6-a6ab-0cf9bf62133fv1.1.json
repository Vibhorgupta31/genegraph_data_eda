Patients with intermediate phenotypes of collagen VI-related myopathy display a lesser degree of weakness and a longer period of ambulation than do individuals with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, and the spectrum of disease finally encompasses mild Bethlem myopathy, in which ambulation persists into adulthood. Dominant and recessive autosomal mutations in the three major collagen VI genes-COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3-can underlie this entire clinical spectrum, and result in deficient or dysfunctional microfibrillar collagen VI in the extracellular matrix of muscle and other connective tissues, such as skin and tendons. The potential effects on muscle include progressive dystrophic changes, fibrosis and evidence for increased apoptosis, which potentially open avenues for pharmacological intervention.

Using the Illumina sequencing technology, we obtained a whole-genome sequence from one affected Landseer. Variants were called with respect to the dog reference genome and compared with the genetic variants of 170 control dogs from other breeds. The affected Landseer dog was homozygous for a single, private nonsynonymous variant in the critical intervals, a nonsense variant in the COL6A1 gene (Chr31:39,303,964G>T; COL6A1:c.289G>T; p.E97*). Genotypes at this variant showed perfect concordance with the muscular dystrophy phenotype in all five cases and more than 1000 control dogs.

Dominant mutations in all three collagen VI genes had previously been associated with the considerably milder Bethlem myopathy. Here we report that a de novo heterozygous deletion of the COL6A1 gene can also result in a severe phenotype of classical UCMD precluding ambulation. The internal gene deletion occurs near a minisatellite DNA sequence in intron 8 that removes 1.1 kb of genomic DNA encompassing exons 9 and 10. The resulting mutant chain contains a 33-amino acid deletion near the amino-terminus of the triple-helical domain but preserves a unique cysteine in the triple-helical domain important for dimer formation prior to secretion. Thus, dimer formation and secretion of abnormal tetramers can occur and exert a strong dominant negative effect on microfibrillar assembly, leading to a loss of normal localization of collagen VI in the basement membrane surrounding muscle fibers. Consistent with this mechanism was our analysis of a patient with a much milder phenotype, in whom we identified a previously described Bethlem myopathy heterozygous in-frame deletion of 18 amino acids somewhat downstream in the triple-helical domain, a result of exon 14 skipping in the COL6A1 gene. This deletion removes the crucial cysteine, so that dimer formation cannot occur and the abnormal molecule is not secreted, preventing the strong dominant negative effect. Our studies provide a biochemical insight into genotype-phenotype correlations in this group of disorders and establish that UCMD can be caused by dominantly acting mutations.","dc:creator":"Pan TC","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"New molecular mechanism for Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy: a heterozygous in-frame deletion in the COL6A1 gene causes a severe phenotype."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12840783","rdfs:label":"UC-4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This variant has been demonstrated de novo and has supporting variant-level evidence (The mutant chains from both patients were able to incorporate into tetramers, but immunostaining against Collagen VI showed some localization in UC-4 but at markedly reduced amounts) which therefore earns default points per SOP8."},{"id":"cggv:da2dedef-2cce-4b71-a57a-669799fcf4e0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b56ef178-96b3-4b5d-a180-4d4f314b175a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Peripheral blood was obtained from patients and parents and genomic DNA extracted.

The protein's basic structural unit is a heterotrimer of the alpha1(VI), alpha2(VI), and alpha3(VI) chains additionally encoded by the genes COL6A2 and COL6A3 to form the triple helical structural element common to collagens. Mutations in Collagen VI have historically been reported in relation to two different conditions. The first, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, was first described in a series of papers in the 1930s by Otto Ullrich and was notable due to occurence of both weakness and joint hypermobility (Kongenitale atonisch-sklerotische Muskeldystrophie, 1930). The second, Bethlem myopathy, was reported by Bethlem and van Wijngaarden in 1976 as a dominant myopathy with development of joint contractures (PMID: 963533). Genetic analysis in patients with each of these disorders revealed both dominant and recessive defects in one of the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 genes that affect the final Collagen VI protein. As these disorders are clearly on a clinical spectrum of phenotypic severity (PMID: 21496625), COL6A1 was curated in relation to a combined disease entity: Semidominant Collagen 6-Related Myopathy. Almost 200 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans by ClinVar and HGMD. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least nine probands in four publications (PMIDs: 8782832, 12840783, 16130093, 23738969). These include a variety of dominant negative glycine substitutions that interrupt the Gly-X-Y sequences in the triple helical domain, in-frame deletions in the same region, and premature termination variants that lead to a complete loss-of-function among others. The gene segregated with the disease in many other family members in the original families characterized by Bethlem, yielding a combined LOD score of 6.21. Many other cases are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease association is additionally supported by several pieces of experimental evidence. Loss of Collagen VI's function as a structural protein, including binding components of the ECM and indirect regulation of processes such as autophagy (PMID: 21037586) and muscle stiffness/satellite cell renewal (PMID: 23743995), perfectly matches the hyperlaxity and muscle-related phenotypes observed in the myopathy, as does primary expression in the skeletal muscle. Functional evidence in Collagen VI Null mice confirming the impact of Collagen VI on autophagy and muscle stiffness/satellite cell renewal, with restoration of these functions rescuing some amount of the phenotypes, also helps explain the pathogenic mechanism. Finally, the alteration of COL6A1 in two models, a hypomorphic mouse model and canines with a natural homozygous termination codon (Glu98Ter), recapitulates the myopathy phenotype observed in humans.\n\nIn summary, COL6A1 is definitively associated with semidominant collagen 6-related myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:56f239a3-d5dc-4be6-a6ab-0cf9bf62133f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
