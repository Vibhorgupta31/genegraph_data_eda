It presents a high heterogeneity, both in clinics and genetics. We have developed a novel targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay and screened a cohort of 257 HPE patients. Mutations with high confidence in their deleterious effect were identified in approximately 24% of the cases and were held for diagnosis, whereas variants of uncertain significance were identified in 10% of cases. This study provides a new classification of genes that are involved in HPE. SHH, ZIC2, and SIX3 remain the top genes in term of frequency with GLI2, and are followed by FGF8 and FGFR1. The three minor HPE genes identified by our study are DLL1, DISP1, and SUFU. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor signaling must now be considered a major pathway involved in HPE. Interestingly, several cases of double mutations were found and argue for a polygenic inheritance of HPE. Altogether, it supports that the implementation of NGS in HPE diagnosis is required to improve genetic counseling.","dc:creator":"Dubourg C","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutational Spectrum in Holoprosencephaly Shows That FGF is a New Major Signaling Pathway."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27363716","rdfs:label":"Hartsfield Syndrome Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Missense with no parental information given and not functional evidence = 0.1.

FGFR1 is a principal cause for these less severe diseases as well. Here we demonstrate that of the nine FGFR1 mutations recently detected in our screen of over 200 HPE probands by next generation sequencing, only five distinct mutations in the kinase domain behave as dominant-negative mutations in zebrafish over-expression assays. Three FGFR1 mutations seen in HPE probands behave identical to wild-type FGFR1 in rescue assays, including one apparent de novo variation. Interestingly, in one HPE family, a deleterious FGFR1 allele was transmitted from one parent and a loss-of-function allele in FGF8 from the other parent to both affected daughters.

The proband presented with bilateral cleft lip and palate, malformed auricles, and bilateral ectrodactyly of his hands and feet at birth. He was later diagnosed with diabetes insipidus, spastic quadriplegia, developmental delay, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and enlargement of the third cerebral ventricle. We noted the substantial phenotypic overlap with individuals with Hartsfield syndrome, the rare combination of holoprosencephaly and ectrodactyly. Sequencing of FGFR1 identified a previously unreported de novo variant in exon 11 (p.Gly487Cys), which we modeled to determine its predicted effect on the protein structure. Although it was not predicted to significantly alter protein folding stability, it is possible this variant leads to the formation of nonnative intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds. We then mapped this and other disease-associated variants to a 3-dimensional model of FGFR1 to assess which protein domains harbored the highest number of pathogenic changes. We observed the greatest number of variants within the domains involved in FGF binding and FGFR activation. To further explore the contribution of each variant to disease, we recorded the phenotype resulting from each FGFR1 variant to generate a series of phenotype-specific protein maps and compared our results to benign variants appearing in control databases. It is our hope that the use of phenotypic maps such as these will further the understanding of genetic disease in general and diseases caused by variation in FGFR1 specifically.","dc:creator":"Lansdon LA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"The Use of Variant Maps to Explore Domain-Specific Mutations of FGFR1."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28825856","rdfs:label":"Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Missense + de novo but no functional evidence = 0.5 points"},{"id":"cggv:bd6c69ad-2d5b-4790-b7d7-826588ee9572_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50dcb649-c4a3-4be5-980f-415c813f7958","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"detectionMethod":"Targeted NGS for ligands and receptors of developmental genes, including FGFR1 and FGF8","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Bilateral cleft lip and palate, high forehead, hypertelorism, lobar HPE, absence of septum pellucidum and anterior corpus callosum, bilateral ectrodactyly of the feet, developmental delay","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:bd6c69ad-2d5b-4790-b7d7-826588ee9572_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ffd35fba-526a-4b08-8aa9-48e3ecf1846c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_023110.3(FGFR1):c.1460G>A (p.Gly487Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA269807"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26931467"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26931467","rdfs:label":"Patient 6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Missense + functional evidence = 1 pt.

Here, exome sequencing analysis in a 12-year-old boy with HS disclosed a novel de novo heterozygous variant c.1934C>T in FGFR1 predicted to cause the p.(Ala645Val) amino-acid substitution. In order to evaluate whether the variant, changing a highly conserved residue of the kinase domain, affects FGFR1 function, biochemical studies were employed. We measured the FGFR1 receptor activity in FGF2-treated cell lines exogenously expressing wild-type or Ala645Val FGFR1 by monitoring the activation status of FGF2/FGFR1 downstream pathways. Our analysis highlighted that RAS/ERK1/2 signaling was significantly perturbed in cells expressing mutated FGFR1, in comparison with control cells. We also provided preliminary evidence showing a modulation of the autophagic process in cells expressing mutated FGFR1.

The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) gene is located in the region of chromosome 8 containing the mutation. Sequencing of the gene in hush puppy heterozygotes revealed a missense mutation in the kinase domain of the protein (W691R). Homozygotes were found to die during development, at approximately embryonic day 8.5, and displayed a phenotype similar to null mutants. Reverse transcription PCR indicated a decrease in Fgfr1 transcript in heterozygotes and homozygotes. Generation of a construct containing the mutation allowed the function of the mutated receptor to be studied. Immunocytochemistry showed that the mutant receptor protein was present at the cell membrane, suggesting normal expression and trafficking. Measurements of changes in intracellular calcium concentration showed that the mutated receptor could not activate the IP(3) pathway, in contrast to the wild-type receptor, nor could it initiate activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Thus, the hush puppy mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 appears to cause a loss of receptor function. The mutant protein appears to have a dominant negative effect, which could be due to it dimerising with the wild-type protein and inhibiting its activity, thus further reducing the levels of functional protein. A dominant modifier, Mhspy, which reduces the effect of the hush puppy mutation on pinna and stapes development, has been mapped to the distal end of chromosome 7 and may show imprinting.","dc:creator":"Calvert JA","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A missense mutation in Fgfr1 causes ear and skull defects in hush puppy mice."},"rdfs:label":"Calvert Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Only skull size was studied, not brain size and deformities.
