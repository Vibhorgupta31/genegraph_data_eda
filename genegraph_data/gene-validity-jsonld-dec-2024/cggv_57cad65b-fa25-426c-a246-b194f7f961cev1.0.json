To identify causal variants for syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID), exome sequencing was performed using DNA samples from 22 consanguineous Pakistani families with ARID, of which 21 have additional phenotypes including microcephaly. To aid in variant identification, homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis were performed. DNA samples from affected family member(s) from every pedigree underwent exome sequencing. Identified rare damaging exome variants were tested for co-segregation with ID using Sanger sequencing. For seven ARID families, variants were identified in genes not previously associated with ID, including: EI24, FXR1 and TET3 for which knockout mouse models have brain defects; and CACNG7 and TRAPPC10 where cell studies suggest roles in important neural pathways. For two families, the novel ARID genes CARNMT1 and GARNL3 lie within previously reported ID microdeletion regions. We also observed homozygous variants in two ID candidate genes, GRAMD1B and TBRG1, for which each has been previously reported in a single family. An additional 14 families have homozygous variants in established ID genes, of which 11 variants are novel. All ARID genes have increased expression in specific structures of the developing and adult human brain and 91% of the genes are differentially expressed in utero or during early childhood. The identification of novel ARID candidate genes and variants adds to the knowledge base that is required to further understand human brain function and development.","dc:creator":"Santos-Cortez RLP","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Novel candidate genes and variants underlying autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorders with intellectual disability."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57cad65b-fa25-426c-a246-b194f7f961ce_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57cad65b-fa25-426c-a246-b194f7f961ce_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40d97824-06e5-4287-968e-eaa6d16f8f78","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5efd9280-001f-48ce-b22a-553754e82ad0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that Tet3 expression is basically undetectable in undifferentiated mouse ESCs, but its level increases rapidly during neuronal differentiation along with neural progenitor marker nestin and the neuronal marker MAP2\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24838624","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), converted from 5-methylcytocine (5mC) by Tet family of dioxygenases (Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3), is enriched in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in the brain.

Although the enzymes that catalyse DNA methylation have been characterized, enzymes responsible for demethylation have been elusive. A recent study indicates that the human TET1 protein could catalyse the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) of DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), raising the possibility that DNA demethylation may be a Tet1-mediated process. Here we extend this study by demonstrating that all three mouse Tet proteins (Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3) can also catalyse a similar reaction. Tet1 has an important role in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell maintenance through maintaining the expression of Nanog in ES cells. Downregulation of Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlates with methylation of the Nanog promoter, supporting a role for Tet1 in regulating DNA methylation status. Furthermore, knockdown of Tet1 in pre-implantation embryos results in a bias towards trophectoderm differentiation. Thus, our studies not only uncover the enzymatic activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrate a role for Tet1 in ES cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification.","dc:creator":"Ito S","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal and inner cell mass specification."},"rdfs:label":"DNA methylation data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.75},{"id":"cggv:57cad65b-fa25-426c-a246-b194f7f961ce_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e9914f2-26ef-4eca-932f-ba932f1b5ee1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2a19bda-0fea-4d5f-974b-debcb8e7d94b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"At stage 35, striking developmental abnormalities was observed in 96% (194/201) of xlTet3 MOs-injected embryos (malformation of the eye (eyeless), small head, and missing pigmentation along the lateral body) while control embryos develop normally. in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR assays in Tet3 depleted embryos at stage 14 showed that depletion of Tet3 greatly reduces the expression of master eye developmental genes (pax6, rx and six3) on the xlTet3 MOs-injected side compared to the uninjected side and inhibits the expression of two primary neuron markers (ngn2 and tubb2b), two neural crest markers (sox9 and snail) and inhibits expression of two major shh signaling components (shh and ptc-1).

Here, we describe in detail a Mendelian disorder caused by the disruption of DNA demethylation. TET3 is a methylcytosine dioxygenase that initiates DNA demethylation during early zygote formation, embryogenesis, and neuronal differentiation and is intolerant to haploinsufficiency in mice and humans. We identify and characterize 11 cases of human TET3 deficiency in eight families with the common phenotypic features of intellectual disability and/or global developmental delay; hypotonia; autistic traits; movement disorders; growth abnormalities; and facial dysmorphism. Mono-allelic frameshift and nonsense variants in TET3 occur throughout the coding region. Mono-allelic and bi-allelic missense variants localize to conserved residues; all but one such variant occur within the catalytic domain, and most display hypomorphic function in an assay of catalytic activity.

*TET3* gene is located on chromosome 2 at 2p13.1 and encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase that initiates DNA demethylation to regulate gene expression during early zygote formation, embryogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. *TET3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Beck-Fahrner syndrome (BEFAHRS) in 2018 (Santos-Cortez et al, PMID:30167849). BEFAHRS is a developmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay with variable (mild to severe) intellectual disability, hypotonia, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the curation was split by inheritance pattern. This curation focuses on the relationship between *TET3* and autosomal recessive BEFAHRS. At least 6 unique variants (5 missense, 1 nonsense) have been reported in 3 probands in three publications (PMIDs: 30167849, 31928709, 34719681) and are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function study, expression study, and rescue in a Xenopus model (PMIDs: 20639862, 24838624, 23217707). The mechanism of pathogenicity is currently unknown. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date November 17, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:57cad65b-fa25-426c-a246-b194f7f961ce"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
