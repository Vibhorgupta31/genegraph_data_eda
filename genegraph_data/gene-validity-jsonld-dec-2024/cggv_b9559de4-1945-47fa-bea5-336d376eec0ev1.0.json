Because disruption of the various subunits of the AP complexes is embryonic lethal in the majority of cases, characterization of their function in vivo is still lacking. Here, we describe the first mutation in the human AP1S1 gene, encoding the small subunit sigma1A of the AP-1 complex. This founder splice mutation, which leads to a premature stop codon, was found in four families with a unique syndrome characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia (MEDNIK). To validate the pathogenic effect of the mutation, we knocked down Ap1s1 expression in zebrafish using selective antisens morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO). The knockdown phenotype consisted of perturbation in skin formation, reduced pigmentation, and severe motility deficits due to impaired neural network development. Both neural and skin defects were rescued by co-injection of AMO with wild-type (WT) human AP1S1 mRNA, but not by co-injecting the truncated form of AP1S1, consistent with a loss-of-function effect of this mutation. Together, these results confirm AP1S1 as the gene responsible for MEDNIK syndrome and demonstrate a critical role of AP1S1 in development of the skin and spinal cord.","dc:creator":"Montpetit A","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Disruption of AP1S1, causing a novel neurocutaneous syndrome, perturbs development of the skin and spinal cord."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b9559de4-1945-47fa-bea5-336d376eec0e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b9559de4-1945-47fa-bea5-336d376eec0e_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9},{"id":"cggv:cd493caf-45ab-4d31-a91f-ac13326025ba_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd493caf-45ab-4d31-a91f-ac13326025ba","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":27,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2308194e-066c-43d7-ab26-703ce94c1706","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001283.5(AP1S1):c.183-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/39854"}},"detectionMethod":"All exons and intron/exon boundaries sequenced","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Homozygosity mapping in four affected families from the same isolated geographic area identified a shared haplotype on 7q22.

MEDNIK syndrome was first reported in a few French-Canadian families sharing common ancestors, presenting a complex neurocutaneous phenotype, but its pathogenesis is not completely understood. A Sephardic-Jewish patient, carrying a new AP1S1 homozygous mutation, showed severe perturbations of copper metabolism with hypocupremia, hypoceruloplasminemia and liver copper accumulation, along with intrahepatic cholestasis. Zinc acetate treatment strikingly improved clinical conditions, as well as liver copper and bile-acid overload. We evaluated copper-related metabolites and liver function retrospectively in the original French-Canadian patient series. Intracellular copper metabolism and subcellular localization and function of copper pump ATP7A were investigated in patient fibroblasts. Copper metabolism perturbation and hepatopathy were confirmed in all patients. Studies in mutant fibroblasts showed abnormal copper incorporation and retention, reduced expression of copper-dependent enzymes cytochrome-c-oxidase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and aberrant intracellular trafficking of Menkes protein ATP7A, which normalized after rescue experiments expressing wild-type AP1S1 gene. We solved the pathogenetic mechanism of MEDNIK syndrome, demonstrating that AP1S1 regulates intracellular copper machinery mediated by copper-pump proteins. This multisystem disease is characterized by a unique picture, combining clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases, in which liver copper overload is treatable by zinc acetate therapy, and can now be listed as a copper metabolism defect in humans. Our results may also contribute to understand the mechanism(s) of intracellular trafficking of copper pumps.","dc:creator":"Martinelli D","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"MEDNIK syndrome: a novel defect of copper metabolism treatable by zinc acetate therapy."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:30ba4d92-abbb-44ce-bbf3-dbdc21d629b3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30ba4d92-abbb-44ce-bbf3-dbdc21d629b3_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:30ba4d92-abbb-44ce-bbf3-dbdc21d629b3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"After confirming loss of expression at both the mRNA and protein level, the authors investigated the consequences of loss of function in patient fibroblasts.

In this article, we review the fundamental properties of protein coats and the diseases that result from mutation of their constituent subunits.","dc:creator":"Dell'Angelica EC","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Coatopathies: Genetic Disorders of Protein Coats."},"rdfs:label":"AP1S1 Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b9559de4-1945-47fa-bea5-336d376eec0e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc9b40d5-4d2a-4d18-8ef3-907c800f7ef3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:49ef8b0f-0703-4f8f-a070-f7ae1b46382d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Given the observed alterations in copper metabolism observed in MEDNIK patients, the authors assayed radiolabeled copper uptake and retention rates in patient fibroblasts. The rate of uptake was higher in patient cells compared to unaffected controls (0.21uCi/mg protein vs 0.064-0.075), as was the retention rate (47% vs 31-36%). These experiments were repeated using cells from a patient with Menkes disease; copper uptake and retention rates were higher than those for the MEDNIK patient (0.47-1.05uCi/mg protein and 92-97%, respectively). Total intracellular copper concentrations for the MEDNIK patient cells were within the normal range (42.5ng/mg protein vs 21.2-46.0), while this value was greatly elevated in the Menkes disease patient cells (295-321ng/mg protein). \n\nIn fibroblasts from unaffected controls, the copper-dependent ATPase ATP7A localizes largely to the trans-Golgi network (assayed by co-localization with p230, a known trans-Golgi protein; Fig. 4A, top panels). When 200uM copper chloride is added to the culture medium, ATP7A localization shifts to the plasma membrane and to cytoskeletal filaments (Fig. 4B, top panels). Meanwhile, ATP7A is localized to the PM and to cytoskeletal filaments in both patient cells, regardless of copper concentration in the culture medium (Fig. 4A-B, middle and bottom panels). The altered localization of this copper-dependent enzyme is consistent with the copper metabolism defects observed in MEDNIK patients, and with the intracellular trafficking functions of the AP-1 complex, of which AP1S1 is a part.

Diarrhea is also a predominant symptom in many immunodeficiencies, congenital disorders of glycosylation, and in some defects of the vesicular sorting and transporting machinery. We set out to identify the etiology of an intractable diarrhea in 2 consanguineous families by whole-exome sequencing, and identified two novel AP1S1 mutations, c.269T>C (p.Leu90Pro) and c.346G>A (p.Glu116Lys). AP1S1 encodes the small subunit of the adaptor protein 1 complex (AP-1), which plays roles in clathrin coat-assembly and trafficking between trans-Golgi network, endosomes and the plasma membrane. An AP1S1 knock-out (KO) of a CaCo2 intestinal cell line was generated to characterize intestinal AP1S1 deficiency as well as identified mutations by stable expression in KO background. Morphology and prototype transporter protein distribution were comparable between parental and KO cells. We observed altered localization of tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin 3, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and an increased dextran permeability of the CaCo2-AP1S1-KO monolayer. In addition, lumen formation in 3D cultures of these cells was abnormal. Re-expression of wild-type AP1S1 in CaCo2-AP1S1-KO cells reverted these abnormalities, while expression of AP1S1 containing either missense mutation did not. Our data indicate that loss of AP1S1 function causes an intestinal epithelial barrier defect, and that AP1S1 mutations can cause a non-syndromic form of congenital diarrhea, whereas 2 reported truncating AP1S1 mutations caused MEDNIK syndrome, characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia.","dc:creator":"Klee KMC","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"AP1S1 missense mutations cause a congenital enteropathy via an epithelial barrier defect."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue in AP1S1-KO Cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:c366146f-b353-46bb-89d6-355ff2068b03","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dadd1f53-21be-44dc-b830-6f7cf7148430","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Rescued animals grew to the same size at wt animals and had similar levels of skin pigmentation with no evidence of epithelial disorganization.

However, the tight-junction protein ZO-1 aberrantly accumulated a cell-cell contact sites, and was mislocalized basally (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained for the enterocyte-specific tight-junction marker claudin 3 (Fig. 4A-B). Steady-state expression levels were unaffected for both proteins (Fig. 4C).

MEDNIK syndrome is a very rare congenital disorder characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma (PMID: 24754424). Another common feature is copper metabolism defects, leading to reduced ceruloplasmin in the serum and liver copper overload (PMID: 31399000). These underlying defects in copper metabolism are consistent with the known role of *AP1S1* in mediating the intracellular trafficking of copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B (PMID: 31399000). \n\nTwo variants (one canonical splice site and one frameshift) that have been reported in six probands in four publications (PMID: 19057675, 23423674, 30244301, 32306098) are included in this curation. Minimal segregation evidence was available in these publications, and did not contribute to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, as all reported probands are homozygous for predicted/proven null alleles. *AP1S1* encodes the sigma 1A subunit of the AP-1 complex, which participates in intracellular trafficking by promoting the formation of clathrin coated vesicles (PMID:31399000). The sigma 1A subunit plays a role in cargo recognition, lipid recognition, and maintaining AP-1 complex stability. Therefore, loss of AP-1 leads to missorting of intracellular cargoes, particularly in polarized cells such as neurons and epithelial cells, where AP-1 specifically traffics proteins from the trans-Golgi network to basolateral domains of the plasma membrane.  \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by in vitro functional assays in both patient cells and a cell culture model, as well as a zebrafish model (PMID: 19057675, 23423674, 32306098). The ATP-dependent copper transporter ATP7A was found to be mislocalized in fibroblast cells from MEDNIK syndrome patients; in addition, the expression and function of cuproenzymes was disrupted in these cells. Transfection with a wild-type *AP1S1* expression construct rescued these defects, demonstrating the specific role of *AP1S1* (PMID:23433674). In an enterocyte cell culture model, loss of *AP1S1* function led to the missorting of tight-junction proteins, resulting in defective epithelial barrier formation (PMID: 32306098). Similar observations were made in the epidermis of zebrafish following treatment with an *AP1S1*-targeted morpholino (PMID:19057675). These animals also had a movement disorder due to interneuron loss, consistent with the phenotypes observed in MEDNIK syndrome patients. \n\nIn summary, *AP1S1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MEDNIK syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 10th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b9559de4-1945-47fa-bea5-336d376eec0e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
