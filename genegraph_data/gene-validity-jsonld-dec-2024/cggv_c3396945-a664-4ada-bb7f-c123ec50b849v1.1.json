In a family with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, we identified a missense mutation in POGLUT1 (protein O-glucosyltransferase 1), an enzyme involved in Notch posttranslational modification and function. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the mutation reduces O-glucosyltransferase activity on Notch and impairs muscle development. Muscles from patients revealed decreased Notch signaling, dramatic reduction in satellite cell pool and a muscle-specific α-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation not present in patients' fibroblasts. Primary myoblasts from patients showed slow proliferation, facilitated differentiation, and a decreased pool of quiescent PAX7+ cells. A robust rescue of the myogenesis was demonstrated by increasing Notch signaling. None of these alterations were found in muscles from secondary dystroglycanopathy patients. These data suggest that a key pathomechanism for this novel form of muscular dystrophy is Notch-dependent loss of satellite cells.","dc:creator":"Servián-Morilla E","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"A POGLUT1 mutation causes a muscular dystrophy with reduced Notch signaling and satellite cell loss."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c1f7e1b-7b84-4115-bc4b-bec3bdb0f7a9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c1f7e1b-7b84-4115-bc4b-bec3bdb0f7a9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":19,"allele":{"id":"cggv:fa9f3597-ab77-49fc-9d5c-d1b0962aa926","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152305.3(POGLUT1):c.547C>T (p.Arg183Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2554902"}},"detectionMethod":"DNA was extracted from blood using standard procedures and NGS technologies with variants confirmed via Sanger sequencing.

A biallelic mutation in the POGLUT1 gene has been reported in one family as the cause of an adult-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD R21; OMIM# 617232). As the result of a collaborative international effort, we have identified the first cohort of 15 patients with LGMD R21, from nine unrelated families coming from different countries, providing a reliable phenotype-genotype and mechanistic insight. Patients carrying novel mutations in POGLUT1 all displayed a clinical picture of limb-girdle muscle weakness. However, the age at onset was broadened from adult to congenital and infantile onset. Moreover, we now report that the unique muscle imaging pattern of \"inside-to-outside\" fatty degeneration observed in the original cases is indeed a defining feature of POGLUT1 muscular dystrophy. Experiments on muscle biopsies from patients revealed a remarkable and consistent decrease in the level of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain, reduction of the pool of satellite cells (SC), and evidence of α-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation. In vitro biochemical and cell-based assays suggested a pathogenic role of the novel POGLUT1 mutations, leading to reduced enzymatic activity and/or protein stability. The association between the POGLUT1 variants and the muscular phenotype was established by in vivo experiments analyzing the indirect flight muscle development in transgenic Drosophila, showing that the human POGLUT1 mutations reduced its myogenic activity. In line with the well-known role of the Notch pathway in the homeostasis of SC and muscle regeneration, SC-derived myoblasts from patients' muscle samples showed decreased proliferation and facilitated differentiation. Together, these observations suggest that alterations in SC biology caused by reduced Notch1 signaling result in muscular dystrophy in LGMD R21 patients, likely with additional contribution from α-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation. This study settles the muscular clinical phenotype linked to POGLUT1 mutations and establishes the pathogenic mechanism underlying this muscle disorder. The description of a specific imaging pattern of fatty degeneration and muscle pathology with a decrease of α-dystroglycan glycosylation provides excellent tools which will help diagnose and follow up LGMD R21 patients.","dc:creator":"Servián-Morilla E","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"POGLUT1 biallelic mutations cause myopathy with reduced satellite cells, α-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation and a distinctive radiological pattern."}},"rdfs:label":"SM2_9P"},{"id":"cggv:6ef6ea9c-981f-4114-a982-bd97c794c3b2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6ef6ea9c-981f-4114-a982-bd97c794c3b2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6ef6ea9c-981f-4114-a982-bd97c794c3b2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"R183W mutant showed similar expression levels but much lower enzymatic activity than WT POGLUT1 and expression of this mutant in Notch-disrupted Drosophilia did not resuce the phenotype nearly to the level of the WT"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9.2},{"id":"cggv:c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.6},{"id":"cggv:5f5255c7-3876-4730-b739-d31126fc0555_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f5255c7-3876-4730-b739-d31126fc0555","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":59,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c42c5cb7-980c-4053-b9a1-e1bb16edd67e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152305.3(POGLUT1):c.305G>T (p.Cys102Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2554799"}},"detectionMethod":"DNA was extracted from blood using standard procedures and NGS technologies with variants confirmed via Sanger sequencing.

KO1 had four stable clone lines each with 53-81% downregulation of POGLUT1, while KO2 had six with a smaller downregulation of 19-42%. Two clones that displayed the strongest downregulation (Pg-KD1 at 82%) and a moderated (Pg-KD2 at 42%). A separate knockdown of POFUT1 confirmed no effect on POGLUT1 expression and vice versa with all downexpressions confirmed at the protein level. In order to judge phenotypic consequences of the knockdowns, fluorescence microscopy showed earlier apparition of thicker and longer branched myotubes in Pg-KD1 compared to controls with agglomerated nuclei. Pg-KD2 showed similar differentiation, but closer to WT and much shorter. This demonstrates that the downregulation affects earlier fusion and decreases cell proliferation with the number of mononucleated cells. The myotube phenotypes were also affected dependent on the level of POGLUT1 downregulation, with much higher fusion being allowed in the Pg-KD1 and 2 lines than in WT controls. This suggests a defective regulation mechanism of myoblast fusion and resulting runaway phenotypes. Given that these abnormal phenotypes could result from alteration of the Notch signalling pathway, western blot for the active form of the Notch receptor showed strong detection in WT myoblasts but consistently lowered levels by 50-95% in the two downregulated lines. Downexpression of several other genes integral to Notch signalling, such as RBPJ, HES1, and HEY1, were also observed suggesting altered cell growth arrest functions and a mechansim for the observed early differentiation. Finally, the PAX7/MYOD expression balance was significantly reduced in the Pg-KD cell lines compared to the WT. This indicates a drastic decrease in reserve cell maintenance in combination with the premature and increased differentiation.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29634421","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (Poglut1) links O-glucose to epidermal growth factor-like repeats harboring the C1XSX(P/A)C2 consensus sequence. Poglut1 is a ubiquitous endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein largely found in metazoans, but only about 50 proteins possess this consensus sequence. Among them, Notch receptors have multiple O-glucosylation sites and their activation depends on this status. In adult skeletal muscle, Notch signaling contributes to the maintenance of satellite cell (SC) quiescence and the proliferation of myoblasts after SC activation. To address the role of Poglut1 in myogenesis, we created two stable C2C12 cell lines where Poglut1 was downexpressed by 42% and 81%, and assessed their ability to differentiate. We showed that Poglut1 knockdown reduced Notch signaling and largely affected the key regulators of myogenic differentiation, with PAX7 decrease and MYOD increase. This perturbed Pax7/MyoD expression balance led to a premature myogenic differentiation and an increase in myotube size, accentuated in case of strong Poglut1 downexpression. Differences observed between myotubes of the two Poglut1 knockdown cell lines could reflect dissimilar fusion defects. We concluded that Poglut1 contributes to myogenesis by regulating Notch signaling and defining, directly or indirectly, the proportion of cells that commit differentiation.","dc:creator":"Pélisse M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Protein O-Glucosyltransferase 1 Expression Influences Formation of Differentiated Myotubes in C2C12 Cell Line."},"rdfs:label":"POGLUT1 Downregulation Affects Myotube Formation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The functional alteration that this publication demonstrates is significant when considering the proposed pathogenic mechansim for LGMD (biallelic loss-of-function leading to reduced Notch signalling that affects skeletal muscle formation and regeneration).

LGMDR21 is typically characterized by young-adult onset of slowly progressive proximal upper and lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy. Additional phenotypes such as scapular winging, calf pseudohypertrophy, and contractures have been reported. A unique feature of \"inside to outside\" fatty degeneration has been observed in muscle biopsy in reported probands.  \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two separate disease entities for autosomal recessive limb-gridle muscular dystrophy-21 (OMIM: 617232) and dominant Dowling-Degos disease 4 (OMIM: 615696). \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 10.8 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 31897643, 27807076). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family members in Family 1 (PMID: 31897643). Primary mechanism of disease associated is loss of function as reported in the literature (PMID: 27807076).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 1 POINT. This gene-disease association is also supported by functional alteration in non-human cells (PMID: 29634421). A model constructed using C2C12 cultured mouse myoblasts demonstrated that POGLUT1 knockdown reduced Notch signaling, affecting key regulators of myogenic differentiation, including PAX7 decrease and MYOD increase. The perturbed Pax7/MyoD expression balance led to a premature myogenic differentiation and an increase in myotube size. This finding was pronounced in in response to strong POGLUT1 downexpression. Considering the proposed disease mechanism for LGMD is biallelic loss-of-function leading to reduced Notch signalling that affects skeletal muscle formation and regeneration, the functional alteration evidence seems to support the gene-disease relationship. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between POGLUT1 and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-21. This has been repeatedly\ndemonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on the meeting date of February 8th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
