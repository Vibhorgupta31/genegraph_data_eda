We describe five individuals who share phenotypically related CNS malformations and in some cases urinary tract defects, and also haploinsufficiency for the NFIA transcription factor gene due to chromosomal translocation or deletion. Two individuals have balanced translocations that disrupt NFIA. A third individual and two half-siblings in an unrelated family have interstitial microdeletions that include NFIA. All five individuals exhibit similar CNS malformations consisting of a thin, hypoplastic, or absent corpus callosum, and hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly. The majority of these individuals also exhibit Chiari type I malformation, tethered spinal cord, and urinary tract defects that include vesicoureteral reflux. Other genes are also broken or deleted in all five individuals, and may contribute to the phenotype. However, the only common genetic defect is NFIA haploinsufficiency. In addition, previous analyses of Nfia(-/-) knockout mice indicate that Nfia deficiency also results in hydrocephalus and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Further investigation of the mouse Nfia(+/-) and Nfia(-/-) phenotypes now reveals that, at reduced penetrance, Nfia is also required in a dosage-sensitive manner for ureteral and renal development. Nfia is expressed in the developing ureter and metanephric mesenchyme, and Nfia(+/-) and Nfia(-/-) mice exhibit abnormalities of the ureteropelvic and ureterovesical junctions, as well as bifid and megaureter. Collectively, the mouse Nfia mutant phenotype and the common features among these five human cases indicate that NFIA haploinsufficiency contributes to a novel human CNS malformation syndrome that can also include ureteral and renal defects.","dc:creator":"Lu W","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"NFIA haploinsufficiency is associated with a CNS malformation syndrome and urinary tract defects."},"rdfs:label":"NFIA important for development of CNS and ureteral systems"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8d5a5b89-8315-495a-b13d-448f9ba9c553_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:210a1e21-3981-4ae5-bec9-19f05bc2178a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72c14864-fa22-489d-b8dc-2c17af14abe9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This mouse model displayed many of the same brain malformations and urinary tract defects seen in human patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17530927","rdfs:label":"NFIA knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5887,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":12.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ca229b0c-aa71-4133-98b2-5e5629aaa670","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100478","gene":"hgnc:7784","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"NFIA was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant brain malformations with or without urinary tract defects in 2007 (Lu et al., PMID: 17530927). Most individuals present with some combination of agenesis of the corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or urinary tract defects. Seven variants (nonsense, frameshift, large deletion etc) that have been reported in seven probands in six publications (PMIDs: 22542183, 24462883, 27081522, 28941020, 32926563, 35080095) are included in this curation. The variants reported in this curation arose de novo as did most observed variants throughout the literature. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by demonstrated biochemical function, expression in relevant tissues, and a knockout mouse model (PMIDs: 10718198, 17530927, 26512640, 29247144). In summary, NFIA is definitively associated with autosomal dominant brain malformations with or without urinary tract defects. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 10/11/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8d5a5b89-8315-495a-b13d-448f9ba9c553"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
