This zinc finger protein also possesses the capacity to stimulate expression from a Pol II mRNA promoter. Here, we report a study on two human proteins, ZNF76 and ZNF143, that are 64 and 84% identical to their Xenopus counterpart, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 mRNAs were expressed in all normal adult tissues examined. By using in vivo and in vitro assays, we have analyzed the DNA binding capacities and transcriptional properties of ZNF76 and ZNF143. The binding affinities of ZNF76 and ZNF143 for Staf divergent responsive elements were determined by gel shift assays, which revealed that the two proteins bound a same DNA motif with similar affinities. Also, polypeptide sequences containing the seven zinc fingers of ZNF76 and ZNF143 could efficiently repress in vivo the activated transcription from an snRNA-type promoter. Transfection experiments in Drosophila cells showed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 can activate transcription from an mRNA promoter through the Staf binding site. Finally, chimeric ZNF76 and ZNF143 proteins, carrying a heterologous DNA binding domain, are able to activate a Pol II mRNA promoter and snRNA Pol II and Pol III promoters in Xenopus oocytes, through the heterologous DNA binding site. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ZNF76 and ZNF143 are two members of a same family of transactivator proteins. ZNF143 constitutes the human ortholog of the Xenopus Staf, and ZNF76 is a novel DNA binding protein related to Staf and ZNF143.","dc:creator":"Myslinski E","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"ZNF76 and ZNF143 are two human homologs of the transcriptional activator Staf."},"rdfs:label":"ZNF143 transcription factor activity "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downscored due to low specificity of the evidence to the cobalamin pathway.

As a transcription factor in the cobalamin (vitamin B12) pathway, *ZNF143* dysfunction results in inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism. Patients with MMA-HCU experience developmental delays, seizure, feeding difficulties, anemia, ocular manifestations, and failure to thrive among other phenotypes (PMID:9266389). Other forms of methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria have been classified into complementation groups including cblC, cblD, cblF, cblX, cblJ (PMID:29862147). \n\n2 variants (1 missense, 1 nonsense) that were reported in 1 proband (PMIDs: 27349184) were included in this curation. A 16-month old Hispanic male was reported to have a variety of severe phenotypes including developmental abnormalities, infantile spasms with intractable epilepsy, combined immunodeficiency, hearing loss, cortical blindness, and prolonged QT intervals. The proband’s lab values showed elevated urinary methylmalonic acid, increased serum methylmalonic acid, and increased serum total homocysteine which are consistent with MMA-HCU. Somatic cell analysis in patient fibroblasts complemented multiple groups including cblC, cblF, cblX, clbD, and cblJ. Whole exome sequencing revealed two variants,  c.851T>G (p.Leu284Ter) and  c.1019C>T (p.Thr340Ile), as well as a balanced inversion (46, XY, inv (5) (p14.2p15.1)). The proband had a normal microarray, and the balanced inversion was also present in the proband’s unaffected father. In patient fibroblasts, MMACHC expression was absent (PMID:27349184). No other probands with notable *ZNF143* dysfunction were reported in the literature in association with MMA-HCU. The mechanism of pathogenicity is predicted to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical evidence, functional alteration assays, model systems, and rescue experiments (PMIDs: 33845046, 9009278, 22268977, 22268977, 27349184, 27349184). First, *ABCD4* encodes a protein with a similar function, as it is a transporter in the cobalamin metabolism pathway. *ABCD4* is implicated in a similar disease, methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria type cblJ, and was classified as moderate by the General IEM GCEP (PMID:33845046). Next, *ZNF143* activates transcription of mRNA promoters when transfected into *Drosophila* cells. This demonstrates the biochemical function of *ZNF143* as a transcription factor (PMID:9705341) and aligns with its predicted role as an activator of *MMACHC* expression. Functional alteration in non-patient cells was observed when *MMACHC* expression was significantly reduced in control fibroblasts treated with *ZNF143* siRNA knockdown (PMID:27349184). In patient fibroblasts, a higher percentage of transcobalamin (TC) bound Cbl was found in subcellular compartments (ex.lysosomes, mitochondria) rather than cytoplasmic compartments compared to controls (PMID:27349184). GTEx analysis showed that *ZNF143* is expressed in almost all tissues, which is consistent with its role as a transcription factor. Although this evidence was evaluated for expression evidence A, it was not scored due to lack of specificity in tissue type. Finally, Halbig et al. created a zebrafish model using morpholino knockdown of *ZNF143*. The zebrafish demonstrated a variety of developmental abnormalities also seen in human MMA-HCU patients such as structural abnormalities within the heart, ear, and brain. The developmental abnormalities were rescued by injecting a wildtype copy of zebrafish *ZNF143* mRNA (PMID: 22268977). \n\nIn summary, *ZNF143* is moderately associated with autosomal recessive methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. Additional case reports will be required to reach a higher classification of this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism on the meeting date 12/8/2023 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d2961595-2f51-45d6-af4d-988ec5a7628a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
