This family consists of four members: Cadm4/Necl4 and Cadm1/Necl2 are found in both glia and axons, whereas Cadm2/Necl3 and Cadm3/Necl1 are expressed by sensory and motor neurons. By generating mice lacking each of the Cadm genes, we now demonstrate that Cadm4 plays a role in the establishment of the myelin unit in the peripheral nervous system. Mice lacking Cadm4 (PGK-Cre/Cadm4(fl/fl)), but not Cadm1, Cadm2, or Cadm3, develop focal hypermyelination characterized by tomacula and myelin outfoldings, which are the hallmark of several Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies. The absence of Cadm4 also resulted in abnormal axon-glial contact and redistribution of ion channels along the axon. These neuropathological features were also found in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Cadm4 lacking its cytoplasmic domain in myelinating glia Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT), as well as in mice lacking Cadm4 specifically in Schwann cells (DHH-Cre/Cadm4(fl/fl)). Consistent with these abnormalities, both PGK-Cre/Cadm4(fl/fl) and Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice exhibit impaired motor function and slower nerve conduction velocity. These findings indicate that Cadm4 regulates the growth of the myelin unit and the organization of the underlying axonal membrane.

Previous studies have suggested that NF number as well as the phosphorylation state of the COOH-terminal tail of the heavy neurofilament (NF-H) subunit are major determinants of axonal caliber. We created NF-H knockout mice to assess the contribution of NF-H to the development of axon size as well as its effect on the amounts of low and mid-sized NF subunits (NF-L and NF-M respectively). Surprisingly, we found that NF-L levels were reduced only slightly whereas NF-M and tubulin proteins were unchanged in NF-H-null mice. However, the calibers of both large and small diameter myelinated axons were diminished in NF-H-null mice despite the fact that these mice showed only a slight decrease in NF density and that filaments in the mutant were most frequently spaced at the same interfilament distance found in control. Significantly, large diameter axons failed to develop in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. These results demonstrate directly that unlike losing the NF-L or NF-M subunits, loss of NF-H has only a slight effect on NF number in axons.

In silico aggregation prediction suggested the terminal 20 residues of the altered NEFH to be amyloidogenic, which we confirmed experimentally by serial deletion analysis. The presence of this amyloidogenic motif fused to NEFH caused prominent and toxic protein aggregates in transfected cells and disrupted motor neurons in zebrafish. We identified a similar aggregation-inducing mechanism in NEFL (neurofilament light) and FUS (fused in sarcoma), in which mutations are known to cause aggregation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, respectively.

However, the clinical spectrum of this condition and the physio-pathological pathway remain to be delineated. We report 12 patients from two French families with axonal dominantly inherited form of CMT caused by two new mutations in the NEFH gene. A remarkable feature was the early involvement of proximal muscles of the lower limbs associated with pyramidal signs in some patients. Nerve conduction velocity studies indicated a predominantly motor axonal neuropathy. Unique deletions of two nucleotides causing frameshifts near the end of the NEFH coding sequence were identified: in family 1, c.3008_3009del (p.Lys1003Argfs*59), and in family 2 c.3043_3044del (p.Lys1015Glyfs*47). Both frameshifts lead to 40 additional amino acids translation encoding a cryptic amyloidogenic element. Consistently, we show that these mutations cause protein aggregation which are recognised by the autophagic pathway in motoneurons and triggered caspase 3 activation leading to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Using electroporation of chick embryo spinal cord, we confirm that NEFH mutants form aggregates in vivo and trigger apoptosis of spinal cord neurons.

Therefore, this study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the NEFH mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness.","dc:creator":"Nam DE","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy concurrent with distal and proximal weakness by translational elongation of the 3' UTR in NEFH."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28544463","rdfs:label":"II-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2a1ca558-9f24-4a46-ae02-45c0ee9297c5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b384304e-65de-4de0-9bce-c0ffd9da6096","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Lower limb muscle weakness \nUpper limb muscle weakness","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003484","obo:HP_0007340"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2a1ca558-9f24-4a46-ae02-45c0ee9297c5_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4e11073b-eca8-4d15-a30f-a2f7a6054141","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021076.4(NEFH):c.3043_3044del (p.Lys1015GlyfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA923726240"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28709447"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28709447","rdfs:label":"II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1281,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7d1bfa82-d6b1-4134-9dce-f2035edc06ec","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014836","gene":"hgnc:7737","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"NEFH was first reported to be associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 in 2016 (Rebelo et al., PMID:27040688). This gene has also been implicated as a risk factor in ALS. NEFH encodes for the neurofilament heavy chain, a key component of neurofilaments, essential for the formation of cytoskeleton in neurons. Clinical features of patients with NEFH mutations include sensorimotor axonal neuropathy mainly characterized by distal lower limbs motor deficit with early and prominent involvement of proximal hip muscles. Additional common features include muscle cramps and increased creatine kinase level. All reported cases have frameshift mutations that cluster at the c-terminus end of the protein. Mutations result in loss of the stop codon and translation of the 3‚Äô-UTR. NEFH mutants carry a sequence extension of 45 extra amino acids, containing an amyloidogenic motif referred as cryptic amyloidogenic element of the 3‚Äô-UTR (CAE). This type of variant has been reported in 4 additional publications (PMIDs: 28709447, 28544463, 29587262, 30992180). NEFH physically interacts with NEFL, also a known CMT gene, forming neurofilament structures. The NEFH knockout mouse model showed diminished calibers of large myelinated axons in both central and peripheral nervous systems (Eder et at, PMID: 976343). Expression of frameshift mutants in cultured cells resulted in accumulation of prominent perinuclear aggregates, disrupted neurofilaments structures and cell toxicity (PMID:27040688). Expression of NEFH mutants in zebrafish resulted in abnormal motor neurons with truncated axons. A zebrafish rescue experiment showed that the WT human NEFH mRNA can rescue the morpholino injected fish, however, NEFH frameshift mutants were not able to rescue the phenotype (PMID:28544463). Expression of CMT-NEFH mutations in chick embryos resulted in neurofilament aggregates in the soma of neurons leading to neuronal cell death. Aggregates stain positive for activated caspase 3 and the autophagy marker p62 (Jacquier et al., PMID: 28709447). In summary, NEFH genetic and functional evidence was classified as DEFINITIVE.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8e1390ea-fd6c-4fa4-9b43-0eccff9e2829"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
