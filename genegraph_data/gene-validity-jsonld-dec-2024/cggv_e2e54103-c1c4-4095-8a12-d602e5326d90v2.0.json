At least 5 unique variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of Case-Level and Experimental data: 4.2 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 25041077, 21263211, 28993341, 17426099). An in vitro functional assay provided evidence that one variant slightly reduces repression of insulin promoter activity (PMID 17426099). \n\nLaver et al (PMID: 3510838) reported a lack of enrichment of ultra-rare (MAF<6x10-6) protein-truncating and missense variants in *BLK*, *PAX4*, and *KLF11* in a large cohort of cases with suspected MODY (n=1227) compared to population cohort (UK Biobank =185,898), gnomADv2 and gnomADv3. They also showed a similar lack of enrichment of protein-truncating variants of any frequency in *BLK*, *PAX4*, and *KLF11* in the MODY cohort. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support, and there appears to be strong evidence to contradict the *PAX4*-monogenic diabetes relationship that warrants refuting the association (originally asserted as maturity-onset diabetes of the young 9, MODY9, MIM: 612225).  \n\n*PAX4* variants may play a role in susceptibility to polygenic type 2 diabetes (MIM: 125853) and have also been described in relation to susceptibility to an atypical presentation of non-autoimmune diabetes sometimes referred to as “ketosis-prone diabetes” (KPD, MIM: 612227), neither of which will be curated at this time since the contribution would be in the form of common variants with a small effect and moreover, evidence is limited.\n\nAt the Diabetes UK Professional Conference 2018, Laver et al reported variants in BLK, PAX4, and KLF11 published as pathogenic having a higher frequency in gnomAD than the population frequency of MODY (>0.8% vs. ~0.01%, p < 0.0001), as well as a higher frequency of LoF variants in these genes in gnomAD than the population frequency of MODY. They also reported that rare variants (< 0.002%) in PAX4 were not enriched in a cohort of 594 individuals who underwent testing based on suspicion of MODY compared with gnomAD (1.5% vs. 1.3%) (https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.2_13570: A15).\n\nUpdate 12/13/2022:  An expansion of this work has now been published (PMID: 3510838) and summary has been updated with the citation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e2e54103-c1c4-4095-8a12-d602e5326d90"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
