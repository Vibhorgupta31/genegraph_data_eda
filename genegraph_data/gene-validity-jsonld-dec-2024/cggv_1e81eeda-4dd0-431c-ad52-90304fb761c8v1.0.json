In this study we report on the mutational analysis of the WFS1 coding region in 19 Italian WS patients and 25 relatives, using a DHPLC-based protocol. A total of 19 different mutations in WFS1 were found in 18 of 19 patients (95%). All these mutations, except one, are novel, preferentially located in WFS1 exon 8, and include deletions, insertions, duplications, and nonsense and missense changes. In particular, a 16 base-pair deletion in WFS1 codon 454 was detected in five different unrelated nuclear families, being the most prevalent alteration in this Italian group.

The WFS1 gene encodes wolframin, a putative multispanning membrane glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum. The function of wolframin is completely unknown. In order to characterize wolframin, we have generated polyclonal antibodies against both hydrophilic termini of the protein. Wolframin was found to be ubiquitously expressed with highest levels in brain, pancreas, heart and insulinoma beta-cell lines. Analysis of the structural features provides experimental evidence that wolframin contains nine transmembrane segments and is embedded in the membrane in an N(cyt)/C(lum) topology. Wolframin assembles into higher molecular weight complexes of approximately 400 kDa in the membrane. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that during maturation wolframin is N-glycosylated but lacks proteolytical processing. Moreover, N-glycosylation appears to be essential for the biogenesis and stability of wolframin. Here we investigate, for the first time, the molecular mechanisms that cause loss-of-function of wolframin in affected individuals. In patients harboring nonsense mutations complete absence of the mutated wolframin is caused by instability and rapid decay of WFS1 nonsense transcripts. In a patient carrying a compound heterozygous missense mutation, R629W, we found markedly reduced steady-state levels of wolframin. Pulse-chase experiments of mutant wolframin expressed in COS-7 cells indicated that the R629W mutation leads to instability and strongly reduced half-life of wolframin. Thus, the Wolfram syndrome in patients investigated here is caused by reduced protein dosage rather than dysfunction of the mutant wolframin.","dc:creator":"Hofmann S","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Wolfram syndrome: structural and functional analyses of mutant and wild-type wolframin, the WFS1 gene product."},"rdfs:label":"Hofmann Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This suggests decreased protein dosage rather than functional defect or GOF cause WS.

Furthermore, isolated islets from mutant mice exhibited increased apoptosis, as assessed by DNA fragment formation, at high concentration of glucose or with exposure to endoplasmic reticulum-stress inducers.

Electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were performed in Wfs1-/- and Wfs1+/+ mice at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Fundi were pictured with Micron III apparatus. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) abundance was determined from Brn3a immunolabeling of retinal sections. RGC axonal loss was quantified by electron microscopy in transversal optic nerve sections. Endoplasmic reticulum stress was assessed using immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (Ire1α) markers. Electroretinograms amplitudes were slightly reduced and latencies increased with time in Wfs1-/- mice. Similarly, VEPs showed decreased N+P amplitudes and increased N-wave latency. Analysis of unfolded protein response signaling revealed an activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress in Wfs1-/- mutant mouse retinas. Altogether, progressive VEPs alterations with minimal neuronal cell loss suggest functional alteration of the action potential in the Wfs1-/- optic pathways.

This association was made using case-level data. For the purpose of this curation, 9​ variants (missense, in-frame del, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Association is seen in at least 7 probands in 4 publications (12754709, 16151413, 21446023, 21602428). Many more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. A meta-analysis was performed by de Heredia et al. 2013, of published Wolfram syndrome cases from 1998 to 2013 (23429432). This gene-disease association is supported by a homozygous null WFS1 mouse model and relevant expression studies. Of note, this gene has been separately curated for its association with autosomal dominant disease. In summary, WFS1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Wolfram syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss​ Working Group on 4/17/18.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1e81eeda-4dd0-431c-ad52-90304fb761c8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
