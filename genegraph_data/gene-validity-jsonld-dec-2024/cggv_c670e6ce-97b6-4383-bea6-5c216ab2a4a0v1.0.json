We hypothesized that CLOVES syndrome would be caused by a somatic mutation arising during early embryonic development. Therefore, we employed massively parallel sequencing to search for somatic mosaic mutations in fresh, frozen, or fixed archival tissue from six affected individuals. We identified mutations in PIK3CA in all six individuals, and mutant allele frequencies ranged from 3% to 30% in affected tissue from multiple embryonic lineages. Interestingly, these same mutations have been identified in cancer cells, in which they increase phosphoinositide-3-kinase activity. We conclude that CLOVES is caused by postzygotic activating mutations in PIK3CA. The application of similar sequencing strategies will probably identify additional genetic causes for sporadically occurring, nonheritable malformations.","dc:creator":"Kurek

Here, we show that three prevalent mutants of p110alpha, E542K, E545K, and H1047R, are oncogenic in vivo. They induce tumors in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo and cause hemangiosarcomas in the animal. These tumors are marked by increased angiogenesis and an activation of the Akt pathway. The target of rapamycin inhibitor RAD001 blocks tumor growth induced by the H1047R p110alpha mutant.

We generated mouse models expressing the most common activating Pik3ca mutations (H1047R and E545K) in developing neural progenitors. These accurately recapitulate all the key human pathological features including brain enlargement, cortical malformation, hydrocephalus and epilepsy, with phenotypic severity dependent on the mutant allele and its time of activation. Underlying mechanisms include increased proliferation, cell size and altered white matter. Notably, we demonstrate that acute 1 hr-suppression of PI3K signaling despite the ongoing presence of dysplasia has dramatic anti-epileptic benefit.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Multiple recurrent variants have been identified in this gene, and functional testing in patient cell lines support a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Additional experimental studies have been done on non-patient derived cells that support a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, CLAPO syndrome, somatic (OMIM: 613089), CLOVE syndrome, somatic (OMIM: 612918), Cowden syndrome 5 (615108), Macrodactyly, somatic (602501), AND Megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria syndrome, somatic (602501). The phenotypic spectrum is largely due to what tissue(s) the variant affects.  In summary, PIK3CA has been definitively associated with overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 05/25/2021 (SOP 8).
