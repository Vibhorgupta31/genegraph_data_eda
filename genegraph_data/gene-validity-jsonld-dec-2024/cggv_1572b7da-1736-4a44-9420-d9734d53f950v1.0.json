Cell lines from all three patients were negative by northern blotting, though trace MS mRNA could be detected by means of phosphorimage analysis. Reverse transcriptase-PCR, SSCP, and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed four mutations. All were functionally null, creating either a frameshift with a downstream stop codon or an insert containing an internal stop codon. Of the two mutations found in the siblings, one of them, intervening sequence (IVS)-166A-->G, generates a cryptic donor splice site at position -166 of an intron beginning after Leu113, resulting in a 165-bp insertion of intronic sequence at junction 339/340. The second is a 2-bp deletion, 2112delTC.

In cblG, mutations in methionine synthase (MTR) decrease conversion of hydroxocobalaminÂ  (HOCbl) to methylcobalamin, while in cblC, mutations in MMACHC disrupt formation of cob(II)alamin (detected as HOCbl). Cases with undetectable methionine synthase (MS) activity are extremely rare and classified as 'cblG-variant'. In four 'cblG-variant' cases, we observed a decreased conversion of cyanocobalamin to HOCbl that is also seen in cblC cases. To explore this observation, we studied the gene defects, splicing products and expression of MS, as well as MS/MMACHC protein interactions in cblG-variant, cblG, cblC and control fibroblasts. We observed a full-size MS encoded by MTR-001 and a 124 kDa truncated MS encoded by MTR-201 in cblG, cblC, control fibroblasts and HEK cells, but only the MTR-201 transcript and inactive truncated MS in cblG-variant cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay showed interaction between truncated MS and MMACHC in cblG-variant cells. This interaction decreased 2.2, 1.5 and 5.0-fold in the proximity ligation assay of cblC cells with p.R161Q and p.R206W mutations, and HEK cells with knock down expression of MS by siRNA, respectively, when compared with control cells. In 3D modelling and docking analysis, both truncated and full-size MS provide a loop anchored to MMACHC, which makes contacts with R-161 and R-206 residues.

To investigate the molecular basis of the disorder, we have characterized the structure of the MTR gene, thereby identifying exon-intron boundaries. This enabled amplification of each of the 33 exons of the gene, from genomic DNA from a panel of 21 patients with cblG. Thirteen novel mutations were identified. These included five deletions (c.12-13delGC, c.381delA, c.2101delT, c.2669-2670delTG, and c.2796-2800delAAGTC) and two nonsense mutations (R585X and E1204X) that would result in synthesis of truncated proteins that lack portions critical for enzyme function. One mutation was identified that resulted in conversion of A to C of the invariant A of the 3' splice site of intron 9. Five missense mutations (A410P, S437Y, S450H, H595P, and I804T) were identified. The latter mutations, as well as the splice-site mutation, were not detected in a panel of 50 anonymous DNA samples, suggesting that these sequence changes are not polymorphisms present in the general population. In addition, a previously described missense mutation, P1173L, was detected in 16 patients in an expanded panel of 24 patients with cblG. Analysis of haplotypes constructed using sequence polymorphisms identified within the MTR gene demonstrated that this mutation, a C-->T transition in a CpG island, has occurred on at least two separate genetic backgrounds.","dc:creator":"Watkins D","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Hyperhomocysteinemia due to methionine synthase deficiency, cblG: structure of the MTR gene, genotype diversity, and recognition of a common mutation, P1173L."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12068375","rdfs:label":"WG1321"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This patient, with cblG disorder, is compound heterozygous for a missense variant, p.Pro1173Leu, and a frameshift variant in MTR.

Using biochemical approaches we demonstrate that one cblG patient has greatly reduced levels of methionine synthase while in another, the enzyme is specifically impaired in the reductive activation cycle. The biochemical data suggested that low levels of methionine synthase activity in the first patient may result from mutations in the catalytic domains of the enzyme, reduced transcription, or generation of unstable message or protein. Using Northern analysis, we demonstrate that the molecular basis for the biochemical phenotype in this patient is associated with greatly diminished steady-state levels of methionine synthase mRNA. The biochemical data on the second patient cell line implicated mutations specific to reductive activation, a function that is housed in the C-terminal AdoMet-binding domain and the intermediate B12-binding domain, in the highly homologous bacterial enzyme. We have detected two mutations in a compound heterozygous state, one that results in conversion of a conserved proline (1173) to a leucine residue and the other a deletion of an isoleucine residue (881). The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli MS predicts that the Pro to Leu mutation could disrupt activation since it is embedded in a sequence that makes direct contacts with the bound AdoMet. Deletion of isoleucine in the B12-binding domain would result in shortening of a beta-sheet. Our data provide the first evidence for mutations in the methionine synthase gene being culpable for the cblG phenotype. In addition, they suggest directly that mutations in methionine synthase can lead to elevated homocysteine, implicated both in neural tube defects and in cardiovascular diseases.","dc:creator":"Gulati S","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Defects in human methionine synthase in cblG patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8968736","rdfs:label":"WG1892"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This individual, with a cobalamin disorder (cblG) is compound heterozygous for p.Pro1173Leu and p.Ile881del) in MTR.

Functional methionine synthase deficiency can be separated into two classes, cobalamin (Cbl) deficiency type E (CblE) and type G (CblG), which are the result of mutations that affect methionine synthase reductase or methionine synthase, respectively. Deficiency of methionine synthase activity may result in megaloblastic anemia without methylmalonic aciduria and neuromuscular abnormality of varying severity. Delayed milestones, ataxia, cerebral atrophy, muscular hypotonia, neonatal seizures, and blindness have been reported as the associated clinical findings. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for a more favorable diagnosis of the affected cases. Herein we report a three-month-old boy with CblG disease who presented with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, feeding intolerance, oral ulcers, microcephaly and hypotonia, and showed a dramatic response to treatment. In the first few months of life, megaloblastic anemia accompanied by apparent neurological involvement should direct physicians to order examinations like measurement of total homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels to detect possible forms of inherited Cbl intracellular metabolism disorders.","dc:creator":"Kasapkara Ã‡S","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"An infant with an extremely rare cobalamin disorder: Methionine synthase deficiency and importance of early diagnosis and treatment."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31951343","rdfs:label":"Case report"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This individual with homocystinuria and clinical symptoms of cblG is homozygous for a missense variant in MTR, p.Pro1173Leu.

Our goal is to further characterize the interactions of MS with other potential partners in a so-called MS interactome. We dissected the interactions and their alterations by co-immunoprecipitation and DuoLink proximity ligation assays in fibroblasts with cblG, cblE, and cblC genetic defects affecting respectively the expression of MS, methionine synthase reductase (MSR) and MMACHC and in HepG2 cells transfected with corresponding siRNAs. We observed the known interactions of MS with MSR and with MMACHC as well as MMADHC with MMACHC, but we also observed novel interactions for MSR with MMACHC and with MMADHC and MS with MMADHC. Furthermore, we show that the absence of MS or MMACHC expression disrupts the interactions between the other interactome members, in cblC and cblG fibroblasts and in HepG2 cells transfected with siRNAs. Our data show that the processing of Cbl in cytoplasm occurs in a multiprotein complex composed of at least MS, MSR, MMACHC and MMADHC, which could contribute to shuttle safely and efficiently Cbl towards MS. Our data suggest that defective protein-protein interactions among key players of this pathway could contribute to the molecular mechanisms of the cblC, cblG and cblE genetic defects and provide novel insights into our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited disorders of Cbl metabolism.","dc:creator":"Bassila C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Methionine synthase and methionine synthase reductase interact with MMACHC and with MMADHC."},"rdfs:label":"MS interaction with MMADHC and MSR"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score is increased because this study supports the physical interaction of MS with 2 proteins known to be involved in cobalamin metabolism and which result in homocystinuria if deficient."},{"id":"cggv:8dfb854b-8ba3-4cef-ba57-28a288de8084","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:69a4b442-81b4-4cb1-b55d-22932569121d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Using co-immunoprecipitation and quantification of the protein â€“protein interactions with the proximity ligation assay (PLA), methionine synthase was shown to interact with MMACHC in control fibroblasts and in fibroblasts from four cblG-variant cases (i.e. with no methionine synthase activity), one cblG case and two cblC cases  (Fig. 4B).

This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, generating tetrahydrofolate and methionine. Human patients with methionine synthase deficiency exhibit homocysteinemia, homocysteinuria, and hypomethioninemia. They suffer from megaloblastic anemia with or without some degree of neural dysfunction and mental retardation. To better study the pathophysiology of methionine synthase deficiency, we utilized gene-targeting technology to inactivate the methionine synthase gene in mice. On average, heterozygous knockout mice from an outbred background have slightly elevated plasma homocysteine and methionine compared to wild-type mice but seem to be otherwise indistinguishable. Homozygous knockout embryos survive through implantation but die soon thereafter. Nutritional supplementation during pregnancy was unable to rescue embryos that were completely deficient in methionine synthase. Whether any human patients with methionine synthase deficiency have a complete absence of enzyme activity is unclear.

MTR encodes methionine synthase (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocystine S-methyltransferase) which catalyzes the transmethylation of homocysteine by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to give methionine and tetrahydrofolate. Individuals with bilalleic variants in MTR, resulting in loss of function of methionine synthase, usually present in infancy with hematological abnormalities, muscular hypotonia, and neurocognitive impairment. Some patients present with impaired consciousness, seizures, or visual impairment (Huemer et al, 2015, PMID 25526710; Sloan et al, 2018, PMID 20301503). Variants in MTR were first reported in patients with methylcobalamin deficiency type cblG in 1996 (Gulati et al, PMID 8968736; Leclerc et al, PMID 8968737). Data from 23 probands, who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for MTR variants, were curated. This curation includes 30 unique variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, splice site, intronic) from 8 publications (Gulati et al, 1996, PMID 8968736; Wilson et al, 1998, PMID 9683607; Watkins et al, 2002, PMID 12068375; Fofou-Caillierez et al, 2013, PMID 23825108; Huemer et al, 2015, PMID 25526710; Vaisbich et al, 2017, PMID 28210839; Kasapkara et al, 2019, PMID 31951343; Liu et al, 2019, PMID 30651581). One variant, p.Pro1173Leu, was found in 66% of alleles in 24 patients in one study, with evidence showing that the variant has arisen more than once (PMID: 12068375). More data is available in the literature but the maximum points for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nThe gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of the product of MTR, methionine synthase, which is consistent with the biochemical features in patients with methylcobalamin deficiency type cblG (Loughlin et al, 1964, PMID 14216440; Banerjee et al, 1990, PMID 2407589; Watkins et al, 2011, PMID 21312325); evidence supporting interaction with other proteins involved in cobalamin metabolism and associated with homocystinuria when deficient, including MMACHC, MMADHC, and MTRR (Fofou-Caillierez et al, 2013, PMID 23825108; Bassila et al, 2017, PMID 27771510), and the findings in an Mtr knock-out mouse model (Swanson et al, PMID 11158293)\nIn summary, MTR is definitively associated with methylcobalamin deficiency type cblG. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 2, 2021.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1572b7da-1736-4a44-9420-d9734d53f950"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
