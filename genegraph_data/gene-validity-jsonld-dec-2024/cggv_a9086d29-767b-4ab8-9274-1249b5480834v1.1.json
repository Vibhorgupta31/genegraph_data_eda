Enzyme activities in cultured fibroblasts from 10 of the patients were assayed, and they ranged from 0 to 13 % of controls analyzed in parallel.

In the present paper, we report an expression study of several mutant CBS enzymes in Escherichia coli, i.e., R121H, G148R, G151R, S217F, H232D, R266G, 1591delTTCG, and K441X. All of the mutants except K441X exhibited severely decreased activity, and the capability to form tetramers of most mutants was severely impaired. The K441X mutant, on the other hand, exhibited relatively high activity (63% of the wild type activity). This was probably due to two factors. First, the high abundance of the full-length CBS protein, a likely K441Q mutant, which was produced through suppression of the amber termination codon by glutamine tRNA in E. coli. And second, the presence of a C-terminally truncated protein, which was previously shown to be constitutively activated. Patient-derived lymphocytes, however, showed no detectable CBS subunits. As previously hypothesized, the increased aggregation of mutant CBS subunits might be a common pathogenic mechanism in CBS deficiency.","dc:creator":"Katsushima F","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Expression study of mutant cystathionine beta-synthase found in Japanese patients with homocystinuria."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16307898","rdfs:label":"Patient 11"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for a missense variant, p.Arg121Cys.

All available members of the family underwent comprehensive medical examinations. Genomic DNA was collected from peripheral blood of all the participants. The coding sequence of CBS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by direct DNA sequencing. Among all the family members, three affected individuals showed typical clinical features of homocystinuria. Two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the CBS gene, c.407T > C (p. L136P) and c.473C > T (p.A158V), were identified by sequencing analysis in this family. Both of the two missense mutations were detected in the three patients. Other available normal individuals, including the patients' parents, grand parents, her younger sister and brother in this family either carried one of the two mutations, or none. In addition, the two mutations were not found in 600 ethnically matched normal controls.

In this article, we report four novel missense mutations in the CBS gene: 172C-->T (R58W) linked in cis with A114V; 376A-->G (M126V); 904G-->A (E302K); and 1006C-->T (R336C). The CBS activity of the corresponding mutant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli was greatly diminished, confirming the pathogenicity of these mutations. Western analysis showed that the R58W+A114V and M126V mutant enzymes were unstable in E. coli, while the E302K subunits were partially degraded to shorter products. Using site-directed mutagenesis we found that CBS containing either the R58W or A114V as the only mutations demonstrated 18% and 46% of normal activity, respectively. Both mutant forms of CBS were stable in E. coli. When these two mutations were expressed in cis, the resultant mutant protein exhibited activity 1.3% that of a control. All these in vitro results were in good agreement with the clinical manifestation in these patients. The Italian patient 2241, an A114V+R58W/M126V compound heterozygote, exhibited severe pyridoxine nonresponsive homocystinuria, while another Italian patient 2242, with an A114V/E302K genotype, responded to pyridoxine treatment and had a much milder phenotype. The third patient 3064, an English compound heterozygote for two severe mutations R336C and G307S, was B6 nonresponsive. This report of a ninth homocystinuric allele carrying two mutations in cis raises the possibility that double mutant alleles may be underestimated in homocystinuric patients. In this context, a search for additional mutations in cis may sometimes be necessary to establish a good genotype-phenotype relationship.","dc:creator":"de Franchis R","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Four novel mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase gene: effect of a second linked mutation on the severity of the homocystinuric phenotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10408774","rdfs:label":"2241"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The score is reduced due to lack of biochemical testing details such as plasma homocystine and methionine levels.

This phenotype can be rescued by expression of wild-type human CBS protein. The authors report two experimentally generated CBS variants, both of which lead to a C-terminal truncation of about 25% of the protein, and which restore the function of 8 out of 9 human CBS missense variants when expressed in cis in yeast lacking CBS. The activity of these C-terminal truncation variants was 10 x normal suggesting that the C terminus of CBS acts as a negative regulator of enzyme activity. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) is known to be an activator of CBS. A tenfold increase in enzyme activity with AdoMet was observed for wild-type CBS but only a minor increase was seen for truncated wild-type CBS. A pathogenic variant, p.D444N, abolishes AdoMet-stimulation of CBS in vitro. These observations are consistent with the C-terminal domain being required for Ado Met regulation. This work not only demonstrates the function of CBS, as indicated by enzyme assays demonstrating conversion of homocystine to cysteine, and the requirement for cysteine in yeast lacking CBS, but also elucidates the molecular mechanism involved in patients with homocystinuria caused by CBS deficiency; showing that some missense variants have problems with activation rather than lack of catalytic activity. The authors suggest the possibility pharmacological therapies that could disrupt the ability of the C-terminal fragment to inhibit catalytic activity.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9590298","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) are known to cause homocystinuria, a recessive disorder characterized by excessive levels of total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma. The primary cause of mortality is thromboembolism induced by the excessive tHcy levels. Mild increases in tHcy levels are a significant risk factor in the development of vascular disease in the general population. This can result from heterozygosity at the CBS locus or polymorphic variation in other enzymes involved in homocysteine re-methylation. We report here that a mutation which deletes the carboxy-terminal 145 amino acids of CBS can functionally suppress the phenotype of several CBS mutant alleles found in homocystinurics when expressed in yeast. This C-terminal domain of CBS acts to inhibit enzymatic activity and is in turn regulated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a positive effector of CBS. Our results indicate that most mutations found in homocystinurics do not cause dysfunction of the catalytic domain, but rather interfere with the activation of the enzyme. These findings suggest a new drug target to treat homocystinuria and homocysteine-related vascular disease.","dc:creator":"Shan X","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Correction of disease-causing CBS mutations in yeast."},"rdfs:label":"Yeast auxotroph studies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3f987bfd-9e72-4c85-9fb3-3254f0ac6a24","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0efec4a9-6155-4f5e-8ea5-090b564fb854","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Seven missense variants (p.H65R, p.A114V, p.K102N, p.R125Q, p.R266K, p.I278T and p.R369C) were expressed in CHO-K1 cells.

Previous experiments in bacterial and yeast cells showed that many mutant CBS enzymes misfold and that chemical chaperones enable proper folding of a number of mutations. In the present study, we tested the extent of misfolding of 27 CBS mutations previously tested in E. coli under the more folding-permissive conditions of mammalian CHO-K1 cells and the ability of chaperones to rescue the conformation of these mutations. Expression of mutations in mammalian cells increased the median activity 16-fold and the amount of tetramers 3.2-fold compared with expression in bacteria. Subsequently, we tested the responses of seven selected mutations to three compounds with chaperone-like activity. Aminooxyacetic acid and 4-phenylbutyric acid exhibited only a weak effect. In contrast, heme arginate substantially increased the formation of mutant CBS protein tetramers (up to sixfold) and rescued catalytic activity (up to ninefold) of five out of seven mutations (p.A114V, p.K102N, p.R125Q, p.R266K, and p.R369C). The greatest effect of heme arginate was observed for the mutation p.R125Q, which is non-responsive to in vivo treatment with vitamin B(6). Moreover, the heme responsiveness of the p.R125Q mutation was confirmed in fibroblasts derived from a patient homozygous for this genetic variant. Based on these data, we propose that a distinct group of heme-responsive CBS mutations may exist and that the heme pocket of CBS may become an important target for designing novel therapies for homocystinuria.","dc:creator":"Melenovská P","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Chaperone therapy for homocystinuria: the rescue of CBS mutations by heme arginate."},"rdfs:label":"Heme arginate chaperone studies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:a9086d29-767b-4ab8-9274-1249b5480834_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06bc667b-7e57-4376-9c55-084d5433e027","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9662c2c-2f13-4962-896d-9323720f2fc9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Regular subcutaneous injections of PEG-CBS resulted in sustained correction of the plasma metabolite profile in the I278T mouse including marked decrease of plasma homocysteine and normalization of plasma cystein and SAM/SAH ratio, as well as correction of tissue metabolites in adult mice, prevention or reversal facial alopecia, and substantial rescue of the zonular structure in the I278T mice eyes.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29398487","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is the most common inherited disorder of sulfur amino acid metabolism caused by deficiency in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity and characterized by severe elevation of homocysteine in blood and tissues.

CBS encodes cystathione beta-synthase which catalyses the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, from homocysteine to cystathione. Variants in CBS were first reported in humans with this disorder in 1992 (Kozich and Kraus, PMID 1301198). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Twenty-one unique variants were curated (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) in 15 probands from 8 publications, and three of these probands each had two affected siblings in whom CBS variants were identified (Kozich and Kraus, 1992, PMID 1301198; De Franchis et al, 1999, PMID 10408774; Sebastio et al, 1999, PMID 7762555; Urreizti et al, 2003, PMID 12815602; Katsushima et al, 2006, PMID 16307898; Suri et al, 2014, PMID 25455305; Gong et al, 2015, PMID 26667307; Li et al, 2018, PMID 29508359). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of CBS, which is consistent with the biochemical features in patients with homocystinuria (including elevated plasma total homocysteine and methionine) (Selim et al, 1959, PMID 13654400; Jhee and Kruger, 2005, PMID 15890029), functional studies in yeast, bacteria, and cultured cells, including chaperone studies in fibroblasts from patients with homocystinuria (Shan et al, 1998, PMID 9590298; Melenovská et al, 2018, PMID 25331909), as well as the biochemical and clinical features of mouse models (Gupta et al, 2009, PMID 18987302) and enzyme replacement studies in mice (Matjan et al, 2018, PMID 29398487). More information is available but the maximum experimental evidence score (6 points) has been reached. In summary, CBS is definitively associated with classic homocystinuria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
