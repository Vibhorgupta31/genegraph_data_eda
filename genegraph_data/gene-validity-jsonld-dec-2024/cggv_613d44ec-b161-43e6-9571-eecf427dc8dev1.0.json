Has2(-/-) embryos lack HA, exhibit severe cardiac and vascular abnormalities, and die during midgestation (E9.5-10). Heart explants from Has2(-/-) embryos lack the characteristic transformation of cardiac endothelial cells into mesenchyme, an essential developmental event that depends on receptor-mediated intracellular signaling. This defect is reproduced by expression of a dominant-negative Ras in wild-type heart explants, and is reversed in Has2(-/-) explants by gene rescue, by administering exogenous HA, or by expressing activated Ras. Conversely, transformation in Has2(-/-) explants mediated by exogenous HA is inhibited by dominant-negative Ras. Collectively, our results demonstrate the importance of HA in mammalian embryogenesis and the pivotal role of Has2 during mammalian development. They also reveal a previously unrecognized pathway for cell migration and invasion that is HA-dependent and involves Ras activation.","dc:creator":"Camenisch TD","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Disruption of hyaluronan synthase-2 abrogates normal cardiac morphogenesis and hyaluronan-mediated transformation of epithelium to mesenchyme."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue Mouse Model in Cell Culture Model "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded due to not recapitulating the phenotype "},{"id":"cggv:1e8fef36-dab9-4fc7-97a1-e320180a21d4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7b35e2b-0354-49c1-be41-d4b8f81025a1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The Has-/- mouse model exhibits cardiac and vascular defects.The  Has2–/– embryo has a characteristic constriction at the AV canal region, egg yolk defects.

One missense variant that has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID:24558368) is included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model and rescue animal model (PMID:10930438) In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
