Although 24 causative genes have been identified, these explain only approximately half of patients with MMAF. Since sperm flagella and motile cilia (especially respiratory cilia) have similar axonemal structures, many patients with MMAF also exhibit respiratory symptoms, such as recurrent airway infection, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis, which are frequently associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), another recessive disorder. Here, exome sequencing was conducted to evaluate the genetic cause in 53 patients with MMAF and classic PCD/PCD-like symptoms. Two homozygous missense variants and a compound-heterozygous variant in the BRWD1 gene were identified in three unrelated individuals. BRWD1 staining was detected in the whole flagella and respiratory cilia of normal controls but was absent in BRWD1-mutated individuals. Transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining demonstrated that BRWD1 deficiency in human affected respiratory cilia and sperm flagella differently, as the absence of outer and inner dynein arms in sperm flagellum and respiratory cilia, while with a decreased number and outer doublet microtubule defects of respiratory cilia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a BRWD1-variant-related disease in humans, manifesting as an autosomal recessive form of MMAF and PCD/PCD-like symptoms. Our data provide a basis for further exploring the molecular mechanism of BRWD1 gene during spermatogenesis and ciliogenesis.","dc:creator":"Guo T","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Bi-allelic BRWD1 variants cause male infertility with asthenoteratozoospermia and likely primary ciliary dyskinesia."}},"rdfs:label":"P1"},{"id":"cggv:35b46824-de14-4c97-8bb4-1bcc9da60f76","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:35b46824-de14-4c97-8bb4-1bcc9da60f76_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:35b46824-de14-4c97-8bb4-1bcc9da60f76_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transmission Electron Microscopy and Immunofluorescence showed the alteration of BRWD1 expression in cilia of respiratory epithelial cells and  in spermatozoa from patients with BRWD1 mutations"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Immunostainig of patient's cilia and sperm flagella shows the absence of other ciliary proteins (DNAH5 and DNALI1) that could explain the phenotype of the patient.

Mutations in PCD patients have been identified in a heterogeneous group of genes normally expressed in cilia and/or sperm flagella (PMID: 33279404).  \nThe *BRWD1* gene was first reported in association with PCD in 2021 (PMID:33389130). A prior study published in 2015 (PMID: 26301565) reported patients with *BRWD1* mutations, however, in association with a different pathology;  **autosomal dominant Agammaglobulinemia with incomplete penetrance** (MONDO:0015977).\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group and due to the differences in molecular mechanism and inheritance patterns, and the obvious phenotypic variability, the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP working group estimated that PCD (MONDO: 0016575) and Agammaglobulinemia (MONDO:0015977) represent distinct diseases and decided to split the entities.\nBRWD1 is a protein containing 8 WD repeats and 2 bromodomains. While WD repeats have diverse functions (PMID: 11814058), the bromodomains are particularly involved in histone recognition (PMID: 22464331). The gene encoding the BRWD1 protein is located in the Down Syndrome critical region of chromosome 21 which shows conserved synteny with the mouse chromosome 16. \nEvidence from 3 probands reported in only one publication (PMID:33389130) were included in this curation representing 4 unique missense variants. There are no additional cases of PCD with *BRWD1 *mutations in the literature, therefore we reached only 0.7 points for the genetic evidence of this curation.   \nGenerally, PCD-related genes are particularly expressed in ciliated epithelia and sperm flagella. This expression pattern is different for *BRWD1 *which is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (PMID: 25613900). Thus, the score of this experimental evidence was downgraded to 0 (zero).\nThe nuclear localization of BRWD1 is supported by abundant experimental evidence (PMID: 26301565, PMID: 25547156, PMID: 12889071). Besides immunostaining, coimmunoprecipitation showed that *BRWD1* associates with BRG1 which is a component of a chromatin remodeling complex (PMID: 12889071). This **contradicts** the prediction of a ciliary expression of *BRWD1* that would support this gene-disease relationship. \n*Brwd1* mutated mice were generated through Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis. In these mice, the generated splice mutation causes the skipping of the exon 10 and leads to the expression of a truncated BRWD1 protein (PMID: 25547156). All the generated mice are infertile. In female mutated mice, in vitro maturation and insemination showed impaired oocyte-to-embryo transition. Only 44% of mutant oocytes progressed to Metaphase II (vs.94% in WT) and the rest were all arrested at the two pronuclear stage.\nMale mutated mice showed oligoasthenozoospermia and MMAF which resembles the phenotype observed in patients with *BRWD1* mutations (PMID:33389130).\nFurther investigations have shown that *BRWD1* promotes haploid spermatid–specific transcription during postmeiotic sperm differentiation in male mice and is essential for epigenetic control of meiotic chromosome stability in females (PMID: 25547156). In mice, the loss of *BRWD1* function interferes with the completion of oogenesis and spermatogenesis through sexually dimorphic mechanisms. By contrast to PCD patients, ciliary and/or flagellar structural defects may not be the main cause for the infertility in these mice. Moreover, no respiratory signs were reported in *Brwd1* mutated mice. \nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between BRWD1 and autosomal recessive PCD has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *BRWD1* plays in this disease. \n**This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on November 10, 2022 (SOP Version 9).**\nIndividuals with variants in BRWD1 and clinical features of PCD are reported in the literature. However, no functional data support the pathogenicity of the variants and their association with PCD. No valid experimental evidence remains to support this curation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9f74ee87-e640-4604-9bb7-e7617907f92c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
