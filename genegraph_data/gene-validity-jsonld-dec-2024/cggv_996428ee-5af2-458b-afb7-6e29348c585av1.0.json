Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined with tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry, to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.","dc:creator":"Uhl√©n M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Proteomics.

The proband is an 11-year-old girl with a negative family history and an apparently healthy younger brother. Since 4 years of age, she has developed a progressive spastic paraparesis associated with ophthalmoparesis and moderate mental retardation. The presence of severe lactic acidosis and Leigh-like lesions of putamina prompted us to perform muscle and skin biopsies. In both, a profound, isolated defect of COX was found by histochemical and biochemical assays. Sequence analysis of muscle mtDNA resulted in the identification of a virtually homoplasmic frameshift mutation in the COIII gene, due to the insertion of an extra C at nucleotide position 9537 of mtDNA. Although the 9537C(ins) does not impair transcription of COIII, no full-length COX III protein was detected in mtDNA translation assays in vivo. Western blot analysis of two-dimensional blue-native electrophoresis showed a reduction of specific crossreacting material and the accumulation of early-assembly intermediates of COX, whereas the fully assembled complex was absent. One of these intermediates had an electrophoretic mobility different from those seen in controls, suggesting the presence of a qualitative abnormality of COX assembly. Immunostaining with specific antibodies failed to detect the presence of several smaller subunits in the complex lacking COX III, in spite of the demonstration that these subunits were present in the crude mitochondrial fraction of patient's cultured fibroblasts. Taken together, the data indicate a role for COX III in the incorporation and maintenance of smaller COX subunits within the complex.","dc:creator":"Tiranti V","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"A novel frameshift mutation of the mtDNA COIII gene leads to impaired assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in a patient affected by Leigh-like syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"COX assembly"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Functional validation done in cells from patient with LSS"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b7f39d8-6112-4507-8c68-41ff1ba98c27_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d5b5e37-2340-4828-8cfc-67389df5f767","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"phenotypeFreeText":"symmetric necrotic lesions of basal ganglia (putamina), consistent with LS per Rahman et al 1996 paper\nMild disease course, mild ID, severe lactic acidosis\n\nabsence of histochemical reaction to COX in muscle and ; other RC enzymes and CS were normal","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:2b7f39d8-6112-4507-8c68-41ff1ba98c27_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:30173d92-d563-4ebb-86ef-2e20675ac38a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"m.9537dupC","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA120602"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11063732"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11063732","rdfs:label":"Case"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"0.5 points for de novo + 0.5 points for egregation (virtually homoplasmic in muscle, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, oral epithelial cells, urine epithelial cells from patient; absent in lymphocytes of healthy brother and MGM; absent in lymphocyte hair, oral epithelial of mother\n\n2 points for additional cybrid testing (fused patient cytoplasts with rho0 cells; collected 20 clones homoplasmic for mutant _one clone is cy7 and this was used for studies - homoplasmic mutant (0.5 points for high heteroplasmy in cybrids); mutant cybrids were COX deficient like patient fibroblasts (biochemical deficiency in cybrid - 1point and biochemical deficiency in patient cell line 0.5 points); COX activity restored when HeLa cytoplasts fused with patient rhoO derivative"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":3037,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5821b659-28c1-4c4f-acba-30a667614c17","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:7422","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between MT-CO3 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 24, 2021. The MT-CO3 gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) subunit 3. Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\nThe first and only report of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum related to the MT-CO3 gene was in 2000 (PMID: 11063732). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one variant (m.9537dupC) in one case from one publication (PMID: 11063732). Other variants in this gene have been related to other mitochondrial diseases outside the scope of this curation. Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, expression, and functional alterations in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 11063732). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\nOnly one case with LSS, must downgrade to limited until more cases are reported","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
