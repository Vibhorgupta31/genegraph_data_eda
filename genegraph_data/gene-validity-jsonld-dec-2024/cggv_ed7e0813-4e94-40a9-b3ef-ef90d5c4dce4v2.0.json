The mutation leads to exon skipping and deletion of 52-amino acid residues of a PX membrane localization domain. FAM65B is known to be involved in myotube formation and in regulation of cell adhesion, polarization, and migration. We show that wild-type Fam65b is expressed during embryonic and postnatal development stages in murine cochlea, and that the protein localizes to the plasma membranes of the stereocilia of inner and outer hair cells of the inner ear. The wild-type protein targets the plasma membrane, whereas the mutant protein accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and does not reach the membrane. In zebrafish, knockdown of fam65b leads to significant reduction of numbers of saccular hair cells and neuromasts and to hearing loss.

FAM65B mutations cause hearing loss by an unknown mechanism. Using biochemistry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we show here that Fam65b oligomers form a circumferential ring near the basal taper of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of murine hair cells. Taperin, a second protein near the taper, forms a dense-core-like structure that is disrupted in the absence of Fam65b. Stereocilia of Fam65b-deficient murine hair cells start to develop, but mechanotransduction is affected and stereocilia deteriorate. Yeast-two-hybrid screens identify RhoC as a Fam65b binding partner. RhoC co-localizes with Fam65b in stereocilia and regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Binding to RhoC and oligomerization are critical for Fam65b function. Our findings thus reveal a highly organized compartment near the base of stereocilia that is critical for hair cell function and affected in disease.","dc:creator":"Zhao B","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Murine Fam65b forms ring-like structures at the base of stereocilia critical for mechanosensory hair cell function."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"There are multiple pieces of evidence in this article (multiple pieces of mechanotransduction/signal evidence).

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, autosomal recessive nonsyndromic genetic deafness (OMIM:616515) and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic genetic deafness (OMIM:607017). The split curation for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic genetic deafness has been curated separately. Two variants (splice-site, nonsense) that have been reported in nine probands in two publications (PMIDs: 24958875, 37864412) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse model, zebrafish model, expression-level evidence, functional alteration evidence; PMIDs: 24958875, 27269051, 30280293). Mutant mice and zebrafish show significant hearing loss. Expression-level evidence indicates that the gene is expressed in inner and outer hair cells. The gene is shown to interact with MYH9, which is classified as definitive for an autosomal dominant condition, of which hearing loss is a feature. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 9/18/2018. It was re-evaluated on 5/15/2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from moderate to strong, due to the addition of genetic evidence and experimental evidence (protein interaction evidence) (PMIDs: 30280293, 37864412). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between RIPOR2 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. More than two publications of genetic evidence are required for a definitive classification, and there are currently only two. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship in the future to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 5/15/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ed7e0813-4e94-40a9-b3ef-ef90d5c4dce4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
