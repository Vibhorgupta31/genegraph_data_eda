However, in pathologic conditions, such as rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, platelet-collagen interactions are associated with cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases. Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) plays a crucial role in collagen-induced activation and aggregation of platelets, and people who are deficient in GPVI suffer from bleeding disorders. Based on the fact that GPVI is coupled to the Fc receptor (FcR)-gamma chain and thus should share homology with the FcR chains, the genes encoding human and mouse GPVI were identified. They belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and share 64% homology at the protein level. Functional evidence demonstrating the identity of the recombinant protein with GPVI was shown by binding to its natural ligand collagen; binding to convulxin (Cvx), a GPVI-specific ligand from snake venom; binding of anti-GPVI IgG isolated from a patient; and association to the FcR-gamma chain. The study also demonstrated that the soluble protein blocks Cvx and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and that GPVI expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets. Finally, human GPVI was mapped to chromosome 19, long arm, region 1, band 3 (19q13), in the same region as multiple members of the Ig superfamily.

However, so far this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here, we demonstrate by intravital fluorescence microscopy of the mouse carotid artery that inhibition or absence of the major platelet collagen receptor, GPVI, abolishes platelet-vessel wall interactions after endothelial denudation. Unexpectedly, inhibition of GPVI by the monoclonal antibody JAQ1 reduced platelet tethering to the subendothelium by approximately 89%. In addition, stable arrest and aggregation of platelets was virtually abolished under these conditions. Using different models of arterial injury, the strict requirement for GPVI in these processes was confirmed in GPVI-deficient mice, where platelets also failed to adhere and aggregate on the damaged vessel wall.

The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (3.5 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models and expression studies. GP6-knock-out mice show absent platelet aggregation in response to collagen, similar to human patients (PMIDs: 12738669, 16139873) and platelets from GPVI-deficient mice are functionally abnormal (PMID: 12515812). The expression of GP6 is restricted to platelets and megakaryocytes (PMID: 10961879, 11278467). \n\nIn summary, the GP6 - Platelet-type Bleeding Disorder 11 gene-disease relationship is definitive. \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on October 23, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:76262cf5-f2cd-4466-b542-bf2334a96c73"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
