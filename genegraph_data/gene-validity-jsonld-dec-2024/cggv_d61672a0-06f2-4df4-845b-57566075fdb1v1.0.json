We used a titin exon array to search for which part(s) of the human titin transcriptional unit encompassing 363 exons is(are) expressed in non-striated muscle tissues. Expression profiling of adult smooth muscle tissues (aorta, bladder, carotid, stomach) identified alternatively spliced titin isoforms, encompassing 80 to about 100 exons. These exons code for parts of the titin Z-disk, I-band and A-band regions, allowing the truncated smooth muscle titin isoform to link Z-disks/dense bodies together with thick filaments. Consistent with the array data, Western blot studies detected the expression of approximately 1 MDa smooth muscle titin in adult smooth muscles, reacting with selected Z-disc, I-band, and A-band titin antibodies. Immunofluorescence with these antibodies located smooth muscle titin in the cytoplasm of cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells and in the tunica media of intact adult bovine aorta. Real time PCR studies suggested that smooth muscle titins are expressed from a promoter located 35 kb or more upstream of the transcription initiation site used for striated muscle titin, driving expression of a bi-cistronic mRNA, coding 5' for the anonymous gene FL39502, followed 3' by titin, respectively. Our work showed that smooth muscle and striated muscle titins share in their conserved amino-terminal regions binding sites for alpha-actinin and filamins: Yeast two-hybrid screens using Z2-Zis1 titin baits identified prey clones coding for alpha-actinin-1 and filamin-A from smooth muscle, and alpha-actinin-2/3, filamin-C, and nebulin from skeletal muscle cDNA libraries, respectively. This suggests that the titin Z2-Zis1 domain can link filamins and alpha-actinin together in the periphery of the Z-line/dense bodies in a fashion that is conserved in smooth and striated muscles.","dc:creator":"Labeit S","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Expression of distinct classes of titin isoforms in striated and smooth muscles by alternative splicing, and their conserved interaction with filamins."},"rdfs:label":"Labeit protein interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e552dd99-8f97-4e43-9d5a-7be86aaae978","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:28b20766-53fd-43fb-a6ee-1c7a2838a96e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"Y2H method showed 2 Ig-like domains from myotilin interacted directly with Ig-like domain 20 of FLNC ‚Äì indicating that the amino-terminal of FLNC may be indirectly anchored to ùõº-actinin in the Z-disc via myotilin\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11038172","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"gamma-Filamin, also called ABP-L, is a filamin isoform that is specifically expressed in striated muscles, where it is predominantly localized in myofibrillar Z-discs.

Subsequently, the same mutation was found in patients from diverse ethnical origins, indicating that this specific alteration is a mutational hot spot. Patients initially present with proximal muscle weakness, while distal and respiratory muscles become affected with disease progression. Muscle biopsies of these patients show typical signs of myofibrillar myopathy, including disintegration of myofibrils and aggregation of several proteins into distinct intracellular deposits. Highly similar phenotypes were observed in patients with other mutations in Ig-like domains of FLNc that result in expression of a noxious protein. Biochemical and biophysical studies showed that the mutated domains acquire an abnormal structure causing decreased stability and eventually becoming a seed for abnormal aggregation with other proteins. The disease usually presents only after the fourth decade of life possibly as a result of ageing-related impairments in the machinery that is responsible for disposal of damaged proteins. This is confirmed by mutations in components of this machinery that cause a highly similar phenotype. Transfection studies of cultured muscle cells reflect the events observed in patient muscles and, therefore, may provide a helpful model for testing future dedicated therapeutic strategies. More recently, FLNC mutations were also found in families with a distal myopathy phenotype, caused either by mutations in the actin-binding domain of FLNc that result in increased actin-binding and non-specific myopathic abnormalities without myofibrillar myopathy pathology, or a nonsense mutation in the rod domain that leads to RNA instability, haploinsufficiency with decreased expression levels of FLNc in the muscle fibers and myofibrillar abnormalities, but not to the formation of desmin-positive protein aggregates required for the diagnosis of myofibrillar myopathy.","dc:creator":"F√ºrst DO","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Filamin C-related myopathies: pathology and mechanisms."},"rdfs:label":"Furst biochemical function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d61672a0-06f2-4df4-845b-57566075fdb1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:230ea8a8-3315-422c-842e-a7ceeaa093ea","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3fab3ba-ea1a-4845-b57d-63b96d1e12f6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Compared to WT FLNC+/‚àÜ7aa :\nDid not effect FLNC expression \nDid not effect sarcomere formation and function\nCaused aggregate formation\nCaused increases in lysosome content, enhancement of autoflux, and accumulation of FLNC-binding partners & Z-disc proteins \n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34405687","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"[Figure: see text].","dc:creator":"Agarwal R","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Filamin C Cardiomyopathy Variants Cause Protein and Lysosome Accumulation."},"rdfs:label":"Agarwal cell culture model "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:d64c18af-7289-4057-ab54-d131f290f3dd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ece6d5e9-601c-4caa-837c-4afc50182237","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Overexpression of eGFP-labled FLNC (p.A1183L & p.A1186V) in zebra fish embryos causes formation of protein aggregates and mild Z-disc abnormalities seen by confocal imaging \nSkeletal muscle aggregates 4E & 4F\nZ-disc streaming along myofibrils in 4H\nAbnormal Z-disc patterning 4I\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858533","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in FLNC for a long time are known in connection to neuromuscular disorders and only recently were described in association with various cardiomyopathies.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Loss of function variation causes weakening of myocyte adhesion and is implicated in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy without musculoskeletal abnormalities (Verdonschot 2020, PMID 32112656). Conversely, the mechanism of non-loss of function variation for FLNC-induced myopathy is attributed to the aggregation of FLNC and FLNC-binding proteins in muscle and the sarcomere (Furst 2013, PMID 23109048). Therefore, we have split the molecular mechanism, curating only non-loss of function variation for the disease entity [Myopathy, myofibrillar, 5] (OMIM: 609524). Over 22 probands in 9 publications have been published (Vorgerd 2005, PMID 15929027; Kley 2007, PMID 18055494; Kley 2012, PMID 22961544; Shatunov 2009, PMID 19050726; Laun 2010, PMID 20417099; Avila-Smirnow 2012, PMID 27633507; Rold√°n-Sevilla 2019, PMID 30919686; Gaudreault 2023, PMID 36864778;; Berm√∫dez-Jim√©nez 2023, PMID 35952944). There were 16 unique heterozygous variants (12 missense, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 in-frame indel, 1 duplication, and 1 termination in the last exon). One variant (p.Trp2710Ter) was seen in 36 affected individuals across six families and represents a founder effect. Of note, FLNC has a pseudogene located 53.6kb downstream from the functional FLNC gene, and exons 46, 47, and 48 are 98% homologous in the functional and pseudogene (Odgerel 2010, PMID: 20578970). \n\nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, protein interaction studies, and model systems (Xie 1998, PMID 979101; Furst 2013, PMID 23109048; van der Ven 2000, PMID 11038172; Gonzalez-Morales 2017 2017, PMID 28732005; Labeit 2006, PMID 16949617; Chevessier 2015, PMID 29859533; Kiselev 2018, PMID 29859533; Ruparelia 2016, PMID 26969713; Agarwal 2012, PMID 34405687), reaching the maximum points for experimental evidence. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between FLNC non-loss of function variation and autosomal dominant myofibrillar myopathy 5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical settings and upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy GCEP on December 12th, 2017. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification has remained the same; however, the molecular mechanism has been split to include only non-loss of function variation approved on October 26, 2023, by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d61672a0-06f2-4df4-845b-57566075fdb1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
