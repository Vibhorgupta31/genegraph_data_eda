Although the complex molecular pathophysiology of neurodegeneration is largely unknown, major advances have been achieved by elucidating the genetic defects underlying mendelian forms of these diseases. This has led to the discovery of common pathophysiological pathways such as enhanced oxidative stress, protein misfolding and aggregation and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we describe loss-of-function mutations in a previously uncharacterized, predominantly neuronal P-type ATPase gene, ATP13A2, underlying an autosomal recessive form of early-onset parkinsonism with pyramidal degeneration and dementia (PARK9, Kufor-Rakeb syndrome). Whereas the wild-type protein was located in the lysosome of transiently transfected cells, the unstable truncated mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the proteasome. Our findings link a class of proteins with unknown function and substrate specificity to the protein networks implicated in neurodegeneration and parkinsonism.","dc:creator":"Ramirez A","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Hereditary parkinsonism with dementia is caused by mutations in ATP13A2, encoding a lysosomal type 5 P-type ATPase."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ba5cb4f-3f7f-44dc-b2a5-0a2d62e510d4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9673a70d-73aa-4883-b8fe-d36c9df35c4d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9673a70d-73aa-4883-b8fe-d36c9df35c4d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":18,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:621ad036-53e0-4f68-b61e-50d74ab99905","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_022089.4(ATP13A2):c.3057del (p.Tyr1020fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA636632"}},{"id":"cggv:eef43429-5714-481e-87e6-4e1bfd3e1821","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_022089.4(ATP13A2):c.1306+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251715"}}],"detectionMethod":"sequenced all 29 exons and splice sites of the predicted gene ATP13A2 ","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007256","obo:HP_0002067","obo:HP_0012378","obo:HP_0000605","obo:HP_0002063","obo:HP_0001268","obo:HP_0001336","obo:HP_0002322"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:0fd9aa97-bc24-4ac5-b48e-58ca71048513_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:621ad036-53e0-4f68-b61e-50d74ab99905"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16964263"},{"id":"cggv:d471c8eb-aab1-4e82-a693-7234bd672e97_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:eef43429-5714-481e-87e6-4e1bfd3e1821"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16964263"}],"rdfs:label":"II-8"},{"id":"cggv:0fd9aa97-bc24-4ac5-b48e-58ca71048513","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0fd9aa97-bc24-4ac5-b48e-58ca71048513_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d471c8eb-aab1-4e82-a693-7234bd672e97","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d471c8eb-aab1-4e82-a693-7234bd672e97_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d471c8eb-aab1-4e82-a693-7234bd672e97_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"cDNA analysis from the father and two affected children confirmed that the c.1306+5G>A splice site variant causes in-frame skipping of exon 13 (removing 111 nucleotides).

We implemented clinical exome sequencing, followed by filtering data for a 'movement disorders' gene panel, as a generic test to increase variant detection in 76 patients with these disorders. Segregation analysis or phenotypic re-evaluation was utilized to substantiate findings. Disease-causing variants were identified in 9 of 28 CA patients, and 8 of 48 HSP patients. In addition, possibly disease-causing variants were identified in 1 and 8 of the remaining CA and HSP patients, respectively. In 10 patients with CA, the total disease-causing or possibly disease-causing variants were detected in 8 different genes, whereas 16 HSP patients had such variants in 12 different genes. In the majority of cases, the identified variants were compatible with the patient phenotype. Interestingly, in some patients variants were identified in genes hitherto related to other movement disorders, such as TH variants in two siblings with HSP. In addition, rare disorders were uncovered, for example, a second case of HSP caused by a VCP variant. For some patients, exome sequencing results had implications for treatment, exemplified by the favorable L-DOPA treatment in a patient with HSP due to ATP13A2 variants (Parkinson type 9). Thus, clinical exome sequencing in this cohort of CA and HSP patients suggests broadening of disease spectra, revealed novel gene-disease associations, and uncovered unanticipated rare disorders. In addition, clinical exome sequencing results have shown their value in guiding practical patient management.","dc:creator":"van de Warrenburg BP","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Clinical exome sequencing for cerebellar ataxia and spastic paraplegia uncovers novel gene-disease associations and unanticipated rare disorders."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 17"},{"id":"cggv:ca686229-250b-45ad-a00b-34fe1b2ab9c0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca686229-250b-45ad-a00b-34fe1b2ab9c0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0ba5cb4f-3f7f-44dc-b2a5-0a2d62e510d4_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ddd0e08b-5daf-4c39-8c14-efc0c5dc7771_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ddd0e08b-5daf-4c39-8c14-efc0c5dc7771","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"cggv:dd0d7310-dffb-4505-8a8d-31f5d67978d5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"ATP13A2, 22-BP DUP","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1220"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"mask-like-face","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0002375","obo:HP_0000605","obo:HP_0002063","obo:HP_0000726","obo:HP_0002385","obo:HP_0002067","obo:HP_0012444"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Linkage Analysis","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:7bdab73f-47bb-4b8d-9d5e-38c64599e3c2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:dd0d7310-dffb-4505-8a8d-31f5d67978d5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16964263"},"rdfs:label":"V-49"},{"id":"cggv:7bdab73f-47bb-4b8d-9d5e-38c64599e3c2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7bdab73f-47bb-4b8d-9d5e-38c64599e3c2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because homozygous variant in a consanguineous family"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:fa0713ce-bf6d-48d3-90dc-892b1009589e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa0713ce-bf6d-48d3-90dc-892b1009589e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":29,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f863a81d-1dfb-4017-b9cd-85070a216da6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_022089.4(ATP13A2):c.2158G>T (p.Gly720Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338243709"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001256","obo:HP_0002352","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0002061","obo:HP_0000514","obo:HP_0001258","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0000725","obo:HP_0011448","obo:HP_0012444","obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0007340"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:9764a9b4-0ee7-490b-ad71-131e49e09b17_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f863a81d-1dfb-4017-b9cd-85070a216da6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31944623","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by lower limb spasticity and weakness, with or without additional symptoms.

We describe six patients from a consanguineous Greenlandic Inuit family, homozygous for a novel frame-shift mutation in exon 22 of ATP13A2 (c.2473C>AA, p.Leu825AsnfsX32). Disease onset varied from 10 to 29 years of age, the latest reported, and the clinical features were highly variable within a wide spectrum of an extrapyramidal-pyramidal syndrome with cognitive/psychiatric features. Ataxia was seen in two patients and axonal neuropathy in one, features not previously related to KRS. Dopamine transporter scans showed symmetrical, severely reduced uptake in striatum in two patients.

The ATP13A2 gene (locus PARK9) encodes the protein ATP13A2, a lysosomal type 5 P-type ATPase that is linked to autosomal recessive familial parkinsonism. The physiological function of ATP13A2, and hence its role in PD, remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that PD-linked mutations in ATP13A2 lead to several lysosomal alterations in ATP13A2 PD patient-derived fibroblasts, including impaired lysosomal acidification, decreased proteolytic processing of lysosomal enzymes, reduced degradation of lysosomal substrates, and diminished lysosomal-mediated clearance of autophagosomes. Similar alterations are observed in stable ATP13A2-knockdown dopaminergic cell lines, which are associated with cell death. Restoration of ATP13A2 levels in ATP13A2-mutant/depleted cells restores lysosomal function and attenuates cell death. Relevant to PD, ATP13A2 levels are decreased in dopaminergic nigral neurons from patients with PD, in which ATP13A2 mostly accumulates within Lewy bodies. Our results unravel an instrumental role of ATP13A2 deficiency on lysosomal function and cell viability and demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic potential of modulating ATP13A2 levels in the context of PD.","dc:creator":"Dehay B","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Loss of P-type ATPase ATP13A2/PARK9 function induces general lysosomal deficiency and leads to Parkinson disease neurodegeneration."},"rdfs:label":"Knockdown in neuroblastoma cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:54130595-a6d6-462b-8336-fe87890a4af4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13571371-35c1-481f-8c40-2e6a4ff77a72","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"General lysosomal deficiency in ATP13A2 patient fibroblasts: \nAccumulation of lysosomal-related structures in patient fibroblasts \nImpaired lysosomal protolysis in patient fibroblasts","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22442086","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The autophagy-lysosomal pathway plays an important role in the clearance of long-lived proteins and dysfunctional organelles. Lysosomal dysfunction has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies that are characterized by accumulations of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies. Recent identification of mutations in genes linked to lysosomal function and neurodegeneration has offered a unique opportunity to directly examine the role of lysosomes in disease pathogenesis. Mutations in lysosomal membrane protein ATP13A2 (PARK9) cause familial Kufor-Rakeb syndrome characterized by early-onset parkinsonism, pyramidal degeneration and dementia. While previous data suggested a role of ATP13A2 in α-synuclein misfolding and toxicity, the mechanistic link has not been established. Here we report that loss of ATP13A2 in human fibroblasts from patients with Kufor-Rakeb syndrome or in mouse primary neurons leads to impaired lysosomal degradation capacity. This lysosomal dysfunction results in accumulation of α-synuclein and toxicity in primary cortical neurons. Importantly, silencing of endogenous α-synuclein attenuated the toxicity in ATP13A2-depleted neurons, suggesting that loss of ATP13A2 mediates neurotoxicity at least in part via the accumulation of α-synuclein. Our findings implicate lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome and suggest that upregulation of lysosomal function and downregulation of α-synuclein represent important therapeutic strategies for this disorder.","dc:creator":"Usenovic M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Deficiency of ATP13A2 leads to lysosomal dysfunction, α-synuclein accumulation, and neurotoxicity."},"rdfs:label":"Patient Fibroblast Study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Same patient cell line used in Dehay (2012) PMID: 22647602 (which was scored).

Most studies have focused on accumulation of neurotoxic α-synuclein secondary to defects in autophagy as the cause of neurodegeneration, but abnormalities of the autophagic-lysosomal system likely mediate toxicity through multiple mechanisms. To further explore how endolysosomal dysfunction causes PD-related neurodegeneration, we generated a murine model of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), characterized by early-onset Parkinsonism with additional neurological features. KRS is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in the ATP13A2 gene encoding the endolysosomal ATPase ATP13A2. We show that loss of ATP13A2 causes a specific protein trafficking defect, and that Atp13a2 null mice develop age-related motor dysfunction that is preceded by neuropathological changes, including gliosis, accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, lipofuscinosis, and endolysosomal abnormalities. Contrary to predictions from in vitro data, in vivo mouse genetic studies demonstrate that these phenotypes are α-synuclein independent. Our findings indicate that endolysosomal dysfunction and abnormalities of α-synuclein homeostasis are not synonymous, even in the context of an endolysosomal genetic defect linked to Parkinsonism, and highlight the presence of α-synuclein-independent neurotoxicity consequent to endolysosomal dysfunction.

Although the transport activity of ATP13A2 has not been defined, in vitro studies show that its loss compromises lysosomal function, which in turn is thought to cause neuronal degeneration. To understand the role of ATP13A2 dysfunction in disease, we disrupted its gene in mice. Atp13a2(-/-) and Atp13a2(+/+) mice were tested behaviorally to assess sensorimotor and cognitive function at multiple ages. In the brain, lipofuscin accumulation, α-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic pathology were measured. Behaviorally, Atp13a2(-/-) mice displayed late-onset sensorimotor deficits. Accelerated deposition of autofluorescent storage material (lipofuscin) was observed in the cerebellum and in neurons of the hippocampus and the cortex of Atp13a2(-/-) mice.

It was later reported in relation to other autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders including hereditary spastic paraplegia, cerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there is insufficient evidence of a difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern to explain the wide phenotypic spectrum observed from *ATP13A2* variation; therefore, the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel decided to lump all these entities together and curate them under the umbrella term Kufor-Rakeb syndrome. \n\nEvidence supporting the relationship between *ATP13A2* and a complex movement disorder includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. For the purposes of this curation, nine variants (missense, splicing, nonsense, and frameshift) reported in seven probands in six publications are included in this curation: (PMIDs: 16964263, 21696388, 27165006, 31944623, 33033738, 30992063). In addition, variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least three families (PMIDs: 11584046, 16964263, 21696388). More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be bi-allelic loss of function (LoF). This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 22647602, 22442086, 23393156, 25855184, 30992063). \n\nIn summary, *ATP13A2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Kufor-Rakeb syndrome.
