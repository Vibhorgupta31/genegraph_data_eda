When interacting with CaM, mutants C38R and those in the 84-89 region increased the association with the others showing reduced interactions. The evaluation between HINT1 and the NR1 subunit of the glutamate NMDA receptor demonstrated increased association with G38V and G89V, but diminished interactions for all other human HINT1 mutants. Binding to the MOR c-terminal cytosolic tail showed the same pattern, with only G89V not displaying a reduced interaction. RGSZ2, which normally forms stable complexes with HINT1 and MOR, showed a disparate pattern of strengthening or weakening the association with the mutants. Finally, interactions were reduced with ICD Teneurin 1 for all except the 84-89 region and all but C38R and G89V displayed very weak interaction with σ1R.

We now report how human HINT1 mutations affect the interaction of HINT1 with the regulator of its SUMOylase activity, calcium-activated calmodulin, and its substrate SUMO. Moreover, HINT1 mutants exhibited anomalous interactions with G protein coupled receptors, such as the mu-opioid, and with glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as well. Additionally, these HINT1 mutants showed impaired associations with transcriptional regulators such as the regulator of G protein signaling Z2 protein and the cleaved N-terminal ICD of teneurin 1.

This combination was clinically recognized and described previously in a few reports but is generally unknown. We aimed to establish the importance of HINT1 mutations as the cause of hereditary neuropathy and particularly hereditary motor neuropathy/axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (HMN/CMT2) among Czech patients. Overall, mutations in the HINT1 gene seem to be a surprisingly frequent cause of inherited neuropathy in our group of patients. Biallelic pathogenic mutations were found in 21 patients from 19 families. The prevalent mutation in the Czech population is the p.R37P (95% of pathogenic alleles). Clinically, all patients with biallelic mutations presented with early onset of symptoms at the end of the first decade. Foot/toe extension weakness to plegia was present in almost all patients. Neuromyotonia was present in all but two patients. However, it had been properly recognized in only three patients prior to molecular genetic diagnosis. HINT1 mutations seem to be one of the most frequent causes of inherited neuropathy and are probably the most frequent cause of HMN in Czech patients. We suggest all HMN/CMT2 patients be tested for the presence of the prevalent mutation, the p.R37P.","dc:creator":"Laššuthová P","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Mutations in HINT1 are one of the most frequent causes of hereditary neuropathy among Czech patients and neuromyotonia is rather an underdiagnosed symptom."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25342199","rdfs:label":"LA6-I"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"One premature termination variant and one heterozygous missense w/ variant-level evidence (PMID:22961002; Arg37Pro shows inability to rescue deficient yeast and lack of proper expression)"},{"id":"cggv:d03c08cc-e28a-4f9b-94fb-45ed19492861_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d69f23e-df12-460c-9284-a96c08adc1be","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted and next generation sequencing used to identify HINT1 mutations and sanger sequencing to confirm them.

Although neuromyotonia was initially defined as a core feature of the disorder, reports of probands without neuromyotonia indicated incomplete penetrance for this phenotype. At least twelve unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans, with the most common pathogenic variant c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) being a founder variant observed mainly in patients of Slavic origin (PMID: 31848916). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least ten probands in five publications (PMIDs: 26059562, 24105373, 25342199, 30001929, 22961002) and segregated with disease in four additional family members. These probands generally present with a primary axonal neuropathy characterized by gait impairment, progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, facial/foot deformities, and neuromyotonia. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, as the mutant proteins are unable to fulfill HINT1's signalling role in the central and peripheral nervous system (PMID: 33404983).\nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression evidence, HINT1's biochemical function in the nervous system, and a series of functional studies performed on pathogenic variants in cell and animal models. Primary expression in the CNS and PNS indicates the crucial role that the protein fulfills, while loss of the sumolayse activity that HINT1 provides matches with the primary motor neuropathy phenotypes observed in probands (PMID: 31088288). Additionally, functional evaluation of all known pathogenic variants demonstrated a variety of altered functions including impaired thermal stability, disrupted dimer formation, and loss of interaction with SUMO1, CaM, and ICD Teneurin 1 (PMID: 33404983).\nIn summary, HINT1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:170aae71-9b16-49b1-be29-44f98db2f72e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
