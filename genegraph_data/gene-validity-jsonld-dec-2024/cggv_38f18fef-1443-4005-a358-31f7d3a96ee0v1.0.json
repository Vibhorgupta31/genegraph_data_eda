highly selective, amiloride-sensitive, epithelial sodium channel from rat colon (rENaC), composed of three homologous subunits termed alpha, beta, and gamma rENaC, has been cloned by functional expression and was proposed to mediate electrogenic sodium reabsorption in aldosterone-responsive epithelia. To determine whether rENaC could account for sodium absorption in vivo, we studied the cellular localization of the sodium channel messenger RNA subunits by in situ hybridization and their cellular and subcellular distribution by immunocytochemistry in the kidney, colon, salivary, and sweat glands of the rat. In the kidney, we show that the three subunit mRNAs are specifically co-expressed in the renal distal convoluted tubules (DCT), connecting tubules (CNT), cortical collecting ducts (CCD), and outer medullary collecting ducts (OMCD), but not in the inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD). We demonstrate co-localization of alpha, beta, and gamma subunit proteins in the apical membrane of a majority of cells of CCD and OMCD. Our data indicate that alpha, beta, and gamma subunit mRNAs and proteins are co-expressed in the distal nephron (excepting IMCD), a localization that correlates with the previously described physiological expression of amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium transport. Our data, however, suggest that another sodium transport protein mediates electrogenic amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption in IMCD. We also localized rENaC to the surface epithelial cells of the distal colon and to the secretory ducts of the salivary gland and sweat gland, providing further evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the highly selective, amiloride-sensitive sodium channel is physiologically expressed in aldosterone-responsive cells.","dc:creator":"Duc C","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Cell-specific expression of epithelial sodium channel alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in aldosterone-responsive epithelia from the rat: localization by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry."},"rdfs:label":"In situ hybridization and Immunocytochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:081248f7-4157-4fa8-9621-cf575780c46a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fdf50756-03d9-4aa2-82a2-2c74634ef3c8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Three homologous subunits of the epithelial sodium channel","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775436","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a member of the ENaC/degenerin superfamily.

This sodium channel is crucial for Na+ reabsorption and, thus, electrolytes homeostasis (Hanukoglu 2016, PMID: 26772908). The channel is localized in the apical portion of epithelial cells of the distal nephron, distal colon, lung, and ducts of exocrine glands (Canessa 1994 PMID: 8107805).\n*SCNN1A* mutation was first reported in association with autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I in 1996 (Chang PMID: 8589714), however, the first clinical description of PHA was of a 3-month-old with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, who was resistant to aldosterone but responded to dietary salt supplementation (Cheek and Perry 1958, PMID: 13545877). PHA type 1 is characterized by excess loss of salt in the urine and high concentrations of sodium in sweat, stool, and saliva. Laboratory tests may show hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and increased plasma renin activity with high levels of aldosterone in the blood. Treatment for this condition involves aggressive salt replacement and control of hyperkalemia.\n*SCNN1A* mutation has also been reported in association with the autosomal dominant condition, Liddle Syndrome, and a Cystic Fibrosis-like condition referred to as ‘Bronchiectasis with or without elevated sweat chloride 2’ with an unclear inheritance pattern. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was sufficient phenotypic variability and differences in mode of inheritance and the molecular mechanisms to support splitting these disorders into three distinct disease entities; Liddle Syndrome (OMIM:618126), Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (OMIM:264350) and Bronchiectasis with or without elevated sweat chloride 3 (OMIM:613021). Autosomal dominant Liddle Syndrome has been curated separately.\nAt least 7 variants in *SCNN1A* have been associated with PHA type 1 including 6 loss-of-function (frameshifts and nonsense) variants and 1 missense variant (Chang 1996, PMID 8589714, Schaedel 1999, PMID 10586178, Welzel, 2013 PMID: 23416952). More variants may be available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including, biochemical function (Garty and Plamer, 1997 PMID: 9114818) and protein interaction with the other ENaC family members (Stewart 2011,  PMID: 21775436). In addition, expression studies show the three members of the channel co-expressed in the renal distal convoluted tubules, connecting tubules, cortical collecting ducts, and outer medullary collecting ducts in rats (Duc 1994, PMID: 7806569). An αENaC(−/−)Tg mouse model also exists, showing clinical features of severe PHA-1 with metabolic acidosis, urinary salt-wasting, growth retardation, and 50% mortality (Hummler, 1997 PMID: 9326675).\nIn summary, SCNN1A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:38f18fef-1443-4005-a358-31f7d3a96ee0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
