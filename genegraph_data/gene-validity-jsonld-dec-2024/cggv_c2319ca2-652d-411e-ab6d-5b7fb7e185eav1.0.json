Hypermethioninemia is occasionally discovered incidentally, but it is often disregarded as an unspecific finding, particularly if liver disease is involved. In many individuals the hypermethioninemia resolves without further deterioration, but it can also represent an early sign of a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. Further investigation of unclear hypermethioninemia is therefore important. We studied two siblings affected by severe developmental delay and liver dysfunction. Biochemical analysis revealed increased plasma levels of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) but normal or mildly elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, indicating a block in the methionine cycle. We excluded S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) deficiency, which causes a similar biochemical phenotype, by using genetic and biochemical techniques and hypothesized that there was a functional block in the SAHH enzyme as a result of a recessive mutation in a different gene. Using exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous c.902C>A (p.Ala301Glu) missense mutation in the adenosine kinase gene (ADK), the function of which fits perfectly with this hypothesis. Increased urinary adenosine excretion confirmed ADK deficiency in the siblings. Four additional individuals from two unrelated families with a similar presentation were identified and shown to have a homozygous c.653A>C (p.Asp218Ala) and c.38G>A (p.Gly13Glu) mutation, respectively, in the same gene. All three missense mutations were deleterious, as shown by activity measurements on recombinant enzymes. ADK deficiency is a previously undescribed, severe IEM shedding light on a functional link between the methionine cycle and adenosine metabolism.","dc:creator":"Bjursell MK","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Adenosine kinase deficiency disrupts the methionine cycle and causes hypermethioninemia, encephalopathy, and abnormal liver function."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21963049","rdfs:label":"BJ1_1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Homozygous missense w/ variant-level evidence (recombinant mutant ADK expressed in E. coli and showed no residual activity compared to WT)"},{"id":"cggv:8d2fb11f-24f0-47c3-a8ce-e682aedf34ac_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a996533-97ed-4ce7-91bf-7f28367f9cca","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing of the ADK gene revealed a homozygous termination variant.

We report the clinical, histological and biochemical courses of three ADK children carrying two new mutations and presenting with neonatal cholestasis and neurological disorders. One of them died of liver failure whereas the other two recovered from their liver damage. As the phenotype was consistent with a mitochondrial disorder, we studied liver mitochondrial respiratory chain activities in two patients and revealed a combined defect of several complexes. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed methionine plasma concentration, a hallmark of ADK deficiency, in a cohort of children and showed that methionine level in patients with ADK deficiency was strongly increased compared with patients with other liver diseases. ADK deficiency is a cause of neonatal or early infantile liver disease that may mimic primary mitochondrial disorders. In this context, an elevation of methionine plasma levels over twice the upper limit should not be considered as a nonspecific finding. ADK deficiency induced-liver dysfunction is most often transient, but could be life-threatening.","dc:creator":"Becker PH","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Adenosine kinase deficiency: Three new cases and diagnostic value of hypermethioninemia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33309011","rdfs:label":"BE2_P3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Homozygous null variant w/o variant-level evidence"},{"id":"cggv:b4e7c2a7-8d5c-4b9d-8200-944f43acdb9b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac61808b-c360-49d7-a16a-888a459adfa2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Variable, mostly NGS/WES","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003235","obo:HP_0002071","obo:HP_0001319","obo:HP_0006579","obo:HP_0002908","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0000708","obo:HP_0002355","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0001396","obo:HP_0002007","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0003202","obo:HP_0004914","obo:HP_0001786","obo:HP_0006236","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0008070"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Decrease or normalization of transamineases with the applicaiton of a low methionine diet was found in all tested patients, along with improvement of the phenotypes; Family is consanguineous","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b4e7c2a7-8d5c-4b9d-8200-944f43acdb9b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c6ebdb76-1429-4e6b-8a3e-757ff68f7576","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006721.4(ADK):c.736_738delinsCC (p.Thr246ProfsTer16)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139768931"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26642971","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Adenosine kinase deficiency is a recently described defect affecting methionine metabolism with a severe clinical phenotype comprising mainly neurological and hepatic impairment and dysmorphism.","dc:creator":"Staufner C","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Adenosine kinase deficiency: expanding the clinical spectrum and evaluating therapeutic options."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26642971","rdfs:label":"ST-6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Frameshift causing premature termination w/o variant-level evidence"},{"id":"cggv:0156507a-0f48-40f1-9af5-247915b3011e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2ef9a39a-a8d1-4ba7-b054-1a85a84979c3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing of P2 revealed a homozygous mutation in ADK which led to a premature termination codon.

In the present study, a deficit in adenosine-dependent metabolism is proposed as a causative factor. Physiologically, adenosine is efficiently metabolized to AMP by adenosine kinase (ADK), an enzyme highly expressed in liver. ADK not only ensures normal adenine nucleotide levels but also is essential for maintaining S-adenosylmethionine-dependent transmethylation processes, where adenosine, an obligatory product, has to be constantly removed. Homozygous Adk(-/-) mutants developed normally during embryogenesis. However, within 4 days after birth they displayed microvesicular hepatic steatosis and died within 14 days with fatty liver. Adenine nucleotides were decreased and S-adenosylhomocysteine, a potent inhibitor of transmethylation reactions, was increased in the mutant liver. Thus, a deficiency in adenosine metabolism is identified as a powerful contributor to the development of neonatal hepatic steatosis, providing a model for the rapid development of postnatally lethal fatty liver.","dc:creator":"Boison D","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Neonatal hepatic steatosis by disruption of the adenosine kinase gene."},"rdfs:label":"ADK Null Mice Model Hepatic Abnormalities"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Although this publication does show the impact of ADK deficiency on the liver and developmental delay, the other characterstic neurological phenotypes are notably absent.

This disorder is multisystemic and includes phenotypes such as global developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, recurrent hypoglycaemia, and prolonged hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period. At least eleven unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nMethylation disorders are rarely reported, with ADK deficiency having only around twenty four confirmed cases in the literature reported in three publications (PMIDs: 21963049, 26642971, 33309011). This disorder was reported in several families with two siblings both displaying symptoms, however further segregation evidence is currently unavailable. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with reduced ADK activity causing a buildup of adenosine, increasing the concentration of hepatic transaminases (ALAT, ASAT) and plasma AdoMet and AdoHcy, and leading to hyperbilirubinemia and hypermethionemia (PMID: 27671891). This pathway disruption causes a cascade of effects mainly in the liver and the brain via disruption of homeostasis, leading to hepatopathy and developmental delay/seizures (PMIDs: 11997462, 27903722).\nThis gene-disease association is supported by the aforementioned biochemical function of ADK, primary protein/RNA expression in the liver and brain, and two knockout mouse models that each model a different aspect of the disorder. The global ADK knockout mice displayed significant liver abnormalities in the neonatal period, however the increased fatality rate did not allow for any observation of the neurological abnormalities. A later model introduced a brain-wide deletion only of ADK, succesfully recapitulating the increased seizures and behavioral/learning abnormalities commonly observed in human probands.\nIn summary, ADK is definitively associated with autosomal recessive adenosine kinase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
