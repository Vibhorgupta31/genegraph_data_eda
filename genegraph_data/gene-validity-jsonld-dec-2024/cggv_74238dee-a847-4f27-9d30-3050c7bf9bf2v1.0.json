We identified a heterozygous splice-acceptor-site mutation in intron 5 (c.631-2A-->G) of the DSC2 gene, which led to the use of a cryptic splice-acceptor site and the creation of a downstream premature termination codon. Quantitative analysis of cardiac DSC2 expression in patient specimens revealed a marked reduction in the abundance of the mutant transcript. Morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos revealed a requirement for dsc2 in the establishment of the normal myocardial structure and function, with reduced desmosomal plaque area, loss of the desmosome extracellular electron-dense midlines, and associated myocardial contractility defects.

We have determined the full cDNA sequence of a murine desmocollin, the homologue of human and bovine type 2 desmocollins (DSC2), and studied its tissue distribution and expression in stratified epithelia. An 8.5 day mouse embryo cDNA library was screened yielding overlapping clones which encoded the mouse DSC2. This gene has an open reading frame of 2710 base pairs (bp) encoding a polypeptide of 902 amino acids (aa). The polypeptide comprises a signal peptide, a precursor peptide, and a mature protein of 766 aa having an extracellular domain of 549 aa, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain of 184 aa. Like other desmocollins, murine DSC2 has two products, Dsc2a and Dsc2b, produced by alternative splicing of a 46 bp exon which encodes 11 COOH-terminal aa followed by an in-frame stop codon. Inclusion of this exon forms Dsc2b which is 54 aa shorter than Dsc2a. Mouse Dsc2a shows 75.7% amino acid identity to human and 63.3% identity to bovine Dsc2a. The mouse desmocollin is also homologous to the cadherins; 32.2% to the most closely related typical cadherin, human N-cadherin. DSC2 is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial tissues and the heart of adult mice and from the blastocyst stage of development. In situ hybridization shows that the gene is most strongly expressed suprabasally in stratified epithelia, similar to the expression of bovine DSC2.","dc:creator":"Lorimer JE","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Cloning, sequence analysis and expression pattern of mouse desmocollin 2 (DSC2), a cadherin-like adhesion molecule."},"rdfs:label":"Lorimer 1994 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e1db8d8c-8d6d-4d85-9b4e-1c5aa84550f5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f8325856-45ce-4926-8c0a-96941cb45025","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Expression of DSC2a and DSC2b isoforms in different human tissues was examined by PCR amplification of cDNAs including the heart, brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney and pancreas","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20197793","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been reported to cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D), an autosomal-dominant disease characterised by progressive myocardial atrophy with fibro-fatty replacement. We screened 112 ARVC/D probands for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2) gene and detected two different amino-acid substitutions (p.E102K, p.I345T) and a frameshift variation (p.A897KfsX4) in 7 (6.2%) patients. DSC2a variant p.A897KfsX4, previously reported as a p.E896fsX900 mutation, was identified in five unrelated probands. Four of them were found to carry one or two mutations in different ARVC/D genes. Unexpectedly, p.A897KfsX4 variation was also found in 6 (1.5%) out of 400 control chromosomes. In vitro functional studies showed that, unlike wild-type DSC2a, this C-terminal mutated protein was localised in the cytoplasm. p.A897KfsX4 variation affects the last five amino acids of the DSC2a isoform but not of DSC2b. In contrast with what we found in other human tissues, in the heart DSC2b is more expressed than DSC2a, suggesting that relative deficiency of DSC2a might be compensated by isoform b. In conclusion, DSC2 gene mutations are not frequently involved in ARVC/D. The p.A897KfsX4 variation, identified in several Italian healthy control subjects, which affects only one of the two DSC2 isoforms, may be considered a rare variant, though possibly affecting phenotypic expression of concomitant ARVC/D mutations.","dc:creator":"De Bortoli M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"The p.A897KfsX4 frameshift variation in desmocollin-2 is not a causative mutation in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"De Bortoli 2010 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e533b586-a2ac-4010-aab2-97449642c27c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:850ed9a9-3acd-4018-a33a-cde6f9c4b200","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Used GST-pulldown in rat heart lysates to show that DSC2 interacts with PKP2 and JUP.

Variants in DSC2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2006 (Syrris et al., PMID: 17033975). At least 13 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\ndata and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 8.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 17963498,  21062920, 23863954, 17186466, 18957847, 17033975). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interactions. In summary, DSC2 is definitively associated with ARVD (AD) and ARVD with mild palmoplantar keratoderma with or without woolly hair (AR). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
