Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in hERG, and patients with LQT2 are susceptible to severe ventricular arrhythmias. We have previously shown that nonsense and frameshift LQT2 mutations caused a decrease in mutant mRNA by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. The Q81X nonsense mutation was recently found to be resistant to NMD. Translation of Q81X is reinitiated at Met(124), resulting in the generation of NH2-terminally truncated hERG channels with altered gating properties. In the present study, we identified two additional NMD-resistant LQT2 nonsense mutations, C39X and C44X, in which translation is reinitiated at Met(60). Deletion of the first 59 residues of the channel truncated nearly one-third of the highly structured Per-Arnt-Sim domain and resulted in the generation of trafficking-defective proteins and a complete loss of hERG current. Partial deletion of the Per-Arnt-Sim domain also resulted in the accelerated degradation of the mutant channel proteins. The coexpression of mutant and wild-type channels did not significantly disrupt the function and trafficking properties of wild-type hERG. Our present findings indicate that translation reinitiation may generate trafficking-defective as well as dysfunctional channels in patients with LQT2 premature termination codon mutations that occur early in the coding sequence.","dc:creator":"Stump MR","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"LQT2 nonsense mutations generate trafficking defective NH2-terminally truncated channels by the reinitiation of translation."},"rdfs:label":"Cell line transfection of mutant KCNH2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:462eeb4e-357d-4c3d-89f0-e386ac0d011b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1e0128e1-e50e-4c08-8958-63f2cad96e15","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:79308621-62ca-4615-8caf-89133e12e3b0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"The benign and wildtype forms of the protein rescue the phenotype of the knockdown zebrafish.

Accordingly, strategies that could reroute the mutated channels to the membrane should be sufficient to restore the electrical properties of the affected cells, thereby suppressing the underlying arrhythmia. We identified here both, embryonic and adult zebrafish breakdance (bre) as a valuable model for human Long-QT syndrome. Electrocardiograms of adult homozygous bre mutants exhibit significant QT prolongation caused by delayed repolarization of the ventricle. We further show that the bre mutation (zERG(I59S)) disrupts ERG protein trafficking, thereby reducing the amount of active potassium channels on the cell membrane. Interestingly, improvement of channel trafficking by cisapride or dimethylsulfoxid is sufficient to reconstitute ERG channels on the cell membrane in a manner that suffices to suppress the Long-QT induced arrhythmia in breakdance mutant zebrafish.
