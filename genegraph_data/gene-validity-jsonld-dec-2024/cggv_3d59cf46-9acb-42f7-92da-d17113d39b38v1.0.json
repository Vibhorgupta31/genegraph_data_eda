Both αβ and γδ TCRs also contain several invariant chains, including CD3δ, which support surface TCR expression and transduce the TCR signal. Mutations in variable chains would be expected to affect a single T cell lineage, while mutations in the invariant chains would affect all T cells. Consistent with this, all CD3δ-deficient patients described to date showed a complete block in T cell development. However, CD3δ-KO mice have an αβ T cell-specific defect. Here, we report 2 unrelated cases of SCID with a selective block in αβ but not in γδ T cell development, associated with a new splicing mutation in the CD3D gene. The patients' T cells showed reduced CD3D transcripts, CD3δ proteins, surface TCR, and early TCR signaling. Their lymph nodes showed severe T cell depletion, recent thymus emigrants in peripheral blood were strongly decreased, and the scant αβ T cells were oligoclonal. T cell-dependent B cell functions were also impaired, despite the presence of normal B cell numbers. Strikingly, despite the specific loss of αβ T cells, surface TCR expression was more reduced in γδ than in αβ T cells. Analysis of individuals with this CD3D mutation thus demonstrates the contrasting CD3δ requirements for αβ versus γδ T cell development and TCR expression in humans and highlights the diagnostic and clinical relevance of studying both TCR isotypes when a T cell defect is suspected.","dc:creator":"Gil J","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A leaky mutation in CD3D differentially affects αβ and γδ T cells and leads to a Tαβ-Tγδ+B+NK+ human SCID."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient BII.2"},{"id":"cggv:ba8f4194-ce9b-445a-b65e-8dd5e5eb5eb9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba8f4194-ce9b-445a-b65e-8dd5e5eb5eb9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ba8f4194-ce9b-445a-b65e-8dd5e5eb5eb9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"RT-PCR in patient and family member cells showed short CD3D PCR products.

Patients and affected fetuses from 2 families were homozygous for a mutation in the CD3D gene, and patients from the third family were homozygous for a mutation in the CD3E gene. The thymus from a CD3delta-deficient fetus was analyzed and revealed that T cell differentiation was blocked at entry into the double positive (CD4+CD8+) stage with the accumulation of intermediate CD4-single positive cells. This indicates that CD3delta plays an essential role in promoting progression of early thymocytes toward double-positive stage. Altogether, these findings extend the known molecular mechanisms underlying severe combined immunodeficiency to a new deficiency, i.e., CD3epsilon deficiency, and emphasize the essential roles played by the CD3epsilon and CD3delta subunits in human thymocyte development, since these subunits associate with both the pre-TCR and the TCR.","dc:creator":"de Saint Basile G","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Severe combined immunodeficiency caused by deficiency in either the delta or the epsilon subunit of CD3."}},"rdfs:label":"PII-2"},{"id":"cggv:5bfd8fc8-df78-44cc-b581-e4b08e0a3208","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5bfd8fc8-df78-44cc-b581-e4b08e0a3208_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"c.279C>A (p.Cys93Ter) is predicted NMD+.

It has long been realized that immunohistochemistry can add an important new level of information on top of morphology and that protein expression patterns in a cancer may yield crucial diagnostic and prognostic information. We have generated an immunohistochemistry-based map of protein expression profiles in normal tissues, cancer and cell lines. For each antibody, altogether 708 spots of tissues and cells are analysed and the resulting images and data are presented as freely available in the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org). The new version 4 of the atlas, including more than 5 million images of immunohistochemically stained tissues and cells, is based on 6122 antibodies, representing 5011 human proteins encoded by approximately 25% of the human genome. The gene-centric database includes a putative classification of proteins in various protein classes, both functional classes, such as kinases or transcription factors and project-related classes, such as candidate genes for cancer or cardiovascular diseases. For each of the internally generated antibodies, the exact antigen sequence is presented, together with a visualization of application-specific validation data, including a protein array assay, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and, in most cases, immunofluorescent-based confocal microscopy. The updated version also includes new search algorithms to allow complex queries regarding expression profiles, protein classes and chromosome location. Thus, the presented Human Protein Atlas provides a resource for pathology-based biomedical research, including protein science and biomarker discovery.","dc:creator":"Pontén F","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The Human Protein Atlas--a tool for pathology."},"rdfs:label":"Human Protein Atlas Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:17d1cab7-6907-43e0-97d0-1edd6df98dde","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f19cc3a-91f2-4f2e-98e1-dd83953567ef","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Cryo-electron microscopy is used to visualize the T cell receptor-CD3 complex.

The structure contains the complete extracellular domains and all the transmembrane helices of TCR-CD3. The octameric TCR-CD3 complex is assembled with 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry of TCRαβ:CD3γε:CD3δε:CD3ζζ. Assembly of the extracellular domains of TCR-CD3 is mediated by the constant domains and connecting peptides of TCRαβ that pack against CD3γε-CD3δε, forming a trimer-like structure proximal to the plasma membrane. The transmembrane segment of the CD3 complex adopts a barrel-like structure formed by interaction of the two transmembrane helices of CD3ζζ with those of CD3γε and CD3δε. Insertion of the transmembrane helices of TCRαβ into the barrel-like structure via both hydrophobic and ionic interactions results in transmembrane assembly of the TCR-CD3 complex. Together, our data reveal the structural basis for TCR-CD3 complex assembly, providing clues to TCR triggering and a foundation for rational design of immunotherapies that target the complex.","dc:creator":"Dong","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Structural basis of assembly of the human T cell receptor-CD3 complex."},"rdfs:label":"T cell receptor-CD3 complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3d59cf46-9acb-42f7-92da-d17113d39b38_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb4e43fd-b1e6-4f37-894e-11f1fe865c23","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f8eb8317-f2b8-4fb8-9fe2-27b8bcb50bb9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The TCR complexes of knockdown cells do not incorporate CD247 or CD3E.

During T cell development, TCR-mediated signalling promotes the transition from one developmental stage to the next and controls whether a thymocyte undergoes positive or negative selection. The roles of particular CD3 components in these events remain unclear. Indeed, it is unknown whether they have specialized or overlapping roles. However, the multiplicity of CD3 components and their evolutionary conservation suggest that they serve distinct functions. Here the developmental requirement for the CD3 delta chain is analyzed by generating a mouse line specifically lacking this component (delta-/- mice). Strikingly, CD3 delta is shown to be differentially required during development. In particular, CD3 delta is not needed for steps in development mediated by pre-TCR or gamma delta TCR, but is required for further development of thymocytes expressing alpha beta TCR. Absence of CD3 delta specifically blocks the thymic selection processes that mediate the transition from the double-positive to single-positive stages of development.","dc:creator":"Dave VP","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"CD3 delta deficiency arrests development of the alpha beta but not the gamma delta T cell lineage."},"rdfs:label":"Dave Rescue Assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f695f563-5c58-464c-b7cf-3e148bb784e2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:24d06974-81e0-49a6-86ca-627ac6953f75","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This mouse model and humans with CD3D deficiency both have abnormal thymocyte development.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9135151","rdfs:label":"Dave Knock Out Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4375,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ef0d6d6b-7e55-468d-86bf-d71f8ac3042f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014280","gene":"hgnc:1673","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CD3D was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 19 in 2003 (Dadi et al., PMID: 14602880). Immunodeficiency 19 is a T-B+NK+ severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Six variants (nonsense, splice site, and intronic) that have been reported in 6 probands in 6 publications are included in this curation (PMID: 14602880, 15546002, 15729559, 28916186, 33628209, 21926461). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Affected individuals typically present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections and very low T cell counts. Hypomorphic phenotypes including Omenn syndrome and leaky SCID with a selective block in alpha beta but not in gamma delta T cell development have also been reported (PMID: 33628209, 21926461). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, protein interactions, functional assays, an animal model, and a rescue assay (PMIDs: 18853439, 31461748, 34249896, 15546002, 9135151). CD3D is expressed in lymphoid tissues and encodes the delta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex (PMID: 18853439). The TCR is made up of multiple other CD3 chains including epsilon (CD3E gene), gamma (CD3G gene), and zeta (CD247) (PMID: 31461748). We have previously established that these three genes; CD3E, CD3G, and CD247; are definitively associated with severe combined immunodeficiency. A Jurkat cell line with knocked down CD3D shows impaired cell surface expression of TCR complexes, and patient T cells with a CD3D homozygous loss of function variant have blocked T cell differentiation (PMID: 34249896, 15546002). CD3D knockout mice show abnormal alpha beta T cell development which is restored with a CD3D transgene (PMID: 9135151).\n\nIn summary, CD3D is definitively associated with autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 19. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on April 21, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3d59cf46-9acb-42f7-92da-d17113d39b38"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
