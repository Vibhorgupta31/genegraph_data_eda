Here we show that biallelic pathogenic variations in DNAJB11 lead to a severe fetal disease including enlarged cystic kidneys, dilation and proliferation of pancreatic duct cells, and liver ductal plate malformation, an association known as Ivemark II syndrome. Cysts of the kidney were developed exclusively from uromodulin negative tubular segments. In addition, tubular cells from the affected kidneys had elongated primary cilia, a finding previously reported in ciliopathies. Thus, our data show that the recessive disease associated with DNAJB11 variations is a ciliopathy rather than a disease of the autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease spectrum, and prompt screening of DNAJB11 in fetal hyperechogenic/cystic kidneys.","dc:creator":"Jordan P","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Bi-allelic pathogenic variations in DNAJB11 cause Ivemark II syndrome, a renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia."},"rdfs:label":"ARL13B Staining of Primary Cilia"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:42197b67-3c9d-47e6-b9c2-d6d3ef076acc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42197b67-3c9d-47e6-b9c2-d6d3ef076acc_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:44f211b4-e570-4fd2-b147-ee78e4b436b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:44f211b4-e570-4fd2-b147-ee78e4b436b6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":23,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0c6bbeb1-ac91-454d-93fa-db55964b95a9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016306.6(DNAJB11):c.600-2A>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1328423"}},"detectionMethod":"Analysis of 94 genes involved in renal ciliopathies was completed.

This gene-disease association is supported by an expression study. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship between *DNAJB11* and autosomal recessive ciliopathy.
