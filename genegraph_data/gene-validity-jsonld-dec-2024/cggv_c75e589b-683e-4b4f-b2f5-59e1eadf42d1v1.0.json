EEC and AEC are caused by heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor p63 encoded by TP63. Here, we report a patient with an EEC/AEC syndrome-like phenotype, including ankyloblepharon, ED, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, syndactyly, additional hypogammaglobulinemia, and growth delay. Neither pathogenic mutations in TP63 nor CNVs at the TP63 locus were identified. Exome sequencing revealed de novo heterozygous variants in CHUK (conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase), PTGER4, and IFIT2. While the variant in PTGER4 might contribute to the immunodeficiency and growth delay, the variant in CHUK appeared to be most relevant for the EEC/AEC-like phenotype. CHUK is a direct target gene of p63 and encodes a component of the IKK complex that plays a key role in NF-κB pathway activation. The identified CHUK variant (g.101980394T>C; c.425A>G; p.His142Arg) is located in the kinase domain which is responsible for the phosphorylation activity of the protein. The variant may affect CHUK function and thus contribute to the disease phenotype in three ways: (1) the variant exhibits a dominant negative effect and results in an inactive IKK complex that affects the canonical NF-κB pathway; (2) it affects the feedback loop of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways that are CHUK kinase activity-dependent; and (3) it disrupts NF-κB independent epidermal development that is often p63-dependent. Therefore, we propose that the heterozygous CHUK variant is highly likely to be causative to the EEC/AEC-like and additional hypogammaglobulinemia phenotypes in the patient presented here.","dc:creator":"Khandelwal KD","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Identification of a de novo variant in CHUK in a patient with an EEC/AEC syndrome-like phenotype and hypogammaglobulinemia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c75e589b-683e-4b4f-b2f5-59e1eadf42d1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c75e589b-683e-4b4f-b2f5-59e1eadf42d1_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.6},{"id":"cggv:85c45b5d-00a2-4c01-9859-c51c63b3f147_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85c45b5d-00a2-4c01-9859-c51c63b3f147","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:16afd6e2-ffef-4ccc-9bba-4d4651a22b7e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001278.5(CHUK):c.1739A>G (p.Tyr580Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA378148833"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0006532","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0002110","obo:HP_0001399","obo:HP_0011842","obo:HP_0010976","obo:HP_0004313","obo:HP_0001581","obo:HP_0002028"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1939119a-2da4-4079-b801-e5ef31d3d073_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:16afd6e2-ffef-4ccc-9bba-4d4651a22b7e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34533979","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase alpha (IKKα) is critical for p100/NF-κB2 phosphorylation and processing into p52 and activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway.

There are no documented phenotypes reported in carriers of these variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, expression studies, rescue, and in vitro functional assays,) (PMIDs: 29523099, 34533979, 38798321-pre-print). Expression studies and in vitro functional assays show that non-canonical NF-kB signaling is impaired through the disruption of NIK binding and lack of p100 processing. Expression studies from the pre-print, Riller et al., (2024) showcases that introduction of wildtype CHUK sequence is able to rescue p100 processing and increase nuclear translocation of RELB in transduced fibroblasts (PMID:38798321-pre-print). Animal models are able to capture proband phenotypes and showcase reduced mature B cells, a severe reduction in serum IgG and IgA levels, a reduction in memory and effector T cells, inability to respond to immunization, and recurrent infections.  \u000b\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between CHUK and autosomal recessive Popliteal pteryium syndrome, Bartoscas-Papas type 2. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
