We have now devised a method to screen the entire coding sequence and flanking splice junctions of FBN1. On completion for a panel of nine probands with classic MFS, six new mutations were identified that accounted for disease in seven (78%) of nine patients. Nine additional new mutations have been characterized in the early stages of a larger screening project. These 15 mutations were equally distributed throughout the gene and, with one exception, were specific to single families. One-third of mutations created premature termination codons, and 6 of 15 substituted residues with putative significance for calcium binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Mutations causing severe and rapidly progressive disease that presents in the neonatal period can occur in a larger region of the gene than previously demonstrated, and the nature of the mutation is as important a determinant as its location, in predisposing to this phenotype.","dc:creator":"Nijbroek G","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Fifteen novel FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome detected by heteroduplex analysis of genomic amplicons."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7611299","rdfs:label":"Case-5782T>C"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1aeb84c1-1166-4794-8b0a-01eef74be542_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2caaa9c7-f2a1-4d03-b72f-aa2551d7b5ce","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Heteroduplex analysis  and restriction enzyme digest (gain of a NlaIII site) was used to identify the FBN1 mutation.","phenotypeFreeText":"This individual presents with classic Marfan syndrome with ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular problems (per Beighton et al., 1988).","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:1aeb84c1-1166-4794-8b0a-01eef74be542_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4496476c-16fc-4287-a9c7-81369b8ecaca","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000015.10:g.48474320T>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16602235"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7611299"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7611299","rdfs:label":"Case-4145A>G"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0a19ab5d-550e-4edd-ba16-1f4bb0c84e27_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5dd439a4-470a-4c29-aebb-98cfa6e3399d","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Heteroduplex analysis and allele specific oligonucleotides were used to identify the FBN1 mutation.","phenotypeFreeText":"These individuals present with classic Marfan syndrome with ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular problems (per Beighton et al., 1988).","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Linkage analysis to confirm FBN1 mutations on chromosome 15 segregated with Marfan syndrome in family.","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:0a19ab5d-550e-4edd-ba16-1f4bb0c84e27_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:3abbc83d-dbec-40cd-9150-07acfe2353e4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000015.10:g.48492539A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16602233"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7611299"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7611299","rdfs:label":"Case-2776T>C"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d3fc0bea-4d6e-449e-885c-b204e6a0b2bf_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ef15989e-ebe9-4d0a-b367-e18b3333926d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:75599537-4653-43e2-8ee6-c6faf4397dfd","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Heteroduplex analysis was used to identify the FBN1 mutation.

Following the identification of fibrillin (a glycoprotein component of the extracellular microfibril), immunohistopathological quantification of the protein in skin and fibroblast culture, and examination of fibrillin synthesis, extracellular transport, and incorporation into the extracellular matrix (D.

Little is known about the composition of the microfibrils or the factors responsible for their spatial organization into tissue-specific macroaggregates. Recent work has revealed the existence of two structurally related microfibrillar components, termed fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2. The functional relationships between these glycoproteins and between them and other components of the microfibrils and elastic fibers are obscure. As a first step toward elucidating these important points, we compared the expression pattern of the fibrillin genes during mammalian embryogenesis. The results revealed that the two genes are differentially expressed, in terms of both developmental stages and tissue distribution. In the majority of cases, fibrillin-2 transcripts appear earlier and accumulate for a shorter period of time than fibrillin-1 transcripts. Synthesis of fibrillin-1 correlates with late morphogenesis and the appearance of well-defined organ structures; fibrillin-2 synthesis, on the other hand, coincides with early morphogenesis and, in particular, with the beginning of elastogenesis. The findings lend indirect support to our original hypothesis stating that fibrillins contribute to the compositional and functional heterogeneity of the microfibrils. The available evidence is also consistent with the notion that the fibrillins might have distinct, but related roles in microfibril physiology. Accordingly, we propose that fibrillin-1 provides mostly force-bearing structural support, whereas fibrillin-2 predominantly regulates the early process of elastic fiber assembly.","dc:creator":"Zhang H","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Developmental expression of fibrillin genes suggests heterogeneity of extracellular microfibrils."},"rdfs:label":"FBN1 expression in the developing mouse embryo"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1bdd8383-fb46-4c5d-96b9-2d2db039312c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b452334-660d-4c81-9e2c-4637c3c822dc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The expression pattern of FBN1 was investigated in human embryonic/ fetal tissue beginning at 5 weeks gestational age, until 12 weeks gestational age by immunohistochemcial staining with an antibody against FBN1 in human tissue.

Mutations in the fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 genes are responsible for the phenotypical manifestations of Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly respectively, which emphasizes their essential roles in developmental processes of various tissues. Consistent with this last notion, organ culture experiments have indirectly suggested morphogenic roles for fibrillins in lung and kidney development. In order to contribute to the understanding of the roles of fibrillins in developmental and morphogenetic events, we have investigated the distribution of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 in human embryonic and early fetal tissues between the 5th and the 12th gestational week, i.e. at the beginning of organogenesis. Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 were localized immunohistochemically using specific monoclonal antibodies, mAb 69 and mAb 48, respectively. Both fibrillins are widely distributed in various human anlagen, from early developmental stages. In most embryonic and early fetal human organs such as skin, lung, heart, aorta, central nervous system anlage, nerves, and ganglia, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 follow the same temporo-spatial pattern of distribution. However, in other organs such as kidney, liver, rib anlagen, notochord fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 are distributed differentially. The present paper is focused on this aspect. These results suggest different roles for fibrillin-1 and -2 in the development of these structures.","dc:creator":"Quondamatteo F","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 in human embryonic and early fetal development."},"rdfs:label":"FBN1 expression in embryonic and early fetal human tissues"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ae894b49-4400-479d-ac23-8718c6a92e44","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b4c94c6-d66c-4095-9fd0-fb0acaf0148d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"TGFBR1 is associated with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome that has similar phenotypes as Marfan.

In MFS and LDS, the cardiovascular manifestations account for the major cause of patient morbidity and mortality, rendering them the main target for therapeutic intervention. Over the past decades, gene identification studies confidently linked the aforementioned syndromes, as well as nonsyndromic aneurysmal disease, to genetic defects in proteins related to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway, greatly expanding our knowledge on the disease mechanisms and providing us with novel therapeutic targets. As a result, the focus of the developing pharmacological treatment strategies is shifting from hemodynamic stress management to TGF-β antagonism.

The majority of mutations affecting the human fibrillin-1 gene, FBN1, result in Marfan syndrome (MFS), a common connective tissue disorder characterised by tall stature, ocular and cardiovascular defects. Recently, stiff skin syndrome (SSS) and a group of syndromes known collectively as the acromelic dysplasias, which typically result in short stature, skin thickening and joint stiffness, have been linked to FBN1 mutations that affect specific domains of the fibrillin-1 protein. Despite their apparent phenotypic differences, dysregulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is a common factor in all of these disorders. Using a newly developed assay to track the secretion and incorporation of full-length, GFP-tagged fibrillin-1 into the extracellular matrix, we investigated whether or not there were differences in the secretion and microfibril assembly profiles of fibrillin-1 variants containing substitutions associated with MFS, SSS or the acromelic dysplasias. We show that substitutions in fibrillin-1 domains TB4 and TB5 that cause SSS and the acromelic dysplasias do not prevent fibrillin-1 from being secreted or assembled into microfibrils, whereas MFS-associated substitutions in these domains result in a loss of recombinant protein in the culture medium and no association with microfibrils. These results suggest fundamental differences in the dominant pathogenic mechanisms underlying MFS, SSS and the acromelic dysplasias, which give rise to TGFβ dysregulation associated with these diseases.","dc:creator":"Jensen SA","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"A microfibril assembly assay identifies different mechanisms of dominance underlying Marfan syndrome, stiff skin syndrome and acromelic dysplasias."},"rdfs:label":"Reduced FBN1 microfibril incorporation in MFS mutants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Because they used two different cell lines to show that the problem was with secretion and incorporation, and not with levels of expression of the constructs."},{"id":"cggv:ea7188fb-1612-4710-a24b-09be3fea4597","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa2ae5bd-d5df-4f4d-a477-656c46dbcfb4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"iPSCs cell lines from control and MFS (Marfan syndrome) patients were differentiated into smooth muscle cells (SMC).

A dominant-negative mechanism has been inferred based upon dominant inheritance, mulitimerization of monomers to form microfibrils, and the dramatic paucity of matrix-incorporated fibrillin-1 seen in heterozygous patient samples. Yeast artificial chromosome-based transgenesis was used to overexpress a disease-associated mutant form of human fibrillin-1 (C1663R) on a normal mouse background. Remarkably, these mice failed to show any abnormalities of cellular or clinical phenotype despite regulated overexpression of mutant protein in relevant tissues and developmental stages and direct evidence that mouse and human fibrillin-1 interact with high efficiency. Immunostaining with a human-specific mAb provides what we believe to be the first demonstration that mutant fibrillin-1 can participate in productive microfibrillar assembly. Informatively, use of homologous recombination to generate mice heterozygous for a comparable missense mutation (C1039G) revealed impaired microfibrillar deposition, skeletal deformity, and progressive deterioration of aortic wall architecture, comparable to characteristics of the human condition. These data are consistent with a model that invokes haploinsufficiency for WT fibrillin-1, rather than production of mutant protein, as the primary determinant of failed microfibrillar assembly.

The nomenclature for Marfan syndrome is ascribed to Antoine Marfan, \nwho described a individual with part of the phenotypic features associated with the greater syndrome in  1896  (reviewed in Gott 1998, PMID: 9798380). \nMarfan syndrome a multisystemic disorder affecting mainly the connective tissue. Marfan comprises a broad phenotypic spectrum and severity and thus represents \na continuum of disease (reviewed in Dietz 1991, Marfan GeneReviews, PMID: 20301510). Cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal phenotypes \nrepresent the most common phenotypic manifestations among individuals diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. The cardiovascular \nphenotypes, including dilatation of the aorta, are the areas that represent the major morbidity and mortality of Marfan syndrome. \nOver 1800 variants  have been identified in FBN1 (Collod-Beroud et al., 2003 PMID: 12938084), including missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site, small deletions, and large deletions, according to two databases that house variant information: (1) The UMD-FBN1 database (http://www.umd.be/FBN1/); and (2) the LOVD FBN1 database (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/FBN1). The mechanism for the gene-disease relationship is protein loss of function, as mutation in the the FBN1 protein, fibrillin, results in the inability of the protein to be excreted from cells to help in the formation and stabilization of connective tissue (Sakai et al., 1986, PMID: 3536967). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, functional data, and model organisms. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for more than 20 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data is available and the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) and experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. In particular, earlier compelling evidence suggestive of the gene-disease relationship, such as linkage data, may not be reflected in the current curation.\n\nIn summary, FBN1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Marfan syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was reviewed by the FBN1 VCEP with final approval by the ClinGen General GCEP on March 4, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d3fc0bea-4d6e-449e-885c-b204e6a0b2bf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
