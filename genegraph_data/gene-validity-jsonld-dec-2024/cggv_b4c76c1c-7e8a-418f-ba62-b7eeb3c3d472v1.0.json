However, the genetic basis of other phenotypes remains unknown. We studied peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) gene as a candidate gene in seven FPL patients who did not appear to have Dunnigan variety. Analysis of the coding region of PPARG revealed C to T heterozygous mutation at nucleotide 1273 in exon 6 which changes a highly conserved residue, arginine at position 425 to cysteine (R425C) in the patient FX200.21. The patient is a 64-year-old nonHispanic white woman who developed diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia at age 32 years and lipodystrophy of the extremities and face at age 50 years. She also had hirsutism. Anthropometry and whole body magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked loss of sc fat particularly from the extremities but sc truncal fat was slightly increased.

We report a three-generation Canadian kindred ascertained based upon partial lipodystrophy, with a normal LMNA gene sequence. Candidate gene sequencing showed that all four affected subjects were heterozygous for a novel T-->A mutation at PPARG nucleotide 1164 in exon 5 that predicted substitution of phenylalanine at codon 388 by leucine (F388L). The mutation was absent from normal family members and normal unrelated subjects, and altered a highly conserved residue within helix 8 of the predicted ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-gamma. The mutant receptor had significantly decreased basal transcriptional activity and impaired stimulation by a synthetic ligand. The germline transmission of a transactivation-deficient mutation in PPARG suggests that autosomal dominant partial lipodystrophy is genetically heterogeneous.

Although these agents can bind and activate an orphan nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), there is no direct evidence to conclusively implicate this receptor in the regulation of mammalian glucose homeostasis. Here we report two different heterozygous mutations in the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma in three subjects with severe insulin resistance. In the PPARgamma crystal structure, the mutations destabilize helix 12 which mediates transactivation. Consistent with this, both receptor mutants are markedly transcriptionally impaired and, moreover, are able to inhibit the action of coexpressed wild-type PPARgamma in a dominant negative manner. In addition to insulin resistance, all three subjects developed type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension at an unusually early age.

We identified a family with a severe form of FPLD3 with never-reported clinical features and a novel mutation affecting the DNA binding domain of PPARγ (E157D). Apart from the lipodystrophy and severe metabolic syndrome, individuals presented musculoskeletal and hematological issues. E157D heterozygotes had a muscular habitus yet displayed muscle weakness and myopathy. Also, E157D heterozygotes presented multiple cytopenias and a susceptibility to autoimmune disease. In vitro studies showed that the E157D mutation does not decrease the receptor's affinity to classical PPAR response elements or its responsiveness to a PPARγ agonist, yet it severely reduces its target gene transcription. Microarray experiments demonstrated a decreased activation of a wide array of genes, including genes involved in the PPAR response, the immune response, hematopoiesis, and metabolism in muscle. In addition, a subset of genes with cryptic PPAR response elements was activated. In summary, we describe a large family with a novel PPARγ mutation, which extends the clinical phenotype of FPLD3 to include muscular, immune, and hematological features. Together, our results support the role of PPARγ in controlling homeostasis of multiple systems beyond lipid metabolism.","dc:creator":"Campeau PM","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular characterization of a severe form of partial lipodystrophy expanding the phenotype of PPARγ deficiency."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Campeau proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:c471b547-8523-4617-9aa3-7de15a030b0e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c471b547-8523-4617-9aa3-7de15a030b0e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c471b547-8523-4617-9aa3-7de15a030b0e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The novel mutation E157D changes an amino acid in the DNA-binding site of PPARγ, and results in reduced activation of a wide range of classical PPARγ target genes with normal DNA binding and no dominant negative effect."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:b4c76c1c-7e8a-418f-ba62-b7eeb3c3d472_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4c76c1c-7e8a-418f-ba62-b7eeb3c3d472_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f206ff10-70b0-4cab-a8e0-fe09e38bdefe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a253cd4-badc-4bff-b63f-0617b1cce178","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"detected via RNA-Seq; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309898","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Global classification of the human proteins with regards to spatial expression patterns across organs and tissues is important for studies of human biology and disease.

We have now curated the inheritance pattern for *PPARG*-related lipodystrophy as semidominant because, while most cases are autosomal dominant, very rarely a recessive mode of inheritance has been reported (Dyment et al, PMID:24980513; Gosseaume et al, PMID:36806620). \n\nBoth loss of function and dominant negative variants have been reported.  Typical autosomal dominant cases due to heterozygous variants present with loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, especially of the limbs, and metabolic complications, in a form of familial partial lipodystrophy (Chen et al et al, PMID:35422762; PMID:36806620; Vasandani et al, PMID:36397776). The occasional recessive cases typically feature early-onset, congenital generalized lipodystrophy, also known as Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, due to biallelic variants in *PPARG* (PMIDs:24980513, 36806620). \n\nAt least 60 lipodystrophy-causing *PPARG* variants (primarily missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting the association of this gene with lipodystrophy includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. **The aggregated score for case-level and segregation data is 12 points.** Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 35 probands in 14 publications (PMIDs: 17766367, 24980513, 16965332, 10622252, 17299075, 29622583, 35422762, 17011503, 12453919, 11788685, 22750678, 34168618, 36806620, 36397776), with most cases presenting as familial partial lipodystrophy and two cases with congenital, generalized lipodystrophy. More evidence is available to support the gene-disease association in the literature, but as the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached this has not been curated exhaustively. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays (both individual and massively parallel), expression studies and functional alterations. **Total points for the experimental evidence are 4. Total points for genetic and experimental evidence together are thus 16.**\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found both differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability, but also overlap in the implicated variants. Specifically, *PPARG* has two associated diseases, namely the more commonly associated autosomal dominant familial partial lipodystrophy (OMIM:604367), and the more rarely associated autosomal recessive congenital, generalized lipodystrophy.  Because the latter is rare and there is overlap in the implicated variants, these two entities have been lumped in a single curation of lipodystrophy (MONDO: 0006573).  \n\nIn summary, *PPARG* is definitively associated with semidominant lipodystrophy, with most cases presenting as autosomal dominant familial partial lipodystrophy in adolescents and young adults. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b4c76c1c-7e8a-418f-ba62-b7eeb3c3d472"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
