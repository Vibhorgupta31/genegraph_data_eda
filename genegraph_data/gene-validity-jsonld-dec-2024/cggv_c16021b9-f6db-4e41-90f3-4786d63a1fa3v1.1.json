A severe neonatal form and a milder late-onset variant are described. We report a novel ASL pseudogene located in the centromeric region of chromosome 7, 14 novel mutations in the ASL gene, and a novel intronic polymorphism found in a cohort of Italian patients. Our approach relied exclusively on genomic DNA analysis. We found seven missense mutations, two nonsense, three small insertions/deletions, and two splicing mutations. Only two patients harbored previously described mutations, and among the novel variants only two were present in more than one kindred. The pathogenicity of the splicing mutations was demonstrated by a functional splicing assay that employed a hybrid minigene. We also performed molecular modeling using the reported three-dimensional structure of ASL to predict the functional consequences of the missense mutations. There was no genotype-phenotype correlation. Patients with neonatal onset display developmental delay and seizures despite adequate metabolic control. Moreover, hepatomegaly, fibrosis, and abnormal liver function tests are common complications in these patients, but not in patients with the late infancy form. We stress the importance of mutation analysis in patients with ASAuria, to confirm the clinical diagnosis, and to perform DNA-based prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies of these families.","dc:creator":"Trevisson E","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency: mutational spectrum in Italian patients and identification of a novel ASL pseudogene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17326097","rdfs:label":"Patient 5a"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Population maximum minor allele frequency for c.91G>A (p.Asp31Asn) = 0.00003250 (S.

We previously established by complementation analysis that 28 ASAL-deficient patients have heterogeneous mutations in a single gene. To prove that the ASAL structural gene is the affected locus, we sequenced polymerase chain reaction-amplified ASAL cDNA of a representative mutant from the single complementation group. Fibroblast strain 944 (approximately 1% of residual ASAL activity), from a late-onset patient who was the product of a consanguineous mating, had only a single base-pair change in the coding region, a C-283----T transition at a CpG dinucleotide in exon 3. This substitution converts Arg-95 to Cys (R95C), occurs in a stretch of 13 residues that is identical in yeast and human ASAL, and was present in both of the patient's alleles but not in 14 other mutant or 10 normal alleles. Expression in COS cells demonstrated that the R95C mutation produces normal amounts of ASAL mRNA but little protein and less than 1% ASAL activity. We observed that amplified cDNA from mutant 944 and normal cells (liver, keratinocytes, lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts) contained, in addition to the expected 5' 513-base-pair band, a prominent 318-base-pair ASAL band formed by the splicing of exon 2 from the transcript. The short transcript maintains the ASAL reading frame but removes Lys-51, a residue that may be essential for catalysis, since it binds the argininosuccinate substrate. We conclude (i) that the identification of the R95C mutation in strain 944 demonstrates that virtually all ASAL deficiency results from defects in the ASAL structural gene and (ii) that minor alternative splicing of the coding region occurs at the ASAL locus.","dc:creator":"Walker DC","dc:date":"1990","dc:title":"Molecular analysis of human argininosuccinate lyase: mutant characterization and alternative splicing of the coding region."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2263616","rdfs:label":"944"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Variant is not listed in gnomAD.\nExpression of ASL p.Arg95Cys in COS cells revealed barely detectable activity when compared to wild type.

Administration of nitrite, which can be converted into NO in vivo, rescued the manifestations of NO deficiency in hypomorphic Asl mice, and a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-independent NO donor restored NO-dependent vascular reactivity in humans with ASL deficiency. Mechanistic studies showed that ASL has a structural function in addition to its catalytic activity, by which it contributes to the formation of a multiprotein complex required for NO production.

It is an essential component of the urea cycle, providing a pathway for the disposal of excess nitrogen in mammals. AL links the urea cycle to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by generating fumarate. Finally, AL is required for the endogenous production of arginine. In this latter role it may function outside ureagenic organs to provide arginine as a substrate for nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Increasing evidence suggests that argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) and AL are more globally expressed, and the coordinate regulation of AS and AL gene expression with that of the inducible form of NOS (iNOS) provides evidence that this may facilitate the regulation of NOS activity. Deficiency of AL leads to the human urea cycle disorder argininosuccinic aciduria. We produced an AL deficient mouse by gene targeting in order to investigate the role of AL in endogenous arginine production. This mouse also provides a model of the human disorder to explore the pathogenesis of the disorder and possible new treatments. Metabolic studies of these mice demonstrated that they have the same biochemical phenotype as humans, with hyperammonemia, elevated plasma argininosuccinic acid and low plasma arginine.

Supporting evidence includes case-level data (12 points) and experimental data (6 points). Variants in this gene were curated from 3 publications (Walker et al. 1990, PMID 2263616; Trevisson et al. 2007, PMID 17326097; Trevisson et al, 2009; PMID 19703900). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of the gene product, argininosuccinate lyase (PMIDs 4732887, 21312326, 22081021, 31110235), and by the clinical and biochemical features observed in a null and hypomorphic mouse models (PMIDs 12559843, 22081021).
