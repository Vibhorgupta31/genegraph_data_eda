Using a positional cloning strategy, we have identified mutations in the gene Grxcr1 (glutaredoxin cysteine-rich 1) in five independent allelic strains of pirouette mice. We also provide sequence data of GRXCR1 from humans with profound hearing loss suggesting that pirouette is a model for studying the mechanism of nonsyndromic deafness DFNB25. Grxcr1 encodes a 290 amino acid protein that contains a region of similarity to glutaredoxin proteins and a cysteine-rich region at its C terminus. Grxcr1 is expressed in sensory epithelia of the inner ear, and its encoded protein is localized along the length of stereocilia, the actin-filament-rich mechanosensory structures at the apical surface of auditory and vestibular hair cells. The precise architecture of hair cell stereocilia is essential for normal hearing. Loss of function of Grxcr1 in homozygous pirouette mice results in abnormally thin and slightly shortened stereocilia. When overexpressed in transfected cells, GRXCR1 localizes along the length of actin-filament-rich structures at the dorsal-apical surface and induces structures with greater actin filament content and/or increased lengths in a subset of cells. Our results suggest that deafness in pirouette mutants is associated with loss of GRXCR1 function in modulating actin cytoskeletal architecture in the developing stereocilia of sensory hair cells.","dc:creator":"Odeh H","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in Grxcr1 are the basis for inner ear dysfunction in the pirouette mouse."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20137774","rdfs:label":"Family B Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because variant is a predicted polymorphism by computational tools."},{"id":"cggv:ce94f276-cfab-43cb-b4eb-fc01b207cf05_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2a6cbb14-a4da-41f8-9bc7-ee12fe2445b2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":41,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000408","obo:HP_0002321","obo:HP_0001751"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ce94f276-cfab-43cb-b4eb-fc01b207cf05_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:eba5ea40-e947-429a-b495-4820dd196524","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000004.12:g.42962946C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2904401"}},{"id":"cggv:235f7b77-604c-4e0e-9b8c-7ee85446e5a0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000004.12:g.43030451C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2904532"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25802247","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We identified 2 patients in 1 family who had novel mutations in GRXCR1, which caused progressive hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Mori K","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Novel mutation in GRXCR1 at DFNB25 lead to progressive hearing loss and dizziness."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25802247","rdfs:label":"Family number 972 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:fd614749-db91-4541-b2e7-0d69aeab21d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3fabe612-8dd2-452c-b13f-0e4044b576ee","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000399","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:fd614749-db91-4541-b2e7-0d69aeab21d6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:8ead8497-df64-421c-bb1e-83f5b9967766","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000004.12:g.42963075C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA356792475"}},{"id":"cggv:eba5ea40-e947-429a-b495-4820dd196524"}],"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969326","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans, affecting 1 in 500 newborns.

Only one of the families, W98-053, was not consanguineous, and its sibship pointed toward a reduced critical region of 0.9 Mb. This region contained the GRXCR1 gene, and the orthologous mouse gene was described to be mutated in the pirouette (pi) mutant with resulting hearing loss and circling behavior. Sequence analysis of the GRXCR1 gene in hearing-impaired family members revealed splice-site mutations in two Dutch families and a missense and nonsense mutation, respectively, in two Pakistani families. The splice-site mutations are predicted to cause frameshifts and premature stop codons. In family W98-053, this could be confirmed by cDNA analysis. GRXCR1 is predicted to contain a GRX-like domain. GRX domains are involved in reversible S-glutathionylation of proteins and thereby in the modulation of activity and/or localization of these proteins. The missense mutation is located in this domain, whereas the nonsense and splice-site mutations may result in complete or partial absence of the GRX-like domain or of the complete protein. Hearing loss in patients with GRXCR1 mutations is congenital and is moderate to profound. Progression of the hearing loss was observed in family W98-053. Vestibular dysfunction was observed in some but not all affected individuals.

Variants in GRXCR1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2010 (Schraders et al.). At least 7 missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 5 publications (20137778, 25802247, 26226137, 26445815, 26969326). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 6 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by relevant expression and protein interaction studies, as well as multiple mouse models published by Odeh et al. 2010. In summary, GRXCR1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 4/24/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4becaf23-4b72-4dd1-a5aa-4deccbb394ea"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
