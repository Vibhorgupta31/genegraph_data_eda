Therefore, the prevalence of the various genetic causes of congenital myopathies is largely unknown. In our cohort of 94 patients with congenital myopathy, two related female patients and two sporadic, male patients were found to carry mutations in the tropomyosin 2 (TPM2) and tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) genes, respectively. This indicates a low (4.3%) frequency of TPM2 and TPM3 mutations as a cause of congenital myopathy. Compared to previously described patients carrying the same mutations as found in our study (c.503G>A, and c.502C>T in TPM3, and c.415_417delGAG in TPM2), clinical presentation and muscle morphological findings differed in our patients. Differences included variation in distribution of muscle weakness, presence of scoliosis and ptosis, physical performance and joint contractures. The variation in clinical profiles emphasizes the phenotypic heterogeneity. However, common features were also present, such as onset of symptoms in infancy or childhood, musculoskeletal deformities and normal or low plasma levels of creatine kinase. One patient had nemaline myopathy and fiber size disproportion, while three patients had congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) on muscle biopsies. TPM2-related CFTD has only been described in two cases, indicating that mutations in TPM2 are rare causes of CFTD.

We have identified a TPM2 mutation, p.K7del, in five unrelated families with nemaline myopathy and a consistent distinctive clinical phenotype. Patients develop large joint contractures during childhood, followed by slowly progressive skeletal muscle weakness during adulthood. The TPM2 p.K7del mutation results in the loss of a highly conserved lysine residue near the N-terminus of β-tropomyosin, which is predicted to disrupt head-to-tail polymerization of tropomyosin. Recombinant K7del-β-tropomyosin incorporates poorly into sarcomeres in C2C12 myotubes and has a reduced affinity for actin. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of patient muscle and primary patient cultured myotubes showed that mutant protein is expressed but incorporates poorly into sarcomeres and likely accumulates in nemaline rods. In vitro studies using recombinant K7del-β-tropomyosin and force measurements from single dissected patient myofibres showed increased myofilament calcium sensitivity. Together these data indicate that p.K7del is a common recurrent TPM2 mutation associated with mild nemaline myopathy. The p.K7del mutation likely disrupts head-to-tail polymerization of tropomyosin, which impairs incorporation into sarcomeres and also affects the equilibrium of the troponin/tropomyosin-dependent calcium switch of muscle. Joint contractures may stem from chronic muscle hypercontraction due to increased myofibrillar calcium sensitivity while declining strength in adulthood likely arises from other mechanisms, such as myofibre decompensation and fatty infiltration. These results suggest that patients may benefit from therapies that reduce skeletal muscle calcium sensitivity, and we highlight late muscle decompensation as an important cause of morbidity.","dc:creator":"Mokbel N","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"K7del is a common TPM2 gene mutation associated with nemaline myopathy and raised myofibre calcium sensitivity."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23378224","rdfs:label":"MO7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Due to the sufficient phenotypic evidence and ample variant-level evidence, this proband earns a default score."},{"id":"cggv:aaae8231-2bf5-4dad-a7fa-dddcb379f8bf_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07c391a8-0cde-477f-8c62-adc424b39e22","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted and the entire coding sequences of ACTA1, TNNI1, TNNT1, TNNC1, TPM2, and TPM3 were determined in Patient 1.

These DNA probes were used to define the regulation of the corresponding mRNAs during the process of myogenesis. Tropomyosin regulation was compared with that of beta- and gamma-actin. No two striated muscle-specific tropomyosin mRNAs are coordinately accumulated during myogenesis nor in adult striated muscles. Similarly, no two nonmuscle tropomyosins are coordinately repressed during myogenesis. However, mRNAs encoding the 248 amino acid nonmuscle tropomyosins and beta- and gamma-actin are more persistent in adult skeletal muscle than those encoding the 284 amino acid nonmuscle tropomyosins. In particular, the nonmuscle tropomyosin Tm4 is expressed at similar levels in adult rat nonmuscle and striated muscle tissues. We conclude that each tropomyosin mRNA has its own unique determinants of accumulation and that the 248 amino acid nonmuscle tropomyosins may have a role in the architecture of the adult myofiber. The variable regulation of nonmuscle isoforms during myogenesis suggests that the different isoforms compete for inclusion into cellular structures and that compensating autoregulation of mRNA levels bring gene expression into alignment with the competitiveness of each individual gene product.

In this study, we expand the allelic spectrum of β-tropomyosin-related myopathies through the identification of a novel β-tropomyosin mutation in two clinical contexts not previously associated with β-tropomyosin. The first clinical phenotype is core-rod myopathy, with a β-tropomyosin mutation uncovered by whole exome sequencing in a family with autosomal dominant distal myopathy and muscle biopsy features of both minicores and nemaline rods. The second phenotype, observed in four unrelated families, is autosomal dominant trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome (distal arthrogryposis type 7; previously associated exclusively with myosin heavy chain 8 mutations). In all four families, the mutation identified was a novel 3-bp in-frame deletion (c.20_22del) that results in deletion of a conserved lysine at the seventh amino acid position (p.K7del). This is the first mutation identified in the extreme N-terminus of β-tropomyosin. To understand the potential pathogenic mechanism(s) underlying this mutation, we performed both computational analysis and in vivo modelling. Our theoretical model predicts that the mutation disrupts the N-terminus of the α-helices of dimeric β-tropomyosin, a change predicted to alter protein-protein binding between β-tropomyosin and other molecules and to disturb head-to-tail polymerization of β-tropomyosin dimers. To create an in vivo model, we expressed wild-type or p.K7del β-tropomyosin in the developing zebrafish. p.K7del β-tropomyosin fails to localize properly within the thin filament compartment and its expression alters sarcomere length, suggesting that the mutation interferes with head-to-tail β-tropomyosin polymerization and with overall sarcomeric structure.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 11738357, 17434307, 23378224, 19047562, 17846275). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Although there is not a significant genotype-phenotype correlation, the mechanism for disease is variable depending on the type of mutation and the resulting calcium sensitivity. Some variants can interfere with actin-myosin interactions, while others can affect calcium sensitivity in two distinct ways. One type of variant leads to a heterozygous loss of function, with tropomyosin not responding to calcium stimulation and causing a hypocontractile phenotype generally characterized by congenital muscle weakness and hypotonia. Another, less common, type of variant leads to a heteroygous gain of function with tropomyosin increasing the response to calcium stimulation and causing a hypercontractile phenotype generally characterized by congenital muscle stiffness and later-onset weakness/hypotonia.\nThis gene-disease association is supported by several pieces of experimental evidence including the relationship between TPM2's function and the resulting phenotypes of nemaline myopathy, the association with ACTA1, the primary expression of TPM2 in the skeletal muscle, and expression of mutant variants in human myoblast cells, mouse myoblast cells, and zebrafish with the resulting phenotypes reflecting those in humans. In summary, TPM2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant TPM2-Related Myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathy Working Group on 12/23/20 (SOP Version 7).\n\nLumping and Splitting: Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no likely difference in the inheritance patterns underlying the disease entities: (1) Arthrogryposis, distal, type 1A (MIM: 108120); (2) Arthrogryposis, distal, type 2B4 (MIM:108120); (3) CAP myopathy 2 (MIM:609285); and (4) Nemaline myopathy 4, autosomal dominant (MIM:609285). There are distinct molecular mechanisms that can vary by mutation, however without a clear genotype-phenotype correlation this evidence is not enough to classify these entities differently. There is no clear correlation outside of a shared variant between (3) and (4) (Martilla, 2014 PMID: 24692096; Li, 2018 PMID: 30285720). Recent evidence has shown that TPM2 is likely expressed and is integral during prenatal development, which may cause the phenotypes displayed in the distal arthrogryposis. The phenotypes are markedly different, with (1) and (2) displaying a set of deformities that are rarely seen in (3) and (4) such as overlapping fingers and absent flexion creases while displaying few of the muscular phenotypes such as muscle weakness, gait difficulty, or cap structures. The two types of arthrogryposis have also been separately reviewed and recommended to consider them phenotypic extremes of the same disorder (Beck, 2013 PMID: 23401156). Therefore, we have lumped the myopathies together and the two types of arthrogryposis together, but split these two resulting groups apart. Of note, there are three other entities that were asserted after the lumping and splitting process: (5) Arthrogryposis, distal, type 7 (MIM: 158300); (6) Myopathy, congenital, with fiber-type disproportion (MIM: 255310); and (7) Multiple Pterygium Syndrome, Escobar Variant (MIM: 265000). Of these, (5)/(7) should be lumped with (1)/(2) and (6) should be lumped with (3)/(4) based on L&S criteria. All of these later assertions have minimal published evidence, so it is possible this should be revisited once more evidence is available.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f137b6cf-247a-4af0-b41f-6cb976239175"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
