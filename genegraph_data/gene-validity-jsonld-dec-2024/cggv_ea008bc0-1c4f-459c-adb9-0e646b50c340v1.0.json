From a cohort of >5,000 families affected by neurodevelopmental disorders, we identified six consanguineous families harboring homozygous inactivating variants in MBOAT7, encoding lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase (LPIAT1). Subjects presented with ID frequently accompanied by epilepsy and autistic features. LPIAT1 is a membrane-bound phospholipid-remodeling enzyme that transfers arachidonic acid (AA) to lysophosphatidylinositol to produce AA-containing phosphatidylinositol. This study suggests a role for AA-containing phosphatidylinositols in the development of ID accompanied by epilepsy and autistic features.","dc:creator":"Johansen A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in MBOAT7, Encoding Lysophosphatidylinositol Acyltransferase I, Lead to Intellectual Disability Accompanied by Epilepsy and Autistic Features."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea008bc0-1c4f-459c-adb9-0e646b50c340_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea008bc0-1c4f-459c-adb9-0e646b50c340_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:609e1bc6-f052-4fce-aa43-375f469fd48a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bc8e3a56-f57d-45ce-bcc0-0ba23b0b6e89","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Cortical atrophy is a recurrent phenotype observed in humans","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23097495","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dietary arachidonic acid (AA) has roles in growth, neuronal development, and cognitive function in infants. AA is remarkably enriched in phosphatidylinositol (PI), an important constituent of biological membranes in mammals; however, the physiological significance of AA-containing PI remains unknown. In an RNA interference-based genetic screen using Caenorhabditis elegans, we recently cloned mboa-7 as an acyltransferase that selectively incorporates AA into PI. Here we show that lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1, also known as MBOAT7), the closest mammalian homologue, plays a crucial role in brain development in mice. Lpiat1(-/-) mice show almost no LPIAT activity with arachidonoyl-CoA as an acyl donor and show reduced AA contents in PI and PI phosphates. Lpiat1(-/-) mice die within a month and show atrophy of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals disordered cortical lamination and delayed neuronal migration in the cortex of E18.5 Lpiat1(-/-) mice. LPIAT1 deficiency also causes disordered neuronal processes in the cortex and reduced neurite outgrowth in vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AA-containing PI/PI phosphates play an important role in normal cortical lamination during brain development in mice.","dc:creator":"Lee HC","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"LPIAT1 regulates arachidonic acid content in phosphatidylinositol and is required for cortical lamination in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Knock-out MBOAT7 mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ea008bc0-1c4f-459c-adb9-0e646b50c340_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84a67540-23d8-4951-a3e6-fc12529d99cb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84a67540-23d8-4951-a3e6-fc12529d99cb","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c826a21f-9ba1-49d3-a722-2110499b5052","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024298.5(MBOAT7):c.126_145del (p.Leu43HisfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA309369063"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0032794","obo:HP_0001249"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:37949602-bdea-44f1-b447-93e979e3c4a4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c826a21f-9ba1-49d3-a722-2110499b5052"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27616480"},"rdfs:label":"Family 1 - Proabnd"},{"id":"cggv:37949602-bdea-44f1-b447-93e979e3c4a4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37949602-bdea-44f1-b447-93e979e3c4a4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ad082a2e-81d4-4651-b0a1-b38db616b982_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad082a2e-81d4-4651-b0a1-b38db616b982","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:1081bdb6-65ed-4d48-a21e-44f1ccb3f848","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024298.5(MBOAT7):c.758_778del (p.Glu253_Ala259del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA309346602"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002120","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0010818"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:f7091f74-b898-46ce-bca2-3677855ac282_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1081bdb6-65ed-4d48-a21e-44f1ccb3f848"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27616480"},"rdfs:label":"Family 2 - Proband"},{"id":"cggv:f7091f74-b898-46ce-bca2-3677855ac282","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7091f74-b898-46ce-bca2-3677855ac282_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ea008bc0-1c4f-459c-adb9-0e646b50c340_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:c3c50a72-b5c3-46e4-a28c-927e84ea2ff1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3c50a72-b5c3-46e4-a28c-927e84ea2ff1","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ce2d3cd5-8ccf-484a-a50e-e8fb514e8582","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024298.5(MBOAT7):c.1062C>A (p.Tyr354Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA407792416"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011166","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0008936","obo:HP_0000729","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0033725"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:87f7c533-88c3-4e6b-9bcf-d46943335279_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ce2d3cd5-8ccf-484a-a50e-e8fb514e8582"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32645526","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7) gene codes for an enzyme involved in regulating arachidonic acid incorporation in lysophosphatidylinositol.

Accumulating evidences obtained from human genetic studies have shown that MBOAT7 is also involved in fatty liver disease. Here we identified two novel homozygous variants in MBOAT7, NM_024298.5: c.1062C>A; p.(Tyr354*) and c.1135del; p.(Leu379Trpfs*9), in two unrelated Iranian families by means of whole exome sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the identified variants and also to investigate whether they co-segregate with the patients' phenotypes. To understand the functional consequences of these changes, we overexpressed recombinant wild type MBOAT7 and mutants in vitro and showed these mutations resulted in abolished protein synthesis and expression, indicating a complete loss of function. Albeit, we did not trace any liver diseases in our patients, but presence of globus pallidus signal changes in Magnetic Resonance Images might be indicative of metabolic changes as a result of loss of MBOAT7 expression in hepatic cells. These signal changes could also help as an important marker of MBOAT7 deficiency while analyzing the genomic data of patients with similar phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Heidari E","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Identification of novel loss of function variants in MBOAT7 resulting in intellectual disability."}},"rdfs:label":"Family A - Proband"},{"id":"cggv:87f7c533-88c3-4e6b-9bcf-d46943335279","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87f7c533-88c3-4e6b-9bcf-d46943335279_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:87f7c533-88c3-4e6b-9bcf-d46943335279_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Using HepG2 cells, western blot showed absent protein"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3e7c85c3-e67d-4849-b9c7-647e67ffa5cc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e7c85c3-e67d-4849-b9c7-647e67ffa5cc","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:284424d2-178a-4693-884b-126d7c6f291e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024298.5(MBOAT7):c.855-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA407793133"}},"detectionMethod":"exome trio","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0000729","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001249"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:6926995e-00f5-4126-93f9-fd17291e9af2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:284424d2-178a-4693-884b-126d7c6f291e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31282596","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"MBOAT7 gene pathogenic variants are a newly discovered and rare cause for intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), seizures, truncal hypotonia, appendicular hypertonia, and below average head sizes (ranging from -1 to -3 standard deviations).

Probands with variants in *MBOAT7* frequently have the phenotypic features of moderate to severe developmental delay, absent speech, infant-onset epilepsy, truncal hypotonia and autistic features. Eight variants (nonsense, frameshift and splice-site) that have been reported in ten probands in four publications (PMIDs: 27616480, 32645526, 31282596, 3335874) are included in this curation. All variants described were homozygous, and one variant, c.758_778del, was reported in three unrelated families. More evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 30701556), but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported as loss of function (PMID: 27616480). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knock-out Mboat7 mouse model (PMID: 23097495). This model showed complete ablation of Mboat7 enzyme activity, an absence of the protein in brain tissue, and displayed atrophy of the cerebral cortex, disordered cortical lamination, and delayed neuron migration. Additionally, expression of two disease-related variants in HepG2 cells (p.(Tyr354*) and p.(Leu379Trpfs*9)) showed absent Mboat7 protein on western blot (PMID: 32645526). \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *MBOAT7* and autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on the meeting date November 21, 2023 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ea008bc0-1c4f-459c-adb9-0e646b50c340"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
