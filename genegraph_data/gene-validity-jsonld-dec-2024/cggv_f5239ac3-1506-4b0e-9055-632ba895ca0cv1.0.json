Through whole-exome sequencing of a hearing-impaired individual from each family, missense mutations were identified at highly conserved residues of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS): the c.1129G>A (p.Asp377Asn) variant was found in one family, and the c.517T>C (p.Tyr173His) variant was found in the other two families. Both variants were predicted to be damaging by multiple bioinformatics tools. The two variants both segregated with the nonsyndromic-hearing-impairment phenotype within the three families, and neither mutation was identified in ethnically matched controls or within variant databases. Individuals homozygous for KARS mutations had symmetric, severe hearing impairment across all frequencies but did not show evidence of auditory or limb neuropathy. It has been demonstrated that KARS is expressed in hair cells of zebrafish, chickens, and mice. Moreover, KARS has strong localization to the spiral ligament region of the cochlea, as well as to Deiters' cells, the sulcus epithelium, the basilar membrane, and the surface of the spiral limbus. It is hypothesized that KARS variants affect aminoacylation in inner-ear cells by interfering with binding activity to tRNA or p38 and with tetramer formation. The identification of rare KARS variants in ARNSHI-affected families defines a gene that is associated with ARNSHI.","dc:creator":"Santos-Cortez RL","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in KARS, encoding lysyl-tRNA synthetase, cause autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment DFNB89."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in chicken, zebrafish, mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3884e9eb-14d3-4206-bee8-5e6d787efcfd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:68adfca0-b747-4877-9fb7-5150d7876047","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Physical interaction.

In a previous study, we found Hint to be associated with MITF in mast cells and showed that it suppresses MITF's transcriptional activity. Here, we have found that lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is also associated with MITF and forms a multicomplex with MITF and Hint. We have also shown that Ap4A, an endogenous molecule consisting of two adenosine linked by four phosphate which is known to be synthesized by LysRS, is accumulated intracellularily above 700 microM in IgE-Ag-activated mast cells, binds to Hint, liberates MITF, and thus leads to the activation of MITF-dependent gene expression. This implies that LysRS plays a key role via Ap4A as an important signaling molecule in MITF transcriptional activity.","dc:creator":"Lee YN","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"The function of lysyl-tRNA synthetase and Ap4A as signaling regulators of MITF activity in FcepsilonRI-activated mast cells."},"rdfs:label":"Lee-MITF"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:f5239ac3-1506-4b0e-9055-632ba895ca0c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f5239ac3-1506-4b0e-9055-632ba895ca0c_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab4c1e81-d0e3-4641-9493-333f7e0ccfb4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5214f2c7-af52-4260-bbe9-0de18af008fc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"detectionMethod":"Screened 144 deafness and 108 leukoencephalopathy genes","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"phenotypeFreeText":"early onset hearing loss","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002352","obo:HP_0001268","obo:HP_0000399"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:ab4c1e81-d0e3-4641-9493-333f7e0ccfb4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:af32d3b3-839c-4d84-8ef0-17f1a2c9c6f9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005548.2(KARS):c.[1430G>A];[1513C>T]","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/437932"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28887846","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Leukoencephalopathies are a broad class of common neurologic deterioration for which the etiology remains unsolved in many cases. In a Chinese Han family segregated with sensorineural hearing loss and leukoencephalopathy, candidate pathogenic variants were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing of 144 genes associated with deafness and 108 genes with leukoencephalopathy. Novel compound heterozygous mutations p.R477H and p.P505S were identified in KARS, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), as the only candidate causative variants. These two mutations were functionally characterized by enzymatic assays, immunofluorescence, circular dichroism analysis, and gel filtration chromatography. Despite no alteration in the dimer-tetramer oligomerization and cellular distribution by either mutation, the protein structure was notably influenced by the R477H mutation, which subsequently released the protein from the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC). Mutant LysRSs with the R477H and P505S mutations had decreased tRNA(Lys) aminoacylation and displayed a cumulative effect when introduced simultaneously. Our studies showed that mutations in KARS lead to a newly defined subtype of leukoencephalopathy associated with sensorineural hearing impairment. The combined effect of reduced aminoacylation and release of LysRS from the MSC likely underlies the pathogenesis of the KARS mutations identified in this study.","dc:creator":"Zhou XL","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations in KARS cause early-onset hearing loss and leukoencephalopathy: Potential pathogenic mechanism."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28887846","rdfs:label":"Zhou Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variants absent from gnomAD.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 4 missense variants have been reported in humans. KARS was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2013 (Santos-Cortez et al.). Association is seen in at least 4 probands in 2 publications (23768514, 28887846). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by expression and protein interaction studies. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. Variants in KARS have been associated with a wide range of other phenotypes, including peripheral neuropathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitochondrial disease, and developmental delays. While linkage analysis provides strong evidence for the DFNB89 locus, there is not strong evidence that KARS is the causative gene in this interval.
