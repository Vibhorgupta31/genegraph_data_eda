Two children presented with febrile seizures followed by developmental delay, clumsiness and epilepsy. At age 2 and 8 years a biochemical and genetic diagnosis of hyperlysinemia type I was confirmed and lysine-restricted diet was started in both cases. Three years after initiation of lysine restriction, case 1 had not suffered further seizures. In case 2, tremor and dysmetria improved, but fine motor clumsiness persisted. Mild cognitive impairment was present in both patients despite dietary treatment. Laboratory studies: Plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid amino acid concentrations were measured by ion exchange chromatography. Mutation analysis of the AASS gene was performed by directly sequencing the PCR products. The plasma lysine values were higher than 1200 μmol/L in both cases. Additionally, an increase in dibasic aminoaciduria was observed. Lysine restriction decreased plasma lysine values and nearly normalised dibasic aminoaciduria. Mutational screening of the AASS gene revealed that case 1 was a compound heterozygote for c.2662 + 1_2662 + 5delGTAAGinsTT and c.874A>G and that case 2 was a compound heterozygote for c.976_977delCA and c.1925C>G. In conclusion, we present two children with hyperlysinemia type I and neurological impairment in which implementation of lysine-restricted diet achieved a mild improvement of symptoms but did not reverse cognitive impairment. The partial decrease of lysine concentrations and the normalisation of urine excretion of dibasic amino acids after lysine restriction further reinforce the possibility of this therapeutic intervention, although further investigations seem necessary.","dc:creator":"Tondo M","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Clinical, biochemical, molecular and therapeutic aspects of 2 new cases of 2-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:99e3bea9-1bcf-496c-9039-a5afed627cc7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d509b61b-4f1c-4042-b65a-b245adbf3158"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23890588"}],"rdfs:label":"Case 2"},{"id":"cggv:31cbd680-6944-4869-835e-dbcea4a64aae","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31cbd680-6944-4869-835e-dbcea4a64aae_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The maternal nonsense variant Ser642Ter occurs in exon 18 and is expected to result in NMD."},{"id":"cggv:99e3bea9-1bcf-496c-9039-a5afed627cc7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:99e3bea9-1bcf-496c-9039-a5afed627cc7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The paternal frameshift variant Gln326fs generates a premature stop codon 28 residues downstream, in exon 10 and is predicted to cause NMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8eb2e45d-6e80-4a4f-ab15-5db5eac26db8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8eb2e45d-6e80-4a4f-ab15-5db5eac26db8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9f45bdaa-e896-4d7c-a801-0be7f71d27d8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"XR_001744523.1(AASS):n.1089G>A (undefined)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA165931292"}},"detectionMethod":"NGS panel for inborn error of metabolism.

We designed a gene panel targeting 614 genes causing inborn errors of metabolism and tested its diagnostic efficacy in a paediatric cohort of 30 undiagnosed patients presenting with variable neurometabolic phenotypes. Genetic defects that could, at least partially, explain observed phenotypes were identified in 53% of cases. Where biochemical abnormalities pointing towards a particular gene defect were present, our panel identified diagnoses in 89% of patients. Phenotypes attributable to defects in more than one gene were seen in 13% of cases. The ability of in silico tools, including structure-guided prediction programmes to characterize novel missense variants were also interrogated. Our study expands the genetic, clinical and biochemical phenotypes of well-characterized (POMGNT1, TPP1) and recently identified disorders (PGAP2, ACSF3, SERAC1, AFG3L2, DPYS).

Defects in one or both of these activities result in familial hyperlysinemia, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by hyperlysinemia, lysinuria, and variable saccharopinuria. In yeast, lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase are encoded by the LYS1 and LYS9 genes, respectively, and we searched the available sequence databases for their human homologues. We identified a single cDNA that encoded an apparently bifunctional protein, with the N-terminal half similar to that of yeast LYS1 and with the C-terminal half similar to that of yeast LYS9. This bifunctional protein has previously been referred to as \"alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase,\" and we have tentatively designated this gene \"AASS.\" The AASS cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2,781 bp predicted to encode a 927-amino-acid-long protein. The gene has been sequenced and contains 24 exons scattered over 68 kb and maps to chromosome 7q31.3. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of several transcripts in all tissues examined, with the highest expression occurring in the liver. We sequenced the genomic DNA from a single patient with hyperlysinemia (JJa). The patient is the product of a consanguineous mating and is homozygous for an out-of-frame 9-bp deletion in exon 15, which results in a premature stop codon at position 534 of the protein. On the basis of these and other results, we propose that AASS catalyzes the first two steps of the major lysine-degradation pathway in human cells and that inactivating mutations in the AASS gene are a cause of hyperlysinemia.","dc:creator":"Sacksteder KA","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Identification of the alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase gene, which is defective in familial hyperlysinemia."}},"rdfs:label":"JJa"},{"id":"cggv:2fad445c-e320-4131-b1c4-cc5081131293","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2fad445c-e320-4131-b1c4-cc5081131293_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous, by consanguinity, nonsense variant Cys534Ter generates a premature stop codon in exon 15 and is expected to result in NMD.

Using a standardized phenotyping platform that incorporates high-resolution 3D imaging, we identify phenotypes at multiple time points for previously uncharacterized genes and additional phenotypes for genes with previously reported mutant phenotypes. Unexpectedly, our analysis reveals that incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are common even on a defined genetic background. In addition, we show that human disease genes are enriched for essential genes, thus providing a dataset that facilitates the prioritization and validation of mutations identified in clinical sequencing efforts.","dc:creator":"Dickinson ME","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"High-throughput discovery of novel developmental phenotypes."},"rdfs:label":"KO Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The knockout mouse model was evaluated as part of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, it has not been published and does not recapitulate human disease."},{"id":"cggv:c7d559af-f302-4c2f-9225-a97b6ccbe8b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af285815-5bac-48dd-bf13-3272f01ac352","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Aass mutant male and female mice carrying the R65Q mutation in α-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) domain have an elevated cerebral lysine level and a normal brain development.

At least 13 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23890588, 10775527, 27604308, 23570448). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Saccharopinuria but no putative causal variants have been identified in patients. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function in lysine catabolism and a knock-in mouse model which recapitulates the human phenotype of hyperlysinemia (PMID: 35135854). In summary, *AASS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive hyperlysinemia.
