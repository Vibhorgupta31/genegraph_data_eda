Although JBTS was first described more than 40 years ago in French Canadian siblings, the causal mutations have not yet been identified in this family nor in most French Canadian individuals subsequently described. We ascertained a cluster of 16 JBTS-affected individuals from 11 families living in the Lower St. Lawrence region. SNP genotyping excluded the presence of a common homozygous mutation that would explain the clustering of these individuals. Exome sequencing performed on 15 subjects showed that nine affected individuals from seven families (including the original JBTS family) carried rare compound-heterozygous mutations in C5ORF42. Two missense variants (c.4006C>T [p.Arg1336Trp] and c.4690G>A [p.Ala1564Thr]) and a splicing mutation (c.7400+1G>A), which causes exon skipping, were found in multiple subjects that were not known to be related, whereas three other truncating mutations (c.6407del [p.Pro2136Hisfs*31], c.4804C>T [p.Arg1602*], and c.7477C>T [p.Arg2493*]) were identified in single individuals. None of the unaffected first-degree relatives were compound heterozygous for these mutations. Moreover, none of the six putative mutations were detected among 477 French Canadian controls. Our data suggest that mutations in C5ORF42 explain a large portion of French Canadian individuals with JBTS.","dc:creator":"Srour M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in C5ORF42 cause Joubert syndrome in the French Canadian population."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:954cdc22-7834-4876-a64e-27d56615c1ff_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b59deccb-e05a-449a-b282-ed2cb4c8e6a0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b59deccb-e05a-449a-b282-ed2cb4c8e6a0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":31,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:b15c6562-0a71-4985-8d60-502adeb37f77","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001384732.1(CPLANE1):c.8050G>A (p.Ala2684Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344567"}},{"id":"cggv:35b1e14d-1b20-4a43-9f7f-797b3a5db9db","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001384732.1(CPLANE1):c.4006C>T (p.Arg1336Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342791"}}],"detectionMethod":"Blood-derived genomic DNA was used to sequence the protein-coding exomes of all individuals which were aligned to hg19.

Because of the MTS, OFD VI belongs to the \"Joubert syndrome related disorders\". Its genetic aetiology remains largely unknown although mutations in the TMEM216 gene, responsible for Joubert (JBS2) and Meckel-Gruber (MKS2) syndromes, have been reported in two OFD VI patients. To explore the molecular cause(s) of OFD VI syndrome, we used an exome sequencing strategy in six unrelated families followed by Sanger sequencing. We identified a total of 14 novel mutations in the C5orf42 gene in 9/11 families with positive OFD VI diagnostic criteria including a severe fetal case with microphthalmia, cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum agenesis, polydactyly and skeletal dysplasia. C5orf42 mutations have already been reported in Joubert syndrome confirming that OFD VI and JBS are allelic disorders, thus enhancing our knowledge of the complex, highly heterogeneous nature of ciliopathies.

Here we report the first Jbts17 mutant mouse model, Heart Under Glass (Hug), recovered from a forward genetic screen. Exome sequencing identified Hug as a S235P missense mutation in the mouse homolog of JBTS17 (2410089e03rik). Hug mutants exhibit multiple birth defects typical of ciliopathies, including skeletal dysplasia, polydactyly, craniofacial anomalies, kidney cysts and eye defects. Some Hug mutants exhibit congenital heart defects ranging from mild pulmonary stenosis to severe pulmonary atresia. Immunostaining showed JBTS17 is localized in the cilia transition zone. Fibroblasts from Hug mutant mice and a JBTS patient with a JBTS17 mutation showed ciliogenesis defects. Significantly, Hug mutant fibroblasts showed loss of not only JBTS17, but also NPHP1 and CEP290 from the cilia transition zone. Hug mutants exhibited reduced ciliation in the cerebellum. This was associated with reduction in cerebellar foliation. Using a fibroblast wound-healing assay, we showed Hug mutant cells cannot establish cell polarity required for directional cell migration. However, stereocilia patterning was grossly normal in the cochlea, indicating planar cell polarity is not markedly affected. Overall, we showed the JBTS pathophysiology is replicated in the Hug mutant mice harboring a Jbts17 mutation. Our findings demonstrate JBTS17 is a cilia transition zone component that acts upstream of other Joubert syndrome associated transition zone proteins NPHP1 and CEP290, indicating its importance in the pathogenesis of Joubert syndrome.

Combining proteomics, in vivo imaging and genetic analysis of proteins linked to planar cell polarity (Inturned, Fuzzy and Wdpcp), we identified and characterized a new genetic module, which we term CPLANE (ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector), and an extensive associated protein network. CPLANE proteins physically and functionally interact with the poorly understood ciliopathy-associated protein Jbts17 at basal bodies, where they act to recruit a specific subset of IFT-A proteins. In the absence of CPLANE, defective IFT-A particles enter the axoneme and IFT-B trafficking is severely perturbed.

Joubert syndrome 17 is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in CPLANE1 on chromosome 5p13.2 and is characterized by a distinctive congenital malformation of the brainstem and agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, referred to as the molar tooth sign (MTS). Additionally, these findings are accompanied by hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia, developmental delays, abnormal respiratory pattern, and/or oculomotor apraxia. CPLANE1 has been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: Orofaciodigital syndrome type IV and Joubert Syndrome 17. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Orofaciodigital syndrome was shown to be a very rare subtype of Joubert syndrome 17 characterized by the neurological features of JS associated with orofacial anomalies, mesoaxial or preaxial polydactyly, Y-shaped metacarpals, and hypothalamic hamartomas. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Joubert Syndrome 17 (OMIM:614615). At least 30 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift,  deletion, duplication, and splice site) have been reported in 21 probands across 4 publications (PMID: 22425360; Lopez et al., 2014, PMID: 24178751; Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32233090; Zhang et al., 2021, PMID: 33822487) and included in this curation. The mechanism for disease has been noted to be loss of function, and it is suggested that at least one truncating mutation is needed to induce the phenotype. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship  is also supported by animal models, functional alteration studies, and rescue models. (Damerla et al., 2015, PMID: 25877302; Toriyama et al., 2016, PMID: 27158779). Mutant 'Hug' mice harboring a S253P variant at a highly conserved residue in the mouse homolog of CPLANE1 (2410089e03rik) were show to recapitulate phenotypes observed in Joubert syndrome 17 patients, including cleft lip/pallet, polydactyly, defects in the cerebellum, and cilia transition zone defects. Additionally, fibroblasts generated from an individual with Joubert syndrome with compound heterozygous JBTS17 variants demonstrated a lack of primary cilia formation compared to 90% ciliation in normal human fibroblast cells from a healthy control subject. Finally, full length WT-Jbts17 rescued the neural tube defects, ciliogenesis defects, and the loss of IFT-A basal body recruitment resulting from MO-based knockdown in Xenopus. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between CPLANE1 and autosomal recessive Joubert Syndrome 17. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 12.17.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:954cdc22-7834-4876-a64e-27d56615c1ff"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
