Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Biochemical function 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Can score 2 pts for 10+ gene products associated with mitochondrial translation function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:4a5d4050-143c-42ed-b3b8-1742fc86bd28_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d747e72-0188-4a6d-91fb-5dbb9e04b209","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00cc3ade-542a-4776-a508-223a846ce08d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"35S-methionine labeling of de novo mitochondrial protein synthesis in control and patient (P5) fibroblasts revealed an impairment in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Fig. 4A) and decreased steady-state levels of OXPHOS components (Fig. 4B).\n34140213: Friederich et al.

A 23-year-old individual with cardiac and skeletal myopathy, neurological involvement, and combined deficiency of OXPHOS complexes in skeletal muscle was clinically and genetically investigated. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data revealed a homozygous mutation in MRPL44 (c.467 T > G), which was not present in the biological father, and a region of homozygosity involving most of chromosome 2, raising the possibility of uniparental disomy. Short-tandem repeat and genome-wide SNP microarray analyses of the family trio confirmed complete maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 2. Mitochondrial ribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation were assessed in patient derived-fibroblasts. These studies confirmed that c.467 T > G affects the stability or assembly of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, leading to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis and decreased levels of multiple OXPHOS components. This study provides evidence of complete maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 2 in a patient with MRPL44-related disease, and confirms that MRLP44 mutations cause a mitochondrial translation defect that may present as a multisystem disorder with neurological involvement.","dc:creator":"Horga A","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 2 causing MRPL44-related multisystem mitochondrial disease."},"rdfs:label":"Functional alteration patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4a5d4050-143c-42ed-b3b8-1742fc86bd28_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b0f7bb7-f344-4722-93ed-2d03f8c0426f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d6fd5303-d3e2-4418-80d7-40edabf9079d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Restored MRPL44, COX1 subunit and COX holocomplex (complex IV) levels to control level (Fig 3A)\nRestored the ratio of assembled 16S to 12S ribosomal RNA to control levels\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23315540","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The genetic complexity of infantile cardiomyopathies is remarkable, and the importance of mitochondrial translation defects as a causative factor is only starting to be recognised.

Only recently, a homozygous missense mutation (c.467T > G, p.Leu156Arg) in MRPL44, encoding a protein of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, has been identified in two siblings with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Using exome sequencing, we identified two further unrelated patients harboring the previously reported mutation c.467T > G, p.Leu156Arg in MRPL44 in the homozygous state and compound heterozygous with a novel missense mutation c.233G > A, p.Arg78Gln, respectively.

Our findings expand the clinical spectrum associated with MRPL44 mutations and indicate that MRPL44-associated mitochondrial dysfunction can also manifest as a progressive multisystem disease with central nervous system involvement.

To date, five patients have been described with pathogenic variants in MRPL44, encoding the ml44 protein which is part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome). Three presented as infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mild lactic acidosis, and easy fatigue and muscle weakness, whereas two presented in adolescence with myopathy and neurological symptoms. We describe two infants who presented with cardiomyopathy from the neonatal period, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia and in one infant lactic acidosis. A decompensation of the cardiac function in the first year resulted in demise. Exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the MRPL44 gene including the known pathogenic variant c.467 T > G and two novel pathogenic variants. We document a combined respiratory chain enzyme deficiency with emphasis on complex I and IV, affecting heart muscle tissue more than skeletal muscle or fibroblasts. We show this to be caused by reduced mitochondrial DNA encoded protein synthesis affecting all subunits, and resulting in dysfunction of complex I and IV assembly. The degree of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction correlated with the impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis due to different pathogenic variants. These functional studies allow for improved understanding of the pathogenesis of MRPL44-associated mitochondrial disorder.","dc:creator":"Friederich MW","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Pathogenic

The MRPL44 gene encodes mitochondrial ribosomal protein L44, which is a component of the large subunit (39S) of the mitochondrial ribosome. \n\nThe *MRPL44 *gene was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 23315540). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MRPL44*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MRPL44* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants (3 missense, 1 frameshift) identified in six unrelated cases from four publications (PMIDs: 23315540, 25797485, 34140213, 33742325). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Of note, the c.467T>G, p.Leu156Arg variant has been identified in every case reported to date and may be a founder variant in the European population, although this has not been confirmed. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mitochondrial translation) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration studies in patient cells showing impaired synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, and rescue of the mitochondrial protein levels and large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit assembly in patient cells following expression of the wild type protein (PMIDs: 33340416, 33742325, 23315540). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MRPL44* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 7, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
