Our study presents the heterogeneous spectrum of genetic disorders in patients with microcephaly either in isolated form or in association with other neurological and extra-neural abnormalities. We present data of 91 patients from 87 unrelated families referred to our clinic during 2016-2020 and provide a comprehensive clinical and genetic landscape in the studied cohort. Molecular diagnosis using exome sequencing was made in 45 families giving a yield of 51.7%. In 9 additional families probable causative variants were detected. We identified disease causing variations in 49 genes that are involved in different functional pathways Among these, 36 had an autosomal recessive pattern, 8 had an autosomal dominant pattern (all inherited de novo), and 5 had an X-linked pattern. In 41 probands where sequence variations in autosomal recessive genes were identified 31 were homozygotes (including 16 from non-consanguineous families). The study added 28 novel pathogenic/likely pathogenic variations. The study also calls attention to phenotypic variability and expansion in spectrum as well as uncovers genes where microcephaly is not reported previously or is a rare finding. We here report phenotypes associated with the genes for ultra-rare NDDs with microcephaly namely ATRIP, MINPP1, PNPLA8, AIMP2, ANKLE2, NCAPD2 and TRIT1.","dc:creator":"Masih S","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Deciphering the molecular landscape of microcephaly in 87 Indian families by exome sequencing."}},{"id":"cggv:11e4aea8-519b-49d2-9736-2a892a2e4d86_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a6fac607-a2cf-4426-a4f3-087ab132bec4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35568357"}],"rdfs:label":"Masih et al., 2012_F83.1"},{"id":"cggv:11e4aea8-519b-49d2-9736-2a892a2e4d86","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11e4aea8-519b-49d2-9736-2a892a2e4d86_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:4dc127cc-d9b7-4703-990f-0010e80c878a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4dc127cc-d9b7-4703-990f-0010e80c878a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"1.5 (nonsense default) - 0.5 (predicted to escape NMD)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0473ea4b-40cb-4f4c-b986-e96b1ae18a9f_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:437522de-9ce9-4e05-8021-65029d70ee23_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:437522de-9ce9-4e05-8021-65029d70ee23","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5aa311ea-cccf-458b-857f-0ffc3acd9f85","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017646.6(TRIT1):c.968G>A (p.Arg323Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA20969799"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002123","obo:HP_0001397","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0011923","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000819"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"WES, mtDNA sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:d03e9c04-2994-49b8-b251-ccdfa0717a03_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5aa311ea-cccf-458b-857f-0ffc3acd9f85"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24901367","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Identifying the genetic basis for mitochondrial diseases is technically challenging given the size of the mitochondrial proteome and the heterogeneity of disease presentations. Using next-generation exome sequencing, we identified in a patient with severe combined mitochondrial respiratory chain defects and corresponding perturbation in mitochondrial protein synthesis, a homozygous p.Arg323Gln mutation in TRIT1. This gene encodes human tRNA isopentenyltransferase, which is responsible for i6A37 modification of the anticodon loops of a small subset of cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs. Deficiency of i6A37 was previously shown in yeast to decrease translational efficiency and fidelity in a codon-specific manner. Modelling of the p.Arg323Gln mutation on the co-crystal structure of the homologous yeast isopentenyltransferase bound to a substrate tRNA, indicates that it is one of a series of adjacent basic side chains that interact with the tRNA backbone of the anticodon stem, somewhat removed from the catalytic center. We show that patient cells bearing the p.Arg323Gln TRIT1 mutation are severely deficient in i6A37 in both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs. Complete complementation of the i6A37 deficiency of both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs was achieved by transduction of patient fibroblasts with wild-type TRIT1. Moreover, we show that a previously-reported pathogenic m.7480A>G mt-tRNASer(UCN) mutation in the anticodon loop sequence A36A37A38 recognised by TRIT1 causes a loss of i6A37 modification. These data demonstrate that deficiencies of i6A37 tRNA modification should be considered a potential mechanism of human disease caused by both nuclear gene and mitochondrial DNA mutations while providing insight into the structure and function of TRIT1 in the modification of cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs.","dc:creator":"Yarham JW","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Defective i6A37 modification of mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs results from pathogenic mutations in TRIT1 and its substrate tRNA."}},"rdfs:label":"Yarham et al., 2014_II-3"},{"id":"cggv:d03e9c04-2994-49b8-b251-ccdfa0717a03","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d03e9c04-2994-49b8-b251-ccdfa0717a03_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d03e9c04-2994-49b8-b251-ccdfa0717a03_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"decreased modification activity in yeast; abnormal red-white color assay\n"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"0.1 (missense) + 0.4 (CI deficiency) + 0.4 (decreased modification activity in yeast) + 0.4 (abnormal red/white color assay) = 1.3 rounds to 1.25"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1852ae7d-c121-40b4-9904-7576d8ffe920_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1852ae7d-c121-40b4-9904-7576d8ffe920","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:ff4286a6-3488-43fd-ab6e-6d6665cd09e7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017646.6(TRIT1):c.22C>T (p.Arg8Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA788227"}},{"id":"cggv:d1588174-f639-40bf-a2b2-522e9eafdd6e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017646.6(TRIT1):c.856A>G (p.Lys286Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16616851"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001332","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000252"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"normal karyotype, mtDNA sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:a497e255-5f10-4c22-9c4e-272383f14fd0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d1588174-f639-40bf-a2b2-522e9eafdd6e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28185376","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Deleterious variants in the same gene present in two or more families with overlapping clinical features provide convincing evidence of a disease-gene association; this can be a challenge in the study of ultrarare diseases.

These modifications are essential for efficient protein translation in mitochondria and contribute to energy metabolism. The first step in i6 A and ms2 i6 A modifications is catalyzed by tRNA isopentenyltransferase, which is encoded by the TRIT1 gene. Herein, we report a girl with a developmental delay, frequent episodes of seizures induced by febrile illness, and myoclonic epilepsy who had compound heterozygous missense mutations in TRIT1. A mass spectrometry analysis of RNA nucleoside obtained from the subject's peripheral blood and urine showed a marked decrease in both i6 A and ms2 i6 A modifications. These results suggest that the mitochondrial disorder was caused by defective tRNA isopentenylation arising from a loss-of-function mutation in TRIT1. Furthermore, the present observations suggest that noninvasive biochemical analysis using peripheral blood and urine samples are sufficient for the diagnosis of TRIT1-related disorders, making muscle biopsy for the direct measurement of oxidative phosphorylation unnecessary. Such biochemical analyses before the start of antiepileptic medications would be beneficial to avoid hepatotoxicity in patients with possible mitochondrial disorders.","dc:creator":"Takenouchi

form isopentenyl-N(6)-A37 (i6A37) on subsets of tRNAs, enhancing their translation activity. Nuclear-encoded IPTases modify select cytosolic (cy-) and mitochondrial (mt-) tRNAs. Mutation in human IPTase, TRIT1, causes disease phenotypes characteristic of mitochondrial translation deficiency due to mt-tRNA dysfunction. Deletion of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe IPTase (tit1-Δ) causes slow growth in glycerol, as well as in rapamycin, an inhibitor of TOR kinase that maintains metabolic homeostasis. Schizosaccharomyces pombe IPTase modifies three different cy-tRNAs(Ser) as well as cy-tRNA(Tyr), cy-tRNA(Trp), and mt-tRNA(Trp). We show that lower ATP levels in tit1-Δ relative to tit1(+) cells are also more decreased by an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we asked if the tit1-Δ phenotypes are due to hypomodification of cy-tRNA or mt-tRNA. A cytosol-specific IPTase that modifies cy-tRNA, but not mt-tRNA, fully rescues the tit1-Δ phenotypes. Moreover, overexpression of cy-tRNAs also rescues the phenotypes, and cy-tRNA(Tyr) alone substantially does so. Bioinformatics indicate that cy-tRNA(Tyr) is most limiting for codon demand in tit1-Δ cells and that the cytosolic mRNAs most loaded with Tyr codons encode carbon metabolilizing enzymes, many of which are known to localize to mitochondria. Thus, S. pombe i6A37 hypomodification-associated metabolic deficiency results from hypoactivity of cy-tRNA, mostly tRNA(Tyr), and unlike human TRIT1-deficiency does not impair mitochondrial translation due to mt-tRNA hypomodification. We discuss species-specific aspects of i6A37. Specifically relevant to mitochondria, we show that its hypermodified version, ms2i6A37 (2-methylthiolated), which occurs on certain mammalian mt-tRNAs (but not cy-tRNAs), is not found in yeast.","dc:creator":"Lamichhane TN","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Lack of tRNA-i6A modification causes mitochondrial-like metabolic deficiency in S. pombe by limiting activity of cytosolic tRNATyr, not mito-tRNA."},"rdfs:label":"Lamichhane et al., 2016_yeast"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Lower ATP levels in tit1-Δ relative to tit1+ cells are more decreased by an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction"},{"id":"cggv:314ad427-6f87-4330-a24f-85b332964596","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0d0de19c-03c8-40fe-be23-aefcfe7d4b24","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Growth defect in oxidative carbon source","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24901367","rdfs:label":"Yarham et al., 2014_yeast"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Growth defect in oxidative carbon source"},{"id":"cggv:824b6a35-ebda-47e9-a567-a8aae119296b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dfa0773a-bf67-4869-88de-1b6937d48130","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Embryonic lethal (embryos that proceed through early preimplantation stages, implant and form a radially symmetric egg cylinder but fail to initiate gastrulation)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32376682","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondria are essential for energy production and although they have their own genome, many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) are required for proper function of the organelle.

The *TRIT1* gene encodes tRNA isopentenyltransferase 1, which catalyzes the transfer of an isopentyl group from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate onto the adenine at position 37 of both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs that bind to codons containing uridine. Of note, modifications of cytosolic tRNAs and mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) occur at nucleotide positions 34 and 37 in the anticodon loop. This promotes translational fidelity and efficiency by optimizing codon-anticodon fit within the ribosome.\n\nThe *TRIT1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2014 (PMID: 24901367). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TRIT1*-related disease (including combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 35), pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TRIT1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 15 variants (nine missense, two frameshift, three stop-gained, and one intronic) identified in ten probands from eight publications (PMIDs: 24901367, 28185376, 30977854, 31140736, 32088416, 32948376, 35568357, 35418828).  Age of onset was typically in the first year of life. Features included infantile/early childhood onset epilepsy, global developmental delay, variable intellectual disability, and some with structural abnormalities (dysmorphisms, structural brain changes, mild congenital heart defects). Muscle biopsies showed COX-negative fibers and reduced activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I/III/IV. Brain imaging revealed microcephaly, septo-optic dysplasia, cerebral atrophy, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. The mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mt-tRNA processing for mitochondrial translation) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in patient cells, model organisms, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 24901367, 32376682, 26857223).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 13, 2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0473ea4b-40cb-4f4c-b986-e96b1ae18a9f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
