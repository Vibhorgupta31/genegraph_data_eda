Their structural and/or functional defects are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disease characterized by chronic respiratory-tract infections and in which most males are infertile due to asthenozoospermia. Among the well-characterized axonemal protein complexes, the outer dynein arms (ODAs), through ATPase activity of their heavy chains (HCs), play a major role for cilia and flagella beating. However, the contribution of the different HCs (γ-type: DNAH5 and DNAH8 and β-type: DNAH9, DNAH11, and DNAH17) in ODAs from both organelles is unknown. By analyzing five male individuals who consulted for isolated infertility and displayed a loss of ODAs in their sperm cells but not in their respiratory cells, we identified bi-allelic mutations in DNAH17. The isolated infertility phenotype prompted us to compare the protein composition of ODAs in the sperm and ciliary axonemes from control individuals. We show that DNAH17 and DNAH8, but not DNAH5, DNAH9, or DNAH11, colocalize with α-tubulin along the sperm axoneme, whereas the reverse picture is observed in respiratory cilia, thus explaining the phenotype restricted to sperm cells. We also demonstrate the loss of function associated with DNAH17 mutations in two unrelated individuals by performing immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses on sperm cells; these analyses indicated the absence of DNAH17 and DNAH8, whereas DNAH2 and DNALI, two inner dynein arm components, were present. Overall, this study demonstrates that mutations in DNAH17 are responsible for isolated male infertility and provides information regarding ODA composition in human spermatozoa.","dc:creator":"Whitfield M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Mutations in DNAH17, Encoding a Sperm-Specific Axonemal Outer Dynein Arm Heavy Chain, Cause Isolated Male Infertility Due to Asthenozoospermia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ef0cbb29-220d-45ae-828c-ab233dcf4824_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17200c0f-0c19-44fb-9355-2f06a9a71e04_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17200c0f-0c19-44fb-9355-2f06a9a71e04","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":30,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a42c3bbe-5d23-4d99-b4f8-8252e148b492","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_173628.4(DNAH17):c.10486_10497dup (p.Val3496_Pro3499dup)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915940706"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003251","obo:HP_0032560","obo:HP_0032558","obo:HP_0012207","obo:HP_0032559"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:13fbc4dd-b37b-46b4-9c93-c9c9a4c59790_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a42c3bbe-5d23-4d99-b4f8-8252e148b492"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31178125"},"rdfs:label":"18GM01926"},{"id":"cggv:13fbc4dd-b37b-46b4-9c93-c9c9a4c59790","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13fbc4dd-b37b-46b4-9c93-c9c9a4c59790_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:13fbc4dd-b37b-46b4-9c93-c9c9a4c59790_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) performed on the sperm of the patient shows Outer Dynein Arms (ODA) defect\nImmunostaining and western-blot show that DNAH17 is absent from sperm flagella"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4f3cb906-29f0-442e-a8b4-c3fb87eed4e7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f3cb906-29f0-442e-a8b4-c3fb87eed4e7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":39,"allele":{"id":"cggv:366b902d-199f-4414-b8a7-6b8114835572","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000017.11:g.78499046G>A (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA401261374"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0032559","obo:HP_0032560","obo:HP_0003251","obo:HP_0012207","obo:HP_0032558"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2fa5f482-4e64-4b76-83cb-c78126926ebd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:366b902d-199f-4414-b8a7-6b8114835572"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070343","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder leading to male infertility.

birth prevalence of laterality defects is about 1.1/10,000 comprising different phenotypes ranging from situs inversus totalis to heterotaxy, mostly associated with complex congenital heart defects (CHD) and situs abnormalities such as intestinal malrotation, biliary atresia, asplenia, or polysplenia. A proportion of laterality defects arise in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) accompanied by respiratory symptoms or infertility. In this study, exome sequencing (ES) was performed in 14 case-parent trios/quattros with clinical exclusion of PCD prior to analysis. Moreover, all cases and parents underwent detailed clinical phenotyping including physical examination, echocardiography by a skilled paediatric cardiologist and abdominal ultrasound examinations not to miss mildly affected individuals. Subsequent survey of the exome data comprised filtering for monoallelic de novo, rare biallelic, and X-linked recessive variants. In two families, rare variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in PKD1L1 and ZIC3 were identified. Both genes have been associated with laterality defects. In two of the remaining families, biallelic variants in LMBRD1 and DNAH17, respectively, were prioritized. In another family, an ultra-rare de novo variant in WDR47 was found. Extensive exome survey of 2,109 single exomes of individuals with situs inversus totalis, heterotaxy, or isolated CHD identified two individuals with novel monoallelic variants in WDR47, but no further individuals with biallelic variants in DNAH17 or LMBRD1. Overall, ES of 14 case-parent trios/quattros with cardiovascular laterality defects identified rare VUS in two families in known disease-associated genes PKD1L1 and ZIC3 and suggests DNAH17, LMBRD1,

morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagellum (MMAF) have been reported to be an important cause of male infertility and reflect a heterogeneous genetic disorder. Previous studies have identified dozens of candidate pathogenic genes for MMAF, but the aetiology in approximately 50% of cases remains unexplained. The present study aimed to identify novel potentially pathogenic gene variants of MMAF. A Chinese family with a 32-year-old infertile proband presenting with MMAF was recruited, and sperm morphology of the patient was examined by Papanicolaou staining. Whole exome sequencing was performed on the proband and Sanger sequencing was used to identify genetic variants in the family. The frequencies of variants were assessed using public databases and the effects on protein structure and function were predicted by online bioinformatics tools. The patient exhibited asthenozoospermia and a MMAF phenotype. Novel compound heterozygous variants (c.5368C > T, p.R1790C and c.13183C > T, p.R4395W) of the DNAH17 gene were identified in the patient, and showed autosomal recessive inheritance in this family. These variants were very rare in the GnomAD database. The two mutated amino acids were located in a highly conserved region of the DNAH17 protein. In silico analysis revealed that the compound heterozygous variants may compromise the function of DNAH17. Our findings expand upon the spectrum of pathogenic DNAH17 variants that are responsible for MMAF, and provide new knowledge for genetic counselling of male infertility due to MMAF.","dc:creator":"Liu Z","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Novel compound heterozygous variants of DNAH17 in a Chinese infertile man with multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella."}},{"id":"cggv:bab61bcc-7277-4b0d-bff8-696d1cfea245_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:010bb1e0-e542-47ea-af2f-f39265da916d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35932098"}],"rdfs:label":"Proband_II1"},{"id":"cggv:bab61bcc-7277-4b0d-bff8-696d1cfea245","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bab61bcc-7277-4b0d-bff8-696d1cfea245_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Missense variant (p.(Arg1790Cys)) of an amino-acid not conserved through evolution (Cys in Saker falcon, Peregrine falcon, Tetraodon and Fugu)"},{"id":"cggv:648b0636-fc47-43a2-95a3-9e37892091d2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:648b0636-fc47-43a2-95a3-9e37892091d2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Missense variant of an amino-acid not conserved through evolution.\nIn trans with a likely benign variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:ef0cbb29-220d-45ae-828c-ab233dcf4824_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ef0cbb29-220d-45ae-828c-ab233dcf4824_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad14b341-6c66-46b1-9aae-7741dd626e99","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:79e8b012-a15a-4c25-91c2-6e503550c21e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"DNAH17 mRNA is expressed in testis of normal controls","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613900","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease.

Ejaculates that fulfill predefined quality requirements are processed, diluted and used for inseminations. Within short time, eight Swiss Large White boars producing immotile sperm that had multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella were noticed at a semen collection center. The eight boars were inbred on a common ancestor suggesting that the novel sperm flagella defect is a recessive trait. Transmission electron microscopy cross-sections revealed that the immotile sperm had disorganized flagellar axonemes. Haplotype-based association testing involving microarray-derived genotypes at 41,094 SNPs of six affected and 100 fertile boars yielded strong association (P = 4.22 × 10-15) at chromosome 12. Autozygosity mapping enabled us to pinpoint the causal mutation on a 1.11 Mb haplotype located between 3,473,632 and 4,587,759 bp. The haplotype carries an intronic 13-bp deletion (Chr12:3,556,401-3,556,414 bp) that is compatible with recessive inheritance. The 13-bp deletion excises the polypyrimidine tract upstream exon 56 of DNAH17 (XM_021066525.1: c.8510-17_8510-5del) encoding dynein axonemal heavy chain 17. Transcriptome analysis of the testis of two affected boars revealed that the loss of the polypyrimidine tract causes exon skipping which results in the in-frame loss of 89 amino acids from DNAH17. Disruption of DNAH17 impairs the assembly of the flagellar axoneme and manifests in multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella. Direct gene testing may now be implemented to monitor the defective allele in the Swiss Large White population and prevent the frequent manifestation of a sterilizing sperm tail disorder in breeding boars.","dc:creator":"Nosková A","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Infertility due to defective sperm flagella caused by an intronic deletion in DNAH17 that perturbs splicing."},"rdfs:label":"Infertility in Dnah17 mutated boars"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Sperm from mutant boars is completely immotile, unlike in humans with bi-allelic DNAH17 mutations."},{"id":"cggv:b2c23250-5a99-4a93-adca-9b0b4605aecb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:254cf179-f352-43d3-9f8b-82419b21c3ce","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Rats with mutated Dnah17 are infertile like human males with bi-allelic DNAH17 mutations.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33764336","rdfs:label":"Infertility in Dnah17-KO rats generated by CRISPR/Cas9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"\"Infertility have been identified in human, mice, and rats due to homozygous mutations in DNAH17/ Dnah17, but rats with Dnah17 knockout seem with more severe defects in sperm development\".\nAlso, unlike in humans, rats displayed drastically decreased sperm count."},{"id":"cggv:f749555c-21fa-437d-beb2-7582f493922e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42bd004a-805b-4f96-9c9e-cd405475894e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Dnah17-KO mice exhibit Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) like observed in human males with bi-allelic DNAH17 mutations","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070343","rdfs:label":"Infertility in Dnah17-KO mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Unlike in humans, mice displayed drastically decreased sperm count, and all spermatozoa were immotile."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5197,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:770ce198-7b88-46d8-8d38-ecb5ca434bf1","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0032845","gene":"hgnc:2946","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"***DNAH17*, Spermatogenic failure 39, autosomal recessive**\n\nSpermatogenic failure 39 (SPGF39) is characterized by male infertility due to morphologic abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), including flagella that are short, absent, irregularly shaped, and coiled (Whitfield et al., 2019, PMID: 31178125).\nMutations in *DNAH17* were first reported in 2019 in association with SPGF39 (OMIM: 610063, MONDO:0032845) involving morphologic abnormalities of the flagella (Whitfield et al., 2019, PMID: 31178125).

Moreover, sperm cells from these patients present abnormal morphology and motility including absent, short, coiled, and irregular-caliber flagella (Whitfield et al., 2019, PMID: 31178125).\nIn mice (Mus musculus), CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to delete 50 nucleotides in exon 3 of *Dnah17* and Generate *Dnah17*-KO (*Dnah17*−/−) mice. These mice exhibit Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) like observed in human males with bi-allelic* DNAH17* mutations. However, unlike in humans, mice displayed drastically decreased sperm count, and all spermatozoa were immotile.\nIn rats (Rattus norvegicus), CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to delete 20bp from exon 55 of *Dnah17* and generate Dnah17-mutant rats (c.8704_8724del p.(T2904Lfs4)). Rats with mutated Dnah17 are infertile like human males with bi-allelic *DNAH17* mutations. Rats with *Dnah17* knockout seem with more severe defects in sperm development, and, unlike in humans, rats displayed drastically decreased sperm count.\nIn boars (Sus scrofa), a 13-bp deletion in intron 55 of *Dnah17* (splice mutation) was detected in infertile boars. Boars with Dnah17 mutation exhibit Infertility due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella, like observed in human males with bi-allelic *DNAH17* mutations. Sperm cells from mutant boars are completely immotile, unlike in humans with bi-allelic *DNAH17* mutations.\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DNAH17* and autosomal recessive Spermatogenic failure 39. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on September 8, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ef0cbb29-220d-45ae-828c-ab233dcf4824"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
