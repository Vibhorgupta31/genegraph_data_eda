Mutation screening of six WS-associated genes detected PAX3 mutations in 6 (86%) of the 7 WS1 probands. Among the 29 WS2 probands, 13 (45%) and 10 (34%) were identified with SOX10 and MITF mutations, respectively. Nineteen of the 26 detected mutations were novel. In WS2 probands whose parental DNA samples were available, de novo mutations were frequently seen for SOX10 mutations (7/8) but not for MITF mutations (0/5, P = 0.005). Excessive freckle, a common feature of WS2 in Chinese Hans, was frequent in WS2 probands with MITF mutations (7/10) but not in those with SOX10 mutations (0/13, P = 4.9 × 10(-4)). Our results showed that mutations in SOX10 and MITF are two major causes for deafness associated with WS2.

Based on the molecular defect of Splotch, an established mouse model for NTD, and on the clinical association between NTD and Waardenburg syndrome (WS), mutations in the PAX3 gene can be expected to act as factors predisposing to human NTD. To test this hypothesis, 39 patients with familial NTD were screened by SSC analysis for mutations in exons 2 to 6 of the human PAX3 gene. One patient with lumbosacral meningomyelocele was identified with a 5 bp deletion in exon 5 approximately 55 bp upstream of the conserved homeodomain. The deletion causes a frameshift with a stop codon almost immediately after the mutated site. Clinical investigation of the index patient indicated mild signs of WS type I. Varying signs of this syndrome were found to cosegregate with the mutation in the family.

Instead, they are partially committed but remain undifferentiated. Upon appropriate stimulation they are capable of regenerating mature cell types. Little is known about the genetic programmes that maintain the undifferentiated phenotype of lineage-restricted stem cells. Here we describe the molecular details of a nodal point in adult melanocyte stem cell differentiation in which Pax3 simultaneously functions to initiate a melanogenic cascade while acting downstream to prevent terminal differentiation. Pax3 activates expression of Mitf, a transcription factor critical for melanogenesis, while at the same time it competes with Mitf for occupancy of an enhancer required for expression of dopachrome tautomerase, an enzyme that functions in melanin synthesis. Pax3-expressing melanoblasts are thus committed but undifferentiated until Pax3-mediated repression is relieved by activated beta-catenin. Thus, a stem cell transcription factor can both determine cell fate and simultaneously maintain an undifferentiated state, leaving a cell poised to differentiate in response to external stimuli.","dc:creator":"Lang D","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Pax3 functions at a nodal point in melanocyte stem cell differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Melanocyte expression of PAX3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:78922459-d4be-412a-ac47-2449b6bfc858","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66cb5896-eb09-400a-9558-f379265a6d69","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Synergistic activation of Mitf with SOX10 as well as repression of Dct and activation of Trp1 all of which are involved in melanocyte development is consistent with the pigmentation phenotype.

Pax3 is a transcription factor that is important in the melanocyte and influences melanocytic proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, migration, lineage specificity and differentiation. In this review, we focus on Pax3 and the molecular pathways that Pax3 is a part of during melanogenesis and in the melanocyte stem cell. These roles of Pax3 are emphasized during the development of diseases and syndromes resulting from either too much or too little Pax3 function. Due to its key task in melanocyte stem cells and tumors, the Pax3 pathway may provide an ideal target for either stem cell or cancer therapies.","dc:creator":"Kubic JD","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Pigmentation PAX-ways: the role of Pax3 in melanogenesis, melanocyte stem cell maintenance, and disease."},"rdfs:label":"Pax3 melanogenesis role"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"3 different proteins invovled in melanocyte development are implicated to be controlled by PAX3 therefore each interaction was given 0.5 pts."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:594ef026-3730-43bc-b721-d15cf0bbbf26_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7fcfcb4-467d-446d-be35-bf9d717a6e7b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2a9ad30b-4471-4a45-a043-df81cdea8069","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Pigmentation abnormalities are common in WS resulting from PAX3 variants","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20095975","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In the course of a large-scale screening program of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, we isolated two semidominant mutation lines with white belly spotting, named as wps and wbs. Direct sequencing detected a nucleotide G-to-A transversion in exon 2 of the c-Kit gene in wps, which resulted in a missense D60N mutation. Another mutant, wbs, was mapped to chromosome 1 by genome-wide linkage analysis. In 93 meioses, the wbs locus was confined to a 5.2-Mb region between D1Mit380 and D1Mit215, including the Pax3 gene. A nonsense mutation K107X on the Pax3 coding region in wbs mice was identified, causing the loss of Pax3 protein in the homozygous mutant. We further demonstrated that Pax3 exhibited genetic interaction with c-Kit by intercrossing the wps and wbs mice. Further, Pax3 transactivated the c-Kit promoter in different cell lines. However, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Pax3 did not bind to the c-Kit promoter, indicating that Pax3 may interact with c-Kit in an indirect way. This expands our understanding of the intricate regulatory network governing the melanocyte development.","dc:creator":"Guo XL","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Identification of a novel nonsense mutation on the Pax3 gene in ENU-derived white belly spotting mice and its genetic interaction with c-Kit."},"rdfs:label":"Wbs mouse models Waardenburg Syndrome (nonsense Pax3)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"No HL phenotype documented, however still a possible model for WS resulting from PAX3"},{"id":"cggv:a278dc20-732d-4bc9-b852-79cabcea1d1d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd896f22-fdf6-438f-b98e-b95075547749","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"White spots on bellies, similar to pigmentation phenotype in WS, Displayed spina bifida and curly tail phenotype.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28043919","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genes responsible for reduced pigmentation phenotypes in rodents are associated with human developmental defects, such as Waardenburg syndrome, where patients display congenital deafness along with various abnormalities mostly related to neural crest development deficiency.","dc:creator":"Ohnishi T","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A spontaneous and novel Pax3 mutant mouse that models Waardenburg syndrome and neural tube defects."},"rdfs:label":"Spontaneous and novel Pax3 mutant mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"the mouse model does not perfectly represent the Waardenburg syndrome phenotype, however phenotypic variation is common in this syndrome.

Linkage analysis indicated that the locus for white spotting was located in the vicinity of the Pax3 gene on chromosome 1. Crosses of white-spotted mice showed that homozygosity for the mutation caused tail and limb abnormalities and embryonic lethality as a result of exencephaly; these phenotypes were analogous to those found in other Pax3 mutants. Sequence analysis identified a missense point mutation (c.101G>A) in exon 2 of Pax3 that resulted in a methionine to isoleucine conversion at amino acid 62 of the PAX3 protein. This mutation site was located in the N-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) motif of the paired domain of Pax3, which is necessary for binding to DNA and is highly conserved in vertebrate species. Alteration of DNA binding affinity was responsible for embryonic lethality in homozygotes and white spotting in heterozygotes. We named the mutant allele as Pax3(Sp-Nag).

Variants in PAX3 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1995 (Hol et al., PMID 7897628). At least 10 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, biochemical function studies and expression in mouse hair follicles as well as several mouse models (PMID: 18983540, 20095975, 28381738, 28043919, 15729346). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs 27759048, 7897628, 28690861, 30314436, 25932447). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 7 additional family members. In summary, PAX3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Waardenberg syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
