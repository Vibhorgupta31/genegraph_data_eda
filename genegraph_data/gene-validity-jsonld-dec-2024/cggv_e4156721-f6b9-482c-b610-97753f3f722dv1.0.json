Interference in the function of BIN1, such as with cholesterol depletion or expression suppression by siRNA, significantly inhibited myoblast fusion and differentiation and halted the biogenesis of the triad structure.\n\nSeveral publications have also shown that BIN1 and DNM2 have a positive genetic interaction with each other (PMIDs: 12183633, 17676042, 29130937). Normally BIN1 acts as a negative regulator for DNM2 expression which prevents overexpression of the wildtype, however when mutant BIN1 loses the capability to properly function significantly increased DNM2 is observed in conjunction with the centronuclear myopathy phenotypes. Mouse models have further demonstrated that normally homozygous lethal BIN1 -/- knockout mice become viable with normal muscle force and muscle fiber organization when  the DNM2 gene undergoes a heterozygous knockout for a +/- in the same line of mice. This reveals that BIN1 and DNM2 both function through a common pathway and define both these genes as important regulators of muscle/triad development and organization.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31691805","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dynamin 2 (DNM2) encodes a ubiquitously expressed large GTPase with membrane fission capabilities that participates in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles.

Despite extensive investigations in cell culture, the role of dynamin 2 in normal muscle development is poorly understood and the consequences of DNM2 mutations at the molecular level in vivo are not known. To address these gaps in knowledge, we developed transgenic zebrafish expressing either wild type dynamin 2 or dynamin 2 with either a CNM or CMT mutation. Taking advantage of the live imaging capabilities of the zebrafish embryo, we establish the localization of wild type and mutant dynamin 2 in vivo, showing for the first time distinctive dynamin 2 subcellular compartments. Additionally, we demonstrate that CNM-related DNM2 mutations are associated with protein mislocalization and aggregation. Lastly, we define core phenotypes associated with our transgenic mutant fish, including impaired motor function and altered muscle ultrastructure, making them the ideal platform for drug screening.

Although a few symptoms were not present, this is easily explained due to the method of injection into already developed mouse muscle. WT-DNM2 mice showed similar phenotypes, implying that the dysregulation of DNM2 expression leads to an increase of GTPase activity and the resulting disorder.

Although ubiquitously expressed, DNM2 was found mutated in two genetic disorders affecting different tissues: autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (ADCNM; skeletal muscle) and peripheral Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (peripheral nerve). To gain insight into the function of DNM2 in skeletal muscle and the pathological mechanisms leading to ADCNM, we introduced wild-type DNM2 (WT-DNM2) or R465W DNM2 (RW-DNM2), the most common ADCNM mutation, into adult wild-type mouse skeletal muscle by intramuscular adeno-associated virus injections. We detected altered localization of RW-DNM2 in mouse muscle. Several ADCNM features were present in RW-DNM2 mice: fiber atrophy, nuclear mislocalization, and altered mitochondrial staining, with a corresponding reduction in specific maximal muscle force. The sarcomere and triad structures were also altered. We report similar findings in muscle biopsy specimens from an ADCNM patient with the R465W mutation. In addition, expression of wild-type DNM2 induced some muscle defects, albeit to a lesser extent than RW-DNM2, suggesting that the R465W mutation has enhanced activity in vivo. In conclusion, we show the RW-DNM2 mutation acts in a dominant manner to cause ADCNM in adult muscle, and the disease arises from a primary defect in skeletal muscle rather than secondary to peripheral nerve involvement. Therefore, DNM2 plays important roles in the maintenance of adult muscle fibers.","dc:creator":"Cowling BS","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Increased expression of wild-type or a centronuclear myopathy mutant of dynamin 2 in skeletal muscle of adult mice leads to structural defects and muscle weakness."},"rdfs:label":"DNM2 Mutant Expression Recapitulates Myopathy"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"This variant-transducted mouse model clearly recapitulates the phenotype of centronuclear myopathy 1, including two of the main signs and a less-specific version of the third.

The disease is clinically heterogeneous, ranging from severe neonatal hypotonic phenotypes to adult-onset mild muscle weakness, and can have multiple modes of inheritance in association with various genes, including MTM1, DNM2, BIN1 and RYR1. Here we analyzed 18 sporadic patients with clinical and histological diagnosis of CNM and sequenced the DNM2 gene, which codes for the dynamin 2 protein. We found DNM2 missense mutations in two patients, both in exon 8, one known (p.E368K) and one novel (p.F372C), which is found in a position of presumed pathogenicity and appeared de novo. The patients had similar phenotypes characterized by neonatal signs followed by improvement and late childhood reemergence of slowly progressive generalized muscle weakness, elongated face with ptosis and ophthalmoparesis, and histology showing fibers with radiating sarcoplasmic strands (RSS). These patients were the only ones in the series to present this histological marker, which together with previous reports in the literature suggest that, when RSS are present, direct sequencing of DNM2 mutation hot spot regions should be the first step in the molecular diagnosis of CNM, even in sporadic cases.

was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy in 2005\n(Bitoun et al., 16227997). At least ten variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, etc) have been reported in\nhumans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data,\nexperimental data. \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in three publications (PMID: 17932957, 16227997, 26273216). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 24 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function, with CNM DNM2 mutations interrupting the normal regulatory pathway and causing overexpression of DNM2 in the skeletal muscle resulting in myopathy phenotypes. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, dominant intermediate B and Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 5. These will be assessed separately.\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by shared biochemical function with BIN1, another gene responsible for centronuclear myopathy apparently via DNM2 dysregulation as shown by mouse models. Skin fibroblasts in DNM2 patients also demonstrate modified endocytosis, another factor which can influence the progress of various myopathies. A mouse model displaying the most common CNM variant, R465W, clearly recapitulates the phenotypes observed in human probands. Lastly, expression of siRNAs to block expression of the variant in these same mice fully rescues the disease phenotype.\nIn summary, DNM2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e4156721-f6b9-482c-b610-97753f3f722d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
