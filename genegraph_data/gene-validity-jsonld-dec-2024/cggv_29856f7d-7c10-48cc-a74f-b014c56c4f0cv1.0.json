Expression of Pax1 mRNA in the embryonic thymus has been reported previously. Here we show that Pax1 protein expression in thymic epithelial cells can be detected throughout thymic development and in the adult. Expression starts in the early endodermal epithelium lining the foregut region and includes the epithelium of the third pharyngeal pouch, a structure giving rise to part of the thymus epithelium. In early stages of thymus development a large proportion of thymus cells expresses Pax1. With increasing age, the proportion of Pax1-expressing cells is reduced and in the adult mouse only a small fraction of cortical thymic stromal cells retains strong Pax1 expression. Expression of Pax1 in thymus epithelium is necessary for establishing the thymus microenvironment required for normal T cell maturation. Mutations in the Pax-1 gene in undulated mice affect not only the total size of the thymus but also the maturation of thymocytes. The number of thymocytes is reduced about 2- to 5-fold, affecting mainly the CD4+8+ immature and CD4+ mature thymocyte subsets. The expression levels of major thymocyte surface markers remains unchanged with the exception of Thy-1 which was found to be expressed at 3- to 4-fold higher levels.","dc:creator":"Wallin J","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Pax1 is expressed during development of the thymus epithelium and is required for normal T-cell maturation."},"rdfs:label":"UnS mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Reduced scoring because this is a full gene deletion and leads to embryonic lethality.

Biallelic homozygous nonsense or hypomorphic missense mutations in PAX1 cause otofaciocervical syndrome type 2 (OTFCS2), a similar but more severe multi-system disorder that can be accompanied by severe combined immunodeficiency due to thymic aplasia. Here we have identified a multi-generational family with mild features of OAVS segregating a heterozygous frameshift in PAX1. The four base duplication is expected to result in nonsense-mediated decay, and therefore cause a null allele. While there was full penetrance of the variant, expressivity of facial and ear features were variable.

Autosomal dominant cases are caused by deletions or point mutations of EYA1. A single family with an autosomal recessive form of OFCS and a homozygous missense mutation in PAX1 gene has been described. We report whole exome sequencing of 4 members of a consanguineous family in which 2 children, showing features of OFCS, expired from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). To date, the co-occurrence of OFCS and SCID has never been reported. We found a nonsense homozygous mutation in PAX1 gene in the 2 affected children. In mice, Pax1 is required for the formation of specific skeletal structures as well as for the development of a fully functional thymus. The mouse model strongly supports the hypothesis that PAX1 depletion in our patients caused thymus aplasia responsible for SCID. This report provides evidence that bi-allelic null PAX1 mutations may lead to a multi-system autosomal recessive disorders, where SCID might represent the main feature.","dc:creator":"Paganini I","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A novel PAX1 null homozygous mutation in autosomal recessive otofaciocervical syndrome associated with severe combined immunodeficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"V18"},{"id":"cggv:2652225f-75a2-4012-830e-db46eb93879e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2652225f-75a2-4012-830e-db46eb93879e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Consanguinity\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d2035b19-ea89-40ed-aca7-274c520f6298_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2035b19-ea89-40ed-aca7-274c520f6298","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:051d2d5d-b21a-4269-b2ac-d0ac26b2a3d7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001257096.2(PAX1):c.463_465del (p.Asn155del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1016138132"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:f3de06fe-ccda-4692-86c8-e01d0ebb4284_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:051d2d5d-b21a-4269-b2ac-d0ac26b2a3d7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26284228","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"There are limited reports of the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) as a clinical diagnostic tool.

In a large consanguineous family with OFCS from Turkey, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of a single pooled DNA sample of four affected individuals. Filtering for variants with a percentage of alternate reads ‚â• 90 % and a coverage of at least five reads identified only a single novel homozygous variant, c.497G>T, located in PAX1 that co-segregated with the disease in the family. PAX1 encodes a transcription factor with a critical role in pattern formation during embryogenesis in vertebrates. The mutation is predicted to substitute the glycine at position 166 to valine (p.G166V) within the highly conserved paired-box domain of the PAX1 protein. We performed a dual luciferase reporter assay to examine the transactivation of a regulatory sequence in the Nkx3-2 promoter region, which is a direct target of mouse Pax1 transcriptional regulation. We observed a significantly reduced transactivation in HEK293T cells overexpressing Pax1(G157V) in comparison to Pax1(WT) expressing cells, indicating a reduced DNA-binding affinity of the mutant protein. Taken together, our results show that the strategy of pooling DNA is a powerful, cost-effective application for WES in consanguineous families and establish PAX1 as a new disease-causing gene for OFCS and as part of the EYA-DACH-SIX-PAX network, important in early embryogenesis.","dc:creator":"Pohl E","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A hypofunctional PAX1 mutation causes autosomal recessively inherited otofaciocervical syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"V2"},{"id":"cggv:e07933b6-a28f-4894-846d-78c9081935f9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e07933b6-a28f-4894-846d-78c9081935f9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e07933b6-a28f-4894-846d-78c9081935f9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Decreased transactivation activity of Pax1 in a luciferase based system.

OTFCS2 is characterized by facial dysmorphism, external ear anomalies with preauricular pits, hearing impairment, hypoparathyroidism, anomalies of the vertebrae and shoulder, and mild intellectual disability. OTFCS2 patients that present with SCID demonstrate thymic aplasia/hypoplasia and T-B+NK+ SCID. 13 variants were curated and are composed of missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Heterozygous carriers have been identified that show full penetrance of the OTFCS2 phenotype with variable expressivity without signs of immunodeficiency, though the immune system has not been extensively studied in these patients (PMID: 35879406). The maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached for this curation (12 pts).\n¬†\nPAX1 is a member of the paired box-containing (PAX) family of transcription factors and plays a role in pattern formation during embryogenesis. It is primarily expressed in the third pharyngeal pouch that generates the thymus, thyroid, parathyroid and middle ear during human development (PMID: 36393845). PAX1 is essential for the development of the thymus, is expressed in thymic epithelial cells during embryogenesis and into adulthood (PMID:2453291). Mice with different LOF mutations in PAX1 demonstrate impacts in the cellularity of the thymus as well as thymocyte development and maturation (PMID:8565834). This is most likely due to the impact of PAX1 on thymic epithelial cells, as cell culture model systems have shown altered thymic stromal cell transcriptomes following induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation (PMID: 32111619). In patients with OTFCS2, thymic transplant has shown promise in patients presenting with immunodeficiency, while HSCT has been less successful (PMID: 37060484, 33987750). Not all reports of OTFCS2 have reported patients with SCID phenotypes. It is currently unclear if this is due to reduced penetrance, the type or location of the mutation in PAX1 or other genetic modifiers. Further study is required to elucidate this finding.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n¬†\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 11/16/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n¬†\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:29856f7d-7c10-48cc-a74f-b014c56c4f0c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
