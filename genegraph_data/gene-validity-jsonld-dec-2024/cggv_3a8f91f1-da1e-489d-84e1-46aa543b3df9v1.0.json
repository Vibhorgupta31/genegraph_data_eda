X-linked myotubular myopathy, the most common severe form of CNM, is caused by mutations in MTM1, encoding myotubularin (MTM1), a lipid phosphatase. To increase our understanding of MTM1 function, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify MTM1-interacting proteins. Striated muscle preferentially expressed protein kinase (SPEG), the product of SPEG complex locus (SPEG), was identified as an MTM1-interacting protein, confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies. SPEG knockout has been previously associated with severe dilated cardiomyopathy in a mouse model. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated CNM-affected probands, including two with documented dilated cardiomyopathy, carrying homozygous or compound-heterozygous SPEG mutations. SPEG was markedly reduced or absent in two individuals whose muscle was available for immunofluorescence and immunoblot studies. Examination of muscle samples from Speg-knockout mice revealed an increased frequency of central nuclei, as seen in human subjects. SPEG localizes in a double line, flanking desmin over the Z lines, and is apparently in alignment with the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Examination of human and murine MTM1-deficient muscles revealed similar abnormalities in staining patterns for both desmin and SPEG. Our results suggest that mutations in SPEG, encoding SPEG, cause a CNM phenotype as a result of its interaction with MTM1. SPEG is present in cardiac muscle, where it plays a critical role; therefore, individuals with SPEG mutations additionally present with dilated cardiomyopathy.

We have previously identified three CNM probands, two with associated dilated cardiomyopathy, carrying striated preferentially expressed gene (SPEG) mutations. Currently, the role of SPEG in skeletal muscle function is unclear as constitutive SPEG-deficient mice developed severe dilated cardiomyopathy and died in utero. We have generated a conditional Speg-KO mouse model and excised Speg by crosses with striated muscle-specific cre-expressing mice (MCK-Cre). The resulting litters had a delay in Speg excision consistent with cre expression starting in early postnatal life and, therefore, an extended lifespan up to a few months. KO mice were significantly smaller and weaker than their littermate-matched controls. Histopathological skeletal muscle analysis revealed smaller myofibers, marked fiber-size variability, and poor integrity and low number of triads. Further, SPEG-deficient muscle fibers were weaker by physiological and in vitro studies and exhibited abnormal Ca2+ handling and excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Overall, SPEG deficiency in skeletal muscle is associated with fewer and abnormal triads, and defective calcium handling and excitation-contraction coupling, suggesting that therapies targeting calcium signaling may be beneficial in such patients.","dc:creator":"Huntoon V","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"SPEG-deficient skeletal muscles exhibit abnormal triad and defective calcium handling."},"rdfs:label":"Calcium Handling in Speg-deficient Muscle Fibers"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3a8f91f1-da1e-489d-84e1-46aa543b3df9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f588970-f499-453e-8010-2d8a3b88a1c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85fb6335-faae-4e31-ae48-e1f50a1d8a62","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Similar to SPEG-associated centronuclear myopathy patients, constitutive Speg knockout mice demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy with postnatal lethality observed in nearly all mice.
