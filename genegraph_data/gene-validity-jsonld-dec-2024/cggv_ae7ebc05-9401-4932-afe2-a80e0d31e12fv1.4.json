In addition to this function, PPT1 (palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1) hydrolyzes fatty acids from modified cysteine residues in proteins that are undergoing degradation in the lysosome. PPT1 deficiency in humans causes a neurodegenerative disorder, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (also known as infantile Batten disease). In the current work, we engineered disruptions in the PPT1 and PPT2 genes to create \"knockout\" mice that were deficient in either enzyme. Both lines of mice were viable and fertile. However, both lines developed spasticity (a \"clasping\" phenotype) at a median age of 21 wk and 29 wk, respectively. Motor abnormalities progressed in the PPT1 knockout mice, leading to death by 10 mo of age. In contrast, the majority of PPT2 mice were alive at 12 mo. Myoclonic jerking and seizures were prominent in the PPT1 mice. Autofluorescent storage material was striking throughout the brains of both strains of mice. Neuronal loss and apoptosis were particularly prominent in PPT1-deficient brains.

One of the more severe infantile forms of the disease (INCL or CLN1 disease) is due to mutations in the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) gene and severely reduces the child's lifespan to approximately 9 years of age. In order to better translate the human condition than is possible in mice, we sought to produce a large animal model employing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Three PPT1 homozygote sheep were generated by insertion of a disease-causing PPT1 (R151X) human mutation into the orthologous sheep locus. This resulted in a morphological, anatomical and biochemical disease phenotype that closely resembles the human condition. The homozygous sheep were found to have significantly reduced PPT1 enzyme activity and accumulate autofluorescent storage material, as is observed in CLN1 patients. Clinical signs included pronounced behavioral deficits as well as motor deficits and complete loss of vision, with a reduced lifespan of 17 ± 1 months at a humanely defined terminal endpoint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a significant decrease in motor cortical volume as well as increased ventricular volume corresponding with observed brain atrophy and a profound reduction in brain mass of 30% at necropsy, similar to alterations observed in human patients. In summary, we have generated the first CRISPR/Cas9 gene edited NCL model. This novel sheep model of CLN1 disease develops biochemical, gross morphological and in vivo brain alterations confirming the efficacy of the targeted modification and potential relevance to the human condition.","dc:creator":"Eaton SL","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"CRISPR/Cas9 mediated generation of an ovine model for infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1 disease)."},"rdfs:label":"CRIPSR/CAS9 generated sheep"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:ae7ebc05-9401-4932-afe2-a80e0d31e12f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae7ebc05-9401-4932-afe2-a80e0d31e12f_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:c9e41ff8-005c-4a7c-9b9e-77ddf83a7f58_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c9e41ff8-005c-4a7c-9b9e-77ddf83a7f58","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:725c144b-6a59-4da4-937d-ba296fbb1c2c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000310.4(PPT1):c.363-3T>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA263501"}},{"id":"cggv:20e17b2c-d3f7-46b8-9eb4-46a18cd0961b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000310.4(PPT1):c.451C>T (p.Arg151Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA316936"}}],"detectionMethod":"All exons and exon–intron boundaries were amplified from whole-blood genomic DNA using intron-based primers.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001251"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:cacd4806-4e91-441a-b053-ba6f4f8c216b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:20e17b2c-d3f7-46b8-9eb4-46a18cd0961b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19793312","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a family of progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by the cellular accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin-like bodies.

Neurologic regression was associated with dramatic shrinkage of cortical structures, evident upon brain magnetic resonance imaging. Three unrelated children harboring the same homozygous mutation in CLN1 and a girl who carried a novel mutation resulting in skipping of multiple exons presented with a similar clinical phenotype. The most severe picture occurred in two siblings who carried a homozygous mutation predicting a prematurely truncated protein.

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) (MONDO:0016295) in 1998 (Mitchison et al., PMID: 9425237). Of note, NCL is also referred to as Batten disease and, in the case of NCL caused by variants in *PPT1*, ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal 1 (CLN1). NCL is a lysosomal storage disorder that is often characterized by intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments and progressive neurodegeneration beginning in childhood, and can involve a variety of phenotypes including: seizures, cognitive decline, vision deterioration, blindness, and brain atrophy. Nine variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, and intronic) that have been reported in 12 probands in three publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 31741823, 19793312, 19302939). Of all variants described, one nonsense variant, p.Arg151*, has been reported to account for 40% of all known alleles (PMID: 9664077). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models (PMIDs: 11717424, 31289301). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PPT1* and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (MONDO:0016295). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date June 16, 2020 (SOP Version 7). As of March 30, 2023, this record underwent administrative updates. Evidence scoring was modified to reflect the new recommendations made in SOP Version 9. An evidence summary was also added. No new evidence was reviewed or added at that time. Most recently, on June 10, 2024, this record underwent further administrative updates to include the ClinGen Retina GCEP as a secondary contributor. Additional explanatory text was added to the evidence summary, but the original evidence was not changed.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ae7ebc05-9401-4932-afe2-a80e0d31e12f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
