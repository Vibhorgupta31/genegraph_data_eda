In many patients with an EVA/PS phenotype, mutation screening of SLC26A4 fails to identify two disease-causing allele variants. That a sizable fraction of patients carry only one SLC26A4 mutation suggests that EVA/PS is a complex disease involving other genetic factors. Here, we show that mutations in the inwardly rectifying K(+) channel gene KCNJ10 are associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss in carriers of SLC26A4 mutations with an EVA/PS phenotype. In probands from two families, we identified double heterozygosity in affected individuals. These persons carried single mutations in both SLC26A4 and KCNJ10. The identified SLC26A4 mutations have been previously implicated in EVA/PS, and the KCNJ10 mutations reduce K(+) conductance activity, which is critical for generating and maintaining the endocochlear potential. In addition, we show that haploinsufficiency of Slc26a4 in the Slc26a4(+/-) mouse mutant results in reduced protein expression of Kcnj10 in the stria vascularis of the inner ear. Our results link KCNJ10 mutations with EVA/PS and provide further support for the model of EVA/PS as a multigenic complex disease.","dc:creator":"Yang T","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations of KCNJ10 together with mutations of SLC26A4 cause digenic nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Yang Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not strong enough to support digenic inheritance."},{"id":"cggv:6b6f3ba5-613c-478c-882c-37ccef868f82","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ba01b3a-f71c-4195-86b8-2b16ad74ab06","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"SLC26A4-null mice, which had EVA and were deaf, lacked KCNJ10 protein in the stria vascularis, however Kcnj10 mRNA were present.

Loss of pendrin causes deafness via a loss of the K(+) channel Kcnj10 in stria vascularis and consequent loss of the endocochlear potential. Pendrin and Kcnj10 are expressed in different cell types. Here, we report that free radical stress provides a link between the loss of Kcnj10 and the loss of pendrin. Studies were performed using native and cultured stria vascularis from Slc26a4(+/-) and Slc26a4(-/-) mice as well as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. Kcnj10, oxidized proteins, and proteins involved in iron metabolism were quantified by Western blotting. Nitrated proteins were quantified by ELISA. Total iron was measured by ferrozine spectrophotometry and gene expression was quantified by qRT-PCR. At postnatal day 10 (P10), stria vascularis from Slc26a4(+/-) and Slc26a4(-/-) mice expressed similar amounts of Kcnj10. Slc26a4(-/-) mice lost Kcnj10 expression during the next 5 days of development. In contrast, stria vascularis, obtained from P10 Slc26a4(-/-) mice and kept in culture for 5 days, maintained Kcnj10 expression. Stria vascularis from Slc26a4(-/-) mice was found to suffer from free radical stress evident by elevated amounts of oxidized and nitrated proteins and other changes in protein and gene expression. Free radical stress induced by 3-morpholinosydnonimine-N-ethylcarbamide was found to be sufficient to reduce Kcnj10 expression in CHO-K1 cells. These data demonstrate that free radical stress provides a link between loss of pendrin and loss of Kcnj10 in Slc26a4(-/-) mice and possibly in human patients suffering from Pendred syndrome.","dc:creator":"Singh R","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Free radical stress-mediated loss of Kcnj10 protein expression in stria vascularis contributes to deafness in Pendred syndrome mouse model."},"rdfs:label":"Singh Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not convincing to support digenic inheritance."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:09f81c95-1213-4029-a6bd-279e52f240c7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:09f81c95-1213-4029-a6bd-279e52f240c7_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6002b326-9d5f-428b-b4cf-9541db40e655_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:70f03917-f2e3-462c-bb85-716539078e93","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"HPLC of SLC26A4 and KCNJ10","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011387","obo:HP_0000376"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:6002b326-9d5f-428b-b4cf-9541db40e655_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:058c7ed4-7e06-4566-99f3-e879f564f117","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002241.4(KCNJ10):c.581C>A (p.Pro194His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7469"}},{"id":"cggv:cad19c6a-4fcc-4d8f-8e66-54b590c82592","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000441.1(SLC26A4):c.1003T>C (p.Phe335Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/4842"}}],"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19426954"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19426954","rdfs:label":"7740-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Proband carries an SLC26A4 variant that is classified as Likely Pathogenic by four clinical testing labs in ClinVar.

KCNJ10 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2009 (Yang et al.​). A heterozygous missense variant has been reported in two probands, who also carry a heterozygous likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant in SLC26A4. No segregation information is available. This gene-disease association claim is supported by functional studies, which are not convincing enough to confirm a digenic inheritance (15320950, 17959752, 19426954). In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the association between KCNJ10 and enlarged vestibular aqueducts, and digenic inheritance with SLC26A4.
