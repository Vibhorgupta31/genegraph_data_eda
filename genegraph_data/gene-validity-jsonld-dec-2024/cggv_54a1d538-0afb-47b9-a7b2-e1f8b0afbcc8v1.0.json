Ultra-structural and/or functional defects of this axoneme are well-known to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, chronic otitis media, situs inversus, male infertility and in most severe cases, hydrocephalus. Only recently, mutations in genes encoding axonemal proteins with preferential expression in the testis were identified in isolated male infertility; in those cases, individuals displayed severe asthenozoospermia due to Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the sperm Flagella (MMAF) but not PCD features. In this study, we performed genetic investigation of two siblings presenting MMAF without any respiratory PCD features, and we report the identification of the c.2018T > G (p.Leu673Pro) transversion in AK7, encoding an adenylate kinase, expressed in ciliated tissues and testis. By performing transcript and protein analyses of biological samples from individual carrying the transversion, we demonstrate that this mutation leads to the loss of AK7 protein in sperm cells but not in respiratory ciliated cells, although both cell types carry the mutated transcript and no tissue-specific isoforms were detected. This work therefore, supports the notion that proteins shared by both cilia and sperm flagella may have specific properties and/or function in each organelle, in line with the differences in their mode of assembly and organization. Overall, this work identifies a novel genetic cause of asthenozoospermia due to MMAF and suggests that in humans, more deleterious mutations of AK7 might induce PCD.","dc:creator":"Lorès P","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Homozygous missense mutation L673P in adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) leads to primary male infertility and multiple morphological anomalies of the flagella but not to primary ciliary dyskinesia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54a1d538-0afb-47b9-a7b2-e1f8b0afbcc8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54a1d538-0afb-47b9-a7b2-e1f8b0afbcc8_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bfa92d42-9c5b-4e30-beb5-a54ab77fa1d1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f50def5-968e-4878-a8e8-780e7283acf9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Detection of AK7 by Western Blotting in Spermatozoa of Healthy Controls","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29365104","rdfs:label":"Detection of AK7 by Western Blotting"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2a442079-9571-4872-a0e0-b4d868ae53fb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d71e4b5-3e60-46e9-817a-767c65ea9a19","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"According to western blot and immunostaining results, AK7 is absent from sperm flagella of patients with mutation in the gene.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29365104","rdfs:label":"Detection of AK7 by Western Blotting in testis of patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The altered expression of the gene in patients was proved by both western blot and immunostaining."},{"id":"cggv:9f577228-e176-4e33-a4e4-450cbc7cdf88","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a78524d5-a2fd-4864-be21-56024adf89fa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunohistochemical staining of human tissues and mRNA analysis in normal controls show AK7 expression in the lung and in testis","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613900","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease.

We report here that a murine mutation of the evolutionarily conserved adenylate kinase 7 (Ak7) gene results in animals presenting with pathological signs characteristic of PCD, including ultrastructural ciliary defects and decreased ciliary beat frequency in respiratory epithelium. The mutation is associated with hydrocephalus, abnormal spermatogenesis, mucus accumulation in paranasal passages, and a dramatic respiratory pathology upon allergen challenge. Ak7 appears to be a marker for cilia with (9 + 2) microtubular organization. This is suggested by its tissue specificity of expression and also the stringent conservation of Ak7 ortholog structure only in protozoans and metazoans possessing motile (9 + 2) cilia. Collectively, our results indicate an ancestral and crucial role of Ak7 in maintaining ciliary structure and function, and suggest that mutations of the human ortholog may underlie a subset of genetically uncharacterized PCD cases.","dc:creator":"Fernandez-Gonzalez A","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutation of murine adenylate kinase 7 underlies a primary ciliary dyskinesia phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"AK7-Knockout mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"Same results were observed in mice models reported in (Vogel et al., 2012, PMID: 21746835) and (Lorès et al., 2018, PMID : 29365104)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:54a1d538-0afb-47b9-a7b2-e1f8b0afbcc8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54a1d538-0afb-47b9-a7b2-e1f8b0afbcc8_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.4},{"id":"cggv:5bf7585b-b1b5-4ba5-abaf-3c87cf738f84_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5bf7585b-b1b5-4ba5-abaf-3c87cf738f84","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":39,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f705af54-e7e5-48d1-9c00-0488d540807b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152327.5(AK7):c.2018T>C (p.Leu673Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7338036"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000246","obo:HP_0003251"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:36d4545a-3cff-42a1-8e5a-00cf5f9543a8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f705af54-e7e5-48d1-9c00-0488d540807b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29365104"},"rdfs:label":"Individual II-1"},{"id":"cggv:36d4545a-3cff-42a1-8e5a-00cf5f9543a8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36d4545a-3cff-42a1-8e5a-00cf5f9543a8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a1723946-1d18-4ec0-afbf-c4328be4c31a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1723946-1d18-4ec0-afbf-c4328be4c31a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":38,"allele":{"id":"cggv:21a4184e-b78a-4d49-a647-2f5331bd64dd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152327.5(AK7):c.1846G>A (p.Glu616Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7337981"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003251","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:fc392b96-42b0-4ad5-8bff-80d01acf8a60_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:21a4184e-b78a-4d49-a647-2f5331bd64dd"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34854019","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To identify the genetic causes of multiple morphological anomalies of the flagella (MMAF) and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT).","dc:creator":"Xiang M","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"A novel homozygous missense mutation in AK7 causes multiple morphological anomalies of the flagella and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband II-1"},{"id":"cggv:fc392b96-42b0-4ad5-8bff-80d01acf8a60","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc392b96-42b0-4ad5-8bff-80d01acf8a60_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.4}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6075,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":4.9,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3a1ba45c-0632-4fa3-a548-362b18f796d9","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0054731","gene":"hgnc:20091","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Spermatogenic failure-27 (SPGF27) is characterized by male infertility due to morphologic abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), including flagella that are short, absent, irregularly shaped, and coiled. Ultrastructural analysis shows loss of the central pair of microtubules, loss of the inner dynein arms, and peripheral doublet disorganization (PMID: 29365104).\nThe *AK7* (Adenylate kinase 7) gene was first reported in association with Spermatogenic failure 27 (MONDO:0054731, OMIM: 617965) in 2018 (PMID: 29365104), and in PCD patients in 2012 (PMID: 22801010).\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group and due to the differences in molecular mechanism and the phenotypic variability, the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP working group estimated that Spermatogenic failure 27 (MONDO:0054731), and in PCD patients in 2012 (PMID: 22801010) represent distinct diseases and decided to split the entities.\nEvidence from two probands (PMID: 29365104 and PMID: 34854019) is included in this curation. Homozygous missense mutations were detected in both patients. Less than half a point (0.4) is reached with this genetic evidence.\nAK7 is phosphotransferase that catalyzes the interconversion of nucleoside phosphates. This reaction provides energy for cellular processes requiring a stable supply of ATP. The AK7 protein has a WcaG motif near the N terminus, followed by an AK domain and a C-terminal DPY30 motif. The WcaG motif is a signature of some prokaryotic nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerases, and the DPY30 is a protein oligomerization motif.  \nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence. Abundant data confirms the expression of *AK7* in sperm flagella (PMID: 25613900, PMID: 29365104).\nMoreover, in patients with *AK7* mutations, the expression of the protein in sperm was altered (PMID: 29365104 and PMID: 34854019).\n*Ak7* knockout mice (Ak7 -/-) were generated by the insertion of a 4.5 kb transgene in the intron 5 of the *AK7* gene (PMID: 18776131). No *Ak7* expression was detected in homozygous transgenic mice.\n(Ak7 -/-) mice showed growth retardation, hydrocephalus, airway dilatation and thickening of airway walls, and excess of mucus in the paranasal sinuses.\nMale Ak7 -/- mice were infertile. They lacked mature spermatids and spermatozoa, and electron microscopy showed abnormal sperm heads and absence of tail structures (PMID: 18776131).\nSimilar results were reported in (PMID: 21746835 and PMID: 29365104).\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on March 9, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:54a1d538-0afb-47b9-a7b2-e1f8b0afbcc8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
