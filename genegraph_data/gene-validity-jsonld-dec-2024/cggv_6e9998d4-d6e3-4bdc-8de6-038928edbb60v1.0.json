We previously identified a disease locus on chromosome 16p12.1-q12.2 with genome-wide significant linkage in a large European Australian family with autosomal dominant inheritance of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and no mutation in known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or dementia genes. Here we demonstrate the segregation of a novel missense variant in CYLD (c.2155A>G, p.M719V) within the linkage region as the genetic cause of disease in this family. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue from two CYLD p.M719V mutation carriers showed widespread glial CYLD immunoreactivity. Primary mouse neurons transfected with CYLDM719V exhibited increased cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43 and shortened axons. CYLD encodes a lysine 63 deubiquitinase and CYLD cutaneous syndrome, a skin tumour disorder, is caused by mutations that lead to reduced deubiquitinase activity. In contrast with CYLD cutaneous syndrome-causative mutations, CYLDM719V exhibited significantly increased lysine 63 deubiquitinase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test P = 0.005). Overexpression of CYLDM719V in HEK293 cells led to more potent inhibition of the cell signalling molecule NF-κB and impairment of autophagosome fusion to lysosomes, a key process in autophagy. Although CYLD mutations appear to be rare, CYLD's interaction with at least three other proteins encoded by frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes (TBK1, OPTN and SQSTM1) suggests that it may play a central role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Mutations in several frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes, including TBK1, OPTN and SQSTM1, result in a loss of autophagy function. We show here that increased CYLD activity also reduces autophagy function, highlighting the importance of autophagy regulation in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","dc:creator":"Dobson-Stone C","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"CYLD is a causative gene for frontotemporal dementia - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e9998d4-d6e3-4bdc-8de6-038928edbb60_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e9998d4-d6e3-4bdc-8de6-038928edbb60_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.9},{"id":"cggv:6e9998d4-d6e3-4bdc-8de6-038928edbb60_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e9998d4-d6e3-4bdc-8de6-038928edbb60_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9915a163-d229-48bc-93ca-1d156ea48ae8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a7791f9-0280-43ac-87be-5045533b4629","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Both Family Aus-12 cases demonstrated widespread glial CYLD-immunoreactivity in the white matter, which was particularly marked in Individual IV:7 and was absent in the sporadic cases of ALS.

(Dobson-Stone et al., PMID: 32185393). *CYLD* codes for a deubiquitinating enzyme that specifically cleaves ‘Lys-63’-and linear ‘Met-1’ linked polyubiquitin chains and is involved in regulating NF-κB activation, Wnt signaling and TNF-alpha-induced necroptosis. *CYLD* has also been reported to cause a group of inherited skin adnexal tumor syndromes called *CYLD* cutaneous syndromes. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, autosomal dominant FTD and/or ALS8 (OMIM:619132) and autosomal dominant CYLD Cutaneous Syndromes: Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome (OMIM:605041), familial cylindromatosis (OMIM:132700), and multiple familial trichoepithelioma (OMIM:601606). The split curation for autosomal dominant Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome has been curated separately. Five missense variants that have been reported in five probands in two publications (PMIDs: 32185393 and 3468212) are included in this curation. Other missense variants reported in the literature have been excluded from scoring due to being outside the expert panel’s MAF cutoff (>0.00001) or not having an ALS phenotype (PMIDs: 36000313, 3468212, and 32666117). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be gain of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence; the preponderance coming from assays expressing the variant Met719Val (PMID: 32185393). Neuropathologic analysis of postmortem brain tissue of 2 affected individuals showed widespread glial *CYLD* immunoreactivity that was not present in other patients with sporadic FTD. There were also patchy areas of diffuse neuronal cytoplasmic *CYLD* staining in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, as well as *CYLD* immunoreactivity in the nuclei of pyknotic neurons.  Transfection of primary mouse cortical neurons with mutant M719V *CYLD* resulted in an increased proportion of neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 staining (~55%) compared to cells transfected with wildtype *CYLD* (~34%). Co-transfection of flagged *CYLD* constructs followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody reveals *CYLD* interacts with known ALS genes *OPTN*, *TBK1* and *SQSTM1*, though M719V does not abrogate the interaction. Additional in vitro cellular studies show that the M719V mutation resulted in impaired autophagosome fusion with lysosomes compared to wildtype. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on February 23, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6e9998d4-d6e3-4bdc-8de6-038928edbb60"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
