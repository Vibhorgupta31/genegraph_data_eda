To evaluate the prevalence of this deletion and its contribution to disease, we retrospectively analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data for 8194 individuals undergoing ES, followed by PCR confirmation and RT-PCR on individuals carrying homozygous or heterozygous exon 23 TBCK deletions. A fifth individual was diagnosed with the TBCK-related disorder due to a heterozygous exon 23 deletion in trans with a c.1860+1G>A (NM_001163435.2) pathogenic variant, and three additional heterozygous carriers were identified. Affected individuals and carriers were from diverse ethnicities including European Caucasian, South Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic American and African American, with only one family reporting consanguinity. RT-PCR revealed two out-of-frame transcripts related to the exon 23 deletion. Our results highlight the importance of identifying single-exon deletions in clinical ES, especially for genes carrying recurrent deletions.

The molecular mechanisms underlying its neuronal phenotype are largely unexplored. In this study, we reported two sisters, who harbored biallelic variants in TBCK and met diagnostic criteria for IHPRF3. We provided evidence that TBCK may play an important role in the early secretory pathway in neuroprogenitor cells (iNPC) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Lack of functional TBCK protein in iNPC is associated with impaired endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi vesicle transport and autophagosome biogenesis, as well as altered cell cycle progression and severe impairment in the capacity of migration. Alteration in these processes, which are crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and cytoarchitecture organization, may represent an important causative mechanism of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in IHPRF3. Whether reduced mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is secondary to impaired TBCK function over other secretory transport regulators still needs further investigation.","dc:creator":"Moreira DP","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Neuroprogenitor Cells From Patients With TBCK Encephalopathy Suggest Deregulation of Early Secretory Vesicle Transport."}},{"id":"cggv:f21f6897-e0e8-4edf-a1ba-36a33b30c9b9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cd2fc7c6-2de0-4a44-be80-2ba17c443a4f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35095425"}],"rdfs:label":"Moreira F6331-1"},{"id":"cggv:f21f6897-e0e8-4edf-a1ba-36a33b30c9b9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f21f6897-e0e8-4edf-a1ba-36a33b30c9b9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f21f6897-e0e8-4edf-a1ba-36a33b30c9b9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Neuroprogenitor cells (iNPC) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from the patient showed reduced mRNA and protein expression compared to controls."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"ID/ASD GCEP max score per proband is 2pts."},{"id":"cggv:77ed3746-5bfa-4cee-a0b6-2cbe98e993d3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:77ed3746-5bfa-4cee-a0b6-2cbe98e993d3_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:77ed3746-5bfa-4cee-a0b6-2cbe98e993d3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Neuroprogenitor cells (iNPC) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from the patient showed reduced mRNA and protein expression compared to controls."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"ID/ASD GCEP max score per proband is 2pts."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a27623fe-ad27-462d-acbe-3736cf0868f9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a27623fe-ad27-462d-acbe-3736cf0868f9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:cc2d8b3c-eaa9-49ae-be4b-fa3171201782","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001163435.3(TBCK):c.304C>T (p.Gln102Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA357970450"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001284","obo:HP_0002540","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0012736","obo:HP_0000618","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0002878","obo:HP_0001252"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:ae1c55df-ba72-4b14-a57c-d8af93ca5149_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cc2d8b3c-eaa9-49ae-be4b-fa3171201782"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30591081","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Homozygous mutation of TBC1 domain-containing kinase (TBCK) is the cause of a very recently defined severe childhood disorder, which is characterized by severe hypotonia, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, characteristic facies and premature death.

Here we demonstrate for the first time the histopathological characteristics of TBCK deficiency consisting of 1) a widespread and massive accumulation of lipofuscin storage material in neurons of the central nervous system without notable neuronal degeneration, 2) storage deposits in few astrocytes, 3) carbohydrate-rich deposits in brain, spleen and liver and 4) vacuolated lymphocytes.

There is marked clinical variability in patients, ranging from mild to severe. The severe phenotype is progressive, often leads to early death, and consists of prominent motor neuron degeneration, profound intellectual disability, leukoencephalopathy and brain atrophy, chronic respiratory failure, refractory epilepsy, and clinical features reminiscent of lysosomal storage disorders. The milder form is non-progressive, and presents with mild intellectual disability, autistic features, and mild motor impairment. The biological factors underlying this variable disease presentation remain unknown. Seven variants (nonsense, frameshift, and in-frame exonic deletion) reported in six probands from four publications (PMIDs: 27040691, 30591081, 35095425, 36317458) are included in this curation. Three variants are recurrent, including a founder variant known as the Boricua mutation in individuals of Puerto Rican descent (p.Arg126*) that is associated with the severe phenotype (PMIDs: 27040691, 27040692). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function (PMIDs: 27040691, 27040692, 34816123, 35095425).  \n\n*TBCK* encodes a putative GTPase-activating protein and has been shown to control cell growth and proliferation, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and mTOR signaling. This gene-disease relationship is supported by findings in skin, lymphocytic, and neuroprogenitor cells from both mildly and severely affected individuals equally demonstrating reduced mRNA and protein expression and decreased mTOR signaling compared to controls (PMIDs: 27040691, 27040692, 35095425). Greater mitochondrial and lysosomal defects were observed in fibroblasts from individuals expressing the severe neurodegenerative phenotype compared to those with a milder phenotype (PMID: 29283439). Additionally, histopathological features of lysosomal storage disease were detected by autopsy in siblings affected with the more severe *TBCK* encephalopathy (PMID 34816123). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *TBCK* and autosomal recessive syndromic complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 7, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1df2bd2a-9170-401b-b680-5f8613043b33"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
