We described the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of GSD VI through the clinical and genetic data we collected. Moreover, we conducted a literature review, and we compared the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of GSD VI between Chinese population and non Chinese population.  Results For the first time, we found that four Chinese patients showed cirrhosis in liver biopsy characterized by the formation of regenerative nodules. In addition, c.772+1G>A and c.1900G>C, p.(Asp634His) were recurrent in three Chinese families and four European families respectively indicating that the genotypic spectrum of PYGL gene may vary among the population.

These are two splice-site mutations and two missense mutations. A mutation of the 5' splice-site consensus of intron 14 causes the retention of intron 14 and the utilization of two illegitimate 5' splice sites, whereas a mutation of the 3' splice-site consensus of intron 4 causes the skipping of exon 5. Two missense mutations, N338S and N376K, both cause nonconservative replacements of amino acids that are absolutely conserved even in yeast and bacterial phosphorylases. We also report corrections of the PYGL coding sequence, sequence polymorphisms, and a partial PYGL gene structure with introns in the same positions as in PYGM, the gene of the muscle isoform of phosphorylase.

The course of these disorders is generally mild, but definitive diagnosis requires invasive procedures. We analyzed a Mennonite kindred with an autosomal recessive form of GSD6 to determine the molecular defect and develop a non-invasive diagnostic test. Linkage analysis was performed using genetic markers flanking the liver glycogen phosphorylase gene ( PYGL ), which was suspected to be the cause of the disorder on biochemical grounds. Mennonite GSD6 was linked to the PYGL locus with a multipoint LOD score of 4.7. The PYGL gene was analyzed for mutations by sequencing genomic DNA. Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a splice site abnormality of the intron 13 splice donor. Confirmation of the genomic mutation was performed by sequencing RT-PCR products, which showed heterogeneous PYGL mRNA lacking all or part of exon 13 in affected persons. This study is the first to demonstrate that a mutation in the PYGL gene can cause GSD6. This mutation is estimated to be present on 3% of Mennonite chromosomes and the disease affects 0.1% of that population. Determination of this mutation provides a basis for the development of a simple and non-invasive diagnostic test for the disease and the carrier state in this population and confirms biochemical data showing the importance of this gene in glucose homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Chang S","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Identification of a mutation in liver glycogen phosphorylase in glycogen storage disease type VI."}},"rdfs:label":"22-month-old girl"},{"id":"cggv:977df5a6-21e8-4746-b713-fa781f46d453","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:977df5a6-21e8-4746-b713-fa781f46d453_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Linkage-analysis and Sanger Sequencing\n\nDownscored for potential consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a8972373-d4c7-4ecb-ac2f-2475f5ab155f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8972373-d4c7-4ecb-ac2f-2475f5ab155f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:118f86a0-f832-486a-94cf-a72948796670","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002863.5(PYGL):c.1454A>G (p.Asn485Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7183458"}},"detectionMethod":"Next-generation sequencing panel","phenotypeFreeText":"Proband has consanguineous parents.

Transaminases, triglycerides, and cholesterol were elevated. In a liver biopsy, glycogen was strongly elevated (15% [normal range 2%–6%]), whereas borderline low values were determined for total phosphorylase (22 mmol/min/g protein [normal range 20–110 mmol/min/g protein]) and phosphorylase a (9 mmol/min/g protein [normal range 10–50 mmol/min/g protein]). Liver phosphorylase kinase was also low (1 mmol/min/g protein [normal 3–30 mmol/min/g protein]). Total phosphorylase and phosphorylase a in leukocytes were in the normal range, as were glycogen and phosphorylase kinase in erythrocytes.\n\nThe biochemical data on patient 3 were ambiguous because both phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase were low in a liver biopsy but were normal in blood cells, and the patient was not available to allow us to repeat the enzyme determinations. Since patient 3 is a daughter of consanguineous parents, an autosomal mode of inheritance was suspected, and the autosomal phosphorylase kinase genes that can give rise to liver glycogenosis—that is, PHKB and PHKG2 (Maichele et al. 1996; Burwinkel et al. 1997a, 1997b, 1998; van den Berg et al. 1997)—therefore were considered along with PYGL. However, the entire PHKG2 coding sequence and most of PHKB were analyzed, without any sequence abnormalities being found, whereas a plausible N376K missense mutation was found in PYGL. The example of patient 3 thus illustrates that mutation analysis may sub- stantiate a diagnosis of type VI glycogenosis when bi- ochemical analysis remains insufficient.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003124","obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0004325","obo:HP_0006568","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_6000979"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:43927dc9-023d-4a1b-80d0-b5dcc627cbdb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c8906c93-ca64-4f5e-bcd0-836a536bd868"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9529348"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 3 (TS.M)"},{"id":"cggv:43927dc9-023d-4a1b-80d0-b5dcc627cbdb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43927dc9-023d-4a1b-80d0-b5dcc627cbdb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Missense\nSanger Sequencing"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:bbfbc0dd-5869-46db-9279-5a33109a4b85_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbfbc0dd-5869-46db-9279-5a33109a4b85","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:b3efe0ec-5281-49b8-91f0-68f4ee3d3d1b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002863.5(PYGL):c.244-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA389697914"}},{"id":"cggv:2d68ab6f-7646-4692-bdc3-4b07526823bf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002863.5(PYGL):c.730C>T (p.Leu244Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA389691726"}}],"detectionMethod":"NGS.

Extended bioinformatics analysis was performed on the exome sequencing data of 5 patients who were clinically diagnosed as having or highly suspected of having GSD, and a single heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic or rare variant of uncertain significance single-nucleotide variant was identified on the PYGL gene. A recurrent, novel, 3.6-kb deletion involving exons 14 to 17 of PYGL was identified in three of the five patients. Together with the two novel and one established stop-gain SNVs, they were diagnosed as compounds heterozygous of PYGL variants and confirmed as GSD6. The detected 3.6-kb deletion was further screened in a Chinese cohort of 31,317 individuals without hepatic abnormalities, and 10 carriers were identified, showing an allele frequency of 0.016%. Compared with the previously established 47 PYGL pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNVs, the novel pathogenic deletion had the second highest allele frequency among the population. This recurrent, novel, 3.6-kb deletion improved the molecular diagnostic rate of the GSD6.

He had two older sisters, the next older sister was affected but the eldest one was only a carrier. Both parents were carriers of the variants. His father was infected with the HBV, while mother and other compatriot with no family history of liver disease as their known.\n\nThe proband was referred to the authors' hospital for further investigation of intermittent hematochezia, growth retardation, hepatomegaly, and elevation of transaminase.\n\nIt was noted that abdominal distension occurred after birth soon, but no treatment was given. It was not until there was intermittent hematochezia for 7 months with no abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea that he went to hospital. His class grade was the average at school. Physical examination showed growth retardation with a height of 97 cm (<−3SD) and a weight of 9 kg (−3SD to −2SD). There was no special face and no jaundice. It demonstrated hepatomegaly with liver palpable to 7 cm below the right costal margin, whereas the spleen was not palpable.\n\nLaboratory data showed liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 346 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 180 U/L), lactate (3.14 mmol/L) and 24-hour urine copper (0.68 μmol/24 h). The fasting blood glucose was slightly reduced after fasting (lowest 3.15 mmol/L). Adrenaline stimulation test had no positive effect to disintegrate glycogen. The biochemistry, blood ammonia, triglycerides, serum copper, ceruloplasmin, hematuria tandem mass spectrometry were within normal values. The autoantibodies of liver disease, hepatitis virus, cytomegalovirus, and epstein-barr virus revealed negative. CT of the abdomen suggested that the liver was tumefacient and the parenchyma density was increased. Since he had hematochezia, enteroscopy was performed. The results showed anal canal inflammation. The liver pathology was compatible with GSD (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). Finding showed hepatic lobular structures, neatly arranged hepatocytes and punctate necrosis. Strongly positive was demonstrated in periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS) in hepatocytes without diastase treatment, while PAS disappeared following diastase treatment. Moreover, masson staining showed more collagen fibroplasia in the slightly distensible portal area. The Ishak score was 3 for inflammation and 3 for fibrosis. To detect the reason for those differences, molecular genetic testing was performed in all members of this family using IDT exon chip capture and high-throughput sequencing by Kindstar Global.\n\nThe boy was diagnosed GSD and treated with uncooked cornstarch (2 g/kg, 6 hours intervals, taken between meals, before bedtime and at night), which serves as a slow release carbohydrate to prolong euglycemia between meals.\n\nThe proband was followed up with regular visits at the authors' hospital. He still had repeated presence of blood in stools 1 month later, but hepatomegaly reduced to 3.5 cm below the right costal margin. He suffered from acute upper respiratory infection at follow-up visit. Laboratory results showed ALT 97 U/L, AST 91 U/L, blood glucose 3.46 mmol/L, and lactate 1.68 mmol/L. Glutathione (0.1 g 3 times daily) and mesalamine (0.5 g once a day) were used in planning treatments. At 15 months follow-up, various data of the boy had changed (Table ​(Table1).1). By the 15th month of return visit, the boy still occasionally presented with presence of blood in stools. Hepatomegaly was reduced to 2.5 cm below the right costal margin. The transaminases and lactate returned to normal. The fasting blood glucose was slightly reduced (3.51 mmol/L).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002151","obo:HP_0003162","obo:HP_0004325","obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0002573","obo:HP_0031956"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:52673888-9487-4713-8d64-6aa38da88f67_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a84a664e-244a-4a76-b7ff-f37d184fab0d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33879691","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type VI is a rare disease caused by the inherited deficiency of liver phosphorylase.","dc:creator":"Zhan Q","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Glycogen storage disease type VI with a novel PYGL mutation: Two case reports and literature review."}},{"id":"cggv:12c64550-23f7-46ef-b35c-179d7d59470d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c6567dd1-ff5f-41e8-998c-6c0a7516f4bf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33879691"}],"rdfs:label":"61-month-old Chinese boy"},{"id":"cggv:12c64550-23f7-46ef-b35c-179d7d59470d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:12c64550-23f7-46ef-b35c-179d7d59470d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:52673888-9487-4713-8d64-6aa38da88f67","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:52673888-9487-4713-8d64-6aa38da88f67_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1f3c93e0-9df4-4c8d-b749-f0c48950fe8a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f3c93e0-9df4-4c8d-b749-f0c48950fe8a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":42,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:fb4c58b8-d573-4e73-b2bc-ac73900ed5de","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002863.5(PYGL):c.1366G>A (p.Val456Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341906"}},{"id":"cggv:9e62fe25-8b30-4718-85cc-590529e6a083","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002863.5(PYGL):c.2417_2418del (p.Ile806SerfsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695219346"}}],"detectionMethod":"NGS.

Age of Follow Up/Most Recent Report: 36 y.o. Age during Pregnancy: 38 y.o. Ethnicity: European, potentially German.\n\nThe patient is the first child of non-consanguineous parents. Clinical signs of hypoglycemia including sweating and shakiness were reported from early infancy throughout childhood. During early childhood the patient required feeding every 2 h, also at night. Hepatomegaly and elevated transaminases were first noted at 3 years. At the age of 6, a liver biopsy was performed and the diagnosis of GSD VI was made based on reduced activity of hepatic PYGL. Until age 13, the patient received regular cornstarch doses during the night, and no episodes of severe hypoglycemia were reported in the further course.\n\nFrom puberty until the age of 36, the patient was lost to follow-up. When she first presented to our metabolic centre at the age of 36, mild hepatomegaly was present, but otherwise she was in good metabolic control. She was on a self-chosen low-carb diet to reduce weight (body weight 113 kg, BMI 39.1 kg/m2). Mutation analysis of the PYGL gene was performed and yielded compound heterozygosity for the variants c.475G > C (p.Gly159Arg) and c.697G > A (p.Gly233Ser). The diet was switched to a protein-rich diet with reduction of simple sugars (protein 30% of total energy).\n\nAt age 38, the patient became pregnant after fertility treatment. Apart from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the pregnancy was uncomplicated. Her maximum fasting time during the night was 11 h with blood glucose levels above 4.2 mmol/L in the morning and ketone levels <0.1 mmol/L with rare exceptions. The patient took a protein-rich bedtime snack or alternatively 30 g of uncooked corn starch. No severe hypoglycemias occurred throughout pregnancy (lowest documented glucose level 3.7 mmol/L), however, no conctinuos glucose monitoring was performed. In compliance with our recommendation, no oral glucose tolerance test was performed in the second trimester. Weight gain during pregnancy was 25 kg (weight before pregnancy 100 kg, BMI 34.6 kg/m2).\n\nIn the 37th week of gestation, she spontaneously delivered a healthy baby boy (weight 3400 g (76th centile), length 52 cm (71th centile), head circumference 32.5 cm (6th centile)). Management in the peripartal period included an intravenous glucose-electrolyte infusion (starting dose 10 g glucose/h), and regular blood glucose and ketone measurements in the mother during labour. Under this regimen, blood glucose remained stable throughout delivery. The boy could be breastfed without any problems and shows normal development at age 5 months. With him being a heterozygous carrier of the disease, no special precautions needed to be taken.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0002910"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:a6753f1d-6fcd-4fb6-ae97-1cd9c23e6071_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:370f15ee-7191-49c5-a03f-f5889b37f22e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34026552","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Glycogen storage disease type VI is caused by biallelic variants in the ","dc:creator":"Grünert SC","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Successful pregnancy in a woman with glycogen storage disease type 6."}},{"id":"cggv:f825d58d-883b-48d7-abb9-94a100ab1472_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:46937157-96b2-4d04-85cf-c1554af94bec"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34026552"}],"rdfs:label":"patient"},{"id":"cggv:a6753f1d-6fcd-4fb6-ae97-1cd9c23e6071","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a6753f1d-6fcd-4fb6-ae97-1cd9c23e6071_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Mutation analysis (suspected Sanger)\n\nUpscored for recurrence"},{"id":"cggv:f825d58d-883b-48d7-abb9-94a100ab1472","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f825d58d-883b-48d7-abb9-94a100ab1472_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Mutation analysis (suspected Sanger)\n\nUpscored for recurrence\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:58d1f1d3-11c8-46be-8e64-0fb61653ff4a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58d1f1d3-11c8-46be-8e64-0fb61653ff4a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:b00cb1ad-1aa3-477a-9fa3-6253fb5f1347","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002863.5(PYGL):c.1016A>G (p.Asn339Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342908"}},{"id":"cggv:7b20be38-bb36-4db6-be27-f06b2ba4dbdd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002863.5(PYGL):c.529-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341170"}}],"detectionMethod":"\"Since the structure of PYGL has not been determined, we based our mutation search on the amplification of the PYGL coding sequence (Newgard et al. 1986), in four overlapping intervals (A–D), by reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR), from RNA isolated from whole blood.

Glycogen metabolism increases in a wide variety of tumors, suggesting that it is an important aspect of cancer pathophysiology. Herein we focused on the O-GlcNAcylation of liver glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL)-an important catabolism enzyme in the glycogen metabolism pathway. PYGL expressed in both HEK 293T and HCT116 was modified by O-GlcNAc. And both PYGL O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of Ser15 (pSer15) were decreased under glucose and insulin, whereas increased under glucagon and Na2S2O4 (hypoxia) conditions. Then, we identified the major O-GlcNAcylation site to be Ser430, and demonstrated that pSer15 and Ser430 O-GlcNAcylation were mutually reinforced. Lastly, we found that Ser430 O-GlcNAcylation was fundamental for PYGL activity. Thus, O-GlcNAcylation of PYGL positively regulated pSer15 and therefore its enzymatic activity.

The specific disease entity, glycogen storage disorder VI  (also referred to as Hers disease) (MONDO:0009294, OMIM:613741), is one of at least 15 different glycogen storage disorders which affect the body and its ability to correctly use or store glycogen. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: Hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, growth retardation, weight retardation, elevated hepatic transaminase levels, accumulation of glycogen in the liver cells/hepatocytes and response to the use of cornstarch supplements to prevent hypoglycemia.\n\nTwenty-six variants: (Canonical Splice Site (8 variants), Missense (10 variants), Nonsense  (6 variants),  Multi-Exon Deletion (1 variant), Frameshift (1 variant)) that have been reported in 25 probands and 1 family in 11 publications (PMIDs: 9529348, 9536091, 32268899, 33879691, 32961316, 28984260, 32892177, 34026552, 36105079, 32374048, 37264426) are included in this curation.\n\nMany of the probands were diagnosed during childhood after experiencing symptoms including hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, growth retardation, weight retardation or elevated transaminase and aminotransferase levels. However, their symptoms were largely able to be controlled through dietary changes or ingesting dosages of cornstarch. Siblings of the probands were also found to be affected to varying degrees of severity. \n\nOverall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function as shown in the probands. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as Expression A (Quantity: 1), Biochemical Function B (Quantity: 1), Biochemical Function A (Quantity: 1) and Non-Human Model: Mouse (Quantity: 1) (PMIDs: 25613900, 34939084, 30659246 and 31701076). First, ProteinAtlas data showed high levels of expression of PYGL in the liver, which is consistent with the liver-related features of GSD0 (PMID:25613900). Next, Chen et al. 2022 (34939084) documented that the addition of wild-type PYGL to HEK293T cells caused a dramatic increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity (Figure 6B). Kishnani et al 2019 (PMID: 30659246) describes how both PYGL and PHKG2 are involved with glycogen breakdown in the liver. Additionally, PHKG2 probands have very similar phenotypes to PYGL including hepatomegaly, growth retardation, elevated serum transaminases, increased liver glycogen and liver fibrosis. PHKG2 was classified as having a \"definitive\" relationship with glycogen storage disease IXc by the General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP. Lastly, Wilson et al 2019 describes a mouse model. This mouse model recapitulates many of the phenotypes seen in the human probands. The mouse model had hepatomegaly which recapitulates the same phenotype that is seen in the human proband. Both the mouse model and the human patients displayed abnormal hepatic glycogen storage. Additionally, the model also displayed hypoglycemia, just like the human probands (PMID: 31701076).\n\nIn conclusion, PYGL  is definitively associated with glycogen storage disorder VI (also referred to as Hers disease). This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the General IEM GCEP on September 27th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:268f120a-bd36-4de2-9f85-871a307f44af"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
