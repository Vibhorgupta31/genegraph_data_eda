Among these enzymes, SETD1B (SET domain containing 1b) has been linked to syndromic intellectual disability in human subjects, but its role in the mammalian postnatal brain has not been studied yet. Here, we employ mice deficient for Setd1b in excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain, and combine neuron-specific ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches to elucidate its role in neuronal gene expression. We observe that Setd1b controls the expression of a set of genes with a broad H3K4me3 peak at their promoters, enriched for neuron-specific genes linked to learning and memory function. Comparative analyses in mice with conditional deletion of Kmt2a and Kmt2b histone methyltransferases show that SETD1B plays a more pronounced and potent role in regulating such genes. Moreover, postnatal loss of Setd1b leads to severe learning impairment, suggesting that SETD1B-dependent regulation of H3K4me levels in postnatal neurons is critical for cognitive function.","dc:creator":"Michurina A","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Postnatal expression of the lysine methyltransferase SETD1B is essential for learning and the regulation of neuron-enriched genes."},"rdfs:label":"Protein Complex Interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:44c7e8ef-e3f7-483e-87bb-7de1c11637d4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:430b2c03-275f-48d5-af93-e2c7b3d605cb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4417b402-cd63-48f3-99b8-812c19df17c8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The model shows an impairment in learning and neuronal functioning.

Individuals with heterozygous variants in *SETD1B* have been reported to present with seizures, intellectual disability/developmental delay, speech delay, motor delay, autism, behavioral disorders, facial dysmorphism, and obesity. Six variants (frameshift, nonsense, splice) that have been reported in 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 34345025, 32546566, 31685013, 38048716) are included in this curation. Additional evidence (including missense variants with supportive functional data) has been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 35385430, 31440728, 29322246, 38313655, 38108116, 31110234), but the maximum for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThe autosomal dominant gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including animal models (mouse, PMID: 34806773, drosophila melanogaster PMID: 32346159) and protein interaction experiments (PMID: 34806773).\n\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SETD1B* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ID Autism GCEP on the meeting date 08/20/2024 (SOP Version 10). \n\nOf note, four individuals from three families with biallelic missense variants with similar neurodevelopmental phenotypes have also been reported, and are not included in this curation (PMID: 34345025). Additional information is needed to determine the role of biallelic variants in disease. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:44c7e8ef-e3f7-483e-87bb-7de1c11637d4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
