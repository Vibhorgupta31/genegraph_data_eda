However, with the exception of the peroxisome-targeting signal receptors and the receptor docking proteins, the function of most of these proteins, called peroxins, remains largely unknown. One step toward elucidating the function of a protein is to identify its interacting partners. We have used a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid system to analyze the interactions among a set of 12 mammalian peroxins and a yeast protein three-hybrid system to investigate whether proteins that interact with the same peroxin and have overlapping binding sites cooperate or compete for this site. Here we report a detailed interaction map of these peroxins and demonstrate that (i) farnesylation, and not the CAAX motif, of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex13p; (ii) the CAAXmotif, and not farnesylation, of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex11pbeta; and (iii) the C(3)HC(4) RING (really interesting new gene) finger domain of Pex12p does not alter the binding properties of Pex5p for the C-terminal peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1. Finally, we show that the Pex5p-Pex13p interaction is bridged by Pex14p and that the latter molecule exists predominantly as a dimer in vivo. Collectively, as demonstrated in this work with peroxins, these results indicate that the bacterial two-hybrid system is an attractive complementary approach to the conventional transcription-based yeast two-hybrid system for studying protein-protein interactions.","dc:creator":"Fransen M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Analysis of mammalian peroxin interactions using a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid assay."},"rdfs:label":"Fransen_PEX13/PEX14 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0bc37a98-eab1-4f01-947c-820fb1935cbc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9dbfb97-f977-4284-864c-83da651160e0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Matrix experiments with a Gal4p-based yeast 2-hybrid system was performed with the 12 full-length peroxins, tested systematically for pairwise interactions.

Peroxisomes are ubiquitous membrane-bound organelles involved in several important biochemical processes, notably lipid metabolism and the use of reactive oxygen species for detoxification. Using cultured cells, we systematically characterized the peroxisome assembly phenotypes associated with dsRNA-mediated knockdown of 14 predicted Drosophila homologs of PEX genes (encoding peroxins; required for peroxisome assembly and linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders), and confirmed that at least 13 of them are required for normal peroxisome assembly. We also demonstrate the relevance of Drosophila as a genetic model for the early developmental defects associated with the human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Mutation of the PEX1 gene is the most common cause of peroxisome biogenesis disorders and is one of the causes of the most severe form of the disease, Zellweger syndrome. Inherited mutations in Drosophila Pex1 correlate with reproducible defects during early development. Notably, Pex1 mutant larvae exhibit abnormalities that are analogous to those exhibited by Zellweger syndrome patients, including developmental delay, poor feeding, severe structural abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems, and early death.

Clinically, they are characterized by a spectrum of dysmorphia, neurological, liver, and other organ involvement. To date, mutations in 13 PEX genes encoding peroxins have been identified in patients with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders. Mutations in PEX13, which encodes peroxisomal membrane protein PEX13, are among the least common causes of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders with only three mutations reported so far. Here, we report on two infants whose clinical and biochemical profile was consistent with classical Zellweger syndrome and whose complementation analysis assigned them both to group H of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders. We show that they harbor two novel mutations in PEX13. One patient had a genomic rearrangement resulting in a 147 kb deletion that spans the whole of PEX13, while the other had an out-of-frame deletion of 14 bp. This represents the first report of a PEX13 deletion and suggests that further work is needed to examine the frequency of PEX13 mutations among Arab patients with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.","dc:creator":"Al-Dirbashi OY","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Zellweger syndrome caused by PEX13 deficiency: report of two novel mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19449432","rdfs:label":"Al-Dirbashi_Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for a 14-bp deletion in exon 2 that caused a frameshift and premature termination of translation.

PEX13 encodes a peroxisome membrane protein involved in PTS1 and PTS2 import. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by defects in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or peroxisome biogenesis, involving at least 14 PEX genes. PEX13 belongs to complementation group H or group 13, and mutations in the gene result in cells devoid of peroxisomes (Waterham and Ebberink 2012, PMID 22871920). \n\nPEX13 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder in 1999. (Shimozawa et al, 1999; PMID: 10332040, Liu et al, 1999; PMID: 10441568). At least 9 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (11 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 10332040, 21031596, 17041890, 10441568, 19449432).     \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. PEX13 interacts with PEX19 and PEX14 (PMID: 12096124, 15798189). Mouse models of PEX13 recapitulate the human disease (PMIDs: 12897163, 29187321) and functional experiments show impaired PTS1 and PTS2 import in PEX13-deficient cells (PMIDs: 21669930, 8858165).  \n  \nIn summary, PEX13 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peroxisome biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on October 4, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0c662669-4eb8-45e3-8540-c394ea40c1b2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
