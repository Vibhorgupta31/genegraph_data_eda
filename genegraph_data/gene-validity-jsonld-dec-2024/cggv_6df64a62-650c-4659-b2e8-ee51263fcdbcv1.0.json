While hundreds of mutations in more than 100 genes have been reported to cause RP, discovering the causative mutations in many patients remains a significant challenge. Exome sequencing in an individual affected with non-syndromic RP revealed two plausibly disease-causing variants in TRNT1, a gene encoding a nucleotidyltransferase critical for tRNA processing. A total of 727 additional unrelated individuals with molecularly uncharacterized RP were completely screened for TRNT1 coding sequence variants, and a second family was identified with two members who exhibited a phenotype that was remarkably similar to the index patient. Inactivating mutations in TRNT1 have been previously shown to cause a severe congenital syndrome of sideroblastic anemia, B-cell immunodeficiency, recurrent fevers and developmental delay (SIFD). Complete blood counts of all three of our patients revealed red blood cell microcytosis and anisocytosis with only mild anemia. Characterization of TRNT1 in patient-derived cell lines revealed reduced but detectable TRNT1 protein, consistent with partial function. Suppression of trnt1 expression in zebrafish recapitulated several features of the human SIFD syndrome, including anemia and sensory organ defects. When levels of trnt1 were titrated, visual dysfunction was found in the absence of other phenotypes. The visual defects in the trnt1-knockdown zebrafish were ameliorated by the addition of exogenous human TRNT1 RNA. Our findings indicate that hypomorphic TRNT1 mutations can cause a recessive disease that is almost entirely limited to the retina.","dc:creator":"DeLuca AP","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Hypomorphic mutations in TRNT1 cause retinitis pigmentosa with erythrocytic microcytosis."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish recapitulated features of the human SIFD "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5827,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:1e06156f-3a60-4e0c-bf47-ed68ad831af1","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014487","gene":"hgnc:17341","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Per Criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting working group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern underlying the disease entities: (1) Sideroblastic anemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fevers, and developmental delay (SIFD), (MIM:616084) and (2) Retinitis pigmentosa and erythrocytic microcytosis, (MIM:616959).\nTherefore, evidence favor lumping the entities (MIM:616084 and MIM:616959) to a single disease spectrum.\n\nTRNT1 (CCA-adding tRNA nucleotidyl transferase enzyme) performs an essential post- transcriptional modification by adding on the cytosine- cytosine-adenine (CCA) trinucleotide sequence to the 3′ end of all newly produced tRNAs. This TRNT1- dependent tRNA modification is essential for both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) to participate in protein biosynthesis. \n\nMutations in *TRNT1* were first reported to cause a syndrome characterized by congenital sideroblastic anemia, B-cell immunodeficiency, recurrent fevers and developmental delay (referred to as SIFD) in 2014 (PMID: 25193871). Retinitis pigmentosa and erythrocytic microcytosis were also reported in SIFD patients (PMID: 27370603).\n\n2 frameshift , 2 splicing , and 3 missense TRNT1 variants are used in this curation. Mechanism of pathogenicity seems to be loss of function resulting in impaired ability of TRNT1 to catalyze the formation of the CCA trinucleotide (PMID: 25193871)\n\nExperimental evidence also supports this gene-disease relationship. Phenotypes of the lumped diseases could be recapitulated in Zebrafish model system through the same molecular pathway. Morphological analysis of the MO-injected embryos (morphants) revealed cardiovascular defects and reduced eye size in addition to  reduced staining of hemoglobin-containing red blood cells and significantly reduced touch response. RNA sequencing confirmed that Morphants had a significantly lower CCA incorporation efficiency than controls (PMID: 26494905). Mt-tRNAs lacking CCA are also detected in patients’ fibroblasts compared to controls (PMID: 27370603).\n\nIn summary, *TRNT1* is definitively associated with the disease spectrum Sideroblastic anemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fevers, and developmental delay (SIFD) and Retinitis pigmentosa and erythrocytic microcytosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Deficiencies GCEP on October 7, 2022.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6df64a62-650c-4659-b2e8-ee51263fcdbc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
