Although fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue or the liver is initiated by citrate transport in exchange for malate across the mitochondrial membrane, the transporter responsible for supplying malate during citrate transport has not been identified. In the present study, we clarified the role of Slc25a10 in supplying malate for citrate transport and examined the effect of Slc25a10 suppression on the lipogenic pathway and lipid accumulation. We have reported an Slc25a10 increase in white adipose tissue in obese mouse models and a decrease in a fasted mouse model using expression profiles. Next, we examined the effect of Slc25a10 suppression by small interfering RNA on citrate transport in the lipogenic cell lines HepG2 and 3T3-L1. We observed that inhibition of malate transport by Slc25a10 suppression significantly reduced the citrate transport from the mitochondria to the cytosol. We also found that suppression of Slc25a10 down-regulated the lipogenic pathway, indicated by decreases in ACC1 expression and malonyl-CoA level. Furthermore, suppression of Slc25a10 decreased triglyceride lipid accumulation in adipose-differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. These results suggested that Slc25a10 plays an important role in supplying malate for citrate transport required for fatty acid synthesis and indicated that inhibition of Slc25a10 might effectively reduce lipid accumulation in adipose tissues.","dc:creator":"Mizuarai S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Identification of dicarboxylate carrier Slc25a10 as malate transporter in de novo fatty acid synthesis."},"rdfs:label":"siRNA knockdown of SLC25A10 in HepG2 Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Score 0.5 default given transporter of substrates essential for the Krebs cycle"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f04751e2-0577-423a-9d57-7f2611be61c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41da7782-ca46-40de-a958-847dc7238921","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Respiratory chain deficiency v. respiratory growth deficiency","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29211846","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial diseases are a plethora of inherited neuromuscular disorders sharing defects in mitochondrial respiration, but largely different from one another for genetic basis and pathogenic mechanism. Whole exome sequencing was performed in a familiar trio (trio-WES) with a child affected by severe epileptic encephalopathy associated with respiratory complex I deficiency and mitochondrial DNA depletion in skeletal muscle. By trio-WES we identified biallelic mutations in SLC25A10, a nuclear gene encoding a member of the mitochondrial carrier family. Genetic and functional analyses conducted on patient fibroblasts showed that SLC25A10 mutations are associated with reduction in RNA quantity and aberrant RNA splicing, and to absence of SLC25A10 protein and its transporting function. The yeast SLC25A10 ortholog knockout strain showed defects in mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial DNA content, similarly to what observed in the patient skeletal muscle, and growth susceptibility to oxidative stress. Albeit patient fibroblasts were depleted in the main antioxidant molecules NADPH and glutathione, transport assays demonstrated that SLC25A10 is unable to transport glutathione. Here, we report the first recessive mutations of SLC25A10 associated to an inherited severe mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorder. We propose that SLC25A10 loss-of-function causes pathological disarrangements in respiratory-demanding conditions and oxidative stress vulnerability.","dc:creator":"Punzi G","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"SLC25A10 biallelic mutations in intractable epileptic encephalopathy with complex I deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Yeast ortholog (DIC1) knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Yeast study showing respiratory growth deficiency scored at 0.5 points given not specific to complex I deficiency seen in patient, but clear impact on respiration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.1},{"id":"cggv:3c09b7ca-6e05-4cf7-8010-dfed0e2f607a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c09b7ca-6e05-4cf7-8010-dfed0e2f607a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:34f8fb2c-6b81-45bd-95db-56e35c7613ff","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012140.5(SLC25A10):c.[657C>T;763-37G>A] (p.Pro219=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658682644"}},{"id":"cggv:bb75f406-dbae-4137-b169-3c3923dfde90","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012140.5(SLC25A10):c.304A>T (p.Lys102Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA401517376"}}],"detectionMethod":"Three variants identified \nc.304A>T; p.

This is important for gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, urea synthesis, and sulfur metabolism, particularly in the liver.\n\nThe first and only case report of *SLC25A10*-related autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2018 (PMID: 29211846) in a 9-year-old male from non-consanguineous parents with epileptic encephalopathy, spasticity, elevated serum lactate and microcytic anemia. This individual had complex I deficiency and mitochondrial DNA depletion. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SLC25A10*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SLC25A10* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one patient who was compound heterozygous for a nonsense variant and complex combination of variants that impacts splicing.  This gene-disease association is also supported by siRNA knockdown of *SLC25A10* in HepG2 cells showing inhibition of malate transport from mitochondrial to cytosol (PMID: 16027120) and by yeast orthologue knockout studies (PMID: 29211846).  \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 20, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
