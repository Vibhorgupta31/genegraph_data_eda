Studying nine Desbuquois families, we identified seven distinct mutations in the Calcium-Activated Nucleotidase 1 gene (CANT1), which encodes a soluble UDP-preferring nucleotidase belonging to the apyrase family. Among the seven mutations, four were nonsense mutations (Del 5' UTR and exon 1, p.P245RfsX3, p.S303AfsX20, and p.W125X), and three were missense mutations (p.R300C, p.R300H, and p.P299L) responsible for the change of conserved amino acids located in the seventh nucleotidase conserved region (NRC). The arginine substitution at position 300 was identified in five out of nine families. The specific function of CANT1 is as yet unknown, but its substrates are involved in several major signaling functions, including Ca2+ release, through activation of pyrimidinergic signaling. Importantly, using RT-PCR analysis, we observed a specific expression in chondrocytes. We also found electron-dense material within distended rough endoplasmic reticulum in the fibroblasts of Desbuquois patients. Our findings demonstrate the specific involvement of a nucleotidase in the endochondral ossification process.","dc:creator":"Huber C","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Identification of CANT1 mutations in Desbuquois dysplasia."}},"rdfs:label":"Huber_Family 2"},{"id":"cggv:b8952aa8-5eca-4415-aa40-5567c57e944d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b8952aa8-5eca-4415-aa40-5567c57e944d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b8952aa8-5eca-4415-aa40-5567c57e944d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Proteoglycan synthesis in patient cells (p.R300H and p.P245RfsX3) incubated β-D-xyloside was significantly decreased compared to control cells (Nizon et al. 2012, PMID: 22539336)."}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"The prenatal GCEP subtracts 0.5 points from each allele for homozygosity, but adds back 0.5 points for functional evidence, reaching a total of 2.5 points for the proband."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1eda0043-4505-4833-9228-12e8984c728f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1eda0043-4505-4833-9228-12e8984c728f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":21,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:56051b7c-9a6e-40f7-aa61-238e1dbece80","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001159773.2(CANT1):c.358del (p.Gln120LysfsTer10)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695227049"}},{"id":"cggv:007bbb14-96ad-411c-b235-346b14124736","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001159773.2(CANT1):c.100delinsTT (p.Ala34PhefsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695227050"}}],"detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis at CANT1 and CHST3 loci was first performed, then both genes were sequenced","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004233","obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0001373","obo:HP_0000007"],"secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:d76fd05c-801d-4c1b-835a-c26d59ce568c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:56051b7c-9a6e-40f7-aa61-238e1dbece80"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22539336","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Desbuquois dysplasia (DD) is characterized by antenatal and postnatal short stature, multiple dislocations, and advanced carpal ossification. Two forms have been distinguished on the basis of the presence (type 1) or the absence (type 2) of characteristic hand anomalies. We have identified mutations in calcium activated nucleotidase 1 gene (CANT1) in DD type 1. Recently, CANT1 mutations have been reported in the Kim variant of DD, characterized by short metacarpals and elongated phalanges. DD has overlapping features with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations (SDCD) due to Carbohydrate (chondroitin 6) Sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3) mutations. We screened CANT1 and CHST3 in 38 DD cases (6 type 1 patients, 1 Kim variant, and 31 type 2 patients) and found CANT1 mutations in all DD type 1 cases, the Kim variant and in one atypical DD type 2 expanding the clinical spectrum of hand anomalies observed with CANT1 mutations. We also identified in one DD type 2 case CHST3 mutation supporting the phenotype overlap with SDCD. To further define function of CANT1, we studied proteoglycan synthesis in CANT1 mutated patient fibroblasts, and found significant reduced GAG synthesis in presence of β-D-xyloside, suggesting that CANT1 plays a role in proteoglycan metabolism.","dc:creator":"Nizon M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Further delineation of CANT1 phenotypic spectrum and demonstration of its role in proteoglycan synthesis."}},{"id":"cggv:fb78d987-1ac0-40c8-b1be-8e8c5eac1c02_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:007bbb14-96ad-411c-b235-346b14124736"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22539336"}],"rdfs:label":"Nizon_3"},{"id":"cggv:fb78d987-1ac0-40c8-b1be-8e8c5eac1c02","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb78d987-1ac0-40c8-b1be-8e8c5eac1c02_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d76fd05c-801d-4c1b-835a-c26d59ce568c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d76fd05c-801d-4c1b-835a-c26d59ce568c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:30c64852-60e0-44ce-bf10-cf7af11b1fa9_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:900c8d9f-ec33-4832-96a1-d19b86729bf0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:900c8d9f-ec33-4832-96a1-d19b86729bf0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0a6d2125-428f-4e13-94ff-3caceea68e36","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001159773.2(CANT1):c.898C>T (p.Arg300Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114109"}},"detectionMethod":"Mapped the Desbuquois type 1 gene to a 1.65 Mb interval on chromosome 17q25.5.

In addition, several conditions with overlapping features are related to this group and broaden the spectrum. The majority of these disorders have been linked to pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins implicated in the synthesis or sulfation of proteoglycans (PG). In a series of 30 patients with multiple dislocations, we have performed exome sequencing and subsequent targeted analysis of 15 genes, implicated in chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations, and related conditions. We have identified causative pathogenic variants in 60% of patients (18/30); when a clinical diagnosis was suspected, this was molecularly confirmed in 53% of cases. Forty percent of patients remain without molecular etiology. Pathogenic variants in genes implicated in PG synthesis are of major importance in chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations and related conditions. The combination of hand features, growth failure severity, radiological aspects of long bones and of vertebrae allowed discrimination among the different conditions.

In this study, we generated Cant1 KO mice using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. All F0 mice possessing frameshift deletions at both Cant1 alleles exhibited a dwarf phenotype. Germline transmission of the edited allele was confirmed in an F0 heterozygous mouse, and KO mice were generated by crossing of the heterozygous breeding pairs. Cant1 KO mice exhibited skeletal defects, including short stature, thoracic kyphosis, and delta phalanx, all of which are observed in DD type 1 patients. The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and extracellular matrix space were reduced in the growth plate cartilage of mutants, and proliferating chondrocytes lost their typical flat shape and became round. Chondrocyte differentiation, especially terminal differentiation to hypertrophic chondrocytes, was impaired in Cant1 KO mice.

Specifically, the glycosaminoglycan synthesis was decreased in chondrocytes from Cant1 knock-out mice and their hydrodynamic size was reduced, whilst the sulfation was increased and the overall proteoglycan secretion was delayed. Interestingly, knock-out chondrocytes had dilated ER cisternae suggesting delayed protein secretion and cellular stress; however, no canonical ER stress response was detected using microarray analysis, Xbp1 splicing and protein levels of BiP and ATF4. The observed proteoglycan defects caused deregulated chondrocyte proliferation and maturation in the growth plate resulting in the reduced skeletal growth. In conclusion, the pathogenic mechanism of DBQD1 comprises deregulated chondrocyte performance due to defective intracellular proteoglycan synthesis and altered proteoglycan properties in the extracellular matrix.","dc:creator":"Paganini C","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Calcium activated nucleotidase 1 (CANT1) is critical for glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis in cartilage and endochondral ossification."},"rdfs:label":"Paganini_mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9389,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c1b381fc-8b7f-446d-997d-8c61bffb78e4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009629","gene":"hgnc:19721","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*CANT1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Desbuquois dysplasia 1 in 2009 (Huber et al., PMID: 19853239). Desbuquois dysplasia is a rare type of osteochondrodysplasia characterized by short stature with short extremities, severe joint laxity with dislocation, and fetal growth restriction. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between Desbuquois dysplasia 1 and epiphyseal dysplasia, multiple, 7. Therefore, the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Desbuquois dysplasia 1 (OMIM:251450). 7 frameshift, 6 missense, and 2 nonsense variants that have been reported in 13 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 19853239, 22539336, 25252066, 28229453, 28742282, 31988067) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is currently unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration of patient cells and animal models (PMIDs: 19853239, 30439444, 32277574). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CANT1* and autosomal recessive Desbuquois dysplasia 1.
