The disease is characterized by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins and is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the stepwise assembly of dolichol-oligosaccharide used for protein N-glycosylation. We report that fibroblasts from a type I CDG patient, born of consanguineous parents, are deficient in their capacity to add the eighth mannose residue onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. We have characterized cDNA corresponding to the human ortholog of the yeast gene ALG12 that encodes the dolichyl-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichyl alpha6-mannosyltransferase that is thought to accomplish this reaction, and we show that the patient is homozygous for a point mutation (T571G) that causes an amino acid substitution (F142V) in a conserved region of the protein. As the pathological phenotype of the fibroblasts of the patient was largely normalized upon transduction with the wild type gene, we demonstrate that the F142V substitution is the underlying cause of this new CDG, which we suggest be called CDG Ig. Finally, we show that the fibroblasts of the patient are capable of the direct transfer of Man(7)GlcNAc(2) from dolichol onto protein and that this N-linked structure can be glucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum.","dc:creator":"Chantret I","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ig is defined by a deficiency in dolichyl-P-mannose:Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl mannosyltransferase."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:21631e85-8133-4703-a77c-c046effb6e56_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e26204ed-57d3-485b-a616-8c33ff4e3206_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e26204ed-57d3-485b-a616-8c33ff4e3206","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ad9b5370-ca44-47cd-ab03-7467cd0721f7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024105.4(ALG12):c.424T>G (p.Phe142Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252769"}},"detectionMethod":"Gene-specific cDNA sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Low IgG","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0002719","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0011344","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001999"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:662e7daf-d99e-4491-b895-463e05be61bb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ad9b5370-ca44-47cd-ab03-7467cd0721f7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11983712"},"rdfs:label":"Patient ME"},{"id":"cggv:662e7daf-d99e-4491-b895-463e05be61bb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:662e7daf-d99e-4491-b895-463e05be61bb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:662e7daf-d99e-4491-b895-463e05be61bb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Biochemical evidence: patient showed an isoelectric focussing pattern consistent with type 1 congenital disorder of glycosylation and patient's fibroblasts showed reduced capacity to add the 8th mannose residue, demonstrating a block at the level of the 7th mannose.

The impact of the molecular defects on protein glycosylation and in turn on the clinical phenotypes of patients with CDG is not yet understood. ALG12-CDG is due to deficiency of ALG12 α1,6-mannosyltransferase that adds the eighth mannose residue on the dolichol-PP-oligosaccharide precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum. ALG12-CDG is a severe multisystem disease associated with low to deficient serum immunoglobulins and recurrent infections. We thoroughly investigated the glycophenotype in a patient with novel ALG12 variants and immunodeficiency. We analyzed serum native transferrin, as first line test for CDG and we profiled serum IgG and total serum N-glycans by a combination of consolidated (N-glycan analysis by MALDI MS) and innovative mass spectrometry-based protocols, such as GlycoWorks RapiFluor N-glycan analysis coupled with LC-ESI MS. Intact serum transferrin showed, as expected for a CDG type I defect, underoccupancy of N-glycosylation sites. Surprisingly, total serum proteins and IgG N-glycans showed some specific changes, consisting in accumulating amounts of definite high-mannose and hybrid structures. As a whole, ALG12-CDG behaves as a dual CDG (CDG-I and II defects) and it is associated with distinct, abnormal glycosylation of total serum and IgG N-glycans. Glycan profiling of target glycoproteins may endorse the molecular defect unraveling the complex clinical phenotype of CDG patients.","dc:creator":"Sturiale L","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"ALG12-CDG: novel glycophenotype insights endorse the molecular defect."}},{"id":"cggv:61741687-6ad2-4842-bd9b-42f9ea5945e1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4857cfc2-3cba-4410-a5a1-1efdd2ef16bb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31529350"}],"rdfs:label":"Sturiale_1"},{"id":"cggv:61741687-6ad2-4842-bd9b-42f9ea5945e1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:61741687-6ad2-4842-bd9b-42f9ea5945e1_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:61741687-6ad2-4842-bd9b-42f9ea5945e1_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"N glycan processing defects in serum glycoproteins and IgG are consistent with other reported patients.

Both patients presented with symptoms indicating CDG, including developmental delay, hypotonia and failure to thrive, and tested positive for deficient glycosylation of transferrin. Labeling of the patients' lipid-linked oligosaccharides suggested mutations in the hALG12 gene, encoding a mannosyltransferase. Both patients were shown to carry previously unpublished hALG12-mutations. Patient 1 has one allele with a deletion of G29, resulting in a premature stop codon, and another allele with an 824G>A mutation yielding an S275N amino acid change. Patient 2 carries two heterozygous mutations (688T>G and 931C>T), resulting in two amino acid exchanges, Y230D and R311C. An adenoviral vector expressing wild type hALG12 corrects the abnormal lipid-linked oligosaccharide pattern of the patients' cells. In addition to common CDG symptoms, these patients also presented with low IgG and genital hypoplasia, symptoms previously described in CDG-Ig patients. We therefore conclude that a combination of developmental delay, low IgG, and genital hypoplasia should prompt CDG testing.","dc:creator":"Eklund EA","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Molecular and clinical description of the first US patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation Ig."}},"rdfs:label":"P2"},{"id":"cggv:c232e9d8-08a7-48b7-84c0-8bedf9982dc2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c232e9d8-08a7-48b7-84c0-8bedf9982dc2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c232e9d8-08a7-48b7-84c0-8bedf9982dc2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Complementation analysis using WT hALG12 and patient fibroblast cells corrected the biochemical phenotype. \n"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c4f19cb0-a5f4-4035-a9f3-176f10c7892e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c4f19cb0-a5f4-4035-a9f3-176f10c7892e","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:5b7f7ce5-ca66-4eb8-b2f1-3e4661335889","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024105.4(ALG12):c.473T>C (p.Leu158Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252773"}},{"id":"cggv:cd4ecabc-2746-467c-8cc9-0032131fc768","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024105.4(ALG12):c.1242C>G (p.Tyr414Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252774"}}],"detectionMethod":"gene-specific cDNA sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"supragluteal fat pads, MRI showing widening of the side ventricles, isoelectric focusing of serum transferrin demonstrating a type 1 CDG pattern.

Common phenotypes include intellectual disability, hypotonia, dysmorphic features, coagulation abnormalities and genitourinary abnormalities. Twenty-two unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift and an in-frame indel) that have been reported in 14 individuals across 11 publications (PMIDs: 11983712, 12093361, 12217961, 15639192, 16435218, 17506107, 25019053, 31529350, 34092405, 34467644, 34602961) are included in this curation. Several variants were evaluated but not scored due to high allele frequency in gnomAD (PMID: 31743061), discordant phenotypes (PMIDs: 31481313, 32530140), or lack of supporting biochemical evidence (PMID: 33461977). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. \n \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence. The protein encoded by *ALG12* is involved in the N-linked glycoprotein synthesis pathway; loss-of-function of different proteins in this pathway have been associated with intellectual disability (PMID: 23798010).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ALG12* and autosomal recessive *ALG12*-congenital disorder of glycosylation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 15, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:21631e85-8133-4703-a77c-c046effb6e56"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
