Homozygosity mapping and gene expression studies identified a 2 exon gene, C2ORF71. The encoded protein has no homologs and is highly expressed in the eye, where it is specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells. Two mutations were found in C2ORF71 in human RP patients: A nonsense mutation (p.W253X) in the first exon is likely to be a null allele; the second, a missense mutation (p.I201F) within a highly conserved region of the protein, leads to proteosomal degradation. Bioinformatic and functional studies identified and validated sites of lipid modification within the first three amino acids of the C2ORF71 protein. Using morpholino oligonucleotides to knockdown c2orf71 expression in zebrafish results in visual defects, confirming that C2ORF71 plays an important role in the development of normal vision. Finally, localization of C2ORF71 to primary cilia in cultured cells suggests that the protein is likely to localize to the connecting cilium or outer segment of photoreceptor cells.","dc:creator":"Nishimura DY","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Discovery and functional analysis of a retinitis pigmentosa gene, C2ORF71."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20398884","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"With a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 4,000, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of hereditary retinal degeneration. More than 30 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic autosomal-recessive (ar) RP. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping was conducted in one Dutch and one Israeli family affected by arRP. The families were found to share a 5.9 Mb homozygous region on chromosome 2p23.1-p23.3. A missense variant in one of the genes residing in this interval, C2ORF71, has recently been reported to be associated with RP. C2ORF71, encoding a putative protein of 1,288 amino acids, was found to be specifically expressed in human retina. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis revealed that in the mouse eye, C2orf71 is expressed as early as embryonic day 14. Mutation analysis detected a 1 bp deletion (c.946 del; p.Asn237MetfsX5) segregating with RP in the Dutch family, whereas a nonsense mutation (c.556C > T; p.Gln186X) was identified in the Israeli family. Microsatellite-marker analysis in additional Israeli families revealed cosegregation of a C2ORF71-linked haplotype in one other family, in which a 13 bp deletion (c.2756_2768 del; p.Lys919ThrfsX) was identified. Clinically, patients with mutations in C2ORF71 show signs of typical RP; these signs include poor night vision and peripheral field loss, typical retinal bone-spicule-type pigment deposits, pale appearance of the optic disk, and markedly reduced or completely extinguished electroretinograms. In conclusion, truncating mutations in C2ORF71 were identified in three unrelated families, thereby confirming the involvement of this gene in the etiology of arRP.","dc:creator":"Collin RW","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in C2ORF71 cause autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa."}],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:afbc5168-51f6-4f69-bf41-41b9a1d9d665_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:afbc5168-51f6-4f69-bf41-41b9a1d9d665_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa8b843c-a67d-408a-8eea-88bc793a2119","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5fba55a0-f2a5-417f-a229-213a9c2c2481","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The expression of PCARE (C2ORF71) in different adult human tissues was analyzed by RT-PCR using exon-spanning primers.

The disease entity associated with *PCARE* was initially named retinitis pigmentosa 54 (MIM# 613428). However, to accommodate the variability in retinal phenotypes observed in patients with variants in this gene, the disease entity used for this curation is “PCARE-related retinopathy” (MONDO:0800404).\n\nThirteen probands with 14 unique variants (8 nonsense, 5 frameshift, 1 missense) reported in three publications were curated (Collin et al, 2010, PMID: 20398884; Nishimura et al, 2010, PMID: 20398886; Gerth-Kahlert et al, 2017, PMID: 28763557). In addition, segregation evidence based on published LOD scores from 4 large families was included (Collin et al, 2010, PMID: 20398884; Nishimura et al, 2010, PMID: 20398886). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of PCARE, protein interaction with the products of other genes known to be involved in retinopathy, its expression in the photoreceptor layer of the retina, and the phenotype observed in non-human model organisms. Evidence supports that PCARE plays an important role in delivering actin associated components to the base of the photoreceptor outer segments to regulate the initial development of OS disks (Corral-Serrano et al 2020, PMID: 32312818). It has been shown to be expressed in retina in human and mice (Collin et al, 2010, PMID: 20398884; Nishimura et al, 2010, PMID: 20398886; Kevany et al, 2015, PMID: 25616964). Yest two-hybrid experiments show interaction with OFD1, CEP290 and CEP 250 (Corral-Serrano et al 2020, PMID: 32312818). Evidence in non-human organisms include the phenotype observed in a zebrafish morpholino knockdown (Nishimura et al, 2010, PMID: 20398886); a mouse knock out with severe retinal degeneration (Kevany ey al, 2015, PMID: 25616964); a zebrafish with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of *pcare1*, abnormal photoreceptor outer segments, and reduced behavioral and electrophysiological response to light (Corral-Serrano et al 2018, PMID: 29946172); and the identification of a homozygous frameshift variant in *PCARE* in Gordon Setter and Irish Setter dogs with progressive retinal atrophy (Downs et al, 2013, PMID: 22686255).\n\nIn summary, *PCARE* (c2orf71) is definitively associated with autosomal recessive PCARE-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on October 6th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:afbc5168-51f6-4f69-bf41-41b9a1d9d665"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
