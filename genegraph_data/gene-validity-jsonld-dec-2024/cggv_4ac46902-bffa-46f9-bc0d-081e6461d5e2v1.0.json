In humans, defects in structural components, docking complexes, or cytoplasmic assembly factors can cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic airway disease and defects in laterality. By using combined high resolution copy-number variant and mutation analysis, we identified ARMC4 mutations in twelve PCD individuals whose cells showed reduced numbers of ODAs and severely impaired ciliary beating. Transient suppression in zebrafish and analysis of an ENU mouse mutant confirmed in both model organisms that ARMC4 is critical for left-right patterning. We demonstrate that ARMC4 is an axonemal protein that is necessary for proper targeting and anchoring of ODAs.

ODA defects are the most common cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a congenital disorder of ciliary beating, characterized by recurrent infections of the upper and lower airways, as well as by progressive lung failure and randomization of left-right body asymmetry. Using a whole-exome sequencing approach, we identified recessive loss-of-function mutations within TTC25 in three individuals from two unrelated families affected by PCD. Mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and carrying a deletion of exons 2 and 3 in Ttc25 presented with laterality defects. Consistently, we observed immotile nodal cilia and missing leftward flow via particle image velocimetry. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in TTC25-deficient mice revealed an absence of ODAs. Consistent with our findings in mice, we were able to show loss of the ciliary ODAs in humans via TEM and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses. Additionally, IF analyses revealed an absence of the ODA docking complex (ODA-DC), along with its known components CCDC114, CCDC151, and ARMC4. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed interaction between the ODA-DC component CCDC114 and TTC25. Thus, here we report TTC25 as a new member of the ODA-DC machinery in humans and mice.","dc:creator":"Wallmeier J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"TTC25 Deficiency Results in Defects of the Outer Dynein Arm Docking Machinery and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia with Left-Right Body Asymmetry Randomization."},"rdfs:label":"ODAD1 function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4ac46902-bffa-46f9-bc0d-081e6461d5e2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0d081e9b-a405-45fa-8b45-04540d27ce7f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e55275d-98c8-4970-9b02-521d8502c755","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Significantly less organisms demonstrated abnormal body patterning (56% abnormal with MOs, 25% abnormal with MOs + human ARMC4 mRNA) (p<0.0001).

To fill this gap, we performed loss-of-function studies using RNAi. By analysis of four independent Drosophila RNAi lines targeting two non-overlapping regions of the CG5155 transcript, we demonstrate that this gene is required for male fertility. Therefore, we have named this gene Gudu. The transcript of Gudu is highly enriched in adult testes. Knockdown of Gudu by a ubiquitous driver leads to defects in the formation of the individualization complex that is required for spermatid maturation, thereby impairing spermatogenesis. Furthermore, testis-specific knockdown of Gudu by crossing the RNAi lines with the bam-Gal4 driver is sufficient to cause the infertility and defective spermatogenesis. Since Gudu is highly homologous to vertebrate ARMC4, also an Armadillo-repeat-containing protein enriched in testes, our results suggest that Gudu and ARMC4 are a subfamily of Armadillo-repeat containing proteins that may have an evolutionarily conserved function in spermatogenesis.

PCD23 is one of 50 primary ciliary dyskinesias that have been observed to be inherited in a monogenic fashion. Most PCD patients present with a chronic productive cough, recurrent respiratory infection, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Some patients also demonstrate situs inversus and neonatal respiratory distress (PMID:23849778).\n\n8 variants (1 missense, 5 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 1 large deletion) that have been reported in 8 probands across 2 publications (PMIDs: 2389778, 24203976) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. High-speed video microscopy of the respiratory cilia in 4 probands with *ODAD2* mutations showed reduced or absent ciliary beating. Transmission electron microscopy of these cilia showed a reduction or lack of outer dynein arms, which suggests that the *ODAD2* protein is important for the assembly of the outer dynein arm structure (PMIDs: 23849778, 24203976).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical evidence, expression data, model systems, and rescue experiments (PMIDs: 24055424, 27486780, 23715323, 23849778). First, *ODAD1* is also involved in the outer dyenin arm docking complex and is definitively associated with PCD20, which supports *ODAD2* also having a role in PCD (PMID: 27486780). Secondly, GTEx expression data shows high levels of *ODAD2* expression in the lungs, testes, and fallopian tubes, which is consistent with the PCD phenotype (PMID: 27486780). Next, fruit fly and zebrafish model systems demonstrate the respective PCD phenotypes of infertility and situs inversus (PMIDs: 24055424, 23849778). Finally, the situs inversus phenotype in the zebrafish was significantly rescued using a human copy of *ODAD2* (PMID:23849778).\n\nIn summary, *ODAD2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 23. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on the meeting date 11/10/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4ac46902-bffa-46f9-bc0d-081e6461d5e2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
