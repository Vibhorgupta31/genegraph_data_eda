By using homozygosity mapping in an individual with autosomal-recessive (ar) RP from a consanguineous family, we identified three sizeable homozygous regions, together encompassing 46 Mb. Next-generation sequencing of all exons, flanking intron sequences, microRNAs, and other highly conserved genomic elements in these three regions revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.497T>A [p.Leu166(∗)]) in C8orf37, located on chromosome 8q22.1. This mutation was not present in 150 ethnically matched control individuals, single-nucleotide polymorphism databases, or the 1000 Genomes database. Immunohistochemical studies revealed C8orf37 localization at the base of the primary cilium of human retinal pigment epithelium cells and at the base of connecting cilia of mouse photoreceptors. C8orf37 sequence analysis of individuals who had retinal dystrophy and carried conspicuously large homozygous regions encompassing C8orf37 revealed a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.156-2A>G) in two siblings of a consanguineous family and homozygous missense mutations (c.529C>T [p.Arg177Trp]; c.545A>G [p.Gln182Arg]) in siblings of two other consanguineous families. The missense mutations affect highly conserved amino acids, and in silico analyses predicted that both variants are probably pathogenic. Clinical assessment revealed CRD in four individuals and RP with early macular involvement in two individuals. The two CRD siblings with the c.156-2A>G mutation also showed unilateral postaxial polydactyly. These results underline the importance of disrupted ciliary processes in the pathogenesis of retinal dystrophies.","dc:creator":"Estrada-Cuzcano A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in C8orf37, encoding a ciliary protein, are associated with autosomal-recessive retinal dystrophies with early macular involvement."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:791b95ad-3c89-436c-aa6e-c153c1c1ea61_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:791b95ad-3c89-436c-aa6e-c153c1c1ea61_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3d837c7-afba-4f24-8795-efbeb93c964f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5e49f83-9903-4d92-9498-f7fcf77b560c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In adult human tissues, C8orf37 is expressed ubiquitously and there are high levels of mRNA expression in the brain, heart, and retinae (Figure 3A).

Sequencing of a DNA sample from a 17-year-old female affected with BBS did not identify any mutation in the known BBS genes. Whole-genome sequencing identified a novel loss-of-function disease-causing homozygous mutation (K102*) in C8ORF37, a gene coding for a cilia protein. The proband was overweight (body mass index 29.1) with a slowly progressive rod-cone dystrophy, a mild learning difficulty, high myopia, three limb post-axial polydactyly, horseshoe kidney, abnormally positioned uterus and elevated liver enzymes. Mutations in C8ORF37 were previously associated with severe autosomal recessive retinal dystrophies (retinitis pigmentosa RP64 and cone-rod dystrophy CORD16) but not BBS. To elucidate the functional role of C8ORF37 in a vertebrate system, we performed gene knockdown in Danio rerio and assessed the cardinal features of BBS and visual function. Knockdown of c8orf37 resulted in impaired visual behavior and BBS-related phenotypes, specifically, defects in the formation of Kupffer's vesicle and delays in retrograde transport. Specificity of these phenotypes to BBS knockdown was shown with rescue experiments. Over-expression of human missense mutations in zebrafish also resulted in impaired visual behavior and BBS-related phenotypes. This is the first functional validation and association of C8ORF37 mutations with the BBS phenotype, which identifies BBS21. The zebrafish studies hereby show that C8ORF37 variants underlie clinically diagnosed BBS-related phenotypes as well as isolated retinal degeneration.","dc:creator":"Heon E","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in C8ORF37 cause Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS21)."},"rdfs:label":"Heon_Zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"mutant zebrafish only recapitulate a subet of the major BBS symptoms"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:791b95ad-3c89-436c-aa6e-c153c1c1ea61_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94b7b1ad-7eff-4c0d-84f5-4690d8dfe694_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94b7b1ad-7eff-4c0d-84f5-4690d8dfe694","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:50630df6-3d9b-4b9b-9ed4-e7f67c5701cb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_177965.4(CFAP418):c.529C>T (p.Arg177Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA260013"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"RP + Postaxial polydactyly","previousTesting":true,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:0af1cda3-c834-4c8c-bfc4-ddeed112e8a5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:50630df6-3d9b-4b9b-9ed4-e7f67c5701cb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26854863","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a pleiotropic and clinically and genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy.

In a BBS patient from a consanguineous marriage we performed next-generation sequencing targeting all known BBS genes and other genes known or hypothesized to cause ciliopathies. While no mutation was present in any of the recognized genes for BBS, we were able to identify the homozygous non-conservative mutation c.529C>T (p.Arg177Trp) in C8orf37 that segregated with the phenotype, affects an evolutionarily highly conserved residue, and is bioinformatically predicted to be pathogenic. The same mutation has been described in unrelated patients with non-syndromic cone-rod dystrophy and other C8orf37 changes were found in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa.

(previously known as *C8orf37*) was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Bardet Biedl syndrome in 2012 (Estrada-Cuzcano et al., PMID: 22177090). BBS is a rare genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy, characterized by rod-cone dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, genital anomalies, renal anomalies, and intellectual disabilities. Additional families have affected members diagnosed with conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa or cone-rod dystrophy (PMID: 22177090, PMID: 25802487). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *CFAP418* disruption) were found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with Bardet-Biedl syndrome 21 (MIM# 617406), cone-rod dystrophy 16 (MIM# 614500), or retinitis pigmentosa 64 (MIM# 614500). The phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *CFAP418* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as CFAP418-related ciliopathy.\n\nThis curation includes eight variants (three canonical splicing, two missense, and three nonsense) that have been reported in nine probands in five publications (PMIDs: 22177090, 25802487, 27008867, 26854863, 26865426). The mechanism of pathogenicity is likely to be biallelic loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by an expression study showing that *CFAP418* is highly expressed in the retina, as well as localized at base of the photoreceptor connecting cilia and photoreceptor inner segments (PMID: 22177090). Using a zebrafish model with knockdown of the *CFAP418* ortholog, Heon et. al. show that the Kuppfer’s vesicle (a ciliated organ) of mutant zebrafish is smaller and has reduced cilia content compared to wild-type fish. Overexpressing the p.Arg177Trp or p.Gln182Arg variants in *CFAP418* results in Kuppfer’s vesicle defects and visual impairment (PMID: 27008867). Finally, a *CFAP418* knockout mouse model shows reduced scotopic and photopic ERG responses, progressive retinal degeneration, and a reduction in outer segment protein expression in the retina (PMID: 29440555).\n\nIn summary, *CFAP418* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive CFAP418-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 11, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:791b95ad-3c89-436c-aa6e-c153c1c1ea61"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
