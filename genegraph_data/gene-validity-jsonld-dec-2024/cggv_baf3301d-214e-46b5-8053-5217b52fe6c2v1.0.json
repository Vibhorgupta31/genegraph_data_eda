Here we report the cloning of a novel transient receptor potential cation channel gene and show that this gene is mutated in patients with the disorder. ML4 encodes a protein, which we propose to call mucolipin, which has six predicted transmembrane domains and is a member of the polycystin II subfamily of the Drosophila transient receptor potential gene family.

Most patients reach a maximal developmental level of 12?15 months. The disease was classified as a mucolipidosis following observations by electron microscopy indicating the lysosomal storage of lipids together with water-soluble, granulated substances. Over 80% of the MLIV patients diagnosed are Ashkenazi Jews, including severely affected and mildly affected patients. The gene causing MLIV was previously mapped to human chromosome 19p13.2-13.3 in a region of approximately 1 cM (ref. 7). Haplotype analysis in the MLIV gene region of over 70 MLIV Ashkenazi chromosomes indicated the existence of two founder chromosomes among 95% of the Ashkenazi MLIV families: a major haplotype in 72% and a minor haplotype in 23% of the MLIV chromosomes (ref. 7, and G.B., unpublished data). The remaining 5% are distinct haplotypes found only in single patients. The basic metabolic defect causing the lysosomal storage in MLIV has not yet been identified. Thus, positional cloning was an alternative to identify the MLIV gene.

This alteration abolished proper splicing of MCOLN1. The splice site at the end of the exon was not used due to an inhibitory effect of the inserted segment, resulting in two aberrant splice products containing stop codons in the downstream intron. These products were eliminated via nonsense-mediated decay. This is the first report of an inherited transfer of mitochondrial nuclear DNA causing a genetic disease. The elimination of the splice site by the mitochondrial DNA requires a change in splicing prediction models.","dc:creator":"Goldin E","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Transfer of a mitochondrial DNA fragment to MCOLN1 causes an inherited case of mucolipidosis IV."}},{"id":"cggv:87b42b7c-594c-4449-bad0-255820491b72_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cbf535c8-cdfb-456e-8028-28b4767ad0e5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15523648"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1-Goldin"},{"id":"cggv:87b42b7c-594c-4449-bad0-255820491b72","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87b42b7c-594c-4449-bad0-255820491b72_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:87b42b7c-594c-4449-bad0-255820491b72_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 18794901: in HEK293T cells, resulted in impaired cation channel activity; PMID: 25119295 - in HEK293T cells, showed altered cellular localization (retention at the endoplasmic reticulum)"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8510bb29-7dfb-4e0a-9f9b-5b788e9a8be9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8510bb29-7dfb-4e0a-9f9b-5b788e9a8be9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8510bb29-7dfb-4e0a-9f9b-5b788e9a8be9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"PMID: 15523648: shown via RT-PCR to alter splicing and lead to premature truncation and nonsense-mediated decay"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:baf3301d-214e-46b5-8053-5217b52fe6c2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:baf3301d-214e-46b5-8053-5217b52fe6c2_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8dacd8dd-3aaf-46f2-90e8-852f3ad88de4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:52224e75-2f2c-48fa-b3bf-333ffc889f64","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"MCOLN1 encodes mucolipin-1, a cation channel that is involved in lysosomal exocytosis, a calcium-dependent process where endosomes fuse with lysosomes, and then fuse with the plasma membrane, via mediating intracellular calcium concentrations through its role as a calcium channel (PMID: 15336987).

In addition, transfection of ML4 patient fibroblasts with wild-type MCOLN1 cDNA resulted in coincident restored mucolipin-1 cation channel activity and restored lysosomal exocytosis.

MCOLN1 encodes mucolipin-1, a cation channel that is involved in lysosomal exocytosis, a calcium-dependent process where endosomes fuse with lysosomes, and then fuse with the plasma membrane, via mediating intracellular calcium concentrations through its role as a calcium channel (PMID: 15336987). \nAmong patients with ML4, impaired mucolipin-1 function results in impaired lysosomal exocytosis (PMID: 16914343), leading to disease manifestations which include neurodegeneration with psychomotor retardation, ophthalmologic anomalies, and achlorhydria (as reviewed in PMID: 32604955, PMID: 21763169, PMID: 12182165). \n\nThe disease mechanism of ML4 is loss of function. ML4 was first reported by Berman et al. in 1974 (PMID: 4365943) and the first report of biallelic variants in MCOLN1 among ML4 patients was by Bargal et al. in 2000 (PMID: 10973263). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between MCOLN1 and ML4. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 10973263, PMID: 11030752, PMID: 15523648, PMID: 31899079, PMID: 18326692). In total, eleven variants from six probands in five publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between MCOLN1 and ML4 includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (mucolipin-1) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified in individuals with ML4 (PMID: 15336987, PMID: 16914343, PMID: 32604955, PMID: 21763169, PMID: 12182165); the biochemical and clinical features of MCOLN1 knockout mice (PMID: 17924347); and rescue of neurologic impairment and neuronal accumulation of undegraded lysosomal substrates via adenovirus -mediated gene therapy in MCOLN1 knockout mice (PMID: 29788236). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, MCOLN1 is definitively associated with ML4. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time.
