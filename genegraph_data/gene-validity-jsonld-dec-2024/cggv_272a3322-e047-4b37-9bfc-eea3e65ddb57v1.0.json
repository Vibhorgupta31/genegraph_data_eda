Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS IIIC) is a lethal disorder, caused by mutations in the heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT) gene and characterized by progressive neurological deterioration, with retinal degeneration as a prominent feature. We identified HGSNAT mutations in six patients with non-syndromic RP. Whole exome sequencing (WES) in an Ashkenazi Jewish Israeli RP patient revealed a novel homozygous HGSNAT variant, c.370A>T, which leads to partial skipping of exon 3. Screening of 66 Ashkenazi RP index cases revealed an additional family with two siblings homozygous for c.370A>T. WES in three Dutch siblings with RP revealed a complex HGSNAT variant, c.[398G>C; 1843G>A] on one allele, and c.1843G>A on the other allele. HGSNAT activity levels in blood leukocytes of patients were reduced compared with healthy controls, but usually higher than those in MPS IIIC patients. All patients were diagnosed with non-syndromic RP and did not exhibit neurological deterioration, or any phenotypic features consistent with MPS IIIC. Furthermore, four of the patients were over 60 years old, exceeding by far the life expectancy of MPS IIIC patients. HGSNAT is highly expressed in the mouse retina, and we hypothesize that the retina requires higher HGSNAT activity to maintain proper function, compared with other tissues associated with MPS IIIC, such as the brain. This report broadens the spectrum of phenotypes associated with HGSNAT mutations and highlights the critical function of HGSNAT in the human retina.","dc:creator":"Haer-Wigman L","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to mutations in the mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC gene, heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT)."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:272a3322-e047-4b37-9bfc-eea3e65ddb57_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:272a3322-e047-4b37-9bfc-eea3e65ddb57_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:042acd8a-868d-421c-9d5d-72bd839721da","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23c452bc-e955-400a-9c95-460baa535aba","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RT-PCR of human and mouse WT retina showed expression of HGSNAT.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25859010","rdfs:label":"Analysis of HGSNAT expression and splicing"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The protein is expressed in the retina.

Mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme cause mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC) or Sanfilippo syndrome type C. MPS IIIC patients exhibit progressive neurodegeneration, leading to dementia and death in early adulthood. Currently there is no approved treatment for MPS IIIC. Incidences of non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa and early signs of night blindness are reported in some MPS IIIC patients, however the majority of ocular phenotypes are not well characterized. The goal of this study was to investigate retinal degeneration phenotype in the Hgsnat knockout mouse model of MPS IIIC and a cadaveric human MPS IIIC eye. Cone and rod photoreceptors in the eyes of homozygous 6-month-old Hgsnat knockout mice and their wild-type counterparts were analyzed using cone arrestin, S-opsin, M-opsin and rhodopsin antibodies. Histological observation was performed on the eye from a 35-year-old MPS IIIC donor. We observed a nearly 50% reduction in the rod photoreceptors density in the Hgsnat knockout mice compared to the littermate wild-type controls. Cone photoreceptor density was unaltered at this age. Severe retinal degeneration was also observed in the MPS IIIC donor eye. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing ocular phenotypes arising from deleterious variants in the Hgsnat gene associated with MPS IIIC clinical phenotype. Our findings indicate retinal manifestations may be present even before behavioral manifestations. Thus, we speculate that ophthalmological evaluations could be used as diagnostic indicators of early disease, progression, and end-point evaluation for future MPS IIIC therapies.","dc:creator":"Ludwig J","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Histological characterization of retinal degeneration in mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC."},"rdfs:label":"Retinal evaluation of mouse knockout model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This paper provides evidence that loss of HGSNAT in the retina leads to retinal degeneration, but this is a full knockout mouse and better models MPS IIIC.

Here we describe the largest cohort to-date of HGSNAT-associated nonsyndromic RP patients, and describe their retinal phenotype, leukocyte enzymatic activity, and likely pathogenic genotypes. We identified biallelic HGSNAT variants in 17 individuals (15 families) as the likely cause of their RP. None showed any other symptoms of MPSIIIC. All had a mild but significant reduction of HGSNAT enzyme activity in leukocytes. The retinal condition was generally of late-onset, showing progressive degeneration of a concentric area of paramacular retina, with preservation but reduced electroretinogram responses. Symptoms, electrophysiology, and imaging suggest the rod photoreceptor to be the cell initially compromised. HGSNAT enzymatic testing was useful in resolving diagnostic dilemmas in compatible patients. We identified seven novel sequence variants [p.(Arg239Cys); p.(Ser296Leu); p.(Phe428Cys); p.(Gly248Ala); p.(Gly418Arg), c.1543-2A>C; c.1708delA], three of which were considered to be retina-disease-specific alleles. The most prevalent retina-disease-specific allele p.(Ala615Thr) was observed heterozygously or homozygously in 8 and 5 individuals respectively (7 and 4 families). Two siblings in one family, while identical for the HGSNAT locus, but discordant for retinal disease, suggest the influence of trans-acting genetic or environmental modifying factors.","dc:creator":"Schiff ER","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"A genetic and clinical study of individuals with nonsyndromic retinopathy consequent upon sequence variants in HGSNAT, the gene associated with Sanfilippo C mucopolysaccharidosis."}},{"id":"cggv:a468cf52-61a9-46c2-af30-3b3cb69824b5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:025e6df8-0e7c-458c-b0b1-89c272c77221"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770643"}],"rdfs:label":"MEH11"},{"id":"cggv:a468cf52-61a9-46c2-af30-3b3cb69824b5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a468cf52-61a9-46c2-af30-3b3cb69824b5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a468cf52-61a9-46c2-af30-3b3cb69824b5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant has been previously studied in Feldhammer et al, 2009 and Fedele and Hopwood, 2010.

These clinically heterogeneous disorders are caused by pathogenic variants in more than 270 genes. As 30-40% of cases remain genetically unexplained following conventional genetic testing, we aimed to obtain a genetic diagnosis in an IRD cohort in which the genetic cause was not found using whole-exome sequencing or targeted capture sequencing. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify causative variants in 100 unresolved cases. After initial prioritization, we performed an in-depth interrogation of all noncoding and structural variants in genes when one candidate variant was detected. In addition, functional analysis of putative splice-altering variants was performed using in vitro splice assays. We identified the genetic cause of the disease in 24 patients. Causative coding variants were observed in genes such as ATXN7, CEP78, EYS, FAM161A, and HGSNAT. Gene disrupting structural variants were also detected in ATXN7, PRPF31, and RPGRIP1. In 14 monoallelic cases, we prioritized candidate noncanonical splice sites or deep-intronic variants that were predicted to disrupt the splicing process based on in silico analyses. Of these, seven cases were resolved as they carried pathogenic splice defects. WGS is a powerful tool to identify causative variants residing outside coding regions or heterozygous structural variants. This approach was most efficient in cases with a distinct clinical diagnosis. In addition, in vitro splice assays provide important evidence of the pathogenicity of rare variants.","dc:creator":"Fadaie Z","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Whole genome sequencing and in vitro splice assays reveal genetic causes for inherited retinal diseases."}},"rdfs:label":"Fadaie Pt-18"},{"id":"cggv:06d58d9b-e993-4dcc-8ddb-a2f604fb408d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06d58d9b-e993-4dcc-8ddb-a2f604fb408d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:06d58d9b-e993-4dcc-8ddb-a2f604fb408d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant has been previously studied in Feldhammer et al, 2009 and Fedele and Hopwood, 2010.

This disease consists of only non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa and does not include any other organ system. Loss of function mutations in *HGSNAT* have also been shown to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC. Based on detailed discussion between the Lysosomal Diseases and Retina GCEPs, expert opinion concluded that the two disorders noted in OMIM, i.e. mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (Sanfilippo C, MIM#: 252930) and retinitis pigmentosa 73 (MIM:# 616544), should remain split for the purposes of gene curation. While retinopathy can be one of the features observed in individuals with MPS IIIC, those individuals have involvement of multiple organ systems. At the time of precuration, the reported individuals with retinitis pigmentosa 73 (PMIDs: 25859010, 32347150, 32770643) have isolated retinopathy without extra-ocular features (except for one patient with mild hearing loss). When measured, N-acetyltransferase activity was usually reduced in patients with isolated retinopathy, but less so than in patients with MPS IIIC. There are no reports of identical genotypes causing isolated retinopathy and MPS IIIC. Therefore, the two disease entities will remain split for gene-disease clinical validity curation. However, it is recommended that patients with retinopathy and variants in *HGSNAT* be fully evaluated for other features of MPS IIIC.\n\nThis curation includes twelve variants (four missense, two frameshift, one large deletion, and five disrupting splicing) that have been reported in thirteen probands in five publications (PMIDs: 25859010, 32770643, 28981474, 27608171, 34795310). Each proband harbored biallelic variants in *HGSNAT*. These variants were either presumed loss of function variants (splice site, frameshift) or had functional evidence supporting complete or partial loss of function. Two previous studies that evaluated the effect of missense variants on *HGSNAT* activity were used to provide functional evidence for some of the variants included in this curation (PMID: 19823584, PMID: 20583299). More cases are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The majority of cases had at least one copy of the p.Ala615Thr variant. This variant has been shown to reduce function in both of the functional studies mentioned above. Individuals homozygous for p.Ala615Thr may have later onset retinal degeneration or reduced penetrance of the disease. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be partial loss of function. It is important to note that full loss of function in both alleles leads to mucopolysaccharidosis type 3C while partial loss of function in both alleles or full loss of function in one allele combined with partial loss of function in the other allele results in *HGSNAT*-related retinopathy.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and a mouse model (PMIDs: 25859010, 36858249). The expression study showed that *HGSNAT* is expressed in both human and mouse retinas. A knockout mouse model exhibited significant rod specific photoreceptor degeneration compared to the wild-type control, which is consistent with the retinal degeneration seen in patients.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *HGSNAT* and autosomal recessive *HGSNAT*-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on April 2, 2024 (SOP version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:272a3322-e047-4b37-9bfc-eea3e65ddb57"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
