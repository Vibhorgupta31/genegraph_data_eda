PCD is mostly caused by mutations affecting the core axoneme structure of motile cilia that is essential for movement. Genes that cause PCD when mutated include a group that encode proteins essential for the assembly of the ciliary dynein motors and the active transport process that delivers them from their cytoplasmic assembly site into the axoneme. We screened a cohort of affected individuals for disease-causing mutations using a targeted next generation sequencing panel and identified two unrelated families (three affected children) with mutations in the uncharacterized C11orf70 gene (official gene name CFAP300). The affected children share a consistent PCD phenotype from early life with laterality defects and immotile respiratory cilia displaying combined loss of inner and outer dynein arms (IDA+ODA). Phylogenetic analysis shows C11orf70 is highly conserved, distributed across species similarly to proteins involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependant assembly of axonemal dyneins. Paramecium C11orf70 RNAi knockdown led to combined loss of ciliary IDA+ODA with reduced cilia beating and swim velocity. Tagged C11orf70 in Paramecium and Chlamydomonas localizes mainly in the cytoplasm with a small amount in the ciliary component. IFT139/TTC21B (IFT-A protein) and FLA10 (IFT kinesin) depletion experiments show that its transport within cilia is IFT dependent. During ciliogenesis, C11orf70 accumulates at the ciliary tips in a similar distribution to the IFT-B protein IFT46. In summary, C11orf70 is essential for assembly of dynein arms and C11orf70 mutations cause defective cilia motility and PCD.","dc:creator":"Fassad MR","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"C11orf70 Mutations Disrupting the Intraflagellar Transport-Dependent Assembly of Multiple Axonemal Dyneins Cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6bcfa4e4-37a3-43a7-9b4d-60554bc7600c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eba34acf-0b63-4ed7-a43f-4caf5782a98f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eba34acf-0b63-4ed7-a43f-4caf5782a98f","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a5e02d28-a9d2-4be0-bd99-0da4b47f6a30","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032930.3(CFAP300):c.433A>T (p.Arg145Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6246001"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Chronic wet cough","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002643","obo:HP_0033036","obo:HP_0000388","obo:HP_0002205","obo:HP_0002110"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9046323d-d5df-420a-93ca-3ef000992aca_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a5e02d28-a9d2-4be0-bd99-0da4b47f6a30"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727693","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by chronic airway disease, male infertility, and randomization of the left/right body axis as a result of defects of motile cilia and sperm flagella. We identified loss-of-function mutations in the open-reading frame C11orf70 in PCD individuals from five distinct families. Transmission electron microscopy analyses and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in C11orf70 cause immotility of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, respectively, as a result of the loss of axonemal outer (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs), indicating that C11orf70 is involved in cytoplasmic assembly of dynein arms. Expression analyses of C11orf70 showed that C11orf70 is expressed in ciliated respiratory cells and that the expression of C11orf70 is upregulated during ciliogenesis, similar to other previously described cytoplasmic dynein-arm assembly factors. Furthermore, C11orf70 shows an interaction with cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2, supporting our hypothesis that C11orf70 is a preassembly factor involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. The identification of additional genetic defects that cause PCD and male infertility is of great importance for the clinic as well as for genetic counselling.","dc:creator":"Höben IM","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mutations in C11orf70 Cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia with Randomization of Left/Right Body Asymmetry Due to Defects of Outer and Inner Dynein Arms."}},"rdfs:label":"OP-2190"},{"id":"cggv:9046323d-d5df-420a-93ca-3ef000992aca","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9046323d-d5df-420a-93ca-3ef000992aca_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The proband is a girl (OP-2190), born to unrelated German parents.

We also show that recursive splicing is a constitutive process, that depletion of U2AF inhibits recursive splicing, and that the sequence and function of ratchet points are evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila. Finally, we identify four recursively spliced human genes, one of which is also recursively spliced in Drosophila. Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed.","dc:creator":"Duff MO","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Genome-wide identification of zero nucleotide recursive splicing in Drosophila."},"rdfs:label":"RNA sequencing of total RNA from 20 human tissues"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ce58fe87-9799-4631-8942-2c4bf524d31b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9648f10-4906-4467-adbc-6fb944831c24","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"C11orf70 was able to pull down DNAAF2 but no other cytoplasmic preassembly factors","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727693","rdfs:label":"CFAP300 direct interaction with DNAAF2 "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:96f3e0ae-52e2-454a-b585-d09b0aac5875","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c95bfe2-47c8-476d-9bdd-a04946736c0c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"TEM analyses of respiratory cilia isolated from individuals with biallelic C11orf70 mutations and sperm flagella displayed both ODA and IDA defects.

Reported cases showed a consistent PCD phenotype with recurrent respiratory tract infection, neonatal respiratory distress and reduced nasal nitric oxide along with immotile respiratory cilia displaying combined loss of inner and outer dynein arms (IDA+ODA). Laterality defects were observed in some of the investigated PCD-affected individuals with biallelic *CFAP300* mutations (PMIDs:29727692, 29727693 and 30916986). Fertility defects are also reported in both male and female patients (PMID: 29727693).\n \nSeven (missense, splice site, and frameshift) variants that have been reported in 3 publications are used in this curation (PMIDs: 29727692, 29727693 and 30916986). Mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function resulting in defects in the dynein-arm assembly machinery (PMID: 29727693).\n \nPhylogenetic analysis shows that C11orf70 is expressed in species that require dynein arms for cilia motility (PMID:29727692). RNAi knockdown of the Paramecium *C11orf70* ortholog led to combined loss of ciliary IDA+ODA with reduced cilia beating and swim velocity (PMID:29727692). *C11orf70* shows a similar RNA expression profile to genes involved in dynein arm assembly, and to those coding for structural dynein arm proteins (PMID: 30916986). High resolution immunofluorescence revealed that the ODA components DNAH5, DNAH9, DNAI1, and DNAI2 as well as IDA components (DNALI1 and DNAH6) were absent or severely reduced from the respiratory ciliary axonemes of the affected individuals (PMIDs:29727693 and 30916986). The identification of *FBB5*, the Chlamydomonas *CFAP300* ortholog, as a member of a group of flagellar basal body genes and the cytoplasmic apical localization of the dynein arm components (DNAH5, DNAI2, and DNALI1) by IF in patients carrying biallelic *CFAP300* mutations, suggest a role of CFAP300 in dynein arm transport within the axoneme (PMID: 30916986).\n \nIn summary, *CFAP300* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 38. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical diagnostic and research settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on September 8, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6bcfa4e4-37a3-43a7-9b4d-60554bc7600c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
