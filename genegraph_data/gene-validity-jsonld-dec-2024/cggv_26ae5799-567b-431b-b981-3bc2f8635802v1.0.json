Eighteen unrelated Korean patients (10 females and 8 males; age range 0.0-19.6 years) with CHARGE syndrome were enrolled. Clinical data were collected by retrospective review of medical records. A serial analysis via sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification of CHD7 was performed to determine the molecular genetic spectrum of the patients. The prevalence of cardinal symptoms was as follows: coloboma (13/18, 72.2%), heart defects (13/18, 72.2%), choanal atresia/stenosis (4/18, 22.2%), retarded growth (10/18, 55.6%), genital anomalies (15/18, 83.3%) and ear abnormalities (18/18, 100%).

Furthermore, we identified genetic alterations in all 18 patients, including 10 novel mutations.

Although it was postulated 25 years ago that CHARGE syndrome results from the abnormal development of the neural crest, this hypothesis remained untested. Here we show that, in both humans and Xenopus, CHD7 is essential for the formation of multipotent migratory neural crest (NC), a transient cell population that is ectodermal in origin but undergoes a major transcriptional reprogramming event to acquire a remarkably broad differentiation potential and ability to migrate throughout the body, giving rise to craniofacial bones and cartilages, the peripheral nervous system, pigmentation and cardiac structures. We demonstrate that CHD7 is essential for activation of the NC transcriptional circuitry, including Sox9, Twist and Slug. In Xenopus embryos, knockdown of Chd7 or overexpression of its catalytically inactive form recapitulates all major features of CHARGE syndrome. In human NC cells CHD7 associates with PBAF (polybromo- and BRG1-associated factor-containing complex) and both remodellers occupy a NC-specific distal SOX9 enhancer and a conserved genomic element located upstream of the TWIST1 gene. Consistently, during embryogenesis CHD7 and PBAF cooperate to promote NC gene expression and cell migration. Our work identifies an evolutionarily conserved role for CHD7 in orchestrating NC gene expression programs, provides insights into the synergistic control of distal elements by chromatin remodellers, illuminates the patho-embryology of CHARGE syndrome, and suggests a broader function for CHD7 in the regulation of cell motility.","dc:creator":"Bajpai R","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"CHD7 cooperates with PBAF to control multipotent neural crest formation."},"rdfs:label":"Bajpai Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b0bee8a7-01b5-42b6-b4a5-6c42787d4c36","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b0f6eb2-5c24-4b69-9f56-f577deb5987b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The study found that CHD7 was expressed in the forebrain and otic placode during neurulation and gastrulation of the chicken emryo.

Furthermore, additional features of CHARGE syndrome have been reported in some patients with Kallmann syndrome and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism who harbor pathogenic CHD7 variants (PMID: 23533228, 25077900, 22399515, 30098700).\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern between these conditions suggesting that these may constitute a disease spectrum associated with variants in CHD7. Therefore, the three conditions have been lumped into the disease entity of CHARGE syndrome. \nAll scored variants arose de novo. Pathogenic variants include predicted loss-of-function (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice sites), missense and full and partial gene deletions suggesting the mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. The gene-disease association is supported by multiple animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 20130577, 20186815, 17334657). Therefore, this association was classified as Definitive by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Expert Panel on 6/26/2018.\nAdditionally, neurodevelopmental issues have been observed in some individuals with CHARGE syndrome and it has been claimed that these issues may be attributed to hearing/vision impairments though this correlation has not been found to be significant by one study (PMID: 12828403). Though developmental delay is considered a \"minor\" feature of CHARGE syndrome (PMID: 20301296), CHD7 is still tested as part of a number of clinical genetic testing panels marketed for neurodevelopmental disorders.  As such, on 8/15/2018 the ClinGen ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel evaluated the evidence originally assessed and classified as Definitive by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Expert Panel.  While the ID/Autism Expert Panel agreed that CHD7 is definitively associated with CHARGE syndrome, they note that there is a large degree of variation in the presence of intellectual disability in CHD7 patients and no animal model of CHD7-associated CHARGE syndrome has provided evidence for the ID phenotype.\nIn summary, although the spectrum of phenotypic features that are primary attributes of CHARGE syndrome are still being defined, the ClinGen Hearing Loss and ID/Autism Expert Panels have classified the overall association with CHARGE syndrome as Definitive as of 8/15/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:26ae5799-567b-431b-b981-3bc2f8635802"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
