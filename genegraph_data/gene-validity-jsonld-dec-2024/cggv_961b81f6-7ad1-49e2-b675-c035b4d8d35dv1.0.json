Here, we identify by whole-exome resequencing, mutations of MRE11, ZNF423, and CEP164 as causing NPHP-RC. All three genes function within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. We demonstrate that, upon induced DNA damage, the NPHP-RC proteins ZNF423, CEP164, and NPHP10 colocalize to nuclear foci positive for TIP60, known to activate ATM at sites of DNA damage. We show that knockdown of CEP164 or ZNF423 causes sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and that cep164 knockdown in zebrafish results in dysregulated DDR and an NPHP-RC phenotype.

However, the precise function of many ciliopathy-related proteins and the mechanisms by which these proteins are targeted to primary cilia are still not well understood. Here, we describe a protein-protein interaction network of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E (INPP5E), a prenylated protein associated with JBTS, and its ciliary targeting mechanisms. INPP5E is targeted to the primary cilium through a motif near the C terminus and prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase 6D (PDE6D)-dependent mechanisms. Ciliary targeting of INPP5E is facilitated by another JBTS protein, ADP-ribosylation factor-like 13B (ARL13B), but not by ARL2 or ARL3. ARL13B missense mutations that cause JBTS in humans disrupt the ARL13B-INPP5E interaction. We further demonstrate interactions of INPP5E with several ciliary and centrosomal proteins, including a recently identified ciliopathy protein centrosomal protein 164 (CEP164).

Despite their clear importance to human biology and health, the molecular mechanisms underlying multiciliated cell differentiation are poorly understood. Prior studies implicate the distal appendage/transition fiber protein CEP164 as a central regulator of primary ciliogenesis; however, its role in multiciliogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we have generated a novel conditional mouse model that lacks CEP164 in multiciliated tissues and the testis. These mice show a profound loss of airway, ependymal, and oviduct multicilia and develop hydrocephalus and male infertility. Using primary cultures of tracheal multiciliated cells as a model system, we found that CEP164 is critical for multiciliogenesis, at least in part, via its regulation of small vesicle recruitment, ciliary vesicle formation, and basal body docking. In addition, CEP164 is necessary for the proper recruitment of another distal appendage/transition fiber protein Chibby1 (Cby1) and its binding partners FAM92A and FAM92B to the ciliary base in multiciliated cells. In contrast to primary ciliogenesis, CEP164 is dispensable for the recruitment of intraflagellar transport (IFT) components to multicilia. Finally, we provide evidence that CEP164 differentially controls the ciliary targeting of membrane-associated proteins, including the small GTPases Rab8, Rab11, and Arl13b, in multiciliated cells. Altogether, our studies unravel unique requirements for CEP164 in primary versus multiciliogenesis and suggest that CEP164 modulates the selective transport of membrane vesicles and their cargoes into the ciliary compartment in multiciliated cells. Furthermore, our mouse model provides a useful tool to gain physiological insight into diseases associated with defective multicilia.","dc:creator":"Siller SS","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Conditional knockout mice for the distal appendage protein CEP164 reveal its essential roles in airway multiciliated cell differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Global and tissue specific (multiciliated) CEP164 KO mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0edceb34-3b5d-486b-9678-f52b4da2acfa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89039b24-0958-4745-acaf-33f040bc27fa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Zebrafish phenotype reflects defects in motile and primary cilium.

Mutations in > 50 genes account for around 70% of cases, with additional genes, and non-coding, synonymous, missense changes or structural variants (SVs) in known genes presumed to account for the missing heritability.","dc:creator":"Wheway G","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Whole genome sequencing in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia."}},{"id":"cggv:d22bb517-a079-4bce-95e7-6152d1c6082a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:874ed6e5-e74c-4dc7-865c-d1370d7c499e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34556108"}],"rdfs:label":"Family E"},{"id":"cggv:d22bb517-a079-4bce-95e7-6152d1c6082a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d22bb517-a079-4bce-95e7-6152d1c6082a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3003c2cc-ae05-40cb-a529-742bd7fc7f93","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3003c2cc-ae05-40cb-a529-742bd7fc7f93_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"penultimate exon, 230/282374 alleles in gnomAD with AF 0.0014 in Europeans\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5bc8457c-09e5-4ac1-9016-6cba14682f8d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5bc8457c-09e5-4ac1-9016-6cba14682f8d","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:aa093d1d-ef77-41f0-9666-b3ac94c373b6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014956.5(CEP164):c.4383A>G (p.Ter1461TrpextTer57)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA382746593"}},"detectionMethod":"Combination of homozygosity mapping with whole-exome resequencing ","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000556","obo:HP_0000618"],"secondTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:f61b52e0-fa0b-4aba-90c9-2050d22a5a8f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:aa093d1d-ef77-41f0-9666-b3ac94c373b6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22863007"},"rdfs:label":"KKESH001-7"},{"id":"cggv:f61b52e0-fa0b-4aba-90c9-2050d22a5a8f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f61b52e0-fa0b-4aba-90c9-2050d22a5a8f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f61b52e0-fa0b-4aba-90c9-2050d22a5a8f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In IMCD3 cells, number of centrosomes positive for CEP164 is reduced upon  over-expression of C-terminally GFP-tagged human CEP164 (CGFP-hCEP164-WT), which mimics the mutation p.X1460WextX57\n"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:961b81f6-7ad1-49e2-b675-c035b4d8d35d_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.5},{"id":"cggv:938e9c33-b3b6-4e56-bcaa-342dc1ffd82b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:938e9c33-b3b6-4e56-bcaa-342dc1ffd82b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":20,"allele":{"id":"cggv:be54cc54-053e-4827-9432-973170eab176","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014956.5(CEP164):c.277C>T (p.Arg93Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130150"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0001513","obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0000771","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000556"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Targeted exome sequencing of 21 previously reported ciliopathy genes associated with BBS ","secondTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:07473699-3821-4f78-abb0-14bd83d41de7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:be54cc54-053e-4827-9432-973170eab176"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27708425","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is both genetically and clinically heterogeneous. To date 19 genes have been associated with BBS, which encode proteins active at the primary cilium, an antenna-like organelle that acts as the cell's signaling hub. In the current study, a combination of mutation screening, targeted sequencing of ciliopathy genes associated with BBS, and whole-exome sequencing was used for the genetic characterization of five families including four with classic BBS symptoms and one BBS-like syndrome. This resulted in the identification of novel mutations in BBS genes ARL6 and BBS5, and recurrent mutations in BBS9 and CEP164. In the case of CEP164, this is the first report of two siblings with a BBS-like syndrome with mutations in this gene. Mutations in this gene were previously associated with nephronophthisis 15, thus the current results expand the CEP164-associated phenotypic spectrum. The clinical and genetic spectrum of BBS and BBS-like phenotypes is not fully defined in Pakistan. Therefore, genetic studies are needed to gain insights into genotype-phenotype correlations, which will in turn improve the clinician's ability to make an early and accurate diagnosis, and facilitate genetic counseling, leading to directly benefiting families with affected individuals.","dc:creator":"Maria M","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Genetic and clinical characterization of Pakistani families with Bardet-Biedl syndrome extends the genetic and phenotypic spectrum."}},"rdfs:label":"F05 V:2"},{"id":"cggv:07473699-3821-4f78-abb0-14bd83d41de7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07473699-3821-4f78-abb0-14bd83d41de7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:07473699-3821-4f78-abb0-14bd83d41de7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"p.R93W mutation strongly lowered the thermostability of the CEP164-NTD and reduced interaction between CEP164 and TTBK2. p.R93W did not interfere with CEP164 localization to the mother centriole but showed a significant reduction in ARL13b-positive cilia formation compared with the WT construct in hTERT RPE1 cells (34499853)."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:510a4286-5824-4188-9b29-14bbea080af3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:510a4286-5824-4188-9b29-14bbea080af3","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:9c3616b2-8cae-4263-b6cf-14aaca1733c0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014956.5(CEP164):c.3055C>T (p.Gln1019Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6295311"}},{"id":"cggv:5ba99de0-4ac8-459d-9bcc-1d164fdd39ec","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014956.5(CEP164):c.2535_2536dup (p.Glu846GlyfsTer10)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA942662030"}}],"detectionMethod":"Trio exome sequencing\n","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000126","obo:HP_0100779","obo:HP_0010297","obo:HP_0002119","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002444","obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0011802","obo:HP_0000191","obo:HP_0001159"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Patient 1 had a chromosomal microarray performed, which showed a 470 base pair duplication of unclear clinical significance at 5q35.2 (hg19:175,668,563–176,138,247) including the NOP16, FAF2, SIMC1, CLTB, and SNCB genes.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. The spectrum of reported phenotypes encompassed various signs and symptoms associated with defects of both the primary and motile cilium, in line with the known roles of CEP164. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: nephronophthisis 15 (MONDO:0013917) and Senior-Loken syndrome (MONDO:0017842). Seven different variants (2 missenses, 3 nonsenses, 1 frameshift and 1 stop loss) that have been reported in 6 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 22863007, 34132027, 27708425) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. Genetic variants have been associated with reduced protein interactions, ciliary defects and DNA damage. One nonsense variant (p.Gln525Ter/p.Q525X) has been associated with a dominant negative effect on cell growth (PMID: 22863007). This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, multiple animal models (zebrafish and mouse) as well as in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 31990917, 22863007, 23150559, 29244804, 31248650). Most importantly, *CEP164* knockdown causes ciliary defects in vitro, and global or conditional knockdown/knockout animal models recapitulate various aspects of the human disease. In summary, *CEP164* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ciliopathy-*CEP164* (MONDO:0005308). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 10/27/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:961b81f6-7ad1-49e2-b675-c035b4d8d35d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
