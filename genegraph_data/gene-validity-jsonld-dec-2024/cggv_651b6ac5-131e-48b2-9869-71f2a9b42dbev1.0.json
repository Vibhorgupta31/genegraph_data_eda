Severe osteopetrosis is also observed with mutations in the OSTM1 gene, which encodes a membrane protein of unknown function. Here we show that both ClC-7 and Ostm1 proteins co-localize in late endosomes and lysosomes of various tissues, as well as in the ruffled border of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Co-immunoprecipitations show that ClC-7 and Ostm1 form a molecular complex and suggest that Ostm1 is a beta-subunit of ClC-7. ClC-7 is required for Ostm1 to reach lysosomes, where the highly glycosylated Ostm1 luminal domain is cleaved. Protein but not RNA levels of ClC-7 are greatly reduced in grey-lethal mice, which lack Ostm1, suggesting that the ClC-7-Ostm1 interaction is important for protein stability. As ClC-7 protein levels in Ostm1-deficient tissues and cells, including osteoclasts, are decreased below 10% of normal levels, Ostm1 mutations probably cause osteopetrosis by impairing the acidification of the osteoclast resorption lacuna, which depends on ClC-7 (ref. 3).

Three main forms can be distinguished on the basis of severity, age of onset and means of inheritance: the dominant benign, the intermediate and the recessive severe form. While several genes have been involved in the pathogenesis of the different types of osteopetroses, the CLCN7 gene has drawn the attention of many researchers, as mutations within this gene are associated with very different phenotypes. We report here the characterization of 25 unpublished patients which has resulted in the identification of 20 novel mutations, including 11 missense mutations, 6 causing premature termination, 1 small deletion and 2 putative splice site defects. Careful analysis of clinical and molecular data led us to several conclusions. First, intermediate osteopetrosis is not homogeneous, since it can comprise both severe dominant forms with an early onset and recessive ones without central nervous system involvement. Second, the appropriateness of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in CLCN7-dependent ARO patients has to be carefully evaluated and exhaustive CNS examination is strongly suggested, as transplantation can almost completely cure the disease in situations where no primary neurological symptoms are present. Finally, the analysis of this largest cohort of CLCN7-dependent ARO patients together with some ADO II families allowed us to draw preliminary genotype-phenotype correlations suggesting that haploinsufficiency is not the mechanism causing ADO II. The availability of biochemical assays to characterize ClC-7 function will help to confirm this hypothesis.","dc:creator":"Pangrazio A","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Molecular and clinical heterogeneity in CLCN7-dependent osteopetrosis: report of 20 novel mutations."}},"rdfs:label":"p.Arg271Stop (homozygous)"},{"id":"cggv:fb837ea3-74ac-4f63-a14a-83423d973513","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb837ea3-74ac-4f63-a14a-83423d973513_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"I am downgrading due to potential consanguinity.

All the identified variants are expected to affect the stability or length of gene products except one nonsynonymous missense variant. TCIRG1 was found as a candidate causal gene in majority of the families. We report six novel variants; four in TCIRG1 and one each in CLCN7 and OSTM1.

Osteopetrosis is characterized by increased bone density, as a consequence of insufficient reabsorption of immature bone. First symptoms include macrocephaly, frontal bossing, skull structural anomalies, choanal stenosis, hydrocephalus, respiration issues, and hypocalcemia. The disease may cause vision and hearing loss, and facial palsy as well. Typical onset of disease is in the first couple of months of life. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (OMIM: 611490), autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (OMIM: 166600), and autosomal dominant hypopigmentation, organomegaly, and delayed myelination and development (HOD; OMIM: 618541). HOD lacks a skeletal phenotype, as it is a lysosomal storage disorder. The autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is more severe than the dominant form of osteopetrosis. The split curations for autosomal dominant osteopetrosis and for autosomal dominant HOD will be completed separately. 16 variants (missense, nonsense, large deletion, large insertion, stop loss) that have been reported in at least 10 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 11207362, 11741829, 14584882, 19953639, 30942407, 34753502) are included in this curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been exceeded. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (a mouse model, rescue evidence in mice, cell culture models of patient cells, and interaction evidence) (PMIDs: 11207362, 15706348, 16525474, 33905594). The mouse model was upgraded due to highly specific evidence (radiographs; skeletal anomalies, low body weight, and premature death in mutant mice). The protein was shown to interact with OSTM1 (also associated with autosomal recessive osteopetrosis). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CLCN7 and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date (9/6/2023; Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:651b6ac5-131e-48b2-9869-71f2a9b42dbe"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
