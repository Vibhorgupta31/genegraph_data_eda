We report six individuals from four families with bi-allelic variants in NRROS. All affected individuals had neurodegenerative disease with refractory epilepsy, developmental regression, and reduced white matter volume with delayed myelination. The clinical course in affected individuals began with normal development or mild developmental delay, and the onset of seizures occurred within the first year of life, followed by developmental regression. Intracranial calcification was detected in three individuals. The phenotypic features in affected individuals are consistent with those observed in the Nrros knockout mouse, and they overlap with those seen in the human condition associated with TGF-β1 deficiency. The disease-causing NRROS variants involve two significant functional NRROS domains. These variants result in aberrant NRROS proteins with impaired ability to anchor latent TGF-β1 on the cell surface. Using confocal microscopy in HEK293T cells, we demonstrate that wild-type and mutant NRROS proteins co-localize with latent TGF-β1 intracellularly. However, using flow cytometry, we show that our mutant NRROS proteins fail to anchor latent TGF-β1 at the cell surface in comparison to wild-type NRROS. Moreover, wild-type NRROS rescues the defect of our disease-associated mutants in presenting latent TGF-β1 to the cell surface. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of NRROS function causes a severe childhood-onset neurodegenerative condition with features suggestive of a disordered response to inflammation.","dc:creator":"Dong X","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Bi-allelic LoF NRROS Variants Impairing Active TGF-β1 Delivery Cause a Severe Infantile-Onset Neurodegenerative Condition with Intracranial Calcification."}},"rdfs:label":"Dong 2020 Family 1 II:2"},{"id":"cggv:6af9c962-529e-4502-af15-00005f59302c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6af9c962-529e-4502-af15-00005f59302c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6af9c962-529e-4502-af15-00005f59302c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Located in exon 3/3, removes a region of the TM domain. \nHA-tagged NRROS p.Leu661SerfsTer cDNA construct coexpressed in HEK293 cells with latent TGF-beta1 resulted in a loss of TGFbeta1 at the cell surface and loss of TGFbeta1 signalling.

The protein is preferentially expressed in the myeloid cells, microglia and periventricular macrophages of the brain and plays a role in the activation of the TGF-beta-1 signaling pathway and other proteins associated with innate immunity. The NRROS gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive early onset seizures with neurodegeneration and brain calcification in 2020 (Smith et al., PMID: 32100099). The clinical course is characterized by normal development to moderate global developmental delay during the first months of life, followed by the onset of seizures and then rapid, severe, progressive developmental regression and neurodegeneration. The seizures are typically refractory and include febrile seizures, infantile spasms, focal seizures, and myoclonic seizures, and occur at frequencies of multiple seizures daily or hourly. Most patients develop hypotonia early in life and can develop peripheral limb hypertonia later. Additional features include issues with recurrent aspiration and feeding difficulties requiring enteral feeding. Findings from brain MRI are variable but include reduction in white matter volume, delayed myelination, thin corpus callosum and cerebral atrophy. Patients for whom CT scans are available all showed punctate calcifications of cerebral matter. A total of 9 variants, including 2 missense and 7 truncating variants, have been reported in 7 probands from 4 publications and are included in this curation (PMIDs: 32100099, 32197075, 35099671, 35716448). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and mouse models which recapitulate the clinical phenotype (PMIDs: 32100099, 29909984, 32197075). In summary, NRROS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive early onset seizures with neurodegeneration and brain calcification. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 15th September 2023 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ebf06969-1af8-411f-bc64-7f1563851363"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
