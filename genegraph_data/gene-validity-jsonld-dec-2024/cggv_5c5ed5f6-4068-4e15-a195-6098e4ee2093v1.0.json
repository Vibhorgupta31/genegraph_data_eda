In a nonconsanguineous family with five affected siblings, linkage analysis and genomic sequencing revealed the genetic basis of Perrault syndrome to be compound heterozygosity for mutations in the mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase HARS2 at two highly conserved amino acids, L200V and V368L. The nucleotide substitution creating HARS2 p.L200V also created an alternate splice leading to deletion of 12 codons from the HARS2 message. Affected family members thus carried three mutant HARS2 transcripts. Aminoacylation activity of HARS2 p.V368L and HARS2 p.L200V was reduced and the deletion mutant was not stably expressed in mammalian mitochondria. In yeast, lethality of deletion of the single essential histydyl tRNA synthetase HTS1 was fully rescued by wild-type HTS1 and by HTS1 p.L198V (orthologous to HARS2 p.L200V), partially rescued by HTS1 p.V381L (orthologous to HARS2 p.V368L), and not rescued by the deletion mutant. In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced expression by RNAi of the single essential histydyl tRNA synthetase hars-1 severely compromised fertility. Together, these data suggest that Perrault syndrome in this family was caused by reduction of HARS2 activity. These results implicate aberrations of mitochondrial translation in mammalian gonadal dysgenesis. More generally, the relationship between HARS2 and Perrault syndrome illustrates how causality may be demonstrated for extremely rare inherited mutations in essential, highly conserved genes.","dc:creator":"Pierce SB","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations in mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase HARS2 cause ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural hearing loss of Perrault syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21464306","rdfs:label":"Pierce 2017 Family Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:75acc798-3424-4cc3-b37c-c7e0a7f41639_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0523ed43-85cd-494f-87f3-8c2fdcef48c8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Negative for GJB2 variants. 35 deafness gene panel.

Recently, mutations in five genes have been identified: C10orf2, CLPP, HARS2, HSD17B4, and LARS2. Probands included are presented with sensorineural deafness associated with gonadic dysgenesis. DNA was sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a panel of 35 deafness genes including the five Perrault genes. Exonic variations known as pathogenic mutations or detected with <1% frequency in public databases were extracted and subjected to segregation analysis within each family. Both mutations and low coverage regions were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Fourteen female index patients were included. The screening in four cases has been extended to four family members presenting with PS phenotype. For four unrelated patients (28.6%), causative mutations were identified: three homozygous mutations in C10orf2, CLPP, and HARS2, and one compound heterozygous mutation in LARS2. Three additional heterozygous mutations in LARS2 and HSD17B4 were found in three independent familial cases. All these missense mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing. Familial segregation analyses confirmed the molecular diagnosis in all cases carrying biallelic mutations. Because of NGS, molecular analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis of PS in 28.6% of our cohort and four novel mutations were found in four Perrault genes. For the unsolved cases, exome sequencing should be performed to search for a sixth unknown PS gene.","dc:creator":"Lerat J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"An Application of NGS for Molecular Investigations in Perrault Syndrome: Study of 14 Families and Review of the Literature."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650058","rdfs:label":"IV-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded because this variant is a missense in a consanguineous family"},{"id":"cggv:d5c92a05-681b-4834-939d-c4ceac8979c9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:634b93eb-49e0-4882-8c6e-8826f2946399","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Negative for GJB2 variants. 35 deafness gene panel.

The etiology of the hearing loss is speculated to have a major influence of CI outcomes, particularly in cases resulting from mutations in genes preferentially expressed in the spiral ganglion region. To elucidate precise gene expression levels in each part of the cochlea, we performed laser-capture micro dissection in combination with next-generation sequencing analysis and determined the expression levels of all known deafness-associated genes in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, lateral wall, and spiral limbs. The results were generally consistent with previous reports based on immunocytochemistry or in situ hybridization. As a notable result, the genes associated with many kinds of syndromic hearing loss (such as Clpp, Hars2, Hsd17b4, Lars2 for Perrault syndrome, Polr1c and Polr1d for Treacher Collins syndrome, Ndp for Norrie Disease, Kal for Kallmann syndrome, Edn3 and Snai2 for Waardenburg Syndrome, Col4a3 for Alport syndrome, Sema3e for CHARGE syndrome, Col9a1 for Sticker syndrome, Cdh23, Cib2, Clrn1, Pcdh15, Ush1c, Ush2a, Whrn for Usher syndrome and Wfs1 for Wolfram syndrome) showed higher levels of expression in the spiral ganglion than in other parts of the cochlea.
