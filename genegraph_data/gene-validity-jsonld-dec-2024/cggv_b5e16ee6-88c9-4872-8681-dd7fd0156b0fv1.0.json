Accordingly, BCATm is expressed in nearly all rodent, non-human primate, and human tissues with the exception of liver. The BCATm gene (Bcat2), under control of the constitutive human apoE gene promoter and its hepatic control region, was stably introduced into mouse liver. Two transgenic lines, expressing low (LivTg-LE) and high (LivTg-HE) levels of hepatic BCATm were established. Liver BCAT activity in LivTg-LE and LivTg-HE was 0.029 and 0.83 U/mg protein, respectively, compared to <0.001 U/mg protein in the control mouse livers. These transgenic mice are capable of both hepatic transamination and oxidation of BCAAs. Liver BCAAs (Leu, Ile, and Val) were up to 3-fold higher in wild type mice as compared to LivTg-HE mice. Statistically significant reductions in liver BCAA concentrations were also observed in the LivTg-LE mice (Table 1) suggesting that liver transamination of BCAAs is increased due to the expression of BCATm transgene especially in LivTg-HE animals. This study supports the function of BCAT2 in the metabolism of BCAAs. Therefore, if BCAT2 activity was deficient, BCAAs would be expected to be elevated, as is observed in individuals with variants in BCAT2.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886623","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Unlike other amino acids, the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) largely bypass first-pass liver degradation due to a lack of hepatocyte expression of the mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm). This sets up interorgan shuttling of BCAAs and liver-skeletal muscle cooperation in BCAA catabolism. To explore whether complete liver catabolism of BCAAs may impact BCAA shuttling in peripheral tissues, the BCATm gene was stably introduced into mouse liver. Two transgenic mouse lines with low and high hepatocyte expression of the BCATm transgene (LivTg-LE and LivTg-HE) were created and used to measure liver and plasma amino acid concentrations and determine whether the first two BCAA enzymatic steps in liver, skeletal muscle, heart and kidney were impacted. Expression of the hepatic BCATm transgene lowered the concentrations of hepatic BCAAs while enhancing the concentrations of some nonessential amino acids. Extrahepatic BCAA metabolic enzymes and plasma amino acids were largely unaffected, and no growth rate or body composition differences were observed in the transgenic animals as compared to wild-type mice. Feeding the transgenic animals a high-fat diet did not reverse the effect of the BCATm transgene on the hepatic BCAA catabolism, nor did the high-fat diet cause elevation in plasma BCAAs. However, the high-fat-diet-fed BCATm transgenic animals experienced attenuation in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in the liver and had impaired blood glucose tolerance. These results suggest that complete liver BCAA metabolism influences the regulation of glucose utilization during diet-induced obesity.","dc:creator":"Ananieva EA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Liver BCATm transgenic mouse model reveals the important role of the liver in maintaining BCAA homeostasis."},"rdfs:label":"Transgenic mice expressing BCAT2 in liver"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b150c657-0818-47e8-8665-5bfd4c031eb2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5a85789-e7f6-4b4e-8a0b-c19153a9b64a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"BCAT2 encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the first step of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism in which valine, isoleucine and leucine are transaminated to their respective Î±-keto acids.

We present genetic, clinical, and functional data in five individuals from four different families with homozygous or compound heterozygous BCAT2 mutations which were all detected following abnormal biochemical profile results or familial mutation segregation studies. We demonstrate that BCAT2 deficiency has a recognizable biochemical profile with raised plasma BCAAs and, in contrast with MSUD, low-normal branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) with undetectable l-allo-isoleucine. Interestingly, unlike in MSUD, none of the individuals with BCAT2 deficiency developed acute encephalopathy even with exceptionally high BCAA levels. We observed wide-ranging clinical phenotypes in individuals with BCAT2 deficiency. While one adult was apparently asymptomatic, three individuals had presented with developmental delay and autistic features. We show that the biochemical characteristics of BCAT2 deficiency may be amenable to protein-restricted diet and that early treatment may improve outcome in affected individuals. BCAT2 deficiency is an inborn error of BCAA catabolism.

When BCAA metabolism is genetically impaired in human, serum levels of BCAA and/or their metabolites rise considerably, causing severe neurological dysfunction. The first step in BCAA catabolism is catalyzed by branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT). Hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia caused by BCAT gene mutation in human have not been reported previously. A 25-year-old man presented with headache complaints and mild memory impairment for about six years. Brain MRI showed symmetric white matter abnormal signals. Metabolic studies revealed remarkably elevated plasma valine and leucine concentrations. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) diagnosis was not supported since all genes for the branched-chain Î±-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD) gene were normal. Interestingly, two heterogeneous BCAT2 gene mutations were found in the patient, including c.509Gâ>âA (p.Arg170Gln) and c.790Gâ>âA (p.Glu264Lys). In addition, c.509Gâ>âA (p.Arg170Gln) and c.790Gâ>âA (p.Glu264Lys) were found in his father and mother, respectively, suggesting an autosomal recessive disorder. BCAT2 functional studies demonstrated that the two BCAT2 gene mutations resulted in decreased BCAT2 enzyme activity. After treatment with vitamin B6, the levels of BCAA, especially valine were remarkably decreased and brain MRI lesions were improved. These findings suggest a new type of branched chain amino acid metabolism disorder. This rare case provides great insight into the further understanding of BCAA metabolism and its defect in human. BCAT2 gene mutations can cause hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia, which are associated with brain white matter lesions.

There are three branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) â leucine, isoleucine, and valine. A branched-chain amino acid transferase (BCAT), which is pyridoxine-dependent, carries out the first step of BCAA metabolism, using alpha-ketoglutarate to form branched chain alpha-keto acids. There are two isoforms of BCAT; BCAT1 (also known as BCATc) is cytosolic and expressed mainly in neurons, while BCAT2 (also known as BCATm) is mitochondrial and expressed in most tissues. The next step in branched chain amino acid metabolism is carried out by branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD), which is deficient in patients with Maple Syrup Urine disease, a condition characterized by elevated BCAAâs and branched chain keto-acids and allo-isoleucine. The relationship between BCAT2 and hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Biallelic variants in BCAT2 were first reported in 2015 in a single patient with hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia (Wang et al, 25653144). A further 6 patients have been reported since then, including an affected mother and daughter (Navarette et al, 2019, PMID 30626930; Knerr et al, 2019, PMID 31177572). To our knowledge, no other patients with this disorder and variants in BCAT2 have been reported in the literature. Nine unique variants (missense, inframe deletion, frameshift, and nonsense) in 6 probands from these three publications were curated; 6.25 points were given for genetic evidence. Note that that phenotype curated for was elevated leucine, valine, and isoleucine. The clinical findings of the reported patients include various neurological findings, including developmental delay in some of the patients. This could be due to ascertainment bias, and further studies are needed to assess the clinical features associated with this condition. \nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the function of BCAT2, which is consistent with the biochemical findings in patients (Ichihara et al, 1966, PMID 5943594; Bledsoe et al, 1997, PMID 9165094; Ananieva et al, 2017, PMID 27886623; Brosnan et al, 2006, PMID  16365084), functional alteration studies showing altered branched chain amino acid metabolism in cells from patients with BCAT2 variants (Knerr et al, 2019), and the findings in an ENU-generated mouse model (Wu et al, 2004, PMID 14755340) and a knock-out mouse. Additional experimental evidence is available but the maximum score (6 points) was given.\nIn summary, BCAT2 is definitively associated with hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b5e16ee6-88c9-4872-8681-dd7fd0156b0f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
