In the present study, we analyzed the SQSTM1 coding sequence for mutations in an extended cohort of 1,808 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), ascertained within the European Early-Onset Dementia consortium. As control dataset, we sequenced 1,625 European control individuals and analyzed whole-exome sequence data of 2,274 German individuals (total n = 3,899). Association of rare SQSTM1 mutations was calculated in a meta-analysis of 4,332 FTLD and 10,240 control alleles. We identified 25 coding variants in FTLD patients of which 10 have not been described. Fifteen mutations were absent in the control individuals (carrier frequency <0.00026) whilst the others were rare in both patients and control individuals. When pooling all variants with a minor allele frequency <0.01, an overall frequency of 3.2 % was calculated in patients. Rare variant association analysis between patients and controls showed no difference over the whole protein, but suggested that rare mutations clustering in the UBA domain of SQSTM1 may influence disease susceptibility by doubling the risk for FTLD (RR = 2.18 [95 % CI 1.24-3.85]; corrected p value = 0.042). Detailed histopathology demonstrated that mutations in SQSTM1 associate with widespread neuronal and glial phospho-TDP-43 pathology.

We examined p62 immunoreactivity in ubiquitin-immunoreactive intraneuronal inclusions in five ALSD cases with a broad clinicopathological spectrum. p62 immunoreactivity in ubiquitin-immunoreactive intraneuronal inclusions was seen in all cases.

Contrary to SQSTM1 overexpression, siRNA knockdown of SQSTM1 caused a significant increase in insoluble MAPT.\nSimilar to that of HEK293 cells, brain lysate from rTg4510, but not from control wild-type mice, induced robust formation of insoluble mutant MAPT deposit in primary neurons from rTg4510 mice, as revealed by MC1 antibody staining.  Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of SQSTM1, but not GFP, significantly reduced the formation of such MC1-positive insoluble MAPT species.\nResearchers also performed co-staining of  SQSTM1 with thioflavin-S (ThioS), a dye that binds to β sheet structures including NFTs, and found that SQSTM1 strongly colocalized with ThioS in HEK293 cells seeded with rTg4510 lysate but not control (Ctrl) lysate. A similar result was obtained when rTg4510 mouse brains were costained for ThioS and SQSTM1 and was further validated by double immunostaining of SQSTM1 with AT8 and MC1 antibodies.

Selective autophagy is a subtype of macroautophagy that requires cargo receptors, such as OPTN (optineurin) or SQSTM1, to recognize specific targets for their sequestration within the autophagosome and their eventual degradation by the lysosome, although their roles in targeting distinct MAPT species have not been fully investigated. Using cargo receptor knockout cell lines and a seeding-based cellular assay in which neurofibrillary tangle pathology can be modeled in vitro, we reveal that while OPTN primarily targets soluble MAPT expressed in physiological conditions, SQSTM1 predominantly degrades insoluble but not soluble mutant MAPT. Endogenous SQSTM1 colocalizes with misfolded and aggregated MAPT species in vitro and in vivo, and both this colocalization and its function in MAPT clearance require both the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif and also the PB1 self-polymerization domain of SQSTM1. Further, pathogenic MAPT accumulation reduces basal macroautophagy/autophagy in vitro and is associated with a compensatory upregulation of the lysosomal pathway in vivo. Finally, increased expression of SQSTM1 in MAPT transgenic mouse brains ameliorates MAPT pathology and prion-like spreading. Our results uncover distinct properties of selective autophagy receptors in targeting different MAPT species, implicate compromised autophagy as a potential underlying factor in mutant MAPT deposition, and demonstrate a potent and specific role of SQSTM1 in targeted clearance of pathogenic MAPT, through which it blocks neurofibrillary tangle accumulation and pathological spreading.

Autophagy is a critical pathway for degrading misfolded and/or damaged proteins, including the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants linked to familial ALS. We previously reported that p62 interacted with ALS mutants of SOD1 and that the ubiquitin-association domain of p62 was dispensable for the interaction. In this study, we identified two distinct regions of p62 that were essential to its binding to mutant SOD1: the N-terminal Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain (residues 1-104) and a separate internal region (residues 178-224) termed here as SOD1 mutant interaction region (SMIR). The PB1 domain is required for appropriate oligomeric status of p62 and the SMIR is the actual region interacting with mutant SOD1. Within the SMIR, the conserved W184, H190 and positively charged R183, R186, K187, and K189 residues are critical to the p62-mutant SOD1 interaction as substitution of these residues with alanine resulted in significantly abolished binding. In addition, SMIR and the p62 sequence responsible for the interaction with LC3, a protein essential for autophagy activation, are independent of each other. In cells lacking p62, the existence of mutant SOD1 in acidic autolysosomes decreased, suggesting that p62 can function as an adaptor between mutant SOD1 and the autophagy machinery.

SQSTM1, which encodes the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62, is genetically associated with ALS-FTLD, although to date autophagy-relevant functional defects in disease-associated variants have not been described. A key protein-protein interaction in autophagy is the recognition of a lipid-anchored form of LC3 (LC3-II) within the phagophore membrane by SQSTM1, mediated through its LC3-interacting region (LIR), and notably some ALS-FTLD mutations map to this region. Here we show that although representing a conservative substitution and predicted to be benign, the ALS-associated L341V mutation of SQSTM1 is defective in recognition of LC3B. We place our observations on a firm quantitative footing by showing the L341V-mutant LIR is associated with a ∼3-fold reduction in LC3B binding affinity and using protein NMR we rationalize the structural basis for the effect. This functional deficit is realized in motor neuron-like cells, with the L341V mutant EGFP-mCherry-SQSTM1 less readily incorporated into acidic autophagic vesicles than the wild type. Our data supports a model in which the L341V mutation limits the critical step of SQSTM1 recruitment to the phagophore. The oligomeric nature of SQSTM1, which presents multiple LIRs to template growth of the phagophore, potentially gives rise to avidity effects which amplify the relatively modest impact of any single mutation on LC3B binding.

Both, p62 KD SH-SY5Y cells and p62 mutant fibroblasts showed a depolarization in response to the F0-F1-ATP synthase (ATPase or complex V) inhibitor oligomycin, suggesting ΔΨm in p62 KD cells is partially maintained by ATP hydrolysis by the ATPase.\nThe activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and the rate of substrate supply can be estimated by measurement of mitochondrial NADH and FAD autofluorescence.

This split curation for autosomal recessive, childhood-onset neurodegeneration with ataxia, dystonia, and gaze palsy will be curated separately.\n \nThe association between *SQSTM1* and ALS was first established in an aggregate variant case-control analysis that identified an association between non-synonymous rare variants in the gene and ALS based on the Sanger sequencing of *SQSTM1* in 1092 ALS cases and 1448 controls (Fecto et al., PMID: 22084127). This curation also includes one other case-control analysis from 1 publication that was scored (PMIDs: 24899140). Additionally, 28 variants, including missense, nonsense, and splicing variants, reported in 28 probands from 14 publications were scored in this curation. Based on the curation, a genetic evidence score of 5.6 was reached. The majority of variants identified in *SQSTM1* appear to be missense variants.\n\nThe gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence describing physical interaction with other known ALS associated genes (PMIDs: 30022074, 30290707, and 19765191); aberrant expression in patient cells (PMID: 14762676); functional alterations in patient and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 31362587, 28490746, 27554286, and 27158844); and establishment of model organisms and rescues (PMIDs: 33557921 and 25410659). An experimental evidence score of 5.5 was reached.\n\nAlthough the final score of 11.1 is typically rounded to the next highest whole number based on SOPv9, the ALS GCEP has chosen to apply standard rounding guidelines resulting in a score of 11 and a classification of moderate association with FTD/ALS 3. Notably, the current literature lacks evidence of variant segregation in *SQSTM1* , which is needed to gain a greater understanding of the involvement of *SQSTM1* in ALS. It is important to understand that in the clinical diagnostic setting, the identification of missense variants of uncertain significance will be common in this gene, and variant interpretation must be completed with caution. \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on the meeting date Decemeber 13, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\nThe ALS GCEP has chosen to round the score of SQSTM1 down to 11, which results in a classification of moderate. More evidence is needed to support this gene-disease relationship, particularly published variant segregation data.
