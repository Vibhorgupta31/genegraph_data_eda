To determine if other elements of the MPZ locus were sufficent to drive high level expression, human and mouse MPZ noncoding loci were compared and a 400-bp region was identified in the first intron. To determine if this reporter would respond to EGR2, the reporter and an EGR2 expression plasmid were transfected into rats with maximal activation of activity 5x that of the mouse MPZ promoter alone.

In this study, we have identified a highly conserved element within the first intron of the Mpz gene, which contains binding sites for the early growth response 2 (Egr2/Krox20) transcription factor, a critical regulator of peripheral nerve myelination. Egr2 can transactivate the intron element, and the induction is blocked by two known repressors of Egr2 activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we find that Egr2 binds in vivo to the intron element, but not to the Mpz promoter. Known inducers of Mpz expression such as forskolin and insulin-like growth factor-1 also activate the element in an Egr2-dependent manner. In addition, we found that Egr2 can act synergistically with Sox10 to activate this intron element, suggesting a model in which cooperative interactions between Egr2 and Sox10 mediate a large increase in Mpz expression to the high levels found in myelinating Schwann cells.","dc:creator":"LeBlanc SE","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Direct regulation of myelin protein zero expression by the Egr2 transactivator."},"rdfs:label":"EGR2 Regulates MPZ Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"MPZ is a major component of peripheral myelin, with any structural alteration or imbalance causing CMT phenotypes.

The majority of known mutations show autosomal dominant inheritance, however at least two reported cases show autosomal recessive inheritance. More than 20 unique missense variants have been reported in the literature, mostly concentrated in the zinc finger domains. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in over 25 probands and over 10 publications (PMIDs: 9537424, 11523566, 17717711, 31852952, 26204789, 20513111, 32896048, 30481651, 27159987, 30843326). There is additionally a significant amount of segregation evidence, with a total summed LOD score of 5.62 over four families. The majority of these probands have adult-onset demyelinating forms of the disorder (labeled as CMT1D) with mild-moderate symptoms; however, early-onset forms with more severe symptoms (labeled as Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy or congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy) and axonal forms (labeled as CMT2) are also included in the general spectrum of this curation (PMIDs: 10371530, 26204789). More genetic evidence is available to review in the literature. \nThe mechanism for disease varies by inheritance pattern. In the dominant form, missense variants in one of three zinc finger domains interfere with DNA binding and decrease the activity of wildtype DNM2 via inappropriate interactions with cofactors. The resulting severity is roughly correlated with the amount of residual DNA binding for a dominant negative effect. Recessive variants located in the R1 domain disallow the ability for the protein to bind and be repressed by NAB proteins, resulting in a loss of function and decreased amount of DNA binding (Warner et al. 1999, PMID: 10369870). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by several types of experimental evidence. Both a knock-in model harboring the recessive Ile268Asn variant and a hypomorphic model of the dominant forms both recapitulated the major phenotypes of the human disorder, including neuropathy, immature Schwann cells, severe hypomyelination, and cranial nerve involvement. Functional studies and protein interactions additionally demonstrate EGR2's importance to myelination, with MPZ activation and expression severely affected by mutant co-expression. \nIn summary, EGR2 is DEFINITIVELY associated with semidominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n ","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a6e83e27-0c9a-4475-92f5-745303931858"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
