Correlations between polymorphisms of the TGF-β1 gene and clinical parameters of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported previously in adults. Here, we tested whether such correlations occur in pediatric patients suffering from IBD. One hundred and four pediatric IBD patients were involved in this study. Among them, 36 were diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (CD) and 68 were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC). The control group consisted of 103 children, in which IBD was excluded. TGF-β1 levels were determined in plasma and intestinal mucosa samples. The presence of the TGF β1 protein and the amount of TGF β1 mRNA were estimated in intestinal mucosa by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription Real-Time PCR, respectively. Four common polymorphisms of the TGF-β1 gene were investigated: -800G/A, -509C/T, 869T/C and 915G/C. No significant correlation between TGF-β1 genotypes and (i) TGF-β1 levels in plasma and tissue samples, (ii) TGF-β1 gene expression efficiency in intestinal mucosa, (iii) IBD clinical parameters and (iv) inflammatory activity could be detected in children suffering from IBD. We conclude that, contrary to previous suggestions, the four common polymorphisms of the TGF-β1 gene do not influence the susceptibility to or clinical parameters of IBD in the tested population of children.","dc:creator":"Liberek A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Clinical parameters of inflammatory bowel disease in children do not correlate with four common polymorphisms of the transforming growth factor β1 gene."},"rdfs:label":"Liberek Pediatric Polymorphisms"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:5f9c2f55-4055-4acf-841a-4d37df8e7af8_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:369e434d-cf40-4b7e-af73-85408f826fc9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:369e434d-cf40-4b7e-af73-85408f826fc9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:dcd49dcc-1fcc-406b-b919-7d0c0f9469bf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000660.7(TGFB1):c.133C>T (p.Arg45Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406006064"}},"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing ","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Loss of communication.

Evidence of inflammatory bowel disease, immunodeficiency, and encephalopathy (IBDIMDE) is predicted to be caused by a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the *TGFB1 *gene.\n \nThree variants (missense) that have been reported in three patients in one publication (PMID:29483653) are included in this curation. Phenotypes varied  but severe inflammatory bowel disesase and central nervous system disease associated with epilepsy, brain atrophy and posterior leukoencephalopathy were common features.\n\nWhile TGFB1 gene polymorphisms have previously been described as potential risk for development of inflammatory bowel disease, this association is controversial and has not been consistently replicated.  (PMID 24074435, PMID: 22140658).\n \nThe gene-disease relationship is supported by two animal models. (PMIDs: 17481928, 1436033, 29204904). Shull et al. (PMID 1436033) observed that mice deficient in TGF-beta 1 developed a wasting syndrome characterized by a multifocal, mixed multi-organ inflammatory cell response affecting heart, stomach, liver, lung, pancreas, salivary gland and striated muscle.  Li et al described mice with T cell-specific deletion of TGFB1 - mice developed severe colitis, with inflammatory infiltrates involving the lung and liver as well.\n \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the role of *TGFB1* in autosomal recessive inflammatory bowel disease, immunodeficiency, and encephalopathy.
