The syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in NR2F1, which encodes a highly conserved nuclear receptor that serves as a transcriptional regulator. Previous investigations to understand the protein's role in neurodevelopment have mostly used mouse models with constitutive and tissue-specific homozygous knockout of Nr2f1. In order to represent the human disease more accurately, which is caused by heterozygous NR2F1 mutations, we investigated a heterozygous knockout mouse model and found that this model recapitulates some of the neurological phenotypes of BBSOAS, including altered learning/memory, hearing defects, neonatal hypotonia and decreased hippocampal volume. The mice showed altered fear memory, and further electrophysiological investigation in hippocampal slices revealed significantly reduced long-term potentiation and long-term depression. These results suggest that a deficit or alteration in hippocampal synaptic plasticity may contribute to the intellectual disability frequently seen in BBSOAS. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed significant differential gene expression in the adult Nr2f1+/- hippocampus, including the up-regulation of multiple matrix metalloproteases, which are known to be critical for the development and the plasticity of the nervous system. Taken together, our studies highlight the important role of Nr2f1 in neurodevelopment. The discovery of impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the heterozygous mouse model sheds light on the pathophysiology of altered memory and cognitive function in BBSOAS.","dc:creator":"Chen CA","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Nr2f1 heterozygous knockout mice recapitulate neurological phenotypes of Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome and show impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity."},"rdfs:label":"Nr2f1 knockout mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4951,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:541befff-fe68-4930-876a-c4af12b38f29","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014320","gene":"hgnc:7975","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*NR2F1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS) in 2014 (PMID: 24462372). BBSOAS is characterized by visual impairment due to optic nerve abnormalities and/or cortical visual impairment, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Additional findings may include hypotonia, seizures, autism spectrum disorder or autistic features, and hearing defects (PMIDs: 24462372, 26986877, 32275123). *NR2F1* variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift and in-frame deletion variants, as well as large deletions, have been identified in over 50 individuals with BBSOAS (PMID: 32275123). Only 8 probands (PMIDs: 24462372, 26986877, 32275123) are included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency (PMIDs: 24462372, 26986877). However, a dominant-negative mechanism has been proposed for variants in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the protein (PMIDs: 26986877, 32275123). Patients with variants in the DBD presented with more severe phenotypes, with increased prevalence of seizures and abnormal brain MRI findings compared to those with a deletion or coding variant outside of the DBD (PMIDs: 26986877, 32275123). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including a mouse model and in vitro expression studies (PMIDs: 31600777, 26986877).\n\nIn summary, *NR2F1* is definitively associated with Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 16, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1aa4efce-b5b8-4cbd-b043-bb89c5283e3c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
