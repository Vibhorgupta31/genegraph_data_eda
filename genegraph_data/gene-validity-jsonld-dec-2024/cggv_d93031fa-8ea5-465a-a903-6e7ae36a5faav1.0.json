SMD Kozlowski type (SMDK) is a well-defined autosomal-dominant SMD characterized by significant scoliosis and mild metaphyseal abnormalities in the pelvis. The vertebrae exhibit platyspondyly and overfaced pedicles similar to autosomal-dominant brachyolmia, which can result from heterozygosity for activating mutations in the gene encoding TRPV4, a calcium-permeable ion channel. Mutation analysis in six out of six patients with SMDK demonstrated heterozygosity for missense mutations in TRPV4, and one mutation, predicting a R594H substitution, was recurrent in four patients. Similar to autosomal-dominant brachyolmia, the mutations altered basal calcium channel activity in vitro. Metatropic dysplasia is another SMD that has been proposed to have both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Patients with the nonlethal form of metatropic dysplasia present with a progressive scoliosis, widespread metaphyseal involvement of the appendicular skeleton, and carpal ossification delay. Because of some similar radiographic features between SMDK and metatropic dysplasia, TRPV4 was tested as a disease gene for nonlethal metatropic dysplasia. In two sporadic cases, heterozygosity for de novo missense mutations in TRPV4 was found. The findings demonstrate that mutations in TRPV4 produce a phenotypic spectrum of skeletal dysplasias from the mild autosomal-dominant brachyolmia to SMDK to autosomal-dominant metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that these disorders should be grouped into a new bone dysplasia family.","dc:creator":"Krakow D","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding the calcium-permeable ion channel TRPV4 produce spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type and metatropic dysplasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19232556","rdfs:label":"R97-261"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This variant is supported by functional evidence."},{"id":"cggv:a1546081-5819-4f7a-b570-0a13f2d86bea_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed7b4e15-9e46-41de-bb59-d89d0c0d20fe","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with SMD-K.

Several rare variant phenotypes that have some overlap but deviate in some ways from the general pattern have also been described. The known variant phenotypes are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type (Pseudo-Morquio type 2), parastremmatic dysplasia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly. Interestingly, different TRPV4 mutations have been associated with dominantly inherited neurologic disorders such as congenital spinal muscular atrophy and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Finally, a small number of patients have been identified in whom a TRPV4 mutation results in a phenotype combining skeletal dysplasia with peripheral neuropathy. The TRPV4 gene encodes a regulated calcium channel implicated in multiple and diverse cellular processes. Over 50 different TRPV4 mutations have been reported, with two codons appearing to be mutational hot spots: P799 in exon 15, mostly associated with MD, and R594 in exon 11, associated with SMDK. While most pathogenic mutations tested so far result in activation of the calcium channel in vitro, the mechanisms through which TRPV4 activation results in skeletal dysplasia and/or peripheral neuropathy remain unclear and the genotype-phenotype correlations in this group of disorders remains somewhat mysterious. Since the phenotypic expression of most mutations seems to be relatively constant, careful clinical and radiographic assessment is useful in directing molecular analysis.","dc:creator":"Nishimura G","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"TRPV4-associated skeletal dysplasias."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22791502","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded for functional evidence described in Krakow et al. 2009 (PMID: 19232556).

Similarly, heterozygous missense mutations of TRPV4 cause a spectrum of peripheral neuropathy, including hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type IIC, congenital spinal muscular atrophy, and scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy. There are no apparent differences in the amino acid positions affected or type of change predicted by the TRPV4 mutations responsible for the two disease spectrums; nevertheless, no fundamental phenotypic overlap has been shown between the two spectrums. Here, we report on three patients who had both skeletal dysplasia and peripheral neuropathy caused by heterozygous TRPV4 missense mutations. The skeletal and neurologic phenotypes of these patients covered the wide spectrum of reported TRPV4-pathies (disease caused by TRPV4 mutations). The molecular data are complementary, proving that \"neuropathic\" mutations can cause skeletal dysplasia but also the \"skeletopathic\" mutations can lead to neuropathies. Our findings suggest that pathogenic mechanisms of TRPV4-pathies in skeletal and nervous systems are not always mutually exclusive and provide further evidence that there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation for either spectrum.

A targeted next-generation sequencing technology was applied to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of bone dysplasia and evaluate the contribution of these genes to patients with bone dysplasia encountered in pediatric endocrinology. A group of unrelated patients (n=82), characterized by short stature, dysmorphology and X-ray abnormalities, of which mucopolysacharidoses, GM1 gangliosidosis, mucolipidosis type II/III and achondroplasia owing to FGFR3 G380R mutation had been excluded, were recruited in this study. Probes were designed to 61 genes selected according to the nosology and classification of genetic skeletal disorders of 2010 by Illumina's online DesignStudio software. DNA was hybridized with probes and then a library was established following the standard Illumina protocols. Amplicon library was sequenced on a MiSeq sequencing system and the data were analyzed by MiSeq Reporter. Mutations of 13 different genes were found in 44 of the 82 patients (54%). Mutations of COL2A1 gene and PHEX gene were found in nine patients, respectively (9/44=20%), followed by COMP gene in 8 (18%), TRPV4 gene in 4 (9%), FBN1 gene in 4 (9%), COL1A1 gene in 3 (6%) and COL11A1, TRAPPC2, MATN3, ARSE, TRPS1, SMARCAL1, ENPP1 gene mutations in one patient each (2% each). In conclusion, mutations of COL2A1, PHEX and COMP gene are common for short stature due to bone dysplasia in outpatient clinics in pediatric endocrinology. Targeted next-generation sequencing is an efficient way to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of genetic bone dysplasia.

However, the Ca(2+) channels involved remain largely unidentified. Here we show that genetic ablation in mice of Trpv4, a Ca(2+)-permeable channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, increases bone mass by impairing bone resorption. TRPV4 mediates basolateral Ca(2+) influx specifically in large osteoclasts when Ca(2+) oscillations decline. TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) influx hereby secures intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, ensures NFATc1-regulated gene transcription, and regulates the terminal differentiation and activity of osteoclasts. In conclusion, our data indicate that Ca(2+) oscillations and TRPV4-mediated Ca(2+) influx are sequentially required to sustain NFATc1-dependent gene expression throughout osteoclast differentiation, and we propose TRPV4 as a therapeutic target for bone diseases.","dc:creator":"Masuyama R","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"TRPV4-mediated calcium influx regulates terminal differentiation of osteoclasts."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in mouse osteoclasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a5fe3903-b246-4929-ae8b-b8b7aa3659a2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02345d80-7f9a-4f11-bede-495e22ddcdbb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that TRPV4 mRNA and protein were expressed in mature porcine articular cartilage.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19790068","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel that can be gated by tonicity (osmolarity) and mechanical stimuli.

Mice transgenic for wild-type Trpv4 showed no morphological changes at embryonic day 16.5 but did have a delay in bone mineralization.

At least seven unique TRPV4 missense and indel variants have been reported in probands diagnosed with SMD-K, including the common recurrent p.Arg594His variant. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 7 variants in 15 probands reported in 6 publications (PMIDs: 19232556, 20577006, 21658220, 22419508, 22791502, 26377240). The mechanism of pathogenicity is suggested to be gain of function (PMIDs: 31463371). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model with p.Arg594His and functional assays (PMIDs: 24644033, 19790068, 21964574, 18762026). Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause metatropic dysplasia, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type, brachyolmia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes and will be curated separately. In some cases, there is overlap between skeletal and neuromuscular phenotypes caused by variants in TRPV4 (PMID: 31191204). Patients presenting with skeletal dysplasias may benefit from neurological, respiratory, and audiological evaluations. In summary, TRPV4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
