In Caenorhabditis elegans, the protein orthologues of the PKD-related proteins, polycystin-1 (LOV-1), polycystin-2 (PKD2), and polaris (OSM-5), co-localize in the cilia of male-specific sensory neurons, and defects in these proteins cause abnormalities of cilia structure and/or function. This study sought to determine whether the mammalian polycystins are expressed in primary cilia of renal epithelia and whether these proteins co-localize with polaris and cystin, the newly described, cilia-associated protein that is disrupted in the cpk mouse. To begin to address this issue, the expression of the protein products encoded by the PKD1, PKD2, Tg737, and cpk genes were examined in mouse cortical collecting duct (mCCD) cells using an immunofluorescence-based approach with a series of previously well-characterized antibodies. The mCCD cells were grown on cell culture inserts to optimize cell polarization and cilia formation. The data demonstrate co-localization in cilia of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, which are the principal proteins involved in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, with polaris and cystin, which are proteins that are disrupted in the Tg737(orpk)and cpk mouse models of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, respectively. These data add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that primary cilium plays a key role in normal physiologic functions of renal epithelia and that defects in ciliary function contribute to the pathogenesis of PKD.","dc:creator":"Yoder BK","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The polycystic kidney disease proteins, polycystin-1, polycystin-2, polaris, and cystin, are co-localized in renal cilia."},"rdfs:label":"Exoression in tissue of interest "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f94ab3c7-4a8c-498a-8f5e-4bfc96f55ff0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb557ba8-fca6-434d-bb7e-7cbb33fb8f78","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunohistochemistry and western blots, found in kidney, foetal kidney collecting duct cells and biliary duct cells ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11854326","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The congenital polycystic kidney (cpk) mutation is the most extensively characterized mouse model of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The renal cystic disease is fully expressed in homozygotes and is strikingly similar to human autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD), whereas genetic background modulates the penetrance of the corresponding defect in the developing biliary tree. We now describe the positional cloning, mutation analysis, and expression of a novel gene that is disrupted in cpk mice. The cpk gene is expressed primarily in the kidney and liver and encodes a hydrophilic, 145-amino acid protein, which we term cystin. When expressed exogenously in polarized renal epithelial cells, cystin is detected in cilia, and its expression overlaps with polaris, another PKD-related protein. We therefore propose that the single epithelial cilium is important in the functional differentiation of polarized epithelia and that ciliary dysfunction underlies the PKD phenotype in cpk mice.","dc:creator":"Hou X","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Cystin, a novel cilia-associated protein, is disrupted in the cpk mouse model of polycystic kidney disease."},"rdfs:label":"Exoression in tissue of interest "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Localised to cilia within tubular cells, like many other genes associated with kidney cysts"},{"id":"cggv:7d3d65f5-3bed-4301-8950-9e991b47fa69","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:69c0b50e-7fbf-4d5f-9595-36eba2a3987a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Necdin inhibits MYC and MYC overexpression results in cystic phenotype. \nCYS1 binds to Necdin","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24349431","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cystin is a novel cilia-associated protein that is disrupted in the cpk mouse, a well-characterized mouse model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Interestingly, overexpression of the Myc gene is evident in animal models of ARPKD and is thought to contribute to the renal cystic phenotype. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, the growth suppressor protein necdin, known to modulate Myc expression, was found as an interacting partner of cystin. Deletion mapping demonstrated that the C-terminus of cystin and both termini of necdin are required for their mutual interaction. Speculating that these two proteins may function to regulate gene expression, we developed a luciferase reporter assay and observed that necdin strongly activated the Myc P1 promoter, and cystin did so more modestly. Interestingly, the necdin effect was significantly abrogated when cystin was co-transfected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a physical interaction with both necdin and cystin and the Myc P1 promoter, as well as between these proteins. The data suggest that these proteins likely function in a regulatory complex. Thus, we speculate that Myc overexpression in the cpk kidney results from the dysregulation of the cystin-necdin regulatory complex and c-Myc, in turn, contributes to cystogenesis in the cpk mouse.

The CYS1 gene encodes a small protein that is expressed in the primary apical cilia of renal ductal epithelial cells. This gene was suspected to be affected in polycystic kidney disease because two deletions in the corresponding mouse gene result in a model of ARPKD, which has been characterized extensively and resembles the human disease (Hou et al 2002: PMID: 11854326). CYS1 was reported in relation to ARPKD by Yang et al in 2021, PMID: 34521872. This is the only disease associated with pathogenic variants in this gene. The kidney cysts arise from the collecting duct epithelium, and there is also biliary dysgenesis and portal tract fibrosis. The disease onset is usually in childhood. Only two pathogenic variants have been reported in CYS1 associated with human disease; a homozygous splice region variant proven to be pathogenic in a minigene construct, and a homozygous missense variant. The lack of reported pathogenic variants is probably because of the protein’s small size and difficulties with sequencing due to the gene’s GC-rich nature. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. This gene-disease pair is supported by experimental expression, protein interaction data, and a non-human model organism.\n\nIn summary, there is Limited evidence supporting the relationship between CYS1 and ARPKD. This has been demonstrated in both the clinical diagnostic and research setting. The classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic GCEP on 04/27/22. This gene-disease relationship was re-evaluated on 03/11/24 and as a result, the classification did not change. This assessment was approved by the ClinGen KCCD GCEP on the meeting date 03/11/2024 (SOP Version 10).\nThe final classification was modified because of the limited number of case reports.
