Patients with RD are unable to degrade phytanic acid due to a deficient activity of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxyl-ase (PhyH), a peroxisomal enzyme catalysing the first step of phytanic acid alpha-oxidation. To enable mutation analysis of RD at the genome level, we have elucidated the genomic organization of the PHYH gene. The gene is approximately 21 kb and contains nine exons and eight introns. Mutation analysis of PHYH cDNA from 22 patients with RD revealed 14 different missense mutations, a 3 bp insertion, and a 1 bp deletion, which were all confirmed at the genome level. A 111 bp deletion identified in the PHYH cDNA of several patients with RD was due to either one of two different mutations in the same splice acceptor site, which result in skipping of exon 3. Six mutations, including a large in-frame deletion and five missense mutations, were expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study their effect on PhyH activity. The results showed that all these mutations lead to an enzymatically inactive PhyH protein.","dc:creator":"Jansen GA","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Human phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase: resolution of the gene structure and the molecular basis of Refsum's disease."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 15"},{"id":"cggv:e29cb8d1-c41c-4861-9040-ebff6c610963","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e29cb8d1-c41c-4861-9040-ebff6c610963_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e29cb8d1-c41c-4861-9040-ebff6c610963_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"heterologous expression of human PHYH ORF containing variant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed reduced PHYH activity compared to wild type (Fig. 2A, lane 8)"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"gnomAD frequency = 0.00002784"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2bad2dff-5818-416a-84a9-c650e27a0c45_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2bad2dff-5818-416a-84a9-c650e27a0c45","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":72,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d96e5e58-c8ca-449a-a4cd-da9f8ff0e3e8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001323083.1(PHYH):c.42_60dup (p.Ser21GlyfsTer36)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA592078945"}},"detectionMethod":"Genetic analysis of the PHYH gene - exact method not described","phenotypeFreeText":"no peripheral nervous system involvement; leukoencephalopathy involving the periventricular white matter, subcortical area, and the brainstem with relative sparing of juxtacortical U fibers; congenital blindness in left eye; balance and memory difficulties onset at 69 yr; apragmatism, severe memory impairment, nycthemeral rhythm inversion, and urinary incontinence at 70 yr; severe frontal syndrome, normal plasma levels of pristanic and very long chain fatty acids, dementia with spatiotemporal disorientation, Electroretinogram normal in R eye, not evaluable in L\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed two white cells/mm3 with slightly increased protein content (0.46 g/L); very high plasma phytanic acid level (458 μmol/L; control <10) later confirmed at 704 μmol/L; plasma pristanic acid level (0.27 μmol/L)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000020","obo:HP_0002352","obo:HP_0012709","obo:HP_0002355","obo:HP_0000726","obo:HP_0001268","obo:HP_0002354","obo:HP_0012185","obo:HP_0010521","obo:HP_0002120","obo:HP_0000822","obo:HP_0002119","obo:HP_0001712","obo:HP_0007875","obo:HP_0010571","obo:HP_0100651","obo:HP_0012157"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:e55f03ef-d1c1-40a0-ba46-4036bd160838_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d96e5e58-c8ca-449a-a4cd-da9f8ff0e3e8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25604618","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Adult Refsum disease is an autosomal recessive peroxisomal disorder characterized by phytanic acid storage.

Biochemically, the disorder is defined by two related properties: pronounced accumulation of phytanic acid and selective loss of the peroxisomal dioxygenase required for alpha-hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA2. Decreased phytanic-acid oxidation is also observed in human cells lacking PEX7, the receptor for the type-2 peroxisomal targetting signal (PTS2; refs 3,4), suggesting that the enzyme defective in Refsum disease is targetted to peroxisomes by a PTS2. We initially identified the human PAHX and mouse Pahx genes as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) capable of encoding PTS2 proteins. Human PAHX is targetted to peroxisomes, requires the PTS2 receptor for peroxisomal localization, interacts with the PTS2 receptor in the yeast two-hybrid assay and has intrinsic phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase activity that requires the dioxygenase cofactor iron and cosubstrate 2-oxoglutarate. Radiation hybrid data place PAHX on chromosome 10 between the markers D10S249 and D10S466, a region previously implicated in Refsum disease by homozygosity mapping. We find that both Refsum disease patients examined are homozygous for inactivating mutations in PAHX, demonstrating that mutations in PAHX can cause Refsum disease.","dc:creator":"Mihalik SJ","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Identification of PAHX, a Refsum disease gene."}},"rdfs:label":"RD002"},{"id":"cggv:c4ee82ed-60b3-4fdb-ba0a-ec287ea112f7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c4ee82ed-60b3-4fdb-ba0a-ec287ea112f7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c4ee82ed-60b3-4fdb-ba0a-ec287ea112f7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"when this variant was expressed, purified, and assayed there was no detectable difference in expression of the PHYH protein, but the protein was enzymatically inactive (Fig. 4b)"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"gnomAD frequency = 0.0001732, variant predicted to eliminate BspE1 site"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d104734a-2a58-4f6d-9886-b0d717ed8aa6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d104734a-2a58-4f6d-9886-b0d717ed8aa6","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ee966e9a-eacc-4708-b849-d9306d508bdb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001323083.1(PHYH):c.506T>C (p.Phe169Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA376034166"}},"detectionMethod":"RT-PCR of PHYH cDNA isolated from patient fibroblasts and subsequent sequence analysis on an Applied Biosystems 377A automated DNA sequencer","phenotypeFreeText":"diagnosed with RD based on clinical findings, deficient in PhyH activity","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0010571","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a30cc053-c2f9-4372-9707-8d794e396d41_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ee966e9a-eacc-4708-b849-d9306d508bdb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10767344"},"rdfs:label":"Case 11"},{"id":"cggv:a30cc053-c2f9-4372-9707-8d794e396d41","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a30cc053-c2f9-4372-9707-8d794e396d41_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD frequency = 0.000003976, scored down due to lack of variant evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c648448e-ad08-4a96-b3ac-bcce2359beda_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c648448e-ad08-4a96-b3ac-bcce2359beda","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":55,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:63425974-0320-4331-b05b-c17a079b846f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006214.4(PHYH):c.153C>T (p.Asn51=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/129891"}},{"id":"cggv:0658b54f-bfd1-4444-af30-68b851cbe86e"}],"detectionMethod":"DNA was extracted from leukocytes using the QIAamp DNA mini kit.

disease is an autosomal-recessively inherited disorder characterized clinically by a tetrad of abnormalities: retinitis pigmentosa, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia and elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without an increase in the number of cells in the CSF. All patients exhibit accumulation of an unusual branched-chain fatty acid, phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid), in blood and tissues. Biochemically, the disease is caused by the deficiency of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PhyH), a peroxisomal protein catalyzing the first step in the alpha-oxidation of phytanic acid. We have purified PhyH from rat-liver peroxisomes and determined the N-terminal amino-acid sequence, as well as an additional internal amino-acid sequence obtained after Lys-C digestion of the purified protein. A search of the EST database with these partial amino-acid sequences led to the identification of the full-length human cDNA sequence encoding PhyH: the open reading frame encodes a 41.2-kD protein of 338 amino acids, which contains a cleavable peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2). Sequence analysis of PHYH fibroblast cDNA from five patients with Refsum disease revealed distinct mutations, including a one-nucleotide deletion, a 111-nucleotide deletion and a point mutation. This analysis confirms our finding that Refsum disease is caused by a deficiency of PhyH.","dc:creator":"Jansen GA","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Refsum disease is caused by mutations in the phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 3"},{"id":"cggv:77b35fd7-7aaa-4843-8d26-c828ced28793","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:77b35fd7-7aaa-4843-8d26-c828ced28793_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:77b35fd7-7aaa-4843-8d26-c828ced28793_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Variant Evidence (PMID:10767344): Variant was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and resulted in no mature protein and no activity (Fig. 2)"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variant absent from gnomAD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:74142efc-0f24-4737-9ac2-2f6496a35c02_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:74142efc-0f24-4737-9ac2-2f6496a35c02","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:ec4f4004-479d-42da-8772-6e05d08cc266"},{"id":"cggv:2addb465-f8db-4f07-ad4b-dba5a7dbdf55","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006214.4(PHYH):c.805A>C (p.Asn269His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7584"}}],"detectionMethod":"first strand cDNA synthesis from RNA extracted from patient fibroblasts, this was used as primer for PCR of PHYH-encoding cDNA, sequence analysis of PCR fragments with sense and antisense strands","phenotypeFreeText":"deficient PhyH activity in fibroblasts, paresis/atrophy, serum phytanic acid concentration = 25mg/dl, phytanic acid oxidase activity = 7pmol h- l mg- I protein","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0001271","obo:HP_0001133","obo:HP_0000662","obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0001627","obo:HP_0000458","obo:HP_0003474","obo:HP_0000951","obo:HP_0001315"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:e0ddd4b7-7e60-43f5-a2e4-771f735f383f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2addb465-f8db-4f07-ad4b-dba5a7dbdf55"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9326940"},{"id":"cggv:62ffddd6-c45d-4689-8469-61ea1f240bbf_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ec4f4004-479d-42da-8772-6e05d08cc266"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9326940"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 5"},{"id":"cggv:62ffddd6-c45d-4689-8469-61ea1f240bbf","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62ffddd6-c45d-4689-8469-61ea1f240bbf_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Scored as zero due to no evidence of variants being in trans both variants absent from gnomAD, no variant evidence"},{"id":"cggv:e0ddd4b7-7e60-43f5-a2e4-771f735f383f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0ddd4b7-7e60-43f5-a2e4-771f735f383f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Scored as zero due to no evidence of variants being in trans both variants absent from gnomAD, no variant evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4858a993-a2e3-4b95-82f0-1e7e58e98dfd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4858a993-a2e3-4b95-82f0-1e7e58e98dfd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9ec1f299-8506-4e76-b657-7a3042eb75a9"},"detectionMethod":"first strand cDNA synthesis from RNA extracted from patient fibroblasts, this was used as primer for PCR of PHYH-encoding cDNA, sequence analysis of PCR fragments with sense and antisense strands","phenotypeFreeText":"deficient PhyH activity in fibroblasts, normal until 6 mo;

The main clinical symptoms are polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa. To study the pathogenesis of Refsum disease, we generated and characterized a Phyh knockout mouse. We studied the pathological effects of phytanic acid accumulation in Phyh(-/-) mice fed a diet supplemented with phytol, the precursor of phytanic acid. Phytanic acid accumulation caused a reduction in body weight, hepatic steatosis, and testicular atrophy with loss of spermatogonia. Phenotype assessment using the SHIRPA protocol and subsequent automated gait analysis using the CatWalk system revealed unsteady gait with strongly reduced paw print area for both fore- and hindpaws and reduced base of support for the hindpaws. Histochemical analyses in the CNS showed astrocytosis and up-regulation of calcium-binding proteins. In addition, a loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum was observed. No demyelination was present in the CNS. Motor nerve conduction velocity measurements revealed a peripheral neuropathy. Our results show that, in the mouse, high phytanic acid levels cause a peripheral neuropathy and ataxia with loss of Purkinje cells. These findings provide important insights in the pathophysiology of Refsum disease.","dc:creator":"Ferdinandusse S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Ataxia with loss of Purkinje cells in a mouse model for Refsum disease."},"rdfs:label":"Phyh -/- mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4295,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4f9607bf-4e7a-462c-b701-5e2af00568f4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100258","gene":"hgnc:8940","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*PHYH* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase deficiency (adult Refsum disease included) in 1997 (Jansen et al., PMID: 9326940).

Summary of case-level and experimental data: 14.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 4 publications (PMIDS: 25604618, 31240149, 17905308,10767344, 9326940, 22156782, 9326939, 28681609).
