The c.165+1G>T germline mutation in the 5'ss of exon 2 of the Fanconi anemia C (FANCC) gene commonly predicted to prevent correct splicing was identified in nine FA patients from three pedigrees. RT-PCR analysis of the endogenous FANCC mRNA splicing pattern of patient-derived fibroblasts revealed aberrant mRNA processing, but surprisingly also correct splicing at the TT dinucleotide, albeit with lower efficiency. This consequently resulted in low levels of correctly spliced transcript and minute levels of normal posttranslationally processed FANCD2 protein, indicating that this naturally occurring TT splicing might contribute to the milder clinical manifestations of the disease in these patients. Functional analysis of this FANCC 5'ss within splicing reporters revealed that both the noncanonical TT dinucleotide and the genomic context of FANCC were required for the residual correct splicing at this mutant 5'ss. Finally, use of lentiviral vectors as a delivery system to introduce expression cassettes for TT-adapted U1 snRNAs into primary FANCC patient fibroblasts allowed the correction of the DNA-damage-induced G2 cell-cycle arrest in these cells, thus representing an alternative transcript-targeting approach for genetic therapy of inherited splice-site mutations.","dc:creator":"Hartmann L","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Correct mRNA processing at a mutant TT splice donor in FANCC ameliorates the clinical phenotype in patients and is enhanced by delivery of suppressor U1 snRNAs."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20869034","rdfs:label":"640/1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Compound heterozygous for the intron 2 mutation and a 250-bp deletion, resulting in the skipping of exons 2 and 3."},{"id":"cggv:e8f37b62-2ffd-45f7-a59e-6bf481c1d041_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93d4653f-0b1e-4c2e-90f6-d3cd17b36f61","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Fanconi anemia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0005528","obo:HP_0000957"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e8f37b62-2ffd-45f7-a59e-6bf481c1d041_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:50a766ee-635f-493e-bb37-6ac68e5cf1f9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20869034"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20869034","rdfs:label":"526/1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"A homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 2 of the FANCC gene (165+1G-T), changing a highly conserved GT dinucleotide to TT at the 5-prime splice site.

Monoallelic inactivation of some FA genes, such as FA complementation group D1 (FANCD1; also known as the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2), leads to adult-onset cancer predisposition but does not cause FA, and somatic mutations in FA genes occur in cancers in the general population. Carcinogenesis resulting from a dysregulated FA pathway is multifaceted, as FA proteins monitor multiple complementary genome-surveillance checkpoints throughout interphase, where monoubiquitylation of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer by the FA core complex promotes recruitment of DNA repair effectors to chromatin lesions to resolve DNA damage and mitosis.
