KIF26A, an unconventional kinesin that lacks motor activity, inhibits growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)- and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent signal transduction, but its functions in the brain have not been characterized. We report a patient cohort with biallelic loss-of-function variants in KIF26A, exhibiting a spectrum of congenital brain malformations. In the developing brain, KIF26A is preferentially expressed during early- and mid-gestation in excitatory neurons. Combining mice and human iPSC-derived organoid models, we discovered that loss of KIF26A causes excitatory neuron-specific defects in radial migration, localization, dendritic and axonal growth, and apoptosis, offering a convincing explanation of the disease etiology in patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing in KIF26A knockout organoids revealed transcriptional changes in MAPK, MYC, and E2F pathways. Our findings illustrate the pathogenesis of KIF26A loss-of-function variants and identify the surprising versatility of this non-motor kinesin.","dc:creator":"Qian X","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Loss

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no significant difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern or brain malformation phenotype between these conditions. Therefore, the these phenotypes have been lumped and curated together as autosomal recessive complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0000904).\n\nEight variants (5 missense, 3 frameshift) that have been reported in 7 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 36228617, 36564622) are included in this curation. Functional evidence supports a damaging impact for 4 of the missense variants, one of which is recurrent and seen in 3 of the 7 probands. Homozygous cases are present in gnomADv4.0.0 for 2 of these missense variants, raising the possibility of incomplete penetrance and/or variable expressivity. Notably, the three reported cases with loss of function variants have reported enteric involvement, while this has not been described in cases with missense variants. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to loss of function. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (PMID: 36228617). Expression analysis shows expression in all cortical regions throughout embryonic and postnatal development, with preferential expression in migrating excitatory neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. Kif26a depletion in the developing mouse brain disrupts the radial migration of cortical excitatory neurons and impairs neuronal localization, morphology, and corpus callosum development, but does not impact overall morphology of the corpus callosum. KIF26A knock-out hiPSC show shorter neurites and decreased migration from neurospheres than controls iPSC cells, which is rescued with exogenous KIF26A.\n\nIn summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between KIF26A and autosomal recessive complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the assertion to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations GCEP on the meeting date 12 March 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3056587d-5d40-4bef-bac8-4e84c3f657bf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
