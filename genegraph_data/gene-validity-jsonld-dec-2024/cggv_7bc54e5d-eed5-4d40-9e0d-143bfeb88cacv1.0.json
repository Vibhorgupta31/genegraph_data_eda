Here the authors report one large Czech family with 15 members affected with an AD CMT phenotype of extraordinary variability. Genetic linkage analysis using SNP arrays revealed a locus of about 9.6 Mb on chromosome 19p13.1-13.2. In this critical interval, 373 genes were located. The only gene herein known to be associated with an intermediate type of CMT was Dynamin 2 (DNM2). Subsequent sequence analysis of the DNM2 gene in the index patient revealed a novel missense mutation p.Met580Thr. This missense mutation segregated with the neuropathy, indicating the causal character of this mutation. The phenotype of CMT in this family shows mild to moderate impairment with relatively preserved upper limbs and a very broad range of the onset of clinical symptoms from an early onset around the age of 12 to the late onset during the fifth decade. Electrophysiology showed an intermediate type of peripheral neuropathy. The motor median nerve conduction velocity varied from 36 m/s to normal values with signs of asymmetrical affection of peripheral nerves. No additional symptoms such as cranial nerve involvement, cataract, and signs of neutropenia or myopathy syndrome were observed in any member of the family yet. The progression was slow with no loss of ambulation. The authors suggest that the characterization of clinical variability in a single family may help to direct the genetic analysis directly to the rarely observed DNM2 mutations.","dc:creator":"HaberlovÃ¡ J","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Phenotypic variability in a large Czech family with a dynamin 2-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22091729","rdfs:label":"HABIII-5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Sufficent phenotypic evidence plus a missense variant with no variant-level evidence yields minimal points."},{"id":"cggv:3d1c414b-dba5-4756-8927-b805f9a2d355_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6af99825-43b1-4cfa-a96f-080a00293463","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":55,"detectionMethod":"Mutation analysis of DNM2 was performed by PCR sequencing of the coding exons on genomic DNA of the patients.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0009130","obo:HP_0030237"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Patients were electrophysiologically evaluated; Electromyography showed a pattern of chronic de-reinnervation consisting of a variable combination of reduced recruitment during full effort, and large amplitude, long duration motor unit action potentials; No spontaneous potentials were present; Required gait support with a cane; MCV moderately slowed at 33 m/s","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:3d1c414b-dba5-4756-8927-b805f9a2d355_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:1fcc41c4-4ff2-4d09-b06a-116121cc433a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001190716.2(DNM2):c.1072G>A (p.Gly358Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA248603"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18560793","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The purpose of the study was to prospectively assess magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of lower limb musculature in an axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2) pedigree due to mutation in the dynamin 2 gene (DNM2).

We studied the clinical, haematological, electrophysiological and sural nerve biopsy findings in 34 patients belonging to six unrelated dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B families in whom a dynamin 2 mutation had been identified: Gly358Arg (Spain); Asp551_Glu553del; Lys550fs (North America); Lys558del (Belgium); Lys558Glu (Australia, the Netherlands) and Thr855_Ile856del (Belgium). The Gly358Arg and Thr855_Ile856del mutations were novel, and in contrast to the other Charcot-Marie-Tooth-related mutations in dynamin 2, which are all located in the pleckstrin homology domain, they were situated in the middle domain and proline-rich domain of dynamin 2, respectively. We report the first disease-causing mutation in the proline-rich domain of dynamin 2. Patients with a dynamin 2 mutation presented with a classical Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, which was mild to moderately severe since only 3% of the patients were wheelchair-bound. The mean age at onset was 16 years with a large variability ranging from 2 to 50 years. Interestingly, in the Australian and Belgian families, which carry two different mutations affecting the same amino acid (Lys558), Charcot-Marie-Tooth cosegregated with neutropaenia. In addition, early onset cataracts were observed in one of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth families. Our electrophysiological data indicate intermediate or axonal motor median nerve conduction velocities (NCV) ranging from 26 m/s to normal values in four families, and less pronounced reduction of motor median NCV (41-46 m/s) with normal amplitudes in two families. Sural nerve biopsy in a Dutch patient with Lys558Glu mutation showed diffuse loss of large myelinated fibres, presence of many clusters of regenerating myelinated axons and fibres with focal myelin thickenings--findings very similar to those previously reported in the Australian family. We conclude that dynamin 2 mutations should be screened in the autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy families with intermediate or axonal NCV, and in patients with a classical mild to moderately severe Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, especially when Charcot-Marie-Tooth is associated with neutropaenia or cataracts.","dc:creator":"Claeys KG","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Phenotypic spectrum of dynamin 2 mutations in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19502294","rdfs:label":"H20II-3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Ample phenotypic evidence plus a confirmed missense variant with variant-level evidence (PMID:19528294 demonstrates that K558E localizes properly to the membrane but impairs endocytosis in cells) yields default points."},{"id":"cggv:c6dfff09-a2df-4611-ad26-1627c1f3ded1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e10caf21-59ca-4890-8d57-c02d42060262","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":67,"detectionMethod":"","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003376","obo:HP_0009027","obo:HP_0003394","obo:HP_0001288","obo:HP_0002166","obo:HP_0002522","obo:HP_0009053","obo:HP_0008944","obo:HP_0003431"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Nerve conduction velocity study results in Table 2","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c6dfff09-a2df-4611-ad26-1627c1f3ded1_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:dcc37fd0-86ec-4202-a56d-c0ee1fa2bb9c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001005360.2(DNM2):c.2576_2581del (p.Thr859_Ile860del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9201666"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19502294"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19502294","rdfs:label":"CMT72II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Sufficent phenotypic evidence plus a variant with no variant-level evidence yields minimum points."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.4},{"id":"cggv:7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb731ac4-47a4-4f80-a3ce-a860dedfbbe3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:85014c3b-d11f-485e-829c-a32082395e5a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"DNA from the patient and her parents was extracted from blood samples with all exons of the DNM2 gene being directly sequenced.","phenotypeFreeText":"Difficulties jumping, Recurring ankle sprains, Toe weakness, Clawed toes","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0009046","obo:HP_0009027","obo:HP_0100018","obo:HP_0007328","obo:HP_0002166","obo:HP_0007970","obo:HP_0011727","obo:HP_0003431","obo:HP_0008944","obo:HP_0009130","obo:HP_0002522","obo:HP_0001875","obo:HP_0020045","obo:HP_0002355","obo:HP_0003445","obo:HP_0001761","obo:HP_0000634","obo:HP_0007230","obo:HP_0007817"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Underwent corrective surgery for ptosis and strabismus due to abducens muscle palsy at the ages of 4 and 6 years; Visual acuity was 1/10 and 4/10 for the left and right eyes, respectively; Mildly reduced median and ulnar nerve motor conduction velocities (45 m/s and 44 m/s, respectively; normal >48 m/s); Normal distal latencies of 3.5 ms and 2.5 ms, respectively for median and ulnar nerve (normal <3.5 ms); Median and ulnar SNAP, respectively, were 12 Î¼V (normal >15 Î¼V) and 7 Î¼V (normal >8 Î¼V); Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and brain MRI were normal; Platelet and erythrocyte counts were in the normal range; No mitochondrial DNA mutations or deletions were detected; No mutation was found in the genes encoding Myelin Protein Zero, Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 or Connexin 32","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:cb731ac4-47a4-4f80-a3ce-a860dedfbbe3_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:10c855a7-7115-4e03-995b-df75504d2f02","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004945.3(DNM2):c.1663_1665del (p.Lys555del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/637071"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18394888","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy, dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type B and CMT2.

Minor gait abnormalities and less movement than controls show that the K562E mutation mildly affects locomotion in the mice. However, when performing electrophysiology measurements, there were no differences in the csNCV or mNCV. There was a decrease in the CMAP amplitude which was confirmed via repetitive stimulation analyses. Therefore there is no major damage to the neural component of these mice, however there are defecits in the muecular systems.

Evaluation of clarathin-mediated endocytosis also confirmed a markedly reduced transferrin uptake in the mutant schwann cells, showing the function was affected. Behavioral abnormalities were noted in the mutant mice, with tremor and limb clasping developing. Biopsy confirmed that signs of a neuropathy, including reduced numbers of myelinated axons and myelinated fibers, were present in the mutant mice. Investigation determined that DNM2 is necessary for correct radial sorting of axons and subsequent myelination. Conditonal knock-out mice, P0ERT2-DNM2_KO, were generated to determine what the impact on myelin maintenance is for DNM2. These mice demonstrated a progressive gait impairment and severely reduced mNCVs and CMAPs that then improved rapidly afterwards. This indicates that demyelination and subsequent remyelination is the cause of the observed phenotype. Therefore, DNM2 is essential for myelin maintenance as well as initial development and formation. Investigation into DNM2's role in schwann cells for survival demonstrated that both developing and adult SCs depend critically on DNM2 for their survival and that, upon DNM2 loss, cells other than SCs invade developing peripheral nerves. Mutant cells also showed a decrease in mitotic events, abnormal cell cycle progression, and imapired cytokinesis. Notably, DNM2 was not necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination, which are typically unaffected in human CNM probands.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30648534","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Myelination requires extensive plasma membrane rearrangements, implying that molecules controlling membrane dynamics play prominent roles. The large GTPase dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a well-known regulator of membrane remodeling, membrane fission, and vesicular trafficking. Here, we genetically ablated Dnm2 in Schwann cells (SCs) and in oligodendrocytes of mice. Dnm2 deletion in developing SCs resulted in severely impaired axonal sorting and myelination onset. Induced Dnm2 deletion in adult SCs caused a rapidly-developing peripheral neuropathy with abundant demyelination. In both experimental settings, mutant SCs underwent prominent cell death, at least partially due to cytokinesis failure. Strikingly, when Dnm2 was deleted in adult SCs, non-recombined SCs still expressing DNM2 were able to remyelinate fast and efficiently, accompanied by neuropathy remission. These findings reveal a remarkable self-healing capability of peripheral nerves that are affected by SC loss. In the central nervous system, however, we found no major defects upon Dnm2 deletion in oligodendrocytes.","dc:creator":"Gerber D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Schwann cells, but not Oligodendrocytes, Depend Strictly on Dynamin 2 Function."},"rdfs:label":"DNM2-KO Mice Show Neuropathy Phenotypes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This model, although not perfectly matching the inheritance pattern or pathogenic mechanism for the human disorder, clearly demonstrates a role for DNM2 in the development and maintenance of myelin as well as schwann cells.

This evidence demonstrates that, in all stages of an organism's life, DNM2 expression is necessary for proper schwann cell function.

At least 10 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, frameshift, large deletion, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least twelve probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 15731758, 18394888, 28971531, 19502294, 17636067, 18560793, 22091729, 25259927). Variants in this gene also segregated with disease in 55 additional family members, totaling a LOD score of 18.29 and the maximum segregation evidence. The mechanism for disease is currently under investigation, however deleterious impact on clathrin-mediated endocytosis is likely involved for at least many of the known CMT variants. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in both a lethal autosomal recessive disorder and a dominant centronuclear myopathy. The latter has been assessed separately by the Congenital Myopathy GCEP. \nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression studies identifying all four isoforms of human DNM2 in the skeletal muscle and schwann cells of all ages and several functional assays demonstrating functional alteration to specifically clathrin-mediated endocytosis as well as myelination and cell survival when mutants are expressed. There are also several models that express DNM2 mutants in mice, however given the physiological differences it is difficult to fully model the heterozygous disorder as the mice seem to require a greater proportion of mutant protein to recapitulate the observed phenotypes.\nIn summary, DNM2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
