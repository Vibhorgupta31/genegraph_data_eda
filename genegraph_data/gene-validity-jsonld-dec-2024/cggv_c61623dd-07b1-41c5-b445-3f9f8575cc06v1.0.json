Genetic defects in NPHP gene products that localize to cilia and centrosomes defined them as \"ciliopathies.\" However, disease mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify by whole-exome resequencing, mutations of MRE11, ZNF423, and CEP164 as causing NPHP-RC. All three genes function within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. We demonstrate that, upon induced DNA damage, the NPHP-RC proteins ZNF423, CEP164, and NPHP10 colocalize to nuclear foci positive for TIP60, known to activate ATM at sites of DNA damage. We show that knockdown of CEP164 or ZNF423 causes sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and that cep164 knockdown in zebrafish results in dysregulated DDR and an NPHP-RC phenotype. Our findings link degenerative diseases of the kidney and retina, disorders of increasing prevalence, to mechanisms of DDR.","dc:creator":"Chaki M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Exome capture reveals ZNF423 and CEP164 mutations, linking renal ciliopathies to DNA damage response signaling."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c34dcf7-49b3-4b49-8caf-5fa26986a412","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36989dbc-85e8-4960-8357-47d6afb43d1e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":" ZNF423 was shown to directly interact with CEP290, localizing to the ciliary transition zone. It was confirmed in a direct yeast two-hybrid assay and by co-immunoprecipitation of CEP290/NPHP6 with ZNF423 expressed in HEK293T cells. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22863007","rdfs:label":"Chaki_Protein_Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ce43bb6a-a349-42e9-ad0a-5dbd2442d788","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4506312e-fb0c-462d-a67c-0f7b8c192c72","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"ZNF423 participates in a developmental switch that regulates the transition from differentiation to maturation in olfactory neurons\n\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17521568","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The coordination of gene expression is critical for cell differentiation and the subsequent establishment of tissue function.

OAZ deletion in mice impairs aspects of ORN differentiation, particularly the patterns of axonal projection to the olfactory bulb. OAZ gain-of-function experiments show that sustained OAZ expression throughout ORN maturation arrests ORN development at an immature stage and alters OR gene expression. Importantly, reintroducing OAZ expression in mature ORNs suppresses mature marker expression and reactivates immature-specific markers. Together, these experiments suggest that OAZ participates in a developmental switch regulating the transition from differentiation to maturation in ORNs.","dc:creator":"Cheng LE","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Zfp423/OAZ participates in a developmental switch during olfactory neurogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Cheng_MouseModel"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:75fef6a1-cda2-4e2b-b98c-a8f166f0bfb3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:efc3d554-0062-4b88-b418-7eca8b4b470c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Zfp423 was expressed in both ventricular and external germinal zones in the cerebellum \nLoss of Zfp423 resulted in diminished proliferation by granule cell precursors in the external germinal layer, especially near the midline, and abnormal differentiation and migration of ventricular zone-derived neurons and Bergmann glia. Results showed that ZNF423 is required for patterning the development of neuronal and glial precursors in the developing brain, particularly in midline structures.\n\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17151198","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Neural stem cells and progenitors in the developing brain must choose between proliferation with renewal and differentiation.

Nephronophthisis is a cystic kidney disease that leads to renal failure in childhood or adolescence. When combined with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia the disorder is referred to as Joubert syndrome. At least 5 variants (missense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. *ZNF423* has been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: Nephronophthisis 14 (NPHP14) and Joubert Syndrome 19 (JBTS19). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Inheritance patterns show that NPHP14 is caused by homozygous mutations while JBTS19 is caused by heterozygous mutations in *ZNF423*. Since the significance of the JBTS patients with a single variant is not clear, this data was not scored. However, variants in *ZNF423* have been reported in one JBTS patient with compound heterozygous missense variants in a second publication (PMIDs: 33531950) and is included in this curation. Therefore, the two disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, nephronophthisis (OMIM:614844). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by a protein interaction study (PMID: 33517396). ZNF423 was shown to directly interact with CEP290, both proteins localizing to the ciliary transition zone. In summary, there is limited evidence to support the association of *ZNF423* with nephronophthisis. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 3/23/22 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
