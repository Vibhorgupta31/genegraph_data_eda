The aim of this study is to clarify the role of ATP6V0A2, the causal gene for ARCL2, a syndrome of abnormal glycosylation and impaired Golgi trafficking, in cellular senescence program. Here we showed that ATP6V0A2 is critical for cellular senescence; impaired expression of ATP6V0A2 disperses the Golgi structure and triggers senescence, suggesting that ATP6V0A2 mediates these processes. FITC-lectin staining and glycoblotting revealed significantly different glycosylation structures in presenescent (young) and senescent (old) TIG-1 cells; reducing ATP6V0A2 expression in young TIG-1 cells yielded structures similar to those in old TIG-1 cells.

The goal of this study was to define the disease mechanisms that lead to connective tissue lesions in ARCL2. In a new cohort of 17 patients, DNA sequencing of ATP6V0A2 detected either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. Considerable allelic and phenotypic heterogeneity was observed, with a missense mutation of a moderately conserved residue p.P87L leading to unusually mild disease. Abnormal N- and/or mucin type O-glycosylation was observed in all patients tested. Premature stop codon mutations led to decreased ATP6V0A2 mRNA levels by destabilizing the mutant mRNA via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. Loss of ATP6V0A2 either by siRNA knockdown or in ARCL2 cells resulted in distended Golgi cisternae, accumulation of abnormal lysosomes and multivesicular bodies. Immunostaining of ARCL2 cells showed the accumulation of tropoelastin (TE) in the Golgi and in large, abnormal intracellular and extracellular aggregates. Pulse-chase studies confirmed impaired secretion and increased intracellular retention of TE, and insoluble elastin assays showed significantly reduced extracellular deposition of mature elastin. Fibrillin-1 microfibril assembly and secreted lysyl oxidase activity were normal in ARCL2 cells. TUNEL staining demonstrated increased rates of apoptosis in ARCL2 cell cultures. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in ATP6V0A2 lead to TE aggregation in the Golgi, impaired clearance of TE aggregates and increased apoptosis of elastogenic cells.","dc:creator":"Hucthagowder V","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Loss-of-function mutations in ATP6V0A2 impair vesicular trafficking, tropoelastin secretion and cell survival."},"rdfs:label":"Elastic fiber network in ATP6V0A2 fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:67eb6244-012c-48c0-a409-874636825d85_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1262c442-734c-4d3a-b36a-0cd9b5c3df0e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1262c442-734c-4d3a-b36a-0cd9b5c3df0e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"allele":{"id":"cggv:bccf7cfc-d9a7-4a92-81d3-214260ebc73d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012463.4(ATP6V0A2):c.2085_2088del (p.Ser695ArgfsTer12)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695217618"}},"detectionMethod":"Multipoint linkage analysis identified a single region, with a LOD score of 2.59 at 12q24.21-24.32.

Transferrin and ApoCIII glycosylation studies typically show evidence of both type II N- and O-glycosylation defects after 6 months of age; transferrin studies are usually normal before this age (Morava et al, 2009, PMID: 19401719; Van Maldergem et al, 2023, PMID: 20301755). \n\nFor the purposes of this curation, Cutis laxa, autosomal recessive, type IIA (MIM# 219200) and Wrinkly skin syndrome (MIM# 278250) were lumped together as ATP6V0A2-related cutis laxa. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern for these two disorders. In fact, per GeneReviews, *ATP6V0A2*-related cutis laxa “spans a phenotypic spectrum that includes the historical diagnoses of Debré-type cutis laxa (autosomal recessive cutis laxa 2, ARCL2) at the severe end and wrinkly skin syndrome at the mild end; these two phenotypes were thought to be distinct clinical entities until their molecular genetic nature was determined.” (Van Maldergem et al, 2023, PMID: 20301755).\n\nA recent literature review found 65 families with *ATP6V0A2*-CDG, and 60 distinct variants of which the majority were loss of function (Morlino et al, 2021, PMID: 33369135). Nine variants (5 frameshift, 3 nonsense, 1 splice site) that have been reported in 7 probands in 5 publications are included in this curation (Kornak et al, 2008 PMID: 18157129; Hucthagowder et al, 2009, PMID: 19321599; Ritelli et al, 2014, PMID: 24815019; Al Teneiji et al, 2017, PMID: 28122681; Karacan et al, 2019, PMID: 30474613). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (2 points). *ATP6V0A2* encodes the a2 subunit of the V0 domain of V-ATPase, and binds phosphoinositide PI(4)P to anchor V-ATPase to the Golgi membrane (Chu et al, 2024, PMID: 38396846). V-ATPases are ATP-dependent proton pumps that maintain organelle luminal pH in eukaryotic cells. These multi-subunit complexes are composed of a V1 domain that hydrolyzes ATP and a V0 domain that translocates protons from the cytosol to the lumen. Disruption of *ATP6V0A2* causes abnormal vesicular trafficking, abnormal glycosylation of serum proteins, intracellular accumulation of tropoelastin, and reduced deposition of mature elastin in the extracellular matrix (Hucthagowder et al, 2009, PMID:19321599; Udono et al, 2015, PMID: 26611489). Of note, at least three additional genes encoding subunits of V-ATPase have been reported to be involved in CDG and cutis laxa, *ATP6V1E1*, *ATP6V1A*, and *ATP6AP1* (Van Damme et al, 2017, PMID: 28065471; Witters et al, 2018, PMID: 29192153).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ATP6V0A2* and *ATP6V0A2*-CDG (autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2A), an autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation.  This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 3, 2024 (SOP version 10) \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:67eb6244-012c-48c0-a409-874636825d85"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
