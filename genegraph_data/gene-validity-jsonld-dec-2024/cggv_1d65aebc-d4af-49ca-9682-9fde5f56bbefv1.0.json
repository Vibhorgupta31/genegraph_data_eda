This neurotransmitter receptor has been shown previously to be present only in the synapses of the ON bipolar cell dendrites, and it mediates synaptic transmission from rod and cone photoreceptors to this type of second-order neuron. Despite the synaptic defect, best visual acuities were normal or only moderately reduced (20/15 to 20/40). The patients were night blind from an early age, and when maximally dark-adapted, they could perceive lights only with an intensity equal to or slightly dimmer than that normally detected by the cone system (i.e., 2-3 log units above normal). Electroretinograms (ERGs) in response to single brief flashes of light had clearly detectable a-waves, which are derived from photoreceptors, and greatly reduced b-waves, which are derived from the second-order inner retinal neurons. ERGs in response to sawtooth flickering light indicated a markedly reduced ON response and a nearly normal OFF response. There was no subjective delay in the perception of suddenly appearing white vs. black objects on a gray background. These patients exemplify a previously unrecognized, autosomal recessive form of congenital night blindness associated with a negative ERG waveform.","dc:creator":"Dryja TP","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Night blindness and abnormal cone electroretinogram ON responses in patients with mutations in the GRM6 gene encoding mGluR6."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d65aebc-d4af-49ca-9682-9fde5f56bbef_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb84fbe8-0a6f-4b49-8c1a-2b58d403e6fb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb84fbe8-0a6f-4b49-8c1a-2b58d403e6fb","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:f11f4bcf-63fb-4161-a308-2dcb7c829fe7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000843.4(GRM6):c.1861C>T (p.Arg621Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA117799"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:5eb56110-075d-46d6-9677-f29566b6d05e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f11f4bcf-63fb-4161-a308-2dcb7c829fe7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15781871"},"rdfs:label":"274-011"},{"id":"cggv:5eb56110-075d-46d6-9677-f29566b6d05e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5eb56110-075d-46d6-9677-f29566b6d05e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a13cbcca-10f5-4e94-ac26-3d180a085df4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0257c3f7-9d9c-4b8d-be8a-b0482b13baea_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0257c3f7-9d9c-4b8d-be8a-b0482b13baea","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:2b0d9110-257f-410d-b9e4-9aed71856b37","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000843.4(GRM6):c.137C>T (p.Pro46Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA117805"}},{"id":"cggv:cd037484-3bb5-44b0-a11e-b71e6d5db75b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"GRM6, 1-BP INS, 720G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/5845"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000662","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:a89d8b91-45de-4bef-a56b-05ee31bf0ea5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cd037484-3bb5-44b0-a11e-b71e6d5db75b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249515","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a group of nonprogressive retinal disorders characterized by impaired night vision that occurs in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked forms.

So far, the sequence variations that have been described in six different families include nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations. Here we investigated the impact of missense mutations in the ligand-binding domain, a conserved cysteine-rich domain, and the intracellular domain on the localization of the protein. We visualized and discriminated between surface and intracellular protein. Here we demonstrate that the wild-type (wt) protein localizes to the cell surface, and to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments. This also holds true for a mGluR6 variant containing a polymorphic, nondisease-associated amino acid exchange in the ligand-binding domain. In contrast, all disease-associated missense mutations lead to retention of the protein in the ER, while dimerization seems not to be affected. This is the first report that shows that CSNB-associated mutations in three different domains of mGluR6 abolish proper protein trafficking.

Congenital stationary night blindness is a clinical and genetically heterogeneous group of nonprogressive retinal disorder that can be characterized by impaired night vision, decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, myopia, and strabismus (OMIM#301500). 11 variants (variant type, e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 5 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 15781871, 16249515, 26628857) that are included in this curation. Segregation data was found in 2 families (PMID:16249515, 26628857). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *GRM6* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *GRM6*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800397).\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by Grm6-deficient mouse model (PMID: 7889569). In the mammalian eye, the ON-centre and OFF-centre retinal ganglion cells form two major pathways projecting to central visual structures from the retina. Electroretinogram analysis and recordings from the superior colliculus indicated that the homozygous mutant mice showed a loss of ON responses but unchanged OFF responses to light, demonstrating that *GRM6* is essential in synaptic transmission to the ON bipolar cell (PMID: 7889569). In another *in vitro* experiment, mutant transfected HEK293T cells demonstrated defects in protein localization when compared to wildtype (PMID:17405131). Preliminary evidence demonstrated that *GRM6* gene therapy could restore vision in mice with retinal degeneration (PMID:32258214).\n\nIn summary, *GRM6* is definitively associated with *GRM6*-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
