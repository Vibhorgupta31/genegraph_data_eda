Mice deficient in GNS showed lysosomal storage pathology and loss of lysosomal homeostasis in the CNS and peripheral tissues, chronic widespread neuroinflammation, reduced locomotor and exploratory activity and shortened lifespan, a phenotype that closely resembled human MPSIIID. Moreover, treatment of the GNS-deficient animals with GNS-encoding adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors of serotype 9 delivered to the cerebrospinal fluid completely corrected pathological storage, improved lysosomal functionality in the CNS and somatic tissues, resolved neuroinflammation, restored normal behaviour and extended lifespan of treated mice.

Twenty patients have been described in the literature and only seven causative mutations in the GNS gene encoding GlcNAc-6S sulphatase have been reported to date. We present the clinical and molecular results of a newly diagnosed Turkish patient with MPS IIID. We identified the novel homozygous single base pair insertion, c.1226GinsG, which leads to a frame-shift and a premature truncation of the GNS protein (p.R409Rfs21X).","dc:creator":"Elçioglu NH","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"A novel loss-of-function mutation in the GNS gene causes Sanfilippo syndrome type D."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1 - Elcioglu"},{"id":"cggv:4b35f2e8-e511-428f-a2de-059f132388e9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b35f2e8-e511-428f-a2de-059f132388e9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Scored 0.75pts per variant to yield 1.5pts total and prevent double-counting homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:56fc0f62-ac07-4824-8887-4f4e5130381c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56fc0f62-ac07-4824-8887-4f4e5130381c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:d5cf2f8f-23e1-4aab-b4c3-6eb5e7e20360","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002076.4(GNS):c.814C>T (p.Gln272Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/638094"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:d25d6e61-b11a-46f6-ab3d-849af6ffcb6d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d5cf2f8f-23e1-4aab-b4c3-6eb5e7e20360"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16990043"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 3 - Beesley 2007"},{"id":"cggv:d25d6e61-b11a-46f6-ab3d-849af6ffcb6d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d25d6e61-b11a-46f6-ab3d-849af6ffcb6d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Scored 0.75pts per variant to yield 1.5pts total and prevent double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5095,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:62f11052-4cd7-4ab5-b5bd-5c37c4d672ba","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009658","gene":"hgnc:4422","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between the GNS gene and mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (MPS3D), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 2, 2022. GNS encodes N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (PMID: 3391615), an enzyme that is involved in the glycosaminoglycan degradation via catalyzing the hydrolysis of the 6-sulfate groups of the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-sulfate moieties of heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate (PMID: 3689315). Individuals with MPS3D show impaired N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase activity, resulting in lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in multiple tissues, which leads to characteristic disease manifestations including CNS degeneration and skeletal dysostosis (PMID: 18392742). \n\nThe disease mechanism of MPS3D is loss of function. MPS3D was first reported in 1980 by Kresse et al. (PMID: 6450420) and the first reports of biallelic variants in GNS among MPS3D cases in 2003 by Mok et al. (PMID: 12573255) and Beasley et al. (PMID: 12624138). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between GNS and MPS3D. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 12573255, PMID: 12624138, PMID: 17998446, PMID: 17998446, PMID: 19650410, PMID: 16990043, PMID: 16990043, PMID: 20232353). In total, eight variants from eight probands in eight publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between GNS and MPS3D includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with MPS3D (PMID: 18392742); the biochemical and clinical features of GNS knockout mice (PMID: 28334745); and rescue of enzyme function via gene therapy in GNS knockout mice (PMID: 28334745). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, GNS is definitively associated with MPS3D. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on September 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:63312833-baef-4b11-9769-c93957decef6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
