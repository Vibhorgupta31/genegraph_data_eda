Loading of cohesin containing nonacetylated SMC3 is required for cohesion establishment in S phase, when SMC3 is acetylated by ESCO1/ESCO2 to facilitate binding of Sororin. Cohesin is removed by either the prophase pathway or by separase-dependent cleavage of RAD21 at anaphase onset. Upon removal from chromatin, HDAC8 deacetylates SMC3 to facilitate release of RAD21 and Sororin, thereby efficiently “refreshing” cohesin “used” in the previous cell cycle. This allows reacetylation of SMC3 in the following cell cycle to ensure its full functionality in sister chromatid cohesion and transcriptional regulation.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22885700","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a dominantly inherited congenital malformation disorder, caused by mutations in the cohesin-loading protein NIPBL for nearly 60% of individuals with classical CdLS, and by mutations in the core cohesin components SMC1A (~5%) and SMC3 (<1%) for a smaller fraction of probands. In humans, the multisubunit complex cohesin is made up of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and a STAG protein. These form a ring structure that is proposed to encircle sister chromatids to mediate sister chromatid cohesion and also has key roles in gene regulation. SMC3 is acetylated during S-phase to establish cohesiveness of chromatin-loaded cohesin, and in yeast, the class I histone deacetylase Hos1 deacetylates SMC3 during anaphase. Here we identify HDAC8 as the vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase, as well as loss-of-function HDAC8 mutations in six CdLS probands. Loss of HDAC8 activity results in increased SMC3 acetylation and inefficient dissolution of the ‘used’ cohesin complex released from chromatin in both prophase and anaphase. SMC3 with retained acetylation is loaded onto chromatin, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis demonstrates decreased occupancy of cohesin localization sites that results in a consistent pattern of altered transcription seen in CdLS cell lines with either NIPBL or HDAC8 mutations.","dc:creator":"Deardorff MA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"HDAC8 mutations in Cornelia de Lange syndrome affect the cohesin acetylation cycle."},"rdfs:label":"SMC3 deacetylation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a7d29159-4c90-488e-a4e1-b006d70ae762_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:851930b3-11d0-4474-ae18-e6c8ebc83557","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b887f309-3e04-443b-a2ee-05b3a84de344","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Purified wild type, but not mutant HDAC8, can rescue the SMC3 overacetylation seen in HDAC8 mutant LCLs.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22885700","rdfs:label":"SMC3 overacetylation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a79ed3f8-c127-4899-9ae5-81453b348cb8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad7f934e-bdfa-410b-8917-cae94e0193b1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder characterized by malformations affecting multiple systems.

At least 9 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice) have been reported in humans. HDAC8 was first associated with this disease in humans in 2012 (Deardorff et al.) and expands the phenotypic spectrum of classic CdLS to include delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, hypertelorism, hooding of eyelids, a wide nose and dental anomalies (Kaiser et al. 2014, Parenti et al. 2016).\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points.\nAssociation is seen in at least 9 probands in 4 publications (22885700, 25102094, 22889856, 29519750). Variants in this gene usually occur de novo but segregation with disease was observed in 11 members of a Dutch family (Harakalova et al 2012). This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays, rescue in patient cells, and animal models.\nIn summary, HDAC8 is definitively associated with Cornelia de Lange syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Autism and Intellectual Disability Working Group on 9/11/2018.\nSegregation should only count for 2 points but this does not affect the scoring.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a7d29159-4c90-488e-a4e1-b006d70ae762"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
