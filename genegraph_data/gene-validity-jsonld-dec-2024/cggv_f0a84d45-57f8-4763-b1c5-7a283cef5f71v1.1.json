GAMT and AGAT deficiency have autosomal-recessive traits, whereas the CrT1 defect is a X-linked disorder. All patients reveal developmental delay/regression, mental retardation, and severe disturbance of their expressive and cognitive speech. The common feature of all creatine deficiency syndromes is the severe depletion of creatine/phosphocreatine in the brain. Only the GAMT deficiency is in addition characterized by accumulation of guanidinoacetic acid in brain and body fluids. Guanidinoacetic acid seems to be responsible for intractable seizures and the movement disorder, both exclusively found in GAMT deficiency. Treatment with oral creatine supplementation is in part successful in GAMT and AGAT deficiency, whereas in CrT1 defect it is not able to replenish creatine in the brain. Treatment of combined arginine restriction and ornithine substitution in GAMT deficiency is capable to decrease guanidinoacetic acid permanently and improves the clinical outcome. The lack of the creatine/phosphocreatine signal in the patient's brain by means of in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the common finding and the diagnostic clue in all three diseases. In AGAT deficiency guanidinoacetic acid is decreased, whereas creatine in blood was found to be normal. On the other hand the CrT1 defect is characterized by an increased concentration of creatine in blood and urine whereas guanidinoacetic acid concentration is normal. The increasing number of patients detected very recently suffering from a creatine deficiency syndrome and the unfavorable outcome highlights the need of further attempts in early recognition of affected individuals and in optimizing its treatment.

We investigated the utility of creatine monohydrate supplementation in two different creatine deficient knockout mouse models. Following weaning, female Arginine: Glycine Amidinotransferase (AGAT) and Guanidinoacetate: methyltransferase (GAMT) knockouts and wild type mice were studied based on their genotypes and dietary supplementation (creatine free or 2% creatine monohydrate supplemented diet) for 10 weeks, using a series of behavioral tests and biochemical analyzes. An improved Rota rod performance was observed in both AGAT (p = 0.02) and GAMT knockout mice (p < 0.001) supplemented with 2% creatine. During Morris water maze probe trial, creatine supplemented AGAT knockout mice took less time to reach virtual platform (p = 0.03) and more frequently crossed this area (p = 0.001) than mice on creatine free diet. Similar observations were recorded for GAMT knockout mice. Urinary creatinine concentrations for AGAT (p = 0.001) and GAMT (p = 0.05) knockout mice were increased following creatine supplementation. Creatine supplementation has a potential to improve neuro-muscular coordination, spatial learning in both AGAT and GAMT knockout mice. Long term Creatine supplementation results in increased urine creatinine concentrations indicating improved creatine metabolism in knockout mice.","dc:creator":"Iqbal F","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Biochemical and behavioral phenotype of AGAT and GAMT deficient mice following long-term Creatine monohydrate supplementation."},"rdfs:label":"Treatment of GAMT knockout mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The score is reduced because the neurological features of GAMT knockout mice are very mild and do not recapitulate the severe features noted in humans with GAMT deficiency.

In GAMT null mice, creatine levels were about 1-27% level of wild type littermates (all mice on creatine-free diet). The relatively high residual level of creatine in knock mice was attributed to coprophagia in cages shared by wild type, heterozygous, and GAMT knockout mice. As in humans with GAMT deficiency, 1H-magentic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in muscle and brain of GAMT knock out mice showed markedly reduced creatine/phosphocreatine resonance signals in comparison to controls. Surprisingly, GAMT knock out mice had no obvious neurological symptoms such as ataxia or seizures. The authors postulate that favorable biochemical adaptations, energy buffering by guanidinoacetate phosphate, residual phosphocreatine or both may prevent serious neurological symptoms in adult GAMT-deficient mice, or that guanidinoacetate levels in the extracellular space of mouse brain might be heterogeneous and possibly also lower than in the CSF of humans.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15028668","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We generated a knockout mouse model for guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (MIM 601240), the first discovered human creatine deficiency syndrome, by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Disruption of the open reading frame of the murine GAMT gene in the first exon resulted in the elimination of 210 of the 237 amino acids present in mGAMT. The creation of an mGAMT null allele was verified at the genetic, RNA and protein levels. GAMT knockout mice have markedly increased guanidinoacetate (GAA) and reduced creatine and creatinine levels in brain, serum and urine, which are key findings in human GAMT patients. In vivo (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed high levels of PGAA and reduced levels of creatine phosphate in heart, skeletal muscle and brain. These biochemical alterations were comparable to those found in human GAMT patients and can be attributed to the very similar GAMT expression patterns found by us in human and mouse tissues. We provide evidence that GAMT deficiency in mice causes biochemical adaptations in brain and skeletal muscle. It is associated with increased neonatal mortality, muscular hypotonia, decreased male fertility and a non-leptin-mediated life-long reduction in body weight due to reduced body fat mass. Therefore, GAMT knockout mice are a valuable creatine deficiency model for studying the effects of high-energy phosphate depletion in brain, heart, skeletal muscle and other organs.","dc:creator":"Schmidt A","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Severely altered guanidino compound levels, disturbed body weight homeostasis and impaired fertility in a mouse model of guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"GAMT null mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The biochemical features of GAMT knockout mice, including low creatine and creatinine, and elevated guanidinoacetate are similar in humans with GAMT deficiency.

GAMT deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At least 120 cases have been reported worldwide (Mercimek-Mahmatoglu and Salomons, 2009, PMID 20301745).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Eleven unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense) in 9 probands were curated (Stöckler et al, 1996, PMID 8651275; Carducci et al, 2000, PMID 11136556; Schulze, 2003, PMID 12557293; Item et al, 2004, PMID 15108290; Leuzzi et al, 2006, PMID 16293431; Verbruggen et al, 2007, PMID 17466557). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Of note, common variants include p.Trp20Ser (c.59G>C) and c.327G>A (impacting splicing by altering the last nucleotide of exon 2) (Mercimek-Mahmatoglu and Salomons, 2009, PMID 20301745). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by the function of GAMT in creatine synthesis (see Schulze, 2003, PMID 12701824 for review), functional analysis of missense variation in GAMT (Mercimek-Mahmatoglu et al, 2014, PMID 2441567), rescue of GAMT activity by expression of the cDNA in cultured fibroblasts from a patient with GAMT deficiency (Almeida et al, 2006, PMID 16899382), and the biochemical features and impact of creatine supplementation in a GAMT knockout mouse model (Schmidt et al, 2004, 15028668; Iqbal et al, 2018, PMID 28808834). More experimental evidence may be available but the maximum score (6 points) has been reached. In summary, GAMT is definitively associated with GAMT deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
