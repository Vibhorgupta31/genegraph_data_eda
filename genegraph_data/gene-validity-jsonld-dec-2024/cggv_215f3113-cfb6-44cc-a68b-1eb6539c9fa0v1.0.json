In 13 Japanese CMTP-affected pedigrees, we identified six (46%) affected by ACTN1 variants cosegregating with CMTP. In the entire cohort, ACNT1 variants accounted for 5.5% of the dominant forms of CMTP cases and represented the fourth most common cause in Japanese individuals. Individuals with ACTN1 variants presented with moderate macrothrombocytopenia with anisocytosis but were either asymptomatic or had only a modest bleeding tendency. ACTN1 encodes α-actinin-1, a member of the actin-crosslinking protein superfamily that participates in the organization of the cytoskeleton. In vitro transfection experiments in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated that altered α-actinin-1 disrupted the normal actin-based cytoskeletal structure. Moreover, transduction of mouse fetal liver-derived megakaryocytes with disease-associated ACTN1 variants caused a disorganized actin-based cytoskeleton in megakaryocytes, resulting in the production of abnormally large proplatelet tips, which were reduced in number.

Combining bioinformatics, segregation, and functional studies, we demonstrated that all but 1 amino acid substitution had deleterious effects. The clinical and laboratory findings of 31 affected individuals confirmed that ACTN1-RT is a mild macrothrombocytopenia with low risk for bleeding. Low reticulated platelet counts and only slightly increased serum thrombopoietin levels indicated that the latest phases of megakaryopoiesis were affected.

Nine variants were located in the α-actinin-1 (ACTN1) rod domain and were predicted to hinder dimer formation. These variants displayed a smaller increase in platelet size compared with variants located outside the rod domain.

Next-generation sequencing has previously been employed in these disorders for the confirmation of suspected genetic abnormalities, and more recently in the discovery of novel disease-causing genes. However its full potential has not yet been exploited. Over the past 6 years we have sequenced the exomes from 55 patients, including 37 index cases and 18 additional family members, all of whom were recruited to the UK Genotyping and Phenotyping of Platelets study. All patients had inherited or sustained thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology with platelet counts varying from 11×109/L to 186×109/L. Of the 51 patients phenotypically tested, 37 (73%), had an additional secondary qualitative platelet defect. Using whole exome sequencing analysis we have identified \"pathogenic\" or \"likely pathogenic\" variants in 46% (17/37) of our index patients with thrombocytopenia. In addition, we report variants of uncertain significance in 12 index cases, including novel candidate genetic variants in previously unreported genes in four index cases.

Here we report a six-generation French pedigree with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and the identification of its genetic basis. Of the 55 subjects available for analysis, 26 were diagnosed with isolated macrothrombocytopenia. Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped a 10.9 Mb locus to chromosome 14 (14q22) with a LOD score of 7.6. Candidate gene analysis complemented by targeted next-generation sequencing identified a missense mutation (c.137GA; p.Arg46Gln) in the alpha-actinin 1 gene (ACTN1) that segregated with macrothrombocytopenia in this large pedigree. The missense mutation occurred within actin-binding domain of alpha-actinin 1, a functionally critical domain that crosslinks actin filaments into bundles. The evaluation of cultured mutation-harboring megakaryocytes by electron microscopy and the immunofluorescence examination of transfected COS-7 cells suggested that the mutation causes disorganization of the cellular cytoplasm.

All of the previously reported ACTN1 mutations associated with macrothrombocytopenia reside within the ABD and the CaM domain and not within the SLR domain. In this report, we describe a mutation in SLR2 of α-actinin-1 (p.Leu395Gln) associated with familial macrothrombocytopenia. A 3-year-old boy and his mother both had this mutation. They showed a mild form of thrombocytopenia without severe bleeding, accompanied by an elevated mean platelet volume. Consistent with the previous reports of mutations that reside in the ABD or the CaM domain, immunofluorescence examination revealed disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in Gln395 mutant-transduced Chinese hamster ovary cells. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of ACTN1-related macrothrombocytopenia that does not involve functional domain mutations.

We have sequenced 2,396 index patients using the ThromboGenomics HTS panel test of diagnostic-grade genes known to harbour variants associated with rare bleeding, thrombotic or platelet disorders (BTPD). The molecular diagnostic rate was determined by the clinical phenotype, with an overall rate of 49.2% for all thrombotic, coagulation, platelet count and function disorder patients and a rate of 3.2% for patients with unexplained bleeding disorders characterized by normal hemostasis test results. The MDT classified 745 unique variants, including copy number and intronic variants, as Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic or Variants of Uncertain Significance. Half (50.9%) of these variants are novel and 41 unique variants were identified in 7 genes recently found to be implicated in BTPD. Inspection of canonical hemostasis pathways identified 29 patients with evidence of oligogenic inheritance. A molecular diagnosis has been reported for 894 index patients providing evidence that introducing an HTS genetic test is a valuable addition to laboratory diagnostics in patients with a high likelihood of having an inherited BTPD.","dc:creator":"Downes K","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Diagnostic high-throughput sequencing of 2,396 patients with bleeding, thrombotic and platelet disorders."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31064749","rdfs:label":"TGP0784"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This frameshift variant, Asp531GlyfsTer21, generates a premature stop codon expected to result in NMD.

Affected individuals have macrothrombocytopenia and usually have no or only mild bleeding tendency, such as epistaxis. At least 27 unique missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 30 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 23434115, 25361813, 26453073, 28562514, 27479822, 24069336, 31064749, 31237726). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 65 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional alteration in patient (PMID: 25361813) and non-patient cells (PMID: 23434115). It is hypothesized that ACTN1 variants induce more stable actin filaments, thereby impairing stretching and leading to shorter and thicker fibers, however the reason why this mild phenotype is limited to platelets while ACTN1 has a ubiquitous expression is currently not well understood. In summary, ACTN1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant platelet-type bleeding disorder 15.\nThe Hemostasis Thrombosis GCEP feels confident that the variant spectrum (missense variants with a gain‐of‐function effect, resulting in an increased binding to actin) of this disease is limiting the ability to assign the appropriate score under genetic evidence, and that evidence supporting the pathogenicity of available variants is strong. As such we opt to override the scoring maximum on the missense variant category and consider the genetic evidence at the full value of 12 pt with 1 pt of experimental evidence for at total of 13 pts this gene disease relationship reaches the Definitive classification.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:215f3113-cfb6-44cc-a68b-1eb6539c9fa0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
