Thrombin generation at low triggers was severely impaired and mixing experiments suggested the presence of a coagulation inhibitor. Using whole exome sequencing, the underlying genetic defect was identified as the THBD c.1611C>A mutation (p.Cys537Stop), which predicts a truncated form of thrombomodulin that is shed from the vascular endothelium. The patient had decreased expression of endothelium-bound thrombomodulin, but extremely elevated levels of soluble thrombomodulin in plasma, impairing the propagation phase of coagulation via rapid activation of protein C and consequent inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa.

This work shows that the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, rather than free thrombin, is the most likely physiologic activator. Thrombomodulin increases the catalytic efficiency of the reaction by a factor of 1250, an effect expressed almost exclusively through an increase in kcat. The kinetics of the reaction conform to a model whereby thrombin can interact with either TAFI (Km = 1.0 microM) or thrombomodulin (Kd = 8.6 nM), and either binary complex so formed can then interact with the third component to form the ternary thrombin-thrombomodulin-TAFI complex from which activated TAFI is produced with kcat = 1.2 s-1. This work also shows that activated TAFI down-regulates tPA-induced fibrinolysis half-maximally at a concentration of 1.0 nM in a system of purified components. This concentration of TAFI is about 2% of the level of the zymogen in plasma, which indicates that ample activated TAFI could be generated to very significantly modulate fibrinolysis in vivo. Therefore, TAFI in vitro and possibly in vivo defines an explicit molecular connection between the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades, such that expression of activity in the former down-regulates the activity of the latter.","dc:creator":"Bajzar L","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"TAFI, or plasma procarboxypeptidase B, couples the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades through the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex."},"rdfs:label":"THBD interacts with Thrombin"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c9647504-136c-4b73-999b-738113b3911d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3dd58da4-6a6c-405d-80f9-8b01e2c5e443","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"The THBD protein forms a 1:1 complex with the coagulation factor thrombin and alters thrombin's specificity toward several substrates, ultimately acting as an antithrombotic factor.

The objectives of this review were to review recent findings regarding thrombomodulin structure, its involvement in the regulation of hemostasis and further discuss the implication, if any, of the genetic polymorphisms in the thrombomodulin gene in the risk of development of thrombosis. We performed a literature search by using electronic bibliographic databases. Although the direct evaluation of risk situations associated with thrombomodulin mutations/polymorphisms could be of clinical significance, it appears that mutations that affect the function of thrombomodulin are rarely associated with venous thromboembolism. However, several polymorphisms are reported to be associated with increased risk for arterial thrombosis. Additionally studies on knock out mice as well studies on humans bearing rare mutations suggest that thrombomodulin dysfunction may be implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial infraction.","dc:creator":"Anastasiou G","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Thrombomodulin as a regulator of the anticoagulant pathway:  implication in the development of thrombosis."},"rdfs:label":"Thrombomodulin as a regulator of the anticoagulant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:358cb384-4303-425d-9b92-509c600c2d03_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7d01ace-a62e-4611-9585-c57d4b39ebf4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0631fd9a-ef90-4b54-a035-b4bd70a39362","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Plasma from the THBD patients showed reduced tissue factor-induced thrombin generation.
