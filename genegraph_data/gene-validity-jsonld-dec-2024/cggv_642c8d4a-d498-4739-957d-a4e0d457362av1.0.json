Mice carrying inactivating mutations in the Lpin1 gene display the characteristic features of human familial lipodystrophy. Very little is known about the roles of lipin-1 in human adipocyte physiology. Apparently, fat distribution and weight is normal in humans carrying LPIN1 inactivating mutations, but a detailed analysis of adipose tissue appearance and functions in these patients has not been available so far. In this study, we performed a systematic histopathological, biochemical, and gene expression analysis of adipose tissue biopsies from human patients harboring LPIN1 biallelic inactivating mutations and affected by recurrent episodes of severe rhabdomyolysis. We also explored the adipogenic differentiation potential of human mesenchymal cell populations derived from lipin-1 defective patients. White adipose tissue from human LPIN1 mutant patients displayed a dramatic decrease in lipin-1 protein levels and PAP activity, with a concomitant moderate reduction of adipocyte size. Nevertheless, the adipose tissue develops without obvious histological signs of lipodystrophy and with normal qualitative composition of storage lipids. The increased expression of key adipogenic determinants such as SREBP1, PPARG, and PGC1A shows that specific compensatory phenomena can be activated in vivo in human adipocytes with deficiency of functional lipin-1.","dc:creator":"Pelosi M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Normal human adipose tissue functions and differentiation in patients with biallelic LPIN1 inactivating mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Lipin-1 protein levels in adipose tissue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"In adipose tissue not muscle"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:642c8d4a-d498-4739-957d-a4e0d457362a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f4ad6eb-f56c-4cf1-a68e-a8c7f00550f2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d449208-61cb-4a94-a036-00556587ea17","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Reduced phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity in patients' cells compared to controls","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28986436","rdfs:label":"Phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"In adipose tissue not muscle"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:642c8d4a-d498-4739-957d-a4e0d457362a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f9a8053-6537-4fb1-bca4-e1b27a93e277","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5273006-fc23-4166-8bc0-06dbbdf3ff16","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Two mouse model showed increased plasma CK levels, chronic myopathy, abnormal mitochondria","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30028636","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Lipin 1 regulates glycerolipid homeostasis by acting as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) enzyme in the triglyceride-synthesis pathway and by regulating transcription factor activity. Mutations in human lipin 1 are a common cause of recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children. Mice with constitutive whole-body lipin 1 deficiency have been used to examine mechanisms connecting lipin 1 deficiency to myocyte injury. However, that mouse model is confounded by lipodystrophy not phenocopied in people. Herein, 2 muscle-specific mouse models were studied: 1) Lpin1 exon 3 and 4 deletion, resulting in a hypomorphic protein without PAP activity, but which preserved transcriptional coregulatory function; and 2) Lpin1 exon 7 deletion, resulting in total protein loss. In both models, skeletal muscles exhibited a chronic myopathy with ongoing muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration and accumulation of phosphatidic acid and, paradoxically, diacylglycerol. Additionally, lipin 1-deficient mice had abundant, but abnormal, mitochondria likely because of impaired autophagy. Finally, these mice exhibited increased plasma creatine kinase following exhaustive exercise when unfed. These data suggest that mice lacking lipin 1-mediated PAP activity in skeletal muscle may serve as a model for determining the mechanisms by which lipin 1 deficiency leads to myocyte injury and for testing potential therapeutic approaches.-Schweitzer, G.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of LPIN1 mutations in patients exhibiting severe episodes of rhabdomyolysis in infancy. After exclusion of primary fatty acid oxidation disorders, LPIN1 coding sequence was determined in genomic DNA and cDNA. Among the 29 patients studied, 17 (59%) carried recessive nonsense or frameshift mutations, or a large scale intragenic deletion. In these 17 patients, episodes of rhabdomyolysis occurred at a mean age of 21 months. Secondary defect of mitochondrial fatty oxidation or respiratory chain was found in skeletal muscle of two patients. The intragenic deletion, c.2295-866_2410-30del, was identified in 8/17 patients (47%), all Caucasians, and occurred on the background of a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. This deleted human LPIN1 form was unable to complement Delta pah1 yeast for growth on glycerol, in contrast to normal LPIN1. Since more than 50% of our series harboured LPIN1 mutations, LPIN1 should be regarded as a major cause of severe myoglobinuria in early childhood. The high frequency of the intragenic LPIN1 deletion should provide a valuable criterion for fast diagnosis, prior to muscle biopsy.","dc:creator":"Michot C","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"LPIN1 gene mutations: a major cause of severe rhabdomyolysis in early childhood."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20583302","rdfs:label":"7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:b032afc4-c4e2-48e2-aac4-d43e4b3dd8ab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:060ae7a2-d7e2-4d07-9975-76d5c6c00eaa","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Rhabdomyolysis","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003201","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b032afc4-c4e2-48e2-aac4-d43e4b3dd8ab_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:53c02708-15a3-4edd-89fd-c1a1bcaa2b49"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20583302"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20583302","rdfs:label":"5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:feac3964-96a8-45e6-8056-02c08dfa6bf3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95e43d94-efdb-45f7-a614-eb84dcd81b0e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"acute recurrent myoglobinuria","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003652","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:feac3964-96a8-45e6-8056-02c08dfa6bf3_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ae6e9ac5-3752-4421-ad66-88a2631fcf1b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_145693.3(LPIN1):c.643G>T (p.Glu215Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/4910"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18817903","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recurrent episodes of life-threatening myoglobinuria in childhood are caused by inborn errors of glycogenolysis, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation.
