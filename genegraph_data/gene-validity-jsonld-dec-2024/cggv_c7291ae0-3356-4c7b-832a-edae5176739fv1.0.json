In most MODY kindreds described in France, chronic hyperglycaemia is caused by mutations in the gene encoding pancreatic beta-cell and liver glucokinase (GCK). We here report the beta-cell secretory profiles of nine patients from four GCK-linked MODY kindreds. First-phase insulin secretion assessed by an intravenous glucose test was comparable in patients and seven controls. However, beta-cell secretory response to continuous glucose stimulus during a hyperglycaemic glucose clamp was significantly reduced: mean plasma insulin values of 12 (SD 7) vs 40 (11) mU/l (p = 0.0001) and mean plasma C-peptide values 1.20 (0.30) vs 2.61 (0.37) (p = 0.0001). This secretory profile is different from those for NIDDM with late age of onset or MODY not linked to GCK. Fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide in patients were inappropriately low in relation to concomitant plasma glucose level. Furthermore, during a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, endogenous insulin secretion at euglycaemia (5 mmol/l) was suppressed in patients but not in controls. These results suggest that mutant GCK may lead to chronic hyperglycaemia by raising the threshold of circulating glucose level which induces insulin secretion.

Despite great advances in the speed and cost of DNA sequencing, determining the pathogenicity of variants remains a challenge, and requires sharing of sequence and phenotypic data between laboratories. We reviewed all diabetes and hyperinsulinism-associated molecular testing done at the Seattle Children's Molecular Genetics Laboratory from 2009 to 2013. 331 probands were referred to us for molecular genetic sequencing for Neonatal Diabetes (NDM), Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), or Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) during this period. Reportable variants were identified in 115 (35%) patients with 91 variants in one of 6 genes: HNF1A, GCK, HNF4A, ABCC8, KCNJ11, or INS. In addition to identifying 23 novel variants, we identified unusual mechanisms of inheritance, including mosaic and digenic MODY presentations. Re-analysis of all reported variants using more recently available databases led to a change in variant interpretation from the original report in 30% of cases. These results represent a resource for molecular testing of monogenic forms of diabetes and hyperinsulinism, providing a mutation spectrum for these disorders in a large North American cohort. In addition, they highlight the importance of periodic review of molecular testing results.

Previously we observed tight linkage between DNA polymorphisms in the glucokinase gene on the short arm of chromosome 7 and NIDDM in a cohort of sixteen French families having MODY. Glucokinase is an enzyme that catalyses the formation of glucose-6-phosphate from glucose and may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and integration of hepatic intermediary metabolism. Because the glucokinase gene was a candidate for the site of the genetic lesion in these families, we scanned this gene for mutations. Here we report the identification of a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding glucokinase and its linkage with early-onset diabetes in one family.

It accounts for 2-5% of all cases of non-type 1 diabetes. MODY subtype 2 is caused by mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene. In this study, we sequenced the GCK gene of two volunteers with clinical diagnosis for MODY2 and we were able to identify four mutations including one for a premature stop codon (c.76C>T). Based on these results, we have developed a specific PCR-RFLP assay to detect this mutation and tested 122 related volunteers from the same family. This mutation in the GCK gene was detected in 21 additional subjects who also had the clinical features of this genetic disease. In conclusion, we identified new GCK gene mutations in a Brazilian family of Italian descendance, with one due to a premature stop codon located in the second exon of the gene. We also developed a specific assay that is fast, cheap and reliable to detect this mutation.

The phenotype is specific to GCK and generally comprises lifelong stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia in the impaired fasting glucose to low diabetic range that generally neither responds to nor requires treatment, exhibits normal response to a glucose load, and has been associated with a much lower prevalence of the vascular complications typically seen with diabetes (PMID 24430320).  This disease entity is often referred to as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 2 (MODY2) and GCK-MODY, as well as GCK-associated hyperglycemia.  \n\n \n\nFor the association of GCK with MODY2 autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes, numerous variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar and variants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25555642, 1570017, 21104275, 23085272, 27269892, 27289208, 25850297). Segregation and familial inheritance has also been noted (PMIDs: 1545870, 23085272, 21104275, 1570017). Additional evidence is available in the literature, however the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, animal models, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, GCK is definitively associated with autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes (MODY2) or impaired fasting glucose with the specific phenotype noted above. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.  \n\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting working group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability underlying the GCK-related disease entities. Therefore, we have split curations for these disease entities.  \n\n\nThe present curation includes (1) Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 2, MODY2 (MIM:125851) (due to heterozygous inactivating GCK variants). Other disease entities requiring separate curations include (2) Diabetes mellitus, permanent neonatal (MIM:606176) (due to homozygous or compound heterozygous GCK variants, usually requiring insulin treatment), and (3) Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, familial, 3 (MIM:602485) (due to heterozygous activating GCK variants). Type 2 diabetes (polygenic; MIM:125853) will not be curated since the contribution of GCK is in the form of common variants with a small effect.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c7291ae0-3356-4c7b-832a-edae5176739f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
