A combined approach of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.565C>T [p.Glu189*]) in RAB28 in a German family with three siblings with arCRD. Another homozygous nonsense mutation (c.409C>T [p.Arg137*]) was identified in a family of Moroccan Jewish descent with two siblings affected by arCRD. All five affected individuals presented with hyperpigmentation in the macula, progressive loss of the visual acuity, atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, and severely reduced cone and rod responses on the electroretinogram. RAB28 encodes a member of the Rab subfamily of the RAS-related small GTPases. Alternative RNA splicing yields three predicted protein isoforms with alternative C-termini, which are all truncated by the nonsense mutations identified in the arCRD families in this report. Opposed to other Rab GTPases that are generally geranylgeranylated, RAB28 is predicted to be farnesylated. Staining of rat retina showed localization of RAB28 to the basal body and the ciliary rootlet of the photoreceptors. Analogous to the function of other RAB family members, RAB28 might be involved in ciliary transport in photoreceptor cells. This study reveals a crucial role for RAB28 in photoreceptor function and suggests that mutations in other Rab proteins may also be associated with retinal dystrophies.","dc:creator":"Roosing S","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in RAB28, encoding a farnesylated small GTPase, are associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy."},"rdfs:label":"Roosing 2013 Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variants found in the 2 families are predicted to truncate all 3 isoforms."},{"id":"cggv:2608f9cb-a425-42bd-a5d3-b5fbf05c78dc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:29914067-9a57-49e8-b89c-1a2e4d09b7be","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Ciliopathies are genetic disorders that result in abnormal formation of function of cilia.

Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.","dc:creator":"Jensen VL","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Whole-Organism Developmental Expression Profiling Identifies RAB-28 as a Novel Ciliary GTPase Associated with the BBSome and Intraflagellar Transport."},"rdfs:label":"Cilia Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:33846a4f-dc92-4e03-b390-472458a6a958_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33846a4f-dc92-4e03-b390-472458a6a958_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bac84766-39ec-4d18-bf1e-945c8e7d0f78_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48c1ade2-8411-4304-91de-df0be41f2377","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":33,"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping in family, Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Atrophy in fovea, tilted optic discs with temporal pallor OS, cone and rod response reduced","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:bac84766-39ec-4d18-bf1e-945c8e7d0f78_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ece89e5a-d04c-4994-bcde-44d1faa23e7d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001017979.2(RAB28):c.409C>T (p.Arg137Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/60755"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23746546"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23746546","rdfs:label":"B- II:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"RT-PCR analysis from lymphocytes isolated from affected individuals: all 3 isoforms were detected, excluding complete loss of RAB28 by NMD."},{"id":"cggv:b1fb9ab6-ee46-41e4-a695-027f831bf1ac_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:978881f7-0089-4450-aa98-b107f54e52cd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping on 3 siblings narrowed to 15 genes.
