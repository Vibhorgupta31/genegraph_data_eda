These genes encode the motor proteins myosin IA, IIIA, VI, VIIA and XVA. To date, most mutations in myosin genes have been found in the Caucasian population. In addition, only a few functional studies have been performed on the previously reported myosin mutations. We performed screening and functional studies for mutations in the MYO1A and MYO6 genes in Korean cases of autosomal dominant non-syndromic HL. We identified four novel heterozygous mutations in MYO6. Three mutations (p.R825X, p.R991X and Q918fsX941) produce a premature truncation of the myosin VI protein. Another mutation, p.R205Q, was associated with diminished actin-activated ATPase activity and actin gliding velocity of myosin VI in an in vitro analysis. This finding is consistent with the results of protein modelling studies and corroborates the pathogenicity of this mutation in the MYO6 gene. One missense variant, p.R544W, was found in the MYO1A gene, and in silico analysis suggested that this variant has deleterious effects on protein function. This finding is consistent with the results of protein modelling studies and corroborates the pathogenic effect of this mutation in the MYO6 gene.

This association was made using case-level and case-control data. At least 11 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. MYO1A was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2003 (Donaudy et al.). Of the 11 published variants, one is supported by a functional study, and 10 are refuted by high frequency in gnomAD, nonsegregation with disease, or confirmed alternate cause of disease. A knock-out mouse model does not replicate the hearing loss phenotype. In summary, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MYO1A and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 1/16/18.\n24616153; Eisenberger 2014 Identified one heterozygous nonsense variant in MYO1A in a 4-y/o with congenital profound HL- did not segregate with HL in family, girl was found to have homozygous missense MYO7A variants, diagnosed with probable pre-RP Usher. A second congenitally deaf patient from consanguineous family found to have heterozygous nonsense MYO1A variant. Again, alternate cause was found- homozygosity for previously reported missense variant in CIB2. Finally, a third case with one of the variants reported in Donaudy (p.G662E) had several nonsegregations (two hearing as well as one hearing-impaired family members carried variant). Paper noted that four out of eight Donaudy 2003 variants are present in dbSNP/ESP. 27759032; Patton 2017 identified 12 individuals with MYO1A variants (either reported in Donaudy 2003 or predicted LOF) by WES. None had hearing loss outside that expected for age. There was no association between hearing loss and presence of MYO1A variants.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3dcc24f7-4cf7-413b-a956-16ad58bcbd36"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
