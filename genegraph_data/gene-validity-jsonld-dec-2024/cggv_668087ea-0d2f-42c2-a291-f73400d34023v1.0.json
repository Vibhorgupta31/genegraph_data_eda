In this study, we aimed to characterize the mutational spectrum of primary CMP in a large cohort of patients ≤18 years referred to a tertiary center. Eighty unrelated index patients with pediatric primary CMP underwent genetic testing with a panel-based next-generation sequencing approach of 89 genes. At least one pathogenic or probably pathogenic variant was identified in 30/80 (38%) index patients. In all CMP subgroups, patients carried most frequently variants of interest in sarcomere genes suggesting them as a major contributor in pediatric primary CMP. In MYH7, MYBPC3, and TNNI3, we identified 18 pathogenic/probably pathogenic variants (MYH7 n = 7, MYBPC3 n = 6, TNNI3 n = 5, including one homozygous (TNNI3 c.24+2T>A) truncating variant. Protein and transcript level analysis on heart biopsies from individuals with homozygous mutation of TNNI3 revealed that the TNNI3 protein is absent and associated with upregulation of the fetal isoform TNNI1. The present study further supports the clinical importance of sarcomeric mutation-not only in adult-but also in pediatric primary CMP. TNNI3 is the third most important disease gene in this cohort and complete loss of TNNI3 leads to severe pediatric CMP.","dc:creator":"Kühnisch J","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Targeted panel sequencing in pediatric primary cardiomyopathy supports a critical role of TNNI3."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568572","rdfs:label":"6-II:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"1.0 point assigned for de novo, reduced from the default 2.0 as recommended by ClinGen protocol because it is a missense variant and not a null variant."},{"id":"cggv:1535766c-f4b4-45d0-af10-aec72fa0aee4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:61295c67-6db2-4dea-9a7f-bde8013d0b64","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"screened for mutations in up to 10 genes  (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, MYBPC3, ACTC, LMNA, PLN, TAZ, and LDB3), and 70% of patients were tested for all genes.","firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:1535766c-f4b4-45d0-af10-aec72fa0aee4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:47f3062e-7817-48d8-b946-921a07699ae4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000363.5(TNNI3):c.544G>A (p.Glu182Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA021848"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464770"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464770","rdfs:label":"E182K Individual"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The varaints was assigned 1.0 points (de novo, reduced from the default 2.0 as recommended by ClinGen GC SPO since they are missense variants and not null variants, and not all DCM genes were scnreened)."},{"id":"cggv:f7a60e0f-6416-463e-8c8a-a5954c59217a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36b69170-5d94-40af-a59f-baa256b405cc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"detectionMethod":"screened for variants in 89 cardiac disease-associated genes using NGS.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:f7a60e0f-6416-463e-8c8a-a5954c59217a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:685f53f7-f6d5-4f2f-ba03-5e40a7406ba9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000363.5(TNNI3):c.204del (p.Arg69fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA021357"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568572"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568572","rdfs:label":"1-II:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"0.5 points assigned, reduced from the default 1.5 (predicted or proven null varaint) due to the suspicion of post-vaccination myocarditis (Category: Genetic evidence).\nAutosomal recessive inheritance pattern with limited evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":1341,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":10,"subject":{"id":"cggv:2de73f9c-cad9-4514-a015-a627405a2b65","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:11947","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"TNNI3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant DCM in 2009 (Carballo et al., 2009, PMID 19590045). Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least 13 unique variants (all missense) have been reported in humans with DCM. Anecdotal cases of autosomal recessive TNNI3-variant mediated DCM exist in the literature (Murphy et al., 2004, PMID 15070570); however, the evidence for this inheritance pattern appears to be weak.   In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by expression studies in vitro functional assays, and studies showing rescue in patient cells (Vallins et al., 1990, PMID 2226790; Carballo et al., 2009, PMID 19590045; Vikhorev et al, 2017, PMID 29093449; Bollen et al., 2017, PMID 28436080). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to establish the relationship of TNNI3 with autosomal dominant DCM definitively. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on June 12, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:668087ea-0d2f-42c2-a291-f73400d34023"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
