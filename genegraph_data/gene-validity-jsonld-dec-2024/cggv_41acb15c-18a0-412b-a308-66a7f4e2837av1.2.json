We recently assigned a locus (RP33) for adRP to 2cen-q12.1, a region that harbors the SNRNP200 gene encoding hBrr2, another U4/U6-U5 snRNP component that is required for unwinding of U4/U6 snRNAs during spliceosome activation and for disassembly of the spliceosome. Here, we report the identification of a missense mutation, c.3260C>T (p.S1087L), in exon 25 of the SNRNP200 gene in an RP33-linked family. The c.3260C>T substitution showed complete cosegregation with the retinitis pigmentosa (RP) phenotype over four generations, but was absent in a panel of 400 controls. The p.S1087L mutation and p.R1090L, another adRP-associated allele, reside in the \"ratchet\" helix of the first of two Sec63 domains implicated in the directionality and processivity of nucleic acid unwinding. Indeed, marked defects in U4/U6 unwinding, but not U4/U6-U5 snRNP assembly, were observed in budding yeast for the analogous mutations (N1104L and R1107L) of the corresponding Brr2p residues. The linkage of hBrr2 to adRP suggests that the mechanism of pathogenesis for splicing-factor-related RP may fundamentally derive from a defect in hBrr2-dependent RNA unwinding and a consequent defect in spliceosome activation.","dc:creator":"Zhao C","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by a mutation in SNRNP200, a gene required for unwinding of U4/U6 snRNAs."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41acb15c-18a0-412b-a308-66a7f4e2837a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41acb15c-18a0-412b-a308-66a7f4e2837a_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.7}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7.5},{"id":"cggv:41acb15c-18a0-412b-a308-66a7f4e2837a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41acb15c-18a0-412b-a308-66a7f4e2837a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6304978f-62af-4d34-80a3-0f4e868eb213","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f38f79ae-fdd5-4d1b-8345-141d49bb79e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Whole mount in situ hybridization in zebra fish revealed a generalized expression of SNRNP200 at two-cell stage, 50%-epiboly, 8-somite stage, 1pdf, and 2pdf.

Retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by nyctalopia (HP:0000662), reduced visual acuity (HP:0007663), rod-cone dystrophy (HP:0000510), attenuation of retinal blood vessels (HP:0007843), pigmentary retinopathy (HP:0000580), macular degeneration (HP:0000608), optic disc pallor (HP:0000543), abnormal (diminished) electroretinogram (HP:0000512), and bone spicule pigmentation of the retina (HP:0007737). To capture the overlapping spectrum of clinical presentations, this gene is curated under the disease entity \"inherited retinal dystrophy\". \nThough total score to reach a definitive classification was achieved by the addition of 27 variants (PMID: 23029027, 26720483, 21618346, 33553197, 33090715, 33598457, 19710410, 33576794, 30543658, 31486839, 26355662, 24516651, 24319334, 25356976, 32037395, 27208204) in this curation, however there is more evidence available in the literature. There are 17 SNRNP200 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants listed on ClinVar (03/02/2022). SNRNP200 RNA was found to be highly expressed in cornea, iris, lens, vitreous body, sclera, retina, and optic nerve of the human cadaver eyes (PMID 33553197) while whole mount in situ hybridization in zebra fish revealed a generalized expression of SNRNP200 at two-cell stage, 50%-epiboly, 8-somite stage, 1pdf, and 2pdf. Furthermore, retinal cryosections showed high expression at the ciliary marginal zone at 3dpf and 5dpf (PMID 33553197). Overexpression of mutant SNRNP200 in knockout zebrafish caused generalized body and retinal defects through dominant negative effect, although in humans with SNRNP200 mutations, no systemic defects have been observed so far (PMID 33553197). \nIn summary, SNRNP200 is definitively associated with SNRNP200-related dominant retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.  \n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:41acb15c-18a0-412b-a308-66a7f4e2837a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
