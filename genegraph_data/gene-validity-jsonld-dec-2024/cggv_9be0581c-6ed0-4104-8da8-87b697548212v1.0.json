The hCx25 RNA is slightly expressed in placenta, and hCx59 and hCx62 RNA are both transcribed in skeletal muscle, although the latter is also slightly expressed in heart. Expression profiles of three orthologous human (h) and mouse (m) connexin gene pairs, i.e., hCx30.2 versus mCx29, hCx40.1 versus mCx39, and hCx62 versus mCx57, differ strongly, in contrast to other orthologous connexins with higher sequence identities. Thus, several of the new human connexin genes appear to have evolved to different expression patterns and presumably to different functions compared to their orthologues in the mouse genome.

In the adult human ventricle, CX43 was expressed at the epicardial aspect. Expression of Cx43 progressively increased to give the uniformly prominent label across the ventricular wall typical of the 6-week postpartum animal. In the atria, Cx43 predominated throughout the mouse developmental stages. The human foetal atria showed similar profile, with one exception--that Cx43 signal at the 9/40 stage was found at very low levels.

Here we compare the patterns of connexin expression in the heart during the development of the mouse (from embryonic day 12.5 to 6 weeks postpartum) and the human (at 9 weeks gestation and adult stage). The extent of connexin43 expression in the ventricles progressively increased during development of the mouse heart. The developmental pattern of expression for connexins 40 and 45 in the mouse heart was similar, but not identical, and in the ventricles showed a progressive and preferential expression in the conduction system.

This gene-disease relationship in the literature reports both autosomal dominant and recessive cases and showed varying mechanisms of pathogenicity, so the mode of inheritance is currently undetermined. Three unique variants (missense) reported in three individuals with CHD (1 homozygous, 2 heterozygous) are included in this curation (PMID: 15978203, 19615768). There are more variants reported in other publications, however they were not included due to either unclear phenotype, high minor allele frequency (>0.00001) on gnomAD v.4, or unclear mode of inheritance with multiple variants reported in the proband (PMID: 7715640, 11470490, 19615768, 28991257, 32368696, 31564432, 31019026, 34670123). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data in both mouse and human cardiac tissues (PMIDs: 12064615, 12881038). One mouse study showed that both heterozygous and homozygous *GJA1* knock-in mice were long term viable with no heart defects (PMID: 22135478). Conversely, there are also several mouse studies showing heart defects in mice mutants, however none were scored due to inconsistent mechanisms of pathogenicity (PMIDs: 7892609, 9640330, 9486664, 9118799). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *GJA1* and congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, the contradictory evidence does not significantly outweigh the evidence that supports the gene-disease relationship either.
