Although the latter by far outnumber the former, the vast majority of mitochondrial translation defects in humans have been associated with mutations in RNA-encoding mtDNA genes, whereas mutations in protein-encoding nuclear genes have been identified in a handful of cases. Genetic investigation involving patients with defective mitochondrial translation led us to the discovery of novel mutations in the mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (EFG1) in one affected baby and, for the first time, in the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EFTu) in another one. Both patients were affected by severe lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The EFG1-mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the EFTu-mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with micropolygyria. Structural modeling enabled us to make predictions about the effects of the mutations at the molecular level. Yeast and mammalian cell systems proved the pathogenic role of the mutant alleles by functional complementation in vivo. Nuclear-gene abnormalities causing mitochondrial translation defects represent a new, potentially broad field of mitochondrial medicine. Investigation of these defects is important to expand the molecular characterization of mitochondrial disorders and also may contribute to the elucidation of the complex control mechanisms, which regulate this fundamental pathway of mtDNA homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Valente L","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Infantile encephalopathy and defective mitochondrial DNA translation in patients with mutations of mitochondrial elongation factors EFG1 and EFTu."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da1707cf-80cd-4669-be96-b273ac96b8b4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa2df672-f47a-44cd-8aa8-dd53cc9a451e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa2df672-f47a-44cd-8aa8-dd53cc9a451e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":20,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:cb87199c-016d-4a42-bfca-bfc6bf856f7d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003321.5(TUFM):c.440T>A (p.Leu147His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16042229"}},{"id":"cggv:430d036c-f912-4291-bc46-766ff1c24c95","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003321.5(TUFM):c.162del (p.Tyr54Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16042230"}}],"detectionMethod":"mtDNA and WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosis: lethal infantile mitochondrial disorder \nIUGR, premature birth, respiratory failure, hypotonia, lactic acidosis\nAlso an affected sibling with lactic acidosis, apnea and died at 8 days \nBiochemical testing: combined complex deficiencies\n\n","secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:25dee7cf-2f67-42c1-97bb-2b5693ebdb4d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cb87199c-016d-4a42-bfca-bfc6bf856f7d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26741492","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial disorders have the highest incidence among congenital metabolic disorders characterized by biochemical respiratory chain complex deficiencies.

Mutations in about 1,500 nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins may cause mitochondrial dysfunction of energy production and mitochondrial disorders. More than 250 genes that cause mitochondrial disorders have been reported to date. However exact genetic diagnosis for patients still remained largely unknown. To reveal this heterogeneity, we performed comprehensive genomic analyses for 142 patients with childhood-onset mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies. The approach includes whole mtDNA and exome analyses using high-throughput sequencing, and chromosomal aberration analyses using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We identified 37 novel mutations in known mitochondrial disease genes and 3 mitochondria-related genes (MRPS23, QRSL1, and PNPLA4) as novel causative genes. We also identified 2 genes known to cause monogenic diseases (MECP2 and TNNI3) and 3 chromosomal aberrations (6q24.3-q25.1, 17p12, and 22q11.21) as causes in this cohort. Our approaches enhance the ability to identify pathogenic gene mutations in patients with biochemically defined mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies in clinical settings.

The *TUFM* gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Tu, an enzyme that facilitates translation elongation by GTP-mediated binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosomal A site, where codon recognition occurs during mitochondrial translation protein synthesis.  \n\n*TUFM* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2007 (PMID: 17160893). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TUFM*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TUFM* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes five variants in five probands across four publications (PMIDs: 17160893, 26741492, 28132884, 30903008). Affected individuals have clinical features falling in a spectrum, with those more severely affecting having early infantile-onset encephalopathy, brain anomalies, lactic acidosis, and risk of early death and others dilated cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis without encephalopathy. Clinical features seen in affected individuals include Leigh syndrome spectrum disorders, lactic acidosis, dysplastic leukoencephalopathy, intrauterine growth restriction, hypertonia, spasticity, microcephaly, dilated cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure. Dysmorphic features have also been noted (epicanthus, low-set ears, flat nasal bridge, high, arched palate, small hands and feet). Brain imaging showed diffuse cystic leukodystrophy, micropolygyria, and diffuse signal abnormality of the white matter in the centra semiovalia, putamina, and nuclei pallidi. Lab abnormalities include elevated lactate, pyruvate, ketones, transaminases, and ammonia. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies (complexes I and IV) are reported.\n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and functional alteration studies in non-patient cells showing impaired binding to aminoacylated mitochondrial tRNAs and impaired mitochondrial translation (PMIDs: 19524667, 33340416).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *TUFM* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 2, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:da1707cf-80cd-4669-be96-b273ac96b8b4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
