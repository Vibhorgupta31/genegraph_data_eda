In this study we screened all the three members of the MuRF family, MuRF1, MuRF2 and MuRF3, in 594 unrelated HCM patients and 307 healthy controls by targeted resequencing.

The prevalence of rare variants in both MuRF1 and MuRF2 in HCM patients was higher than that in control subjects (MuRF1 13/594 (2.2%) vs. 1/307 (0.3%), p = 0.04; MuRF2 22/594 (3.7%) vs. 2/307 (0.7%); p = 0.007).

MuRF1 reduced steady-state troponin I levels when coexpressed in COS-7 cells and increased degradation of endogenous troponin I protein in cardiomyocytes. The degradation of troponin I in cardiomyocytes was associated with the accumulation of ubiquitylated intermediates of troponin I and was proteasome-dependent. In vitro, MuRF1 functioned as a ubiquitin ligase to catalyze ubiquitylation of troponin I through a RING finger-dependent mechanism.

MURF-1 has been suggested to act as an ubiquitin ligase, thereby controlling proteasome-dependent degradation of muscle proteins. Here, we performed yeast two-hybrid (YTH) screens of skeletal muscle cDNA libraries with MURF-1 baits to identify potential myocellular targets of MURF-1-dependent ubiquitination. This identified eight myofibrillar proteins as binding partners of MURF-1: titin, nebulin, the nebulin-related protein NRAP, troponin-I (TnI), troponin-T (TnT), myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2), myotilin and T-cap. YTH mating studies with MURF-1,2,3 baits indicated that these eight myofibrillar proteins are all targeted redundantly by both MURF-1 and MURF-2. Western blot studies on cardiac tissues from wild-type and MURF-1-deficient mice suggested that titin and nebulin were ubiquitinated at similar levels, and MLC-2 and TnI at reduced levels in MURF-1 KO mice. Mapping of the TnI and titin binding sites on MURF-1 peptide scans demonstrated their binding to motifs highly conserved between MURF-1 and MURF-2. Our data are consistent with a model in which MURF-1 and MURF-2 together target a specific set of myofibrillar proteins redundantly, most likely to control their ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Finally, our YTH screens identified the interaction of MURF-1 with 11 enzymes required for ATP/energy production in muscle including the mitochondrial ATP synthase and cytoplasmic creatine kinase.

MURF1 interacts with receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1) and colocalizes with RACK1 after activation with phenylephrine or PMA. Coincident with this agonist-stimulated interaction, MURF1 blocks PKCepsilon translocation to focal adhesions, which is a critical event in the hypertrophic signaling cascade. MURF1 inhibits focal adhesion formation, and the activity of downstream effector ERK1/2 is also inhibited in the presence of MURF1. MURF1 inhibits phenylephrine-induced (but not IGF-1-induced) increases in cell size.

TRIM63 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2012 (Chen et al, 2012, PMID 22821932) and has been reported in no subsequent clinical reports, though evidence for autosomal recessive disease is emerging. The split curation for autosomal recessive inheritance has been curated separately. Chen et al. reported 3 variants in 5 probands, including 2 missense variants in 3 probands, and one truncating variant (p.Q247X) in 2 probands without segregation. The p.Q247X variant has an allele frequency of 0.0007 (0.008 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population), considered too high for AD inheritance. All 3 variants have limited functional evidence for disease causation. A case control study utilizing aggregate variant analysis reported rare variants in TRIM63 at a higher frequency in cases compared to controls (Su et al, 2014, PMID 24865491). A second case control study (Walsh et al, 2017, PMID 27532257) found no enrichment of rare variants in cases vs. controls. Notably, multiple reports of AR inheritance have demonstrated no disease in heterozygote relatives (Olive et al, 2015, PMID 25801283, Andreeva et al, 2022, PMID 35273634, Salazar-Mendiguchia et al, 2020, PMID 32451364).

The original curation was published on December 20th, 2016 with a classification of Limited. At the time of this re-curation, no new genetic level evidence has emerged to support the disease mode of inheritance. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between TRIM63 and autosomal dominant HCM has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role TRIM63 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 27th, 2022.\nMove to change classification from Limited to Disputed due to the lack of replication over time and the emergence of evidence that disputes the suggested mode of inheritance.
