These ISC proteins are responsible for essential functions such as glycine cleavage and the formation of lipoic acid, an essential cofactor of respiratory chain complexes. Defects in ISC biogenesis lead to multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes including: ISCA2 with infantile onset leukodystrophy. Recently, a founder mutation, c.229G > A, p.Gly77Ser in ISCA2 was reported to cause Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunction Syndrome type 4. In a retrospective review of children diagnosed with the ISCA2 defect, we were able to identify ten new patients who were not reported previously with the identical founder mutation. High CSF glycine levels and elevated glycine peaks on MR spectroscopy were demonstrated in all tested probands. All patients were between 3 and 7 months of age with a triad of neurodevelopmental regression, nystagmus and optic atrophy and leukodystrophy. MRI findings were typical in the patients with diffuse, abnormal white matter signal in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. The patients ended up in a vegetative state, and often premature death due to respiratory infections. We alert clinicians to consider the ISCA2 defect as a differential diagnosis of infantile onset leukodystrophies affecting the brain as well as the spinal cord, especially in the presence of elevated CSF glycine or elevated glycine peaks in MR spectroscopy.","dc:creator":"Alfadhel M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Further delineation of the phenotypic spectrum of ISCA2 defect: A report of ten new cases."}},"rdfs:label":"Alfadhel_4"},{"id":"cggv:93797eb9-7f8e-41ac-b3a3-c97b53e75b53","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93797eb9-7f8e-41ac-b3a3-c97b53e75b53_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:706fbc5f-0540-4dd5-a35f-90cb8413ca81_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:706fbc5f-0540-4dd5-a35f-90cb8413ca81","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c4d095a2-c0a3-4345-8344-0f589f62498c"},"phenotypeFreeText":"This is a girl (Saudi Arabian) with leukodystrophy.\n","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9bba2f02-08e1-470b-ac69-0459895a611a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c4d095a2-c0a3-4345-8344-0f589f62498c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29297947","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are essential cofactors for proteins that participate in fundamental cellular processes including metabolism, DNA replication and repair, transcriptional regulation, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).

We present two additional unrelated cases, and provide a more complete clinical description that includes hyperglycinemia, leukodystrophy of the brainstem with longitudinally extensive spinal cord involvement, and mtDNA deficiency. Additionally, we characterize the role of ISCA2 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and Fe-S cluster assembly using subject cells and ISCA2 cellular knockdown models. Loss of ISCA2 diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, the mitochondrial network, basal and maximal respiration, ATP production, and activity of ETC complexes II and IV. We specifically tested the impact of loss of ISCA2 on 2Fe-2S proteins versus 4Fe-4S proteins and observed deficits in the functioning of 4Fe-4S but not 2Fe-2S proteins. Together these data indicate loss of ISCA2 impaired function of 4Fe-4S proteins resulting in a fatal encephalopathy accompanied by a relatively unusual combination of features including mtDNA depletion alongside complex II deficiency and hyperglycinemia that may facilitate diagnosis of ISCA2 deficiency patients.","dc:creator":"Alaimo JT","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Loss-of-function mutations in ISCA2 disrupt 4Fe-4S cluster machinery and cause a fatal leukodystrophy with hyperglycinemia and mtDNA depletion."}},"rdfs:label":"Alaimo_S2"},{"id":"cggv:9bba2f02-08e1-470b-ac69-0459895a611a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9bba2f02-08e1-470b-ac69-0459895a611a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:978bd430-cdfe-4479-9973-a76a09de988f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:978bd430-cdfe-4479-9973-a76a09de988f","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6f8cbbae-1746-4d2b-98ae-7ab41dc8a667","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_194279.4(ISCA2):c.355G>A (p.Ala119Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA390380156"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"This is an Iranian boy.

De novo LA biosynthesis is dependent on LIAS activity together with LIPT1 and LIPT2. LIAS is an iron‑sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing mitochondrial protein, like mitochondrial aconitase (mt-aco) and some subunits of respiratory chain (RC) complexes I, II and III. All of them harbor at least one [Fe-S] cluster and their activity is dependent on the mitochondrial [Fe-S] cluster (ISC) assembly machinery. Disorders in the ISC machinery affect numerous Fe-S proteins and lead to a heterogeneous group of diseases with a wide variety of clinical symptoms and combined enzymatic defects. Here, we present the biochemical profiles of several key mitochondrial [Fe-S]-containing proteins in fibroblasts from 13 patients carrying mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in either the lipoic acid (LIPT1 and LIPT2) or mitochondrial ISC biogenesis (FDX1L, ISCA2, IBA57, NFU1, BOLA3) pathway. Ten of them are new patients described for the first time. We confirm that the fibroblast is a good cellular model to study these deficiencies, except for patients presenting mutations in FDX1L and a muscular clinical phenotype. We find that oxidative phosphorylation can be affected by LA defects in LIPT1 and LIPT2 patients due to excessive oxidative stress or to another mechanism connecting LA and respiratory chain activity. We confirm that NFU1, BOLA3, ISCA2 and IBA57 operate in the maturation of [4Fe-4S] clusters and not in [2Fe-2S] protein maturation. Our work suggests a functional difference between IBA57 and other proteins involved in maturation of [Fe-S] proteins. IBA57 seems to require BOLA3, NFU1 and ISCA2 for its stability and NFU1 requires BOLA3.

MRI demonstrates a demyelinating leukodystrophy. We describe an eleven-year-old boy with a milder phenotype of ISCA2 related disorder manifesting as: normal early development, acute infantile neurologic deterioration leading to stable spastic quadriparesis, optic atrophy and mild cognitive impairment. The first MRI demonstrated a diffuse demyelinating leukodystrophy. A sequential MRI revealed white matter rarefaction with well-delineated cysts. The patient harbors two novel bi-allelic variants (p.Ala2Asp and p.Pro138Arg) in ISCA2 inherited from heterozygous carrier parents. This report expands the clinical spectrum of ISCA2-related disorders to include a milder phenotype with a longer life span and better psychomotor function and cavitating leukodystrophy on MRI.

homoallelic missense founder mutation of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly 2 (ISCA2) gene has been recently reported in six cases affected by an autosomal recessive infantile neurodegenerative mitochondrial disorder. We documented a case of a 2-month-old girl presenting with severe hypotonia and nystagmus, who rapidly deteriorated and died at the age of three months. Increased cerebral spinal fluid level of lactate, documented also at the brain spectroscopy, involvement of the cortex, restricted diffusion of white and gray matter abnormalities, sparing of the corpus callosum and extensive involvement of the spinal cord were observed. Her clinical presenting features and course as well as some neuroradiological findings mimicked those of early-onset leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and high brain lactate (LBSL). The analysis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain function showed a reduced activity of complexes II and IV. The girl harboured two heterozygous mutations in the ISCA2 gene. A comprehensive review of the literature and a comparison with the cases of early onset LBSL enabled us to highlight significant differences in the clinical, biochemical and neuroradiological phenotype between the two conditions, which also emerged from the comparison with the other 6 reported cases of ISCA2 gene mutation previously reported. In summary, this represents the second report ever published associating ISCA2 gene mutation with a mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy, with a different genetic mechanism to the previous cases. Molecular analysis of ISCA2 should be included in the genetic panel for the diagnosis of early onset mitochondrial leukoencephalopathies.","dc:creator":"Toldo I","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Neonatal mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy with brain and spinal involvement and high lactate: expanding the phenotype of ISCA2 gene mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:986122cb-f48e-4928-9651-d9a5b44f81bb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:08c433b3-5048-4b33-bde1-fced88611e7f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29359243"}],"rdfs:label":"Toldo_Case"},{"id":"cggv:64313acd-ff7a-4e92-a2e1-3bfea6d6d822","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64313acd-ff7a-4e92-a2e1-3bfea6d6d822_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:64313acd-ff7a-4e92-a2e1-3bfea6d6d822_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.25 (biochemistry)"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"0.25 (biochemistry)"},{"id":"cggv:986122cb-f48e-4928-9651-d9a5b44f81bb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:986122cb-f48e-4928-9651-d9a5b44f81bb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:986122cb-f48e-4928-9651-d9a5b44f81bb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"1 (predicted to escape NMD) + 0.25 (biochemistry)\n"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"1 (predicted to escape NMD) + 0.25 (biochemistry)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9.9},{"id":"cggv:ac2a091c-b7da-4268-b2f4-0fbf9231a5fb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac2a091c-b7da-4268-b2f4-0fbf9231a5fb_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5e943e4-2f5b-4310-b2b0-6736b7ff41ff","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0942ff87-c721-42b0-85b0-23eb8608f901","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Fe-S cluster biogenesis","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33340416","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Several initiatives at establishing a classification of inherited metabolic disorders have been published previously, some focusing on pathomechanisms, others on clinical manifestations, while yet another attempted a simplified approach of a comprehensive nosology. Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Fe-S cluster biogenesis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"There are 6-9 gene products with shared biochemical function."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ac2a091c-b7da-4268-b2f4-0fbf9231a5fb_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6784ae5-ea69-4400-a6c1-89939d934520","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2043f40-87e4-4b3d-b72c-3173702b70c0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"There were decreased activities/amount of MRC complexes and lipoic-acid bound proteins.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29297947","rdfs:label":"Alaimo_Functional alteration (non-patient cells)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"There were decreased activities/amount of MRC complexes and lipoic-acid bound proteins."},{"id":"cggv:88453451-eae4-4914-a9e2-76ae4194deb8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa95e816-30cc-410a-a543-a18d8144ffe6","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"There was altered mitochondrial morphology (swollen, enlarged mitochondria devoid of cristae membranes) and decreased activities of [4Fe-4S] mitochondrial proteins.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22323289","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Members of the bacterial and mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery include the so-called A-type ISC proteins, which support the assembly of a subset of Fe/S apoproteins. The human genome encodes two A-type proteins, termed ISCA1 and ISCA2, which are related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Isa1 and Isa2, respectively. An additional protein, Iba57, physically interacts with Isa1 and Isa2 in yeast. To test the cellular role of human ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57, HeLa cells were depleted for any of these proteins by RNA interference technology. Depleted cells contained massively swollen and enlarged mitochondria that were virtually devoid of cristae membranes, demonstrating the importance of these proteins for mitochondrial biogenesis. The activities of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, including aconitase, respiratory complex I, and lipoic acid synthase, were diminished following depletion of the three proteins. In contrast, the mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] enzyme ferrochelatase and cellular heme content were unaffected. We further provide evidence against a localization and direct Fe/S protein maturation function of ISCA1 and ISCA2 in the cytosol. Taken together, our data suggest that ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57 are specifically involved in the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins functioning late in the ISC assembly pathway.","dc:creator":"Sheftel AD","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"The human mitochondrial ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57 proteins are required for [4Fe-4S] protein maturation."},"rdfs:label":"Sheftel_Functional alteration (non-patient cells)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"There was altered mitochondrial morphology (swollen, enlarged mitochondria devoid of cristae membranes) and decreased activities of [4Fe-4S] mitochondrial proteins."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7541,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":13.4,"subject":{"id":"cggv:fc06d960-dc75-4cb6-b201-9c706b53d1f5","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:19857","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *ISCA2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 21, 2023. *ISCA2* encodes the protein iron-sulfur cluster assembly 2 that, along with *ISCA1* and *IBA57*, is part of the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery in mitochondria functioning late (maturation) in the biosynthetic pathway of mitochondrial 4Fe-4S proteins.\n\n*ISCA2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2015 (PMID: 25539947), in several individuals with infantile-onset neurodegeneration and severe leukodystrophy.  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *ISCA2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *ISCA2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique variants (seven missense, one frameshift) identified in twenty-one probands from eight publications (PMIDs: 25539947, 25558065, 28803783, 29297947, 29122497, 29359243, 31279336, 32424628). One of the seven missense variants was a founder variant, c.229G>A (p.Gly77Ser; NM_194279.4) that was seen in the homozygous state in 16 probands of Saudi Arabian descent. Affected individuals commonly present in the infantile period with regression, nystagmus/optic atrophy, and white matter involvement, and most reported individuals died in early childhood. There is one report of a more mildly affected individual with spastic paraplegia (PMID: 28803783). Muscle biopsies in affected individuals were variable, including variable mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities. Brain imaging generally showed diffuse bilateral symmetric signal abnormality in cerebral white matter with variable involvement of other parts of the brain. Metabolic labs showed variable elevated blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate and glycine.\n  \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function (PMID: 33340416) and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 29297947, 22323289). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ISCA2* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
