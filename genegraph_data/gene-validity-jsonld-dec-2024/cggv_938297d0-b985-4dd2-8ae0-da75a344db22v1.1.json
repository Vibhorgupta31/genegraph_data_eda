Here, we describe eight probands with a DEE phenotype comprising intellectual disability, epilepsy, and hypotonia. Exome trio analysis showed de novo variants in TRPM3, encoding a brain-expressed transient receptor potential channel, in each. Seven probands were identically heterozygous for a recurrent substitution, p.(Val837Met), in TRPM3's S4-S5 linker region, a conserved domain proposed to undergo conformational change during gated channel opening. The eighth individual was heterozygous for a proline substitution, p.(Pro937Gln), at the boundary between TRPM3's flexible pore-forming loop and an adjacent alpha-helix. General-population truncating variants and microdeletions occur throughout TRPM3, suggesting a pathomechanism other than simple haploinsufficiency. We conclude that de novo variants in TRPM3 are a cause of intellectual disability and epilepsy.","dc:creator":"Dyment DA","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"De novo substitutions of TRPM3 cause intellectual disability and epilepsy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:938297d0-b985-4dd2-8ae0-da75a344db22_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:938297d0-b985-4dd2-8ae0-da75a344db22_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8419,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ad98b776-1824-43e3-8908-487f22fad458","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0800439","gene":"hgnc:17992","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*TRPM3* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant intellectual disability and epilepsy in 2019 (Dyment et al., PMID: 31278393). Phenotypic features include congenital hypotonia, global developmental delays, variable intellectual disability, ophthalmologic findings including strabismus and nystagmus, musculoskeletal findings including hip dysplasia, scoliosis, and club foot, variable seizure and epilepsy classifications, MRI abnormalities, and distinctive  dysmorphic features. This curation includes 12 heterozygous missense variants reported in 12 probands with phenotypic similarity (PMIDs: 31278393, 34074259, 36648066, 37684057). Of these 12 heterozygous missense variants, 9 have functional data to support a gain of function effect. All distinct variants available in the literature are scored. Additional probands are reported in the literature, but all harbor variants already included in the curation. As the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached, those individuals were not included in this curation.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *TRPM3* and autosomal dominant syndromic complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date May 23, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:938297d0-b985-4dd2-8ae0-da75a344db22"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
