These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.

To date, PTPN11, RAF1, and BRAF have been reported to be causal for NSML. We report on a 13-year-old Japanese boy, who was diagnosed with NSML. He was found to have a novel heterozygous missense variant (c.305A > G; p.E102G) in MAP2K1, a gene mostly causal for cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS). He manifested fetal macrosomia, and showed hypotonia and poor sucking in the neonatal period. He had mild developmental delay, and multiple lentigines appearing at approximately age 3 years, as well as flexion deformity of knees bilaterally, subtle facial characteristics including ocular hypertelorism, sensorineural hearing loss, and precocious puberty. He lacked congenital heart defects or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, frequently observed in patients with NSML, mostly caused by PTPN11 mutations. He also lacked congenital heart defects, characteristic facial features, or intellectual disability, frequently observed in those with CFCS caused by MAP2K1 or MAP2K2 mutations.
