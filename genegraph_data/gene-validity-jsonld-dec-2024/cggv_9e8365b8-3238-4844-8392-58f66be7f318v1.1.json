We describe a new PAM in a patient with proximal muscle weakness and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whose muscle fibres contained inclusions containing myosin and myosin-associated proteins, and aberrant distribution of microtubules. These lesions appear as intact A- and M-bands lacking thin filaments and Z-discs. These features differ from inclusions in myosin storage myopathy (MSM), but are highly similar to those in mice deficient for the muscle-specific RING finger proteins MuRF1 and MuRF3. Sanger sequencing excluded mutations in the MSM-associated gene MYH7 but identified mutations in TRIM63 and TRIM54, encoding MuRF1 and MuRF3, respectively. No mutations in other potentially disease-causing genes were identified by Sanger and whole exome sequencing. Analysis of seven family members revealed that both mutations segregated in the family but only the homozygous TRIM63 null mutation in combination with the heterozygous TRIM54 mutation found in the proband caused the disease phenotype. Both MuRFs are microtubule-associated proteins localizing to sarcomeric M-bands and Z-discs. They are E3 ubiquitin ligases that play a role in degradation of sarcomeric proteins, stabilization of microtubules and myogenesis. Lack of ubiquitin and the 20S proteasome subunit in the inclusions found in the patient suggested impaired turnover of thick filament proteins. Disruption of microtubules in cultured myotubes was rescued by transient expression of wild-type MuRF1. The unique features of this novel myopathy point to defects in homeostasis of A-band proteins in combination with instability of microtubules as cause of the disease.

MURF-1 has been suggested to act as an ubiquitin ligase, thereby controlling proteasome-dependent degradation of muscle proteins. Here, we performed yeast two-hybrid (YTH) screens of skeletal muscle cDNA libraries with MURF-1 baits to identify potential myocellular targets of MURF-1-dependent ubiquitination. This identified eight myofibrillar proteins as binding partners of MURF-1: titin, nebulin, the nebulin-related protein NRAP, troponin-I (TnI), troponin-T (TnT), myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2), myotilin and T-cap. YTH mating studies with MURF-1,2,3 baits indicated that these eight myofibrillar proteins are all targeted redundantly by both MURF-1 and MURF-2. Western blot studies on cardiac tissues from wild-type and MURF-1-deficient mice suggested that titin and nebulin were ubiquitinated at similar levels, and MLC-2 and TnI at reduced levels in MURF-1 KO mice. Mapping of the TnI and titin binding sites on MURF-1 peptide scans demonstrated their binding to motifs highly conserved between MURF-1 and MURF-2. Our data are consistent with a model in which MURF-1 and MURF-2 together target a specific set of myofibrillar proteins redundantly, most likely to control their ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Finally, our YTH screens identified the interaction of MURF-1 with 11 enzymes required for ATP/energy production in muscle including the mitochondrial ATP synthase and cytoplasmic creatine kinase. These data raise the possibility that MURF-1 may coordinately regulate the energy metabolism of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic compartments.","dc:creator":"Witt SH","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"MURF-1 and MURF-2 target a specific subset of myofibrillar proteins redundantly: towards understanding MURF-dependent muscle ubiquitination."},"rdfs:label":"Interaction of MuRF1 and TNNT2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Already reached max points for function "},{"id":"cggv:098cfc17-6ca0-40f0-a07b-58329daa8a6a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5e12774a-cb52-4847-ac32-8078fae09a3e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"TNNI3 has a definitive association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, based on the ClinGen clinical validity framework.\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15601779","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Muscle-specific RING finger protein 1 (MuRF1) is a sarcomere-associated protein that is restricted to cardiac and skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, MuRF1 is up-regulated by conditions that provoke atrophy, but its function in the heart is not known. The presence of a RING finger in MuRF1 raises the possibility that it is a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system of protein degradation. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for interaction partners of MuRF1 in the heart that might be targets of its putative ubiquitin ligase activity. This screen identified troponin I as a MuRF1 partner protein. MuRF1 and troponin I were found to associate both in vitro and in vivo in cultured cardiomyocytes. MuRF1 reduced steady-state troponin I levels when coexpressed in COS-7 cells and increased degradation of endogenous troponin I protein in cardiomyocytes. The degradation of troponin I in cardiomyocytes was associated with the accumulation of ubiquitylated intermediates of troponin I and was proteasome-dependent. In vitro, MuRF1 functioned as a ubiquitin ligase to catalyze ubiquitylation of troponin I through a RING finger-dependent mechanism. In isolated cardiomyocytes, MuRF1 reduced indices of contractility.

MURF1 interacts with receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1) and colocalizes with RACK1 after activation with phenylephrine or PMA. Coincident with this agonist-stimulated interaction, MURF1 blocks PKCepsilon translocation to focal adhesions, which is a critical event in the hypertrophic signaling cascade. MURF1 inhibits focal adhesion formation, and the activity of downstream effector ERK1/2 is also inhibited in the presence of MURF1. MURF1 inhibits phenylephrine-induced (but not IGF-1-induced) increases in cell size. These findings establish that MURF1 is a key regulator of the PKC-dependent hypertrophic response and can blunt cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which may have important implications in the pathophysiology of clinical cardiac hypertrophy.","dc:creator":"Arya R","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Muscle ring finger protein-1 inhibits PKC{epsilon} activation and prevents cardiomyocyte hypertrophy."},"rdfs:label":"MuRF1 relationship to hypertrophic response "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Scored 0 points as max scoring for functional evidence has already been reached.

We show that muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and MuRF3 act as E3 ubiquitin ligases that cooperate with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a, -b, and -c to mediate the degradation of beta/slow myosin heavy chain (beta/slow MHC) and MHCIIa via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in vivo and in vitro. Accordingly, mice deficient for MuRF1 and MuRF3 develop a skeletal muscle myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characterized by subsarcolemmal MHC accumulation, myofiber fragmentation, and diminished muscle performance.

The *TRIM63* gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which targets cellular proteins, including sarcomeric proteins, for degradation. *TRIM63* has been associated with autosomal recessive (AR) HCM in 32 probands across 5 publications; the Q247X variant is a recurrent variant reported in 11 of these 32 probands in either a homozygous or compound heterozygous state (Olivé et al, 2015, PMID 25801283; Jokela et al, 2019, PMID 30372688; Salazar-Mendiguchía J et al, 2020, PMID 32451364; Andreeva et al, 2022, PMID 35273634; Allouba M, et al., 2023, PMID: 37431535); however, the Q247X variant has limited functional evidence for disease causation. Case-control evidence showed enrichment of biallelic TRIM63 variants in cases compared to controls, but this study did not calculate or report statistical significance (Salazar-Mendiguchía J et al, 2020, PMID 32451364). Importantly, there have been at least 2 reports of co-occurring HCM and skeletal myopathy in the presence of biallelic *TRIM63* variants (Olivé et al, 2015, PMID 25801283; Jokela et al, 2019, PMID 30372688). One of the described probands was also found to have a heterozygous TRIM54 variant. This raises the possibility of a broader phenotype including skeletal myopathy, but more evidence is needed. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies (Bodine et al, 2001, PMID 11679633; Fagerberg et al, 2014, PMID 24309898), protein interaction with TNNI3, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and MYH7 (Kedar et al, 2004, PMID 15601779, Mearini et al, 2010, PMID 19850579, Witt et al, 2005, PMID 15967462, Fielitz et al, 2007, PMID 17786241), biochemical function (Kedar et al, 2004, PMID 15601779, Mearini et al, 2010, PMID 19850579, Arya et al, 2004, PMID 15596539), and a model system (Willis et al, 2007, PMID 17272810). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between TRIM63 and autosomal recessive HCM is moderate.
