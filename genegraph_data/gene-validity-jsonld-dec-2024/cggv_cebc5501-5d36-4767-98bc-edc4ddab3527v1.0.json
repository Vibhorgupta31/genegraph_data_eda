The lack of a functional Coq9 protein in homozygous Coq9 mutant (Coq9(X/X)) mice causes a severe reduction in the Coq7 protein and, as consequence, a widespread CoQ deficiency and accumulation of demethoxyubiquinone. The deficit in CoQ induces a brain-specific impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics performance, a reduction in respiratory control ratio, ATP levels and ATP/ADP ratio and specific loss of respiratory complex I. These effects lead to neuronal death and demyelinization with severe vacuolization and astrogliosis in the brain of Coq9(X/X) mice that consequently die between 3 and 6 months of age.

In 2009 the first patient with mutations in COQ9 was reported in an infant with a neonatal-onset, primary CoQ10 deficiency with multi-system disease. Here we describe four siblings with a previously undiagnosed lethal disorder characterized by oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction, variable cardiomyopathy, anemia, and renal anomalies. The first and third pregnancy resulted in live born babies with abnormal tone who developed severe, treatment unresponsive lactic acidosis after birth and died hours later. Autopsy on one of the siblings demonstrated brain changes suggestive of the subacute necrotizing encephalopathy of Leigh disease. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed the siblings shared compound heterozygous mutations in the COQ9 gene with both variants predicted to affect splicing. RT-PCR on RNA from patient fibroblasts revealed that the c.521 + 2 T > C variant resulted in splicing out of exons 4-5 and the c.711 + 3G > C variant spliced out exon 6, resulting in undetectable levels of COQ9 protein in patient fibroblasts. The biochemical profile of patient fibroblasts demonstrated a drastic reduction in CoQ10 levels. An additional peak on the chromatogram may represent accumulation of demethoxy coenzyme Q (DMQ), which was shown previously to accumulate as a result of a defect in COQ9.

The COQ9 gene encodes an enzyme critical for the synthesis of coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 is critical for many processes in the cell, including in the mitochondrial respiratory chain transferring electrons from complexes I and II to complex III.\n\nThe COQ9 gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2018 (PMID: 29560582). There was another case reported with brain ultrasound findings reported by the authors to be consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum; however this expert panel considered that there are too many confounding factors in ultrasonography to confirm the presence of brain lesions consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 29560582). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 19375058, 25613900, 20495179, 25802402, 23255162).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although the total score (8) falls in the moderate range, only one case with Leigh syndrome spectrum has been reported, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
