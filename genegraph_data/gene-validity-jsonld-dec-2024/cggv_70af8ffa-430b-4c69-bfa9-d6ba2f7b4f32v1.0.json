Multitissue Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from 16 different tissues were hybridized with a radiolabeled MCD-specific probe (Fig.7). A 2.3-kilobase MCDtranscript was detected in all tissues examined. The abundance of the MCD mRNA varied, with extremely strong expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The levels of MCD mRNA were much lower in liver, kidney, and pancreas, and low but detectable in all other tissues.

Although defects in MCD activity are associated with malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, a lethal disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy and developmental delay, the metabolic role of this enzyme in mammals is unknown. A computer-based search for novel peroxisomal proteins led to the identification of a candidate gene for human MCD, which encodes a protein with a canonical type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal of serine-lysine-leucine(COOH). We observed that recombinant MCD protein has high intrinsic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity and that a malonyl-CoA decarboxylase-deficient patient has a severe mutation in the MCD gene (c.947-948delTT), confirming that this gene encodes human MCD. Subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that MCD resides in both the cytoplasm and peroxisomes. Cytoplasmic MCD is positioned to play a role in the regulation of cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA abundance and, thus, of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and oxidation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that malonyl-CoA decarboxylase-deficient patients display a number of phenotypes that are reminiscent of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from our observation that MCD mRNA is most abundant in cardiac and skeletal muscles, tissues in which cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and which derive significant amounts of energy from fatty acid oxidation. As for the role of peroxisomal MCD, we propose that this enzyme may be involved in degrading intraperoxisomal malonyl-CoA, which is generated by the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of odd chain-length dicarboxylic fatty acids.","dc:creator":"Sacksteder KA","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"MCD encodes peroxisomal and cytoplasmic forms of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and is mutated in malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Malonyl-CoA Decarboxylase Is Highly Expressed in Muscle"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:405502f1-07fb-45ca-8875-9eab66241183","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:88a05c40-b819-4807-8bb4-069eb2f054c5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Malonyl CoA decarboxylase catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide.
