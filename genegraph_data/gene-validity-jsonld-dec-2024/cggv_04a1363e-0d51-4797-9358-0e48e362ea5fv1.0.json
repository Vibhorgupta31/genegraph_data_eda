The human molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (HMCS) gene, the human ma-l homologue, is therefore a candidate gene responsible for classical xanthinuria type II, which involves both XDH and AO deficiencies. However, HMCS has not been identified as yet. In this study, we cloned the HMCS gene from a cDNA library prepared from liver. In two independent patients with classical xanthinuria type II, we identified a C to T base substitution at nucleotide 1255 in the HMCS gene that should cause a CGA (Arg) to TGA (Ter) nonsense substitution at codon 419. A classical xanthinuria type I patient and healthy volunteers lacked this mutation. These results indicate that a functional defect of the HMCS gene is responsible for classical xanthinuria type II, and that HMCS protein functions to provide a sulfur atom for the molybdenum cofactor of XDH and AO.","dc:creator":"Ichida K","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutation of human molybdenum cofactor sulfurase gene is responsible for classical xanthinuria type II."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04a1363e-0d51-4797-9358-0e48e362ea5f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:003abf11-b7bd-48cc-8151-a25468b22ccc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:003abf11-b7bd-48cc-8151-a25468b22ccc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":66,"allele":{"id":"cggv:b6acfce2-646a-4d30-9c39-ac4e365e708b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017947.4(MOCOS):c.1255C>T (p.Arg419Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8940673"}},"detectionMethod":"The authors cloned the MOCOS gene from a cDNA library, defining the structure of the gene for the first time.

Two mutations, both in the N-terminal domain of the Human Molybdenum Cofactor Sulfurase (HMCS), were reported in patients with type II xanthinuria. Whereas the N-terminal domain of HMCS was demonstrated to have cysteine desulfurase activity, the C-terminal domain hypothetically transfers the sulfur to the MoCo. We describe the first mutation in the C-terminal domain of HMCS identified in a Bedouin-Arab child presenting with urolithiasis and in an asymptomatic Jewish female. Patients were diagnosed with type II xanthinuria by homozygosity mapping and/or allopurinol loading test. The Bedouin-Arab child was homozygous for a c.2326C>T (p.Arg776Cys) mutation, while the female patient was compound heterozygous for this and a novel c.1034insA (p.Gln347fsStop379) mutation in the N-terminal domain of HMCS. Cosegregation of the homozygous mutant genotype with hypouricemia and hypouricosuria was demonstrated in the Bedouin family. Haplotype analysis indicated that p.Arg776Cys is a recurrent mutation. Arg776 together with six surrounding amino acid residues were found fully conserved and predicted to be buried in homologous eukaryotic MoCo sulfurases. Moreover, Arg776 is conserved in a diversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins that posses a domain homologous to the C-terminal domain of HMCS. Our findings suggest that Arg776 is essential for a core structure of the C-terminal domain of the HMCS and identification of a mutation at this site may contribute clarifying the mechanism of MoCo sulfuration.","dc:creator":"Peretz H","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Identification and characterization of the first mutation (Arg776Cys) in the C-terminal domain of the Human Molybdenum Cofactor Sulfurase (HMCS) associated with type II classical xanthinuria."}},{"id":"cggv:e1b97ebf-1f82-47c9-87df-c075d6c59537_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7be7d5b1-be50-46d5-be6b-e8809a5da495"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17368066"}],"rdfs:label":"ZO-II-1"},{"id":"cggv:4d8ada63-dc9b-47c5-a6f0-231e94cc7bf6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d8ada63-dc9b-47c5-a6f0-231e94cc7bf6_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:e1b97ebf-1f82-47c9-87df-c075d6c59537","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e1b97ebf-1f82-47c9-87df-c075d6c59537_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e1b97ebf-1f82-47c9-87df-c075d6c59537_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"From 34356852: Peretz et al.

In this review, focused on eukaryotic Moco biology, we elucidate the benefits of gene fusions on Moco biosynthesis and beyond. While originally the gene fusions were driven by biosynthetic advantages such as coordinated expression of functionally related proteins and product/substrate channeling, they also served as origin for the development of novel functions. Today, Moco biosynthetic genes are involved in a multitude of cellular processes and loss of the according gene products result in severe disorders, both related to Moco biosynthesis and secondary enzyme functions.","dc:creator":"Mayr SJ","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Molybdenum cofactor biology, evolution and deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"MOCOS Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:04a1363e-0d51-4797-9358-0e48e362ea5f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6b894c9b-dc78-452d-aadb-aede919cad1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20bea954-553d-4af3-9095-b09006696f6c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The classical symptoms of xanthinuria type 2 are low/undetectable uric acid in the serum and urine, and elevated xanthine/hypoxanthine in the serum and urine.

Xanthinuria type II is characterized by elevated xanthine/hypoxanthine in the urine and serum, and simultaneous low or undetectable levels of uric acid. This is due to an inability to synthesize sulfurated molybdenum-cofactor, the enzymatic product of the MOCOS enzyme, which is necessary for the activity of both xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is required for converting xanthine/hypoxanthine into uric acid. Many affected individuals remain asymptomatic, though ~40% develop urolithiasis, and ~5-10% experience non-specific stomach and/or muscle pain (PMID:25370766). \n\nEight variants (five missense, one nonsense, two frameshift) that have been reported in eight probands in five publications (PMID: 11302742, 14624414, 17368066, 29935280, 34356852) are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by segregation evidence from two large families with multiple affected siblings (PMID: 17368066, 34356852). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and an animal model (PMID: 33017596, 16127175, 35372998). The MOCOS gene is most highly expressed in the liver and small intestine, which are the major sites of xanthine oxidase activity. Complete knock-out of the homologous gene in mice fully recapitulates the phenotypes observed in human patients, while also inducing late embryonic/perinatal lethality, failure to thrive, and early mortality that has not been observed in humans. \n\nIn summary, MOCOS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive xanthinuria type II. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 8/12/2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:04a1363e-0d51-4797-9358-0e48e362ea5f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
