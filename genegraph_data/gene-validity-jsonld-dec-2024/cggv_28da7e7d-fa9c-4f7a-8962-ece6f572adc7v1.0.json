Using magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM), we have quantitated for the first time the neuromorphology of Reln mice at a resolution of 21.5 microm. The neuroanatomical phenotypes of heterozygous and homozygous mutant Reln mice were compared to those of wild type (WT) littermates using morphometry and texture analysis. The cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar phenotypes of the heterozygous and homozygous mutant Reln mice were confirmed, and new features were revealed. The Reln(rl/rl) mice possessed a smaller brain, and both Reln(rl/+) and Reln(rl/rl) mice had increased ventricles compared to WT controls. Shape differences were found between WT and Reln(rl/rl) brains, specifically in cerebellum, olfactory bulbs, dorsomedial frontal and parietal cortex, certain regions of temporal and occipital lobes, as well as in the lateral ventricles and ventral hippocampus. These findings suggest that certain brain regions may be more severely impacted by the Reln mutation than others. Gadolinium-based active staining demonstrated that layers of the hippocampus were disorganized in Reln(rl/rl) mice and differences in thickness of these layers were identified between WT and Reln(rl/rl) mice. The intensity distributions characteristic to the dorsal, middle, and ventral hippocampus were altered in the Reln(rl/rl), especially in the ventral hippocampus. These differences were quantified using skewness and modeling the intensity distributions with a Gaussian mixture. Our results suggest that structural features of Reln(rl/rl) brain most closely phenocopy those of patients with Norman-Roberts lissencephaly.","dc:creator":"Badea A","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Neuroanatomical phenotypes in the reeler mouse."},"rdfs:label":"reeler mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:28da7e7d-fa9c-4f7a-8962-ece6f572adc7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c690832c-5d43-43d8-835b-cb6c3ef1dcf2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c690832c-5d43-43d8-835b-cb6c3ef1dcf2","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:62428efc-ce7b-4442-9999-891ae448d87f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005045.4(RELN):c.1249C>T (p.Gln417Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA368926233"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007360","obo:HP_0001339"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b997fd8a-a600-447b-9662-9ceb432fe9d0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:62428efc-ce7b-4442-9999-891ae448d87f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35769015","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Reelin, a large extracellular protein, plays several critical roles in brain development and function. It is encoded by RELN, first identified as the gene disrupted in the reeler mouse, a classic neurological mutant exhibiting ataxia, tremors and a 'reeling' gait. In humans, biallelic variants in RELN have been associated with a recessive lissencephaly variant with cerebellar hypoplasia, which matches well with the homozygous mouse mutant that has abnormal cortical structure, small hippocampi and severe cerebellar hypoplasia. Despite the large size of the gene, only 11 individuals with RELN-related lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia from six families have previously been reported. Heterozygous carriers in these families were briefly reported as unaffected, although putative loss-of-function variants are practically absent in the population (probability of loss of function intolerance = 1). Here we present data on seven individuals from four families with biallelic and 13 individuals from seven families with monoallelic (heterozygous) variants of RELN and frontotemporal or temporal-predominant lissencephaly variant. Some individuals with monoallelic variants have moderate frontotemporal lissencephaly, but with normal cerebellar structure and intellectual disability with severe behavioural dysfunction. However, one adult had abnormal MRI with normal intelligence and neurological profile. Thorough literature analysis supports a causal role for monoallelic RELN variants in four seemingly distinct phenotypes including frontotemporal lissencephaly, epilepsy, autism and probably schizophrenia. Notably, we observed a significantly higher proportion of loss-of-function variants in the biallelic compared to the monoallelic cohort, where the variant spectrum included missense and splice-site variants. We assessed the impact of two canonical splice-site variants observed as biallelic or monoallelic variants in individuals with moderately affected or normal cerebellum and demonstrated exon skipping causing in-frame loss of 46 or 52 amino acids in the central RELN domain. Previously reported functional studies demonstrated severe reduction in overall RELN secretion caused by heterozygous missense variants p.Cys539Arg and p.Arg3207Cys associated with lissencephaly suggesting a dominant-negative effect. We conclude that biallelic variants resulting in complete absence of RELN expression are associated with a consistent and severe phenotype that includes cerebellar hypoplasia. However, reduced expression of RELN remains sufficient to maintain nearly normal cerebellar structure. Monoallelic variants are associated with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity even within the same family and may have dominant-negative effects. Reduced RELN secretion in heterozygous individuals affects only cortical structure whereas the cerebellum remains intact. Our data expand the spectrum of RELN-related neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from lethal brain malformations to adult phenotypes with normal brain imaging.","dc:creator":"Di Donato N","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Monoallelic and biallelic mutations in RELN underlie a graded series of neurodevelopmental disorders."}},"rdfs:label":"LP96-078"},{"id":"cggv:b997fd8a-a600-447b-9662-9ceb432fe9d0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b997fd8a-a600-447b-9662-9ceb432fe9d0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"homozygous variant in consanguineous family"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9baf59d5-483a-4cbd-8ea3-9f44d70f03b5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9baf59d5-483a-4cbd-8ea3-9f44d70f03b5","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:fb05b2f6-bedd-46c1-a1d3-3549f1b63421","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005045.4(RELN):c.9427T>G (p.Tyr3143Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA060835"}},{"id":"cggv:dbdd1101-17ae-4c2e-9069-fe0a304fee2e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005045.4(RELN):c.2213G>A (p.Cys738Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA060844"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001302"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:1f4bb5ed-d3f3-4be2-9a4b-ff656c6cb9a2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fb05b2f6-bedd-46c1-a1d3-3549f1b63421"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26395554","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To unravel missing genetic causes underlying monogenic disorders with recurrence in sibling, we explored the hypothesis of parental germline mosaic mutations in familial forms of malformation of cortical development (MCD).

Lissencephaly (\"smooth brain,\" from \"lissos,\" meaning smooth, and \"encephalos,\" meaning brain) is a severe developmental disorder in which neuronal migration is impaired, leading to a thickened cerebral cortex whose normally folded contour is simplified and smooth. Two identified lissencephaly genes do not account for all known cases, and additional lissencephaly syndromes have been described. An autosomal recessive form of lissencephaly (LCH) associated with severe abnormalities of the cerebellum, hippocampus and brainstem maps to chromosome 7q22, and is associated with two independent mutations in the human gene encoding reelin (RELN). The mutations disrupt splicing of RELN cDNA, resulting in low or undetectable amounts of reelin protein. LCH parallels the reeler mouse mutant (Reln(rl)), in which Reln mutations cause cerebellar hypoplasia, abnormal cerebral cortical neuronal migration and abnormal axonal connectivity. RELN encodes a large (388 kD) secreted protein that acts on migrating cortical neurons by binding to the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2; refs 9-11 ), alpha3beta1 integrin and protocadherins. Although reelin was previously thought to function exclusively in brain, some humans with RELN mutations show abnormal neuromuscular connectivity and congenital lymphoedema, suggesting previously unsuspected functions for reelin in and outside of the brain.","dc:creator":"Hong SE","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with human RELN mutations."}},"rdfs:label":"Saudian Arabian"},{"id":"cggv:c843a27b-94f4-4efb-9a02-f892d3ec1880","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c843a27b-94f4-4efb-9a02-f892d3ec1880_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c843a27b-94f4-4efb-9a02-f892d3ec1880_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR cDNA sequencing shows absent  ex37 leading to frameshift; W Blot shows absence of Reelin;"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"homozygous variant in consanguineous family"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:28da7e7d-fa9c-4f7a-8962-ece6f572adc7_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10.2},{"id":"cggv:64d0f976-346c-49ce-9a2b-289b37856e5b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64d0f976-346c-49ce-9a2b-289b37856e5b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:43c6b16d-d789-474b-b91d-079e82ac4c8f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005045.4(RELN):c.6613_6614del (p.Phe2205GlnfsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1730781655"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007360","obo:HP_0001339"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:67568832-7a16-422b-9ba4-7c4b7ecc7fe4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:43c6b16d-d789-474b-b91d-079e82ac4c8f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35769015"},"rdfs:label":"LP95-137a1"},{"id":"cggv:67568832-7a16-422b-9ba4-7c4b7ecc7fe4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67568832-7a16-422b-9ba4-7c4b7ecc7fe4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"\nhomozygous variant in consanguineous family"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:dfaf5395-8592-4bf5-af87-781490648df0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dfaf5395-8592-4bf5-af87-781490648df0","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:dce7eff9-2236-4b60-8d8d-1dda424ddc03","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005045.4(RELN):c.8844-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/2577917"}},"detectionMethod":"Targeted sequencing of RELN and VLDLR","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0007360","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001339","obo:HP_0001263"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:886505e6-fe1a-4748-a073-0201eebf98da_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:dce7eff9-2236-4b60-8d8d-1dda424ddc03"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27000652","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Pontocerebellar hypoplasias (PCH) are characterized by lack of development and/or early neurodegeneration of cerebellum and brainstem.

This condition is also described in the literature as lissencephaly-2 (Norman Roberts syndrome) (OMIM 257320). \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability with other conditions reported to be associated with this gene. Therefore, the following disease entities are not included in this curation: autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder, autosomal dominant familial temporal lobe epilepsy, autosomal dominant lissencephaly spectrum disorder; see PMID 35769015 for a discussion of the various phenotypes reported to be associated with this gene.\n\nSeven variants (2 missense, 1 nonsense, 2 splice-disrupting, 2 frameshifts) that have been reported in six probands in five publications (PMIDs: 10973257, 27000652, 26395554, 28454995, 35769015) are included in this curation. Five of these six probands were homozygous variant carriers in consanguineous families, many of which had more than one affected homozygote. At least four cases of structural chromosome abnormalities disrupting the RELN gene have also been reported (PMID 10973257, 16958033, 17431900, 35769015) for three of which an absence of Reelin protein has been demonstrated; these were not scored in this curation due to the absence of an accurate sequence level variant description, however they do provide additional support for this assertion. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.  \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by several spontaneous and experimentally generated reeler mouse mutants; the structural features of Relnrl/rl brain are consistent with the lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia observed in the patients (PMID: 17185001).\n\nIn summary, RELN is definitively associated with autosomal recessive AR lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations gene curation expert panel on 26.Sept.2023.\n\nreplicated over time","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:28da7e7d-fa9c-4f7a-8962-ece6f572adc7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
