Thrombomodulin increases the catalytic efficiency of the reaction by a factor of 1250, an effect expressed almost exclusively through an increase in kcat. The kinetics of the reaction conform to a model whereby thrombin can interact with either TAFI (Km = 1.0 microM) or thrombomodulin (Kd = 8.6 nM), and either binary complex so formed can then interact with the third component to form the ternary thrombin-thrombomodulin-TAFI complex from which activated TAFI is produced with kcat = 1.2 s-1. This work also shows that activated TAFI down-regulates tPA-induced fibrinolysis half-maximally at a concentration of 1.0 nM in a system of purified components. This concentration of TAFI is about 2% of the level of the zymogen in plasma, which indicates that ample activated TAFI could be generated to very significantly modulate fibrinolysis in vivo.

The objectives of this review were to review recent findings regarding thrombomodulin structure, its involvement in the regulation of hemostasis and further discuss the implication, if any, of the genetic polymorphisms in the thrombomodulin gene in the risk of development of thrombosis. We performed a literature search by using electronic bibliographic databases. Although the direct evaluation of risk situations associated with thrombomodulin mutations/polymorphisms could be of clinical significance, it appears that mutations that affect the function of thrombomodulin are rarely associated with venous thromboembolism.
