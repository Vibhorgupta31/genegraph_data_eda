There are eight genetically distinct forms of AR LGMD, LGMD 2A-H (refs 2-10), and the genetic lesions underlying these forms, except for LGMD 2G and 2H, have been identified. LGMD 2A and LGMD 2B are caused by mutations in the genes encoding calpain 3 (ref. 11) and dysferlin, respectively, and are usually associated with a mild phenotype. Mutations in the genes encoding gamma-(ref. 14), alpha-(ref. 5), beta-(refs 6,7) and delta (ref. 15)-sarcoglycans are responsible for LGMD 2C to 2F, respectively. Sarcoglycans, together with sarcospan, dystroglycans, syntrophins and dystrobrevin, constitute the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Patients with LGMD 2C-F predominantly have a severe clinical course. The LGMD 2G locus maps to a 3-cM interval in 17q11-12 in two Brazilian families with a relatively mild form of AR LGMD (ref. 9). To positionally clone the LGMD 2G gene, we constructed a physical map of the 17q11-12 region and refined its localization to an interval of 1.2 Mb. The gene encoding telethonin, a sarcomeric protein, lies within this candidate region. We have found that mutations in the telethonin gene cause LGMD 2G, identifying a new molecular mechanism for AR LGMD.","dc:creator":"Moreira ES","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein telethonin."}},"rdfs:label":"Moreira_Family LG18_II-1"},{"id":"cggv:1aa2a72c-c4d0-4dea-b657-258a1c343131","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1aa2a72c-c4d0-4dea-b657-258a1c343131_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1aa2a72c-c4d0-4dea-b657-258a1c343131_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Absence of the telethonin protein is shown by IHC and Western blot in muscle biopsy from proband."}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the nonsense variant, Gln53Ter, in exon 2/2.

Muscle histology of Tcap-null mice revealed abnormal myofiber size variation with central nucleation, similar to findings in the muscles of LGMD2G patients.

It remains unclear why mutations in Tcap lead to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2G (LGMD2G) in human patients. Here, we cloned tcap in zebrafish and conducted genetic studies. We show that tcap is functionally conserved, as the Tcap protein appears in the sarcomeric Z-disc and reduction of Tcap resulted in muscular dystrophy-like phenotypes including deformed muscle structure and impaired swimming ability. However, the observations that Tcap integrates into the sarcomere at a stage after the Z-disc becomes periodic, and that the sarcomere remains intact in tcap morphants, suggest that defective sarcomere assembly does not contribute to this particular type of muscular dystrophy. Instead, a defective interaction between the sarcomere and plasma membrane was detected, which was further underscored by the disrupted development of the T-tubule system. Pertinent to a potential function in stretch sensor signaling, zebrafish tcap exhibits a variable expression pattern during somitogenesis. The variable expression is inducible by stretch force, and the expression level of Tcap is negatively regulated by integrin-link kinase (ILK), a protein kinase that is involved in stretch sensing signaling. Together, our genetic studies of tcap in zebrafish suggested that pathogenesis in LGMD2G is due to a disruption of sarcomere-T-tubular interaction, but not of sarcomere assembly per se. In addition, our data prompted a novel hypothesis that predicts that the transcription level of Tcap can be regulated by the stretch force to ensure proper sarcomere-membrane interaction in striated muscles.","dc:creator":"Zhang R","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Depletion of zebrafish Tcap leads to muscular dystrophy via disrupting sarcomere-membrane interaction, not sarcomere assembly."},"rdfs:label":"Zhang_Zebrafish model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score is reduced as the zebrafish model is not considered an appropriate model to recapitulate muscle phenotypes in humans.

This association was made using case-level, segregation, and experimental data. The *TCAP* gene is located on chromosome 17q12. The transcript referred to in the literature (NM_003673.3) is 960 bp long with 2 exons encoding a 167-amino acid protein. More than 20 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (AR-LGMD) are recorded in ClinVar, most of them being predicted loss of function variants such as nonsense, frameshift, deletion/duplication and splicing variants. Since the gene has only 2 exons, most predicted loss of function variants do not cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Patients with AR-LGMD due to *TCAP* variants show progressive proximal muscle weakness (along with distal weakness in some) with an average age at onset in the second decade, difficulty in walking and running with loss of ambulation in some, foot drop, increased serum creatine kinase levels, and a muscle biopsy showing dystrophic changes. *TCAP* has been reported in association with AR-LGMD as early as 2000 by Moreira et al (PMID: 10655062).\n \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 7 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 10655062, 28666572, 27618135, 25055047). Variants in the gene segregated with disease in 11 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.\n \nSummary of Experimental Data (3.5 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interaction assays. *TCAP* encodes the telethonin protein that localizes to the Z-disk in the sarcomere and interacts with titin to form the titin cap, which is essential for sarcomere formation and integrity (PMID: 9645487). Telethonin is expressed in the striated muscles, including the heart and skeletal muscles (PMID: 9817758). The effects of *TCAP* knockdown are studied in zebrafish models (PMID: 19679566), and the effects of *TCAP* knockout are studied in mouse models (PMIDs: 20233748, 21799151). Studies show loss of swimming ability in fish and balancing ability on rotating road in mice, as well as muscle histological changes similar to human patients with AR-LGMD due to *TCAP* variants.\n\nIn summary, this gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n \nOMIM entities: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 25; autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy 7.\n \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found significant difference in phenotype AND inheritance pattern AND in the absence of a well-defined molecular mechanism in the above-mentioned disease entities.
