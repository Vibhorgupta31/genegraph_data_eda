Using spontaneous and targeted Whrn mutants, we show that the major long (WHRN-L) and short (WHRN-S) isoforms of WHRN have distinct localizations within stereocilia and also across hair cell types. Lack of both isoforms causes abnormally short stereocilia and profound deafness and vestibular dysfunction. WHRN-S expression, however, is sufficient to maintain stereocilia bundle morphology and function in a subset of hair cells, resulting in some auditory response and no overt vestibular dysfunction. WHRN-S interacts with EPS8, and both are required at stereocilia tips for normal length regulation. WHRN-L localizes midway along the shorter stereocilia, at the level of inter-stereociliary links.

Three variants (nonsense and frameshift) that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 12833159, 29270100, 34194829) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 12 additional family members from 3 separate families. Many additional cases have been reported in the literature claiming autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss with WHRN variants; however, these variants were not scored due to a lack of convincing phenotyping to rule out late onset retinitis pigmentosa in the probands (i.e. patient is below age of RP onset for Usher type 2, age is not reported, eye examination is not reported) (PMIDs: 23767834, 24194196, 26561413, 26969326, 27344577, 27610647, 28600779, 30303587). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression in the cochlea, and two separate mouse models phenocopying nonsyndromic genetic hearing loss in humans (PMID: 27117407). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on January 2, 2019. It was reevaluated on January 17, 2024.
