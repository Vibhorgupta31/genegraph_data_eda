They are characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. We performed linkage analysis, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to determine the underlying defect in patients with an inherited limb-girdle pattern of myasthenic weakness. We identify ALG14 and ALG2 as novel genes in which mutations cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome. Through analogy with yeast, ALG14 is thought to form a multiglycosyltransferase complex with ALG13 and DPAGT1 that catalyses the first two committed steps of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation. We show that ALG14 is concentrated at the muscle motor endplates and small interfering RNA silencing of ALG14 results in reduced cell-surface expression of muscle acetylcholine receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. ALG2 is an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase that also catalyses early steps in the asparagine-linked glycosylation pathway. Mutations were identified in two kinships, with mutation ALG2p.Val68Gly found to severely reduce ALG2 expression both in patient muscle, and in cell cultures. Identification of DPAGT1, ALG14 and ALG2 mutations as a cause of congenital myasthenic syndrome underscores the importance of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction. These syndromes form part of the wider spectrum of congenital disorders of glycosylation caused by impaired asparagine-linked glycosylation. It is likely that further genes encoding components of this pathway will be associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes or impaired neuromuscular transmission as part of a more severe multisystem disorder. Our findings suggest that treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors may improve muscle function in many of the congenital disorders of glycosylation.","dc:creator":"Cossins J","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Congenital myasthenic syndromes due to mutations in ALG2 and ALG14."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:809c40c4-1800-42ef-b56f-95a2c61f44ce_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5abc0df8-9ce3-4f71-a5cc-67309a22f6b9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5abc0df8-9ce3-4f71-a5cc-67309a22f6b9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:57824f3a-60fe-49d7-8958-2e0ca5c8ce79","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_144988.4(ALG14):c.422T>G (p.Val141Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA961779"}},{"id":"cggv:ed02fc05-a3fe-453c-bffd-eba9cebee193","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_144988.4(ALG14):c.220G>A (p.Asp74Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA961846"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Lack of spontaneous breathing made primary intubation necessary, Frontoparietal atrophy","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000581","obo:HP_0001762","obo:HP_0008947","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0001166","obo:HP_0012448","obo:HP_0010516","obo:HP_0000774","obo:HP_0034671","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0010602","obo:HP_0000262","obo:HP_0006610","obo:HP_0001558","obo:HP_0034392","obo:HP_0010851","obo:HP_0001561"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:feef3227-71cf-4433-a143-a45226903522_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:57824f3a-60fe-49d7-8958-2e0ca5c8ce79"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28733338","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To describe the presentation and identify the cause of a new clinical phenotype, characterized by early severe neurodegeneration with myopathic and myasthenic features.","dc:creator":"Schorling DC","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Early and lethal neurodegeneration with myasthenic and myopathic features: A new "}},{"id":"cggv:84533fca-9fb9-483f-8267-6cc6b9fce614_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ed02fc05-a3fe-453c-bffd-eba9cebee193"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28733338"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient A-1 "},{"id":"cggv:feef3227-71cf-4433-a143-a45226903522","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:feef3227-71cf-4433-a143-a45226903522_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"European (non-Finnish): 141/ 1179134 (0.0001196)"},{"id":"cggv:84533fca-9fb9-483f-8267-6cc6b9fce614","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84533fca-9fb9-483f-8267-6cc6b9fce614_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"European (non-Finnish): 347/1179758 (0.0002941)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f9a39d70-c0e4-4580-b8e3-6700323334d1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9a39d70-c0e4-4580-b8e3-6700323334d1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:3c904000-2659-4a17-928f-8b55ca807e5a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_144988.4(ALG14):c.310C>T (p.Arg104Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA249439"}},{"id":"cggv:a2ce4e1f-d058-43da-86e5-19e7fa23762b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_144988.4(ALG14):c.194C>T (p.Pro65Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA248783"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with autoimmune myasthenia gravis at 18, unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy.

The pathogenic variant in ALG14 results in a severe pathological form of CMS causing end-plate acetylcholine receptor deficiency. Here, we report the cases of two siblings with CMS associated with a novel variant in ALG14. Immediately after birth, they showed hypotonia and multiple joint contractures with low Apgar scores. Ptosis, low-set ears, and high-arched palate were noted. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical. They showed worsening swallowing and respiratory problems; hence, nasal feeding and tracheotomy were performed. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed delayed myelination and cerebral atrophy. Exome sequencing indicated that the siblings had novel compound heterozygous missense variants, c.590T>G (p.Val197Gly) and c.433G>A (p.Gly145Arg), in exon 4 of ALG14.

Despite intense research, several of the enzymes required for LLO synthesis have not yet been identified. Here we show that two poorly characterized yeast proteins known to be required for the synthesis of the LLO precursor, GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, interact to form an unusual hetero-oligomeric UDP-GlcNAc transferase. Alg13 contains a predicted catalytic domain, but lacks any membrane-spanning domains. Alg14 spans the membrane but lacks any sequences predicted to play a direct role in sugar catalysis. We show that Alg14 functions as a membrane anchor that recruits Alg13 to the cytosolic face of the ER, where catalysis of GlcNAc2-PP-dol occurs. Alg13 and Alg14 physically interact and under normal conditions, are associated with the ER membrane. Overexpression of Alg13 leads to its cytosolic partitioning, as does reduction of Alg14 levels. Concomitant Alg14 overproduction suppresses this cytosolic partitioning of Alg13, demonstrating that Alg14 is both necessary and sufficient for the ER localization of Alg13. Further evidence for the functional relevance of this interaction comes from our demonstration that the human ALG13 and ALG14 orthologues fail to pair with their yeast partners, but when co-expressed in yeast can functionally complement the loss of either ALG13 or ALG14. These results demonstrate that this novel UDP-GlcNAc transferase is a unique eukaryotic ER glycosyltransferase that is comprised of at least two functional polypeptides, one that functions in catalysis and the other as a membrane anchor.","dc:creator":"Gao XD","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Alg14 recruits Alg13 to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum to form a novel bipartite UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase required for the second step of N-linked glycosylation."},"rdfs:label":"co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) of ALG13 and ALG14"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:eae39979-fecc-4e0d-a055-3301a3102344","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ce4cf42-e12d-4b9b-a45b-4d78857f2b84","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"They observed that reduced expression of either Alg13 or Alg14 resulted in hypoglycosylation of CPY (protein used as a reporter for N-linked glycosylation defects in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)).

At least 14 unique variants (mostly missense and one intronic variant) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands from publications (PMIDs:23404334, 28733338, 30221345, 33751823, 34971077 ).  Patients may exhibit a range of neurological abnormalities, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, and dysmorphic features, or they may have a neuromuscular transmission disorder associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. No supporting segregation information is available. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of ***ALG14***, which encodes a subunit of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase enzyme responsible for adding the second N-acetylglucosamine residue during the synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PMID:28733338, 16100110).

Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
