Mutations in the ACTA1 gene contribute to a significant proportion of NM cases.

However, approximately 10% of ACTA1 gene mutations are associated with autosomal recessive NM; these mutations are associated with loss of protein function. We report the first case of a large deletion in the ACTA1 gene contributing to autosomal recessive NM. This case illustrates the importance of understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level to accurately infer the inheritance pattern and potentially aid with clinical management.","dc:creator":"Friedman B","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Novel large deletion in the ACTA1 gene in a child with autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy."}},"rdfs:label":"Friedman case"},{"id":"cggv:b4c97d03-af3e-46a4-8f9f-b035e33d1fe3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4c97d03-af3e-46a4-8f9f-b035e33d1fe3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This maternal frameshift occurs in the penultimate exon and is not predicted to trigger NMD.

The skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) is one of five genes for thin filament proteins identified so far as responsible for different forms of NM. We have screened the ACTA1 gene in a cohort of 109 unrelated patients with NM. Here, we describe clinical and pathological features associated with 29 ACTA1 mutations found in 38 individuals from 28 families. Although ACTA1 mutations cause a remarkably heterogeneous range of phenotypes, they were preferentially associated with severe clinical presentations (p < 0.0001). Most pathogenic ACTA1 mutations were missense changes with two instances of single base pair deletions. Most patients with ACTA1 mutations had no prior family history of neuromuscular disease (24/28). One severe case, caused by compound heterozygous recessive ACTA1 mutations, demonstrated increased alpha-cardiac actin expression, suggesting that cardiac actin might partially compensate for ACTA1 abnormalities in the fetal/neonatal period. This cohort also includes the first instance of an ACTA1 mutation manifesting with adult-onset disease and two pedigrees exhibiting potential incomplete penetrance. Overall, ACTA1 mutations are a common cause of NM, accounting for more than half of severe cases and 26% of all NM cases in this series.","dc:creator":"Agrawal PB","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Heterogeneity of nemaline myopathy cases with skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:b1126b6b-70d1-4a83-bec7-3663fd7ec8d7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5844134f-943e-48c6-b233-7e1677c8a57e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15236405"}],"rdfs:label":"117-1"},{"id":"cggv:b1126b6b-70d1-4a83-bec7-3663fd7ec8d7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b1126b6b-70d1-4a83-bec7-3663fd7ec8d7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b1126b6b-70d1-4a83-bec7-3663fd7ec8d7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"From PMID: 15226407, when expressed in reticulocyte lysates the variant protein was improperly folded and was not released from CCT and prefoldin.

There are skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle and non-muscle isoforms of both actin and myosin. Inherited diseases in humans have been associated with defects in cardiac actin (dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cardiac myosin (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and non-muscle myosin (deafness). Here we report that mutations in the human skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) are associated with two different muscle diseases, 'congenital myopathy with excess of thin myofilaments' (actin myopathy) and nemaline myopathy. Both diseases are characterized by structural abnormalities of the muscle fibres and variable degrees of muscle weakness. We have identified 15 different missense mutations resulting in 14 different amino acid changes. The missense mutations in ACTA1 are distributed throughout all six coding exons, and some involve known functional domains of actin. Approximately half of the patients died within their first year, but two female patients have survived into their thirties and have children. We identified dominant mutations in all but 1 of 14 families, with the missense mutations being single and heterozygous. The only family showing dominant inheritance comprised a 33-year-old affected mother and her two affected and two unaffected children. In another family, the clinically unaffected father is a somatic mosaic for the mutation seen in both of his affected children. We identified recessive mutations in one family in which the two affected siblings had heterozygous mutations in two different exons, one paternally and the other maternally inherited. We also identified de novo mutations in seven sporadic probands for which it was possible to analyse parental DNA.","dc:creator":"Nowak KJ","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene in patients with actin myopathy and nemaline myopathy."}},{"id":"cggv:e8551279-9d53-4b9b-8af8-06902c596c30_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:48085f6a-255c-4fe0-8e32-fa47c745d5a5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10508519"}],"rdfs:label":"1999 Patient 5"},{"id":"cggv:69fcbc80-53a5-471d-89ab-2e193599ceba","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:69fcbc80-53a5-471d-89ab-2e193599ceba_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:69fcbc80-53a5-471d-89ab-2e193599ceba_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In PMID: 15226407, when expressed in reticulocyte lysates the variant was improperly folded and was not released from CCT and prefoldin."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The overall allele frequency of Glu261Val in gnomAD is 0.00003203 with a MAF of 0.00006518 (1/15342) in the non-Finnish European population."},{"id":"cggv:e8551279-9d53-4b9b-8af8-06902c596c30","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8551279-9d53-4b9b-8af8-06902c596c30_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e8551279-9d53-4b9b-8af8-06902c596c30_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In PMID: 15226407, when expressed in reticulocyte lysates the variant was improperly folded and was not released from CCT and prefoldin."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7f85bc4e-91ed-4b16-811e-09451bdc492a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f85bc4e-91ed-4b16-811e-09451bdc492a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:aafb7ca9-e533-48a4-8f9e-e7b82592ad21","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001100.4(ACTA1):c.541del (p.Asp181ThrfsTer11)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1442845"}},"detectionMethod":"The α‐skeletal muscle actin gene (ACTA1) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and each of the six coding exons was sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"reduced antigravity movements","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003690","obo:HP_0003458","obo:HP_0003798","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0030319","obo:HP_0002421","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0001460","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0011471"],"previousTestingDescription":"Muscle biopsy at 2 months showed abnormal fiber size variation, internal nuclei, aggregates of mitochondria, high lipid content of fibers, several rodlike structures, loss of myofibrils, some fiber atrophy and apoptosis.","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:3c0c9a3f-e27b-40ab-94fb-469913dc23a4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:aafb7ca9-e533-48a4-8f9e-e7b82592ad21"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17187373","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To investigate seven congenital myopathy patients from six families: one French Gypsy, one Spanish Gypsy, four British Pakistanis, and one British Indian.

At that time, only 15 different missense mutations were known in ACTA1. More than 60 mutations have now been identified. This review analyses this larger spectrum of mutations in ACTA1. It investigates the molecular consequences of the mutations found to date, provides a framework for genotype-phenotype correlation and suggests future studies in light of results of investigation of normal and mutant actin in other systems, notably the actin specific to the indirect flight muscles of Drosophila. The larger series confirms that the majority of ACTA1 mutations are dominant, a small number are recessive and most isolated cases with no previous family history have de novo dominant mutations. The severity of the disease caused ranges from lack of spontaneous movements at birth requiring immediate mechanical ventilation, to mild disease compatible with life to adulthood. Overall, the mutations within ACTA1 are randomly distributed throughout the protein. However, the larger series of mutations now available indicates that there may be clustering of mutations associated with some phenotypes, e.g. actin myopathy. This would suggest that interference with certain actin functions may be more associated with certain phenotypes, though the exact pathophysiology of the actin mutations remains unknown.","dc:creator":"Sparrow JC","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Muscle disease caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1)."}},"rdfs:label":"Splice-sitemutation"},{"id":"cggv:d4e5046d-710c-4942-88d1-42929d488496","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d4e5046d-710c-4942-88d1-42929d488496_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This homozygous splice variant in intron 5 is predicted to cause skipping of exon 6 with a premature stop codon in the final exon 7, leading to a 10% truncation."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8be9c025-a3c1-491b-8124-3fb2559ea208_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8be9c025-a3c1-491b-8124-3fb2559ea208","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":22,"allele":{"id":"cggv:520b1cdd-4ebb-4a63-82fa-167c96898245","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001100.3(ACTA1):c.121C>T (p.Arg41Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345151247"}},"detectionMethod":"The α‐skeletal muscle actin gene (ACTA1) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and each of the six coding exons was sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"absent antigravity movements","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0002093","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0030319","obo:HP_0011471","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0002421","obo:HP_0001270"],"previousTestingDescription":"Deltoid muscle biopsy (at 1 and 7 months) showed abnormal fiber size variation, a few internal nuclei, clusters of nemaline rods, large areas of disorganized myofibrils, and some apoptotic nuclei.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6d8e2a55-c6f1-4887-99ff-f667b37cd683_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:520b1cdd-4ebb-4a63-82fa-167c96898245"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17187373"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:6d8e2a55-c6f1-4887-99ff-f667b37cd683","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d8e2a55-c6f1-4887-99ff-f667b37cd683_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous (due to consanguinity) nonsense variant Arg41Ter occurs in exon 2 of 6 and is predicted to result in NMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:098a7b3a-26ab-4915-8187-f6db682cef4f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:098a7b3a-26ab-4915-8187-f6db682cef4f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e89595c3-b355-4f78-a49d-a8fe69a1e829","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b949f12-c310-4b61-9215-f87d2dbfd955","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Developmental Northern blots were performed using the alpha-skeletal isoactin-specific probe in embryonic day 15 through postnatal day 8 and adult rat tissues.

Moreover, the interaction of filamentous actin with myosin forms the basis of muscle contraction.

While it is hypothesized that each of the muscle isoactins is specifically adapted to its respective tissue and that the minor variations among them have developmental and/or physiological relevance, the exact functional and developmental significance of these proteins remains largely unknown. In order to begin to assess these issues, we disrupted the skeletal actin gene by homologous recombination. All mice lacking skeletal actin die in the early neonatal period (day 1 to 9). These null animals appear normal at birth and can breathe, walk, and suckle, but within 4 days, they show a markedly lower body weight than normal littermates and many develop scoliosis. Null mice show a loss of glycogen and reduced brown fat that is consistent with malnutrition leading to death. Newborn skeletal muscles from null mice are similar to those of wild-type mice in size, fiber type, and ultrastructural organization. At birth, both hemizygous and homozygous null animals show an increase in cardiac and vascular actin mRNA in skeletal muscle, with no skeletal actin mRNA present in null mice. Adult hemizygous animals show an increased level of skeletal actin mRNA in hind limb muscle but no overt phenotype. Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle isolated from skeletal-actin-deficient mice at day 2 to 3 showed a marked reduction in force production compared to that of control littermates, and EDL muscle from hemizygous animals displayed an intermediate force generation. Thus, while increases in cardiac and vascular smooth-muscle actin can partially compensate for the lack of skeletal actin in null mice, this is not sufficient to support adequate skeletal muscle growth and/or function.","dc:creator":"Crawford K","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mice lacking skeletal muscle actin show reduced muscle strength and growth deficits and die during the neonatal period."},"rdfs:label":"Null mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"In this report the authors show that skeletal-actin-deficient mice are indistinguishable from normal mice at birth in terms of size, but they fail to thrive and thus die in the neonatal period.

These variants lead to a variety of overlapping adult onset and congenital myopathies characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, myopathic facies, respiratory dysfunction, and rarely cardiac involvement. While nemaline myopathy is the most common presentation, several other myopathies have been reported in association with *ACTA1* mutations. Specific skeletal muscle structural lesions visible on muscle biopsy include actin accumulations, nemaline and intranuclear bodies, fiber-type disproportion, cores, caps, dystrophic features and zebra bodies. Disorders associated with *ACTA1* pathogenic variants can have autosomal dominant (90%) or recessive (10%) inheritance. Per criteria outlined by the Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism (dominant negative vs. recessive loss of function) and inheritance pattern actinopathy was split into dominant and recessive curations.\n\n*ACTA1* was first reported in relation to recessive actinopathy in 1999 (Nowak KJ, et al., 1999, PMID: 10508519). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Biallelic loss of function variants (splicing, frameshift, nonsense, and missense) in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 10508519, 12921789, 15236405, 17187373, 24447884). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 4 additional family members. More evidence may be available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction (PMID: 21314430), its skeletal muscle specific expression (PMID: 1743394), and a null mouse model (PMID: 12138199) that partially recapitulates human disease. In summary *ACTA1* is definitively associated with recessive inheritance of actinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:098a7b3a-26ab-4915-8187-f6db682cef4f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
