The coding sequence and splice site boundaries of all six genes were amplified in germline DNA from 2240 invasive EOC cases and 1535 controls. Barcoded fragment libraries were sequenced using the Illumina GAII or HiSeq and sequence data for each subject de-multiplexed prior to interpretation. GATK and Annovar were used for variant detection and annotation. After quality control 2222 cases (99.2%) and 1528 controls (99.5%) were included in the final analysis. We identified 193 EOC cases (8.7%) carrying a deleterious mutation in at least one gene compared with 10 controls (0.65%). Mutations were most frequent in BRCA1 and BRCA2, with 84 EOC cases (3.8%) carrying a BRCA1 mutation and 94 EOC cases (4.2%) carrying a BRCA2 mutation. The combined BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation prevalence was 11% in high-grade serous disease. Seventeen EOC cases carried a mutation in a mismatch repair gene, including 10 MSH6 mutation carriers (0.45%) and 4 MSH2 mutation carriers (0.18%). At least 1 in 10 women with high-grade serous EOC has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The development of next generation sequencing technologies enables rapid mutation screening for multiple susceptibility genes at once, suggesting that routine clinical testing of all incidence cases should be considered.

To gain more insight into its role in homologous recombination, we expressed wild-type BRCA2 in the well-characterized BRCA2-deficient human cell line CAPAN-1 containing, as homologous recombination substrates, either direct or inverted repeats of two inactive marker genes. Whereas direct repeats monitor a mixture of RAD51-dependent and RAD51-independent homologous recombination events, inverted repeats distinguish between these events by reporting RAD51-dependent homologous recombination, gene conversion, and crossover events only. At either repeats, BRCA2 decreases the rate and frequency of spontaneous homologous recombination, but following chromosomal DSBs, BRCA2 increases the frequency of homologous recombination. At direct repeats, BRCA2 suppresses both spontaneous gene conversion and deletions, which can arise either from crossover or RAD51-independent sister chromatid replication slippage (SCRS), but following chromosomal DSBs, BRCA2 highly promotes gene conversion with little effect on deletions. At inverted repeats, spontaneous or DSB-induced crossover events were scarce and BRCA2 does not suppress their formation. From these results, we conclude that (i) BRCA2 regulates RAD51 recombination in response to the type of DNA damage and (ii) BRCA2 suppresses SCRS, suggesting a role for BRCA2 in sister chromatids cohesion and/or alignment.

In 1995, Wooster et al. (PMID: 8524414) identified BRCA2 gene and the association of breast cancer. Subsequently, the association of ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer with germline BRCA2 variants was reported (PMID: 7597059, 9140390, 11257103). Emerging evidence also reported an increased risk of tumor formation at other sites including prostate cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) or inheritance pattern. Therefore, these phenotypes have been lumped into this BRCA2-related cancer predisposition curation (MONDO:0700269). Association of germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the BRCA2 with autosomal recessive inherited Fanconi Anemia complementation group D1 (MONDO:0011584) has curated separately due to phenotypic variability and different inheritance patterns. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. Three publications in which 6 founder variants from individuals and families with breast cancer and ovarian cancer (PMIDs: 8673092, 8673089 and 9361038) and 6 large case-control studies (PMID: 24728189, 28888541, 29922827, 30900310, 33471974, 33471991) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 Points) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (4.5 Points; PMIDs: 9126738, 9774970, 11694875, 15899802). Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that brca2 interacts with Rad51, a DNA-repair protein. Brca2-deficient mice were radiation sensitive. Mice with conditional mutants in Brca2 and/or p53 developed mammary tumors. In summary, BRCA2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant BRCA2-related cancer predisposition. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive for breast-ovarian cancer, familial, susceptibility to, 2 (MONDO:0012933) by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 09/13/2017. This re-curation as definitive was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 01/26/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4e504fdc-d8b1-474e-8f01-d1b1f8267c79"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
