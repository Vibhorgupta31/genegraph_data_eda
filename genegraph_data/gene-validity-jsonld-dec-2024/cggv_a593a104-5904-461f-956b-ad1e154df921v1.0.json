expression cell lines is important for controlling and modulating the glycosylation profiles of recombinant glycoproteins. We found that expression of erythropoietin (EPO) in a HEK293S N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I)(-/-) cell line resulted in production of the Man5GlcNAc2 glycoforms, in which more than 50% were core-fucosylated, implicating a clear GnT I-independent core fucosylation pathway. Expression of GM-CSF and the ectodomain of FcÎ³IIIA receptor led to â¼30% and 3% core fucosylation, suggesting that the level of core fucosylation also depends on the nature of the recombinant proteins. To elucidate the GnT I-independent core fucosylation pathway, we generated a stable HEK293S GnT I(-/-) cell line with either knockdown or overexpression of FUT8 by a highly efficient lentivirus-mediated gene transfer approach. We found that the EPO produced from the FUT8 knockdown cell line was the pure Man5GlcNAc2 glycoform, whereas that produced from the FUT8-overexpressing cell line was found to be fully core-fucosylated oligomannose glycan (Man5GlcNAc2Fuc). These results provide direct evidence that FUT8, the mammalian Î±1,6-fucosyltransferase, is the sole enzyme responsible for the GnT I-independent core fucosylation pathway. The production of the homogeneous core-fucosylated Man5GlcNAc2 glycoform of EPO in the FUT8-overexpressed HEK293S GnT I(-/-) cell line represents the first example of production of fully core-fucosylated high-mannose glycoforms.","dc:creator":"Yang Q","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mammalian Î±-1,6-Fucosyltransferase (FUT8) Is the Sole Enzyme Responsible for the N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-independent Core Fucosylation of High-mannose N-Glycans."},"rdfs:label":"Yang HEK293S Cell Knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a593a104-5904-461f-956b-ad1e154df921_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f191430-c492-4fc5-9631-661dc226ac55","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c9a25e64-05d0-40d6-a4c5-f50ef8cc3402","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Knockout mice exhibited an absence of fucosylated N-glycans, which is also seen in humans.

To investigate physiological functions of the core fucose, we generated alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8)-null mice and found that disruption of Fut8 induces severe growth retardation and death during postnatal development. Histopathological analysis revealed that Fut8(-/-) mice showed emphysema-like changes in the lung, verified by a physiological compliance analysis. Biochemical studies indicated that lungs from Fut8(-/-) mice exhibit a marked overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-12 and MMP-13, highly associated with lung-destructive phenotypes, and a down-regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as elastin, as well as retarded alveolar epithelia cell differentiation. These changes should be consistent with a deficiency in TGF-beta1 signaling, a pleiotropic factor that controls ECM homeostasis by down-regulating MMP expression and inducing ECM protein components. In fact, Fut8(-/-) mice have a marked dysregulation of TGF-beta1 receptor activation and signaling, as assessed by TGF-beta1 binding assays and Smad2 phosphorylation analysis. We also show that these TGF-beta1 receptor defects found in Fut8(-/-) cells can be rescued by reintroducing Fut8 into Fut8(-/-) cells. Furthermore, exogenous TGF-beta1 potentially rescued emphysema-like phenotype and concomitantly reduced MMP expression in Fut8(-/-) lung. We propose that the lack of core fucosylation of TGF-beta1 receptors is crucial for a developmental and progressive/destructive emphysema, suggesting that perturbation of this function could underlie certain cases of human emphysema.","dc:creator":"Wang X","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Dysregulation of TGF-beta1 receptor activation leads to abnormal lung development and emphysema-like phenotype in core fucose-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Wang Knockout Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8301,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5fd82050-dbbb-41dd-bdf8-2c9aa2ff3034","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020775","gene":"hgnc:4019","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"FUT8 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation with defective fucosylation 1 in 2018 (Ng et al., PMID: 29304374). 8 variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense) that have been reported in 7 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 29304374, 32049367) are included in this curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal knockout model (PMID: 16236725) and a cell line knockout model (PMID: 27008861). Both models showed a lack of fucosylated N-glycans, which is also observed in affected patients. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between FUT8 and autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation with defective fucosylation 1.
