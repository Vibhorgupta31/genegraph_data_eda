Here, we report homozygous mutations in peroxidasin (PXDN) in two consanguineous Pakistani families with congenital cataract-microcornea with mild to moderate corneal opacity and in a consanguineous Cambodian family with developmental glaucoma and severe corneal opacification. These results highlight the diverse ocular phenotypes caused by PXDN mutations, which are likely due to differences in genetic background and environmental factors. Peroxidasin is an extracellular matrix-associated protein with peroxidase catalytic activity, and we confirmed localization of the protein to the cornea and lens epithelial layers. Our findings imply that peroxidasin is essential for normal development of the anterior chamber of the eye, where it may have a structural role in supporting cornea and lens architecture as well as an enzymatic role as an antioxidant enzyme in protecting the lens, trabecular meshwork, and cornea against oxidative damage.","dc:creator":"Khan K","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Homozygous mutations in PXDN cause congenital cataract, corneal opacity, and developmental glaucoma."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:905b07f8-ed15-4c25-9579-edac5521c699_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:905b07f8-ed15-4c25-9579-edac5521c699_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:4005aa57-66ea-44c9-b73e-c462ac2916b9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4005aa57-66ea-44c9-b73e-c462ac2916b9","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:be7fd8ff-d328-4b79-9564-6950fc80f147","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012293.3(PXDN):c.693_697dup (p.Val233AlafsTer11)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915943654"}},{"id":"cggv:c65aaf37-7f4b-4f4d-8a89-cd6ac006d573","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012293.3(PXDN):c.1A>G (p.Met1Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345730250"}}],"detectionMethod":"Whole genome sequencing was used.

There is a wide genetic heterogeneity leading to these ocular malformations. By using whole genome, exome and targeted sequencing in patients with ocular developmental anomalies, six biallelic pathogenic variants (including five novel variants) were identified in the PXDN gene in four families with microphthalmia and anterior segment dysgenesis. Only 11 different mutations (11 families) have been described in this gene to date. The phenotype of these patients is variable in severity, ranging from cataract and developmental glaucoma to complex microphthalmia. Interestingly, two unrelated patients of our series presented with an ocular phenotype including aniridia and microspherophakia. However, despite various phenotypic presentations and types of mutations, no genotype-phenotype correlation could be made. Thus, this work improves our knowledge of the recessive phenotype associated with biallelic variants in this gene and highlights the importance of screening PXDN in patients with anterior segment dysgenesis with or without microphthalmia.","dc:creator":"Zazo-Seco C","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Novel PXDN biallelic variants in patients with microphthalmia and anterior segment dysgenesis."}},{"id":"cggv:aa4ff9d6-4fce-44b8-b585-f250ebd9d3fe_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:be7fd8ff-d328-4b79-9564-6950fc80f147"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32015378"}],"rdfs:label":"Zazo-Seco_Family 3_Case 4"},{"id":"cggv:565a0aa4-1faa-4af8-b6e8-bda1425253a2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:565a0aa4-1faa-4af8-b6e8-bda1425253a2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The proband was compound heterozygous for a frameshift variant, Val233AlafsTer11, which predicts a premature termination codon in exon 8 out of 23 exons in the PXDN gene, and the initiation codon variant, p.Met1?, confirmed in trans.

The role of peroxidasin during eye development is poorly understood. Here, we describe the first Pxdn mouse mutant which was induced by ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) and led to a recessive phenotype. Sequence analysis of cDNA revealed a T3816A mutation resulting in a premature stop codon (Cys1272X) in the peroxidase domain. This mutation causes severe anterior segment dysgenesis and microphthalmia resembling the manifestations in patients with PXDN mutations. The proliferation and differentiation of the lens is disrupted in association with aberrant expression of transcription factor genes (Pax6 and Foxe3) in mutant eyes. Additionally, Pxdn is involved in the consolidation of the basement membrane and lens epithelium adhesion in the ocular lens. Lens material including γ-crystallin is extruded into the anterior and posterior chamber due to local loss of structural integrity of the lens capsule as a secondary damage to the anterior segment development leading to congenital ocular inflammation. Moreover, Pxdn mutants exhibited an early-onset glaucoma and progressive retinal dysgenesis. Transcriptome profiling revealed that peroxidasin affects the transcription of developmental and eye disease-related genes at early eye development. These findings suggest that peroxidasin is necessary for cell proliferation and differentiation and for basement membrane consolidation during eye development.

It catalyzes the formation of the sulfilimine bond between methionine and hydroxylysine in Collagen IV, which may be necessary to reinforce the mechanical strength of ECM and maintain tissue integrity (PMID: 31817535). ASD7 is also associated with partial or total corneal opacification, microcornea, microphthalmia, cataract in humans.\n \n**PXDN** was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ASD7 in 2011 (Khan et al, 2011, PMID: 21907015). At least 15 nonsense,  frameshift, and missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n  \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 32499604, 35595447, 32015378, 21907015). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. \n \nSummary of experimental data (3 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models. **PXDN** is expressed in the corneal epithelial layer, lens epithelium in the adult mouse eye (PMID: 21907015). Two homozygous knock out mouse models of **Pxdn** recapitulate the human phenotype. An ENU-induced knock-out of **Pxdn** due to a nonsense variant in exon 17 leads to anterior segment dysgenesis in mice (PMID: 24895407). CRISPR-mediated knock-out of **Pxdn** in mice leads to severe defects in eye morphology including absence of lenses, eyelids and disorganized retinal structures (PMID: 31817535).    \n\nIn summary, **PXDN** is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ASD7. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
