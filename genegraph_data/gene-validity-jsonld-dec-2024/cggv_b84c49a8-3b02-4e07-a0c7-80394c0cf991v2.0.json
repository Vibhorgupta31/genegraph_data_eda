Although astonishing progress has been made in the identification of more than 50 genes for deafness during the past decade, the majority of deafness genes are yet to be identified. In this study, we mapped a previously unknown autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss locus (DFNB91) to chromosome 6p25 in a consanguineous Turkish family. The degree of hearing loss was moderate to severe in affected individuals. We subsequently identified a nonsense mutation (p.E245X) in SERPINB6, which is located within the linkage interval for DFNB91 and encodes for an intracellular protease inhibitor. The p.E245X mutation cosegregated in the family as a completely penetrant autosomal-recessive trait and was absent in 300 Turkish controls. The mRNA expression of SERPINB6 was reduced and production of protein was absent in the peripheral leukocytes of homozygotes, suggesting that the hearing loss is due to loss of function of SERPINB6. We also demonstrated that SERPINB6 was expressed primarily in the inner ear hair cells. We propose that SERPINB6 plays an important role in the inner ear in the protection against leakage of lysosomal content during stress and that loss of this protection results in cell death and sensorineural hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Sirmaci A","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A truncating mutation in SERPINB6 is associated with autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss."},"rdfs:label":"Detection of Serpinb6 in mouse inner ear"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a1725782-36ed-4b3a-8bb1-6e5f5f4a5876","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:161cfa1a-9add-4965-a178-21900be337a9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Western blot analysis of protein recovered from peripheral blood leukocytes in homozygous and heterozygous members of the family reveals that those who were heterozygous for the variant had reduced expression, and homozygotes had no expression of SERPINB6.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20451170","rdfs:label":"Relative concentrations of SERPINb6 from isolated blood leuk"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:b84c49a8-3b02-4e07-a0c7-80394c0cf991_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc2e21b5-3afd-4ef5-b87b-96acd2d50b8e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf1d40f3-8ca4-4042-9736-b48d91b73e70","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Transfected Hela cells with WT serpinb6 as well as mutant and the expression vectors and used LysoTracker Red to find that resistance to osmotic shock (made by replacing the culture media with molecular biology grade water was reduced in the cells with SERPINB6 deficiency.

Recessively inherited forms of HL are highly heterogeneous and account for a majority of prelingual deafness. The current study is designed to investigate genetic causes of HL in three consanguineous Pakistani families. After IRB approval, the clinical history and pure tone audiometric data was obtained for the clinical diagnosis of HL segregating in these three Pakistani families. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by Sanger sequencing in order to identify and validate the HL-associated pathogenic variants, respectively. The 3-D molecular modeling and the Ramachandran analysis of the identified missense variants were compiled to evaluate the impact of the variants on the encoded proteins. Clinical evaluation revealed prelingual severe to profound sensorineural HL segregating among the affected individuals in all three families.

Variants in SERPINB6 were shown to segregate with disease as well. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression in the developing inner ear, altered expression in patients, functional alteration in patients, and a mouse model phenocopying disease (PMIDs: 20451170, 23669344). In summary, SERPINB6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 10/5/2017 and reviewed again on 4/24/2018. It was reevaluated on 10/19/2022.
