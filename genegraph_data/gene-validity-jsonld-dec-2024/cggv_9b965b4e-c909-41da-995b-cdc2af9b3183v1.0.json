TMEM127 loss leads to increased mTOR signaling. However, the spectrum of tumors with TMEM127 mutation and how TMEM127 and mTOR interact in tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we report that germline TMEM127 mutations occur in RCCs and that some mutant proteins, unlike wild-type (WT) TMEM127, fail to cooperate with activated early endosomal GTPase, Rab5, to inhibit mTOR signaling. Tmem127-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are deficient in generating early-to-late hybrid endosomes upon constitutive Rab5 activation, a defect rescued by WT, but not mutant, TMEM127. This endosomal dysfunction results in diminished mTOR colocalization with Rab5-positive vesicles. Conversely, active, lysosomal-bound mTOR is increased in Tmem127-null MEFs, which also display enhanced lysosomal biogenesis. Our data map the tumor-suppressive properties of TMEM127 to modulation of mTOR function in the endolysosome, a feature that may contribute to both pheochromocytoma and RCC pathogenesis.

In a cohort of 103 samples, we detected truncating germline TMEM127 mutations in approximately 30% of familial tumors and about 3% of sporadic-appearing pheochromocytomas without a known genetic cause. The wild-type allele was consistently deleted in tumor DNA, suggesting a classic mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Pheochromocytomas with mutations in TMEM127 are transcriptionally related to tumors bearing NF1 mutations and, similarly, show hyperphosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) effector proteins. Accordingly, in vitro gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses indicate that TMEM127 is a negative regulator of mTOR. TMEM127 dynamically associates with the endomembrane system and colocalizes with perinuclear (activated) mTOR, suggesting a subcompartmental-specific effect.

However, there remain familial occurrences of pheochromocytoma without a known genetic defect. We describe here a familial pheochromocytoma syndrome consistent with digenic inheritance identified through a combination of global genomics strategies. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis revealed identical LOD scores of 2.97 for chromosome 2cen and 16p13 loci. A two-locus parametric linkage analysis produced maximum LOD score of 5.16 under a double recessive multiplicative model, suggesting that both loci are required to develop the disease. Allele-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected only at the chromosome 2 locus in all tumors from this family, consistent with a tumor suppressor gene. Four additional pheochromocytomas with a similar genetic pattern were identified through transcription profiling and helped refine the chromosome 2 locus. High-density LOH mapping with single nucleotide polymorphism-based array identified a total of 18 of 62 pheochromocytomas with LOH within the chromosome 2 region, which further narrowed down the locus to <2 cM. This finding provides evidence for two novel susceptibility loci for pheochromocytoma and adds a recessive digenic trait to the increasingly broad genetic heterogeneity of these tumors. Similarly, complex traits may also be involved in other familial cancer syndromes.","dc:creator":"Dahia PL","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Novel pheochromocytoma susceptibility loci identified by integrative genomics."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16266984","rdfs:label":"index"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This variant was detected in 2 separate families"},{"id":"cggv:7d258fd9-e54d-43dc-a2c6-629a66221bc1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:29af9237-4865-4ee9-88d6-93a60ac5c903","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":54,"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0002666","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:7d258fd9-e54d-43dc-a2c6-629a66221bc1_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:be61d4df-3aab-4356-922c-b2bff1ec70b3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017849.4(TMEM127):c.248del (p.Phe83SerfsTer3)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA165536"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20154675"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20154675","rdfs:label":"F6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This variant was found in a family of two affected family members without pedigree provided.

TMEM127 [MIM# 613403] gene encodes the transmembrane protein 127. Heterozygous germline loss of function variants in TMEM127 were first described in 2005 [Dahia PL, et al.; PMID 16266984]. The LOH (loss of heterozygosity) at the TMEM127 locus in tumors examined suggests TMEM127 is a tumor suppressor gene. Genetic evidence from studies on familial and patients with sporadic Pheochromocytomas, as well as RCC are used in this curation [PMID 16266984, 25389632, 20154675 and 28384794]. \nExperimental evidences such as reduced TMEM127 transcription levels of TMEM127-mutant tumor samples in Pheochromocytomas and Renal cell carcinomas; reduced mTOR signaling, enlarged cells, reduced vesicles and/or increased cell growth compared to non mutant controls in various human cells and murine model cells with reduced or depleted TMEM127 are included for this curation.  Evidence that the enlarged cells and increased cell proliferation were rescued by enforced expression of TMEM127  is also included [PMID 20154675, 21156949, 24334765]. In summary, TMEM127 gene is definitely associated with autosomal dominant HPGL/PCC syndrome, most commonly pheochromocytoma. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9b965b4e-c909-41da-995b-cdc2af9b3183"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
