We report a knockin α2-chimaerin mouse (Chn1KI/KI) that models DRS. Whole embryo imaging of Chn1KI/KI mice revealed stalled abducens nerve growth and selective trochlear and first cervical spinal nerve guidance abnormalities. Stalled abducens nerve bundles did not reach the orbit, resulting in secondary aberrant misinnervation of the lateral rectus muscle by the oculomotor nerve. By contrast, Chn1KO/KO mice did not have DRS, and embryos displayed abducens nerve wandering distinct from the Chn1KI/KI phenotype. Murine embryos lacking EPH receptor A4 (Epha4KO/KO), which is upstream of α2-chimaerin in corticospinal neurons, exhibited similar abducens wandering that paralleled previously reported gait alterations in Chn1KO/KO and Epha4KO/KO adult mice. Findings from Chn1KI/KI Epha4KO/KO mice demonstrated that mutant α2-chimaerin and EphA4 have different genetic interactions in distinct motor neuron pools: abducens neurons use bidirectional ephrin signaling via mutant α2-chimaerin to direct growth, while cervical spinal neurons use only ephrin forward signaling, and trochlear neurons do not use ephrin signaling. These findings reveal a role for ephrin bidirectional signaling upstream of mutant α2-chimaerin in DRS, which may contribute to the selective vulnerability of abducens motor neurons in this disorder.","dc:creator":"Nugent AA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutant α2-chimaerin signals via bidirectional ephrin pathways in Duane retraction syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"knockin α2-chimaerin mouse (Chn1KI/KI) that models DRS"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Whole embryo imaging of CHN1KI/KI mice revealed stalled abducens nerve growth and selective trochlear and first cervical spine nerve guidance abnormalities.

Duane retraction syndrome 2 is a congenital disorder characterized by restricted horizontal eye movement with globe retraction and palpebral fissure narrowing on attempted adduction. 12 missense variants that have been reported in 13 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 18653847, 21555619, 21715346, 29031989, 33004823) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity has been reported to be gain of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model (PMID: 28346224). In summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between CHN1 and Duane retraction syndrome 2. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations GCEP on the meeting date December July 26, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c19544e0-2fb1-4d8a-b1ad-f493068f76bb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
