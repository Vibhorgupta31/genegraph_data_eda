Development of an accurate diagnostic test for presymptomatic detection of individuals at risk is an urgent requisition for this condition. Herein, we report mapping of a new adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) locus on 5q22.1 (GLC1G) and identification of its defective gene. Mutation screening of seven candidate genes from the GLC1G critical region (approximately 2 Mb between D5S1466 and D5S2051) identified only one significant alteration in the WDR36 (WD40-repeat 36) gene. This mutation (i.e. D658G) was segregated in all affected members of our first GLC1G-linked family but it was absent in 476 normal control chromosomes. Further screening of WDR36 in a total of 130 POAG families revealed 24 DNA variations. Overall, four mutations (N355S, A449T, R529Q and D658G) were identified in 17 (5.02-6.92%) unrelated POAG subjects, 11 with high-pressure and six with low-pressure glaucoma. These mutations were absent in a minimum of 200 normal control chromosomes and, further they were conserved between WDR36 orthologues in mouse, rat, dog, chimp and human. WDR36 is a novel gene with 23 exons, which encodes for 951 amino acids and a protein with multiple G-beta WD40 repeats. By northern blotting, two distinct mRNA transcripts of 5.9 and 2.5 kb were observed in human heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. WDR36 gene expression in lens, iris, sclera, ciliary muscles, ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, retina and optic nerve were established by RT-PCR. In mouse, two transcripts of 3.5 and 2.9 kb showed analogous expression patterns to human. mRNA expressions were detected in 7-, 11-, 15- and 17-day-old developing mouse embryos. In summary, WDR36 is a novel causative gene for adult-onset POAG at the GLC1G locus. Specific ocular expressions and observed mutations are consistent with WDR36 role in etiology of both high- and low-pressure glaucoma.","dc:creator":"Monemi S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Identification of a novel adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) gene on 5q22.1."},"rdfs:label":"Monemi_expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The evidence is not scored any points as the expression is ubiquitous."},{"id":"cggv:3270c344-e555-4c68-8c82-d2c4023d5176","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f57074b5-a371-4b02-b3ce-b5ee69ee718c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The study does not provide evidence for the function of WDR36 protein.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21850170","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To investigate the role of multigenic variation in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) involving the rRNA processing gene WD repeat domain 36 (WDR36).","dc:creator":"Footz T","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Co-variation of STI1 and WDR36/UTP21 alters cell proliferation in a glaucoma model."},"rdfs:label":"Footz_WDR36 modifier"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The study assessed the modifier effect of STI1 in the context of WDR36 variation; however, does not provide evidence for the function of WDR36."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:173858d9-f695-470f-b8b0-22940c60c074_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2b435a3-0baf-4e9d-98c4-b287a5e9fab2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:849d2aa6-5831-4c0e-88a7-b0118f90b3d9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Intra-ocular pressure measurement was similar in WT and mutant mice. ~25% reduction in the peripheral retina thickness was observed for del605–607 mice compared with the WT mice.

POAG is defined by cell death of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and surrounding neuronal cells at higher or normal intraocular pressure (IOP). Coded by one of the three genes responsible for POAG, WD repeat-containing protein 36 (WDR36) has two domains with a similar folding. To address whether WDR36 is functionally important in the retina, we developed four transgenic mice strains overexpressing a wild-type (Wt) and three mutant variants of D606G, deletion of amino acids at positions 605-607 (Del605-607) and at 601-640 (Del601-640) equivalent to the location of the D658G mutation observed in POAG patients. A triple amino acid deletion of mouse Wdr36 at positions 605-607 corresponding to the deletion at positions 657-659 in humans developed progressive retinal degeneration at the peripheral retina with normal IOP. RGCs and connecting amacrine cell synapses were affected at the peripheral retina. Axon outgrowth rate of cultured RGC directly isolated from transgenic animal was significantly reduced by the Wdr36 mutation compared with Wt. Molecular modeling of wild and mutant mouse Wdr36 revealed that deletion at positions 605-607 removed three residues and a hydrogen bond, required to stabilize anti-parallel β-sheet of the 6th β-propeller in the second domain. We concluded that WDR36 plays an important functional role in the retina homeostasis and mutation to this gene can cause devastating retinal damage.

Utp21 is cell essential and functions in the nucleolar processing of 18S rRNA, which is required for ribosome biogenesis. Evidence for functional homology comes from sequence alignment, ubiquitous expression, sub-cellular localization to the nucleolus and loss-of-function phenotypes that include defects in 18S rRNA processing and abnormal nucleolar morphology. Additionally, we show that loss of Wdr36 function leads to an activation of the p53 stress-response pathway, suggesting that co-inheritance of defects in p53 pathway genes may influence the impact of WDR36 variants on POAG.

The study reported linkage to WDR36 in 7 families with primary open angle glaucoma and identifed four variants that were predicted to be disease causing. However, the variants are not supported by functional evidence -- they are found at relatively high population frequencies in gnomAD. \n\nThis gene-disease association has been studied in several case-control studies (PMID: 28658128, 29104481, 22025897, 18172102, 16723468, 19347049, 29540704, 17353431, 28282485, 19875670, 16876519); however, statistical significance was not reached in most. A meta-analysis (Liu et al, 2017; PMID: 28658128) including 5 individual studies reported no statistically significant association of WDR36 variants with primary open angle glaucoma.  \n\nWDR36 is expressed ubiquitously, including th eye (PMID: 15677485). The function of WDR36 is not clearly understood, but animal studies suggest a role in eye development. Zebrafish and mouse models show head and eye phenotypes (PMID: 20631153, 18469340); however, they are non-specific and do not support the role of WDR36 variation in glaucoma. With an unclear role for this gene in glaucoma, it is thought to have a modifier effect in disease (PMID: 29104481). \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between WDR36 and autosomal dominant primary open angle glaucoma has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role WDR36 plays in glaucoma, but based on the evidence avaialble at this time, the gene is disputed as a monogenic cause of glaucoma. \nThe causal role of WDR36 variants in human disease is not clearly established. No human patients with glaucoma are reported in the literature to carry pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in WDR36. Case-control studies do not show enrichment of variants in cases vs controls and a meta analysis revealed no statistical significance in the association of WDR36 variants with glaucoma. While studies in animal models show that WDR36 may have a functional role in eye development, none of the models develop the expected glaucoma phenotype. Based on these observations, the WDR36-primary open angle glaucoma gene-disease relationship is disputed.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:173858d9-f695-470f-b8b0-22940c60c074"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
