By differential display technique, we tried to identify molecules that are expressed earlier than cardiac transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5 and GATA-4 and are involved in cardiomyocyte differentiation using the P19CL6 cell line, which efficiently differentiates into cardiomyocytes when treated with dimethyl sulfoxide. We isolated a novel gene designated Midori. Its deduced amino acid sequence contained an ATP/GTP-binding site, Ig-like domain, and Kringle-like domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of Midori was restricted to the fetal and adult heart and adult skeletal muscle in mice. In whole mount in situ hybridization, Midori was expressed in cardiac crescent and developing heart but not in somites. The MIDORI protein was localized in the nucleus and overexpression of Midori induced expression of endogenous Midori itself, suggesting that MIDORI may act as a transcriptional regulator. Permanent P19CL6 cell lines overexpressing Midori more efficiently differentiated into cardiomyocytes than did parental cells, whereas those overexpressing the antisense Midori less efficiently differentiated. These results suggest that Midori may promote the differentiation of P19CL6 into cardiomyocytes.","dc:creator":"Hosoda T","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A novel myocyte-specific gene Midori promotes the differentiation of P19CL6 cells into cardiomyocytes."},"rdfs:label":"Hosoda Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:abb492b0-031c-4bb6-8cc6-d0e21e36b9cd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f80b3a0a-fa00-4b69-9890-c3a5033ec90c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Provides initial evidence of the importance of ALPK3 to heart development, by both in vitro and in vivo methods.

encodes for protein α-kinase 3, an essential cardiac pseudokinase which functions to aid in myosin-mediated force buffering and sarcomere proteostasis. ALPK3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant HCM in 2018 (Jaouadi et al., 2018 PMID: 30046096). At least 38 variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) have been reported in probands in five publications (PMIDs: 34263907, 32480058, 30046096, 33191771, 37973666) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregate in at least three families. Two case-control studies showed that the proportion of ALPK3 loss-of-function variants in cardiomyopathy cohorts was significantly higher than control cohorts. More evidence is available in the literature, however, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is loss of function and this gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function, expression, and an animal model (PMIDs: 11418590, 36321451, and McNamara et al., 2023). In summary, ALPK3 has a strong association with autosomal dominant HCM; this has been demonstrated in both research and clinical settings. An analysis will be performed separately to determine the strength of evidence for ALPK3 in an autosomal recessive cardiomyopathy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP on December 19, 2023.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ace85164-0b70-46a2-ac6b-253088f4514d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
