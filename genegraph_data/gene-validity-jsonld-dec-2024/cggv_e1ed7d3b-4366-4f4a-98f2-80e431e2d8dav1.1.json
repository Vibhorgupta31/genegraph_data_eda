To investigate, in vivo, the regulation of the expression, assembly, and function of the alpha3alpha4alpha5(IV) protomer, we have generated a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic line of mice carrying the human COL4A3-COL4A4 locus.

The co-assembly of the human and mouse chains into a hybrid network in the GBM restores a functional GBM and rescues the Alport phenotype, providing further evidence that defective assembly of the alpha3-alpha4-alpha5(IV) protomer, caused by mutations in any of the three chains, is the pathogenic mechanism responsible for the disease.

These nephropathies invariably present with microscopic hematuria and frequently progress to proteinuria and CKD or ESRD during long-term follow-up. Nonetheless, the exact molecular mechanisms by which these mutations exert their deleterious effects on the glomerulus remain elusive. We hypothesized that defective trafficking of the COL4A3 chain causes a strong intracellular effect on the cell responsible for COL4A3 expression, the podocyte. To this end, we overexpressed normal and mutant COL4A3 chains (G1334E mutation) in human undifferentiated podocytes and tested their effects in various intracellular pathways using a microarray approach. COL4A3 overexpression in the podocyte caused chain retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that was associated with activation of unfolded protein response (UPR)-related markers of ER stress. Notably, the overexpression of normal or mutant COL4A3 chains differentially activated the UPR pathway. Similar results were observed in a novel knockin mouse carrying the Col4a3-G1332E mutation, which produced a phenotype consistent with AS, and in biopsy specimens from patients with TBMN carrying a heterozygous COL4A3-G1334E mutation. These results suggest that ER stress arising from defective localization of collagen IV chains in human podocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of TBMN and AS through activation of the UPR, a finding that may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions for a variety of collagenopathies.

Changes in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in AS suggest that the type IV collagen matrix, the major structural component of GBM, is disrupted. We recently isolated the genes for two type IV collagens, alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV), that are encoded head-to-head on human chromosome 2. These chains are abundant in normal GBM but are sometimes absent in AS. We screened for mutations in families in which consanguinity suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Homozygous mutations were found in alpha 3(IV) in two families and in alpha 4(IV) in two others, demonstrating that these chains are important in the structural integrity of the GBM and that there is an autosomal form of AS in addition to the previously-defined X-linked form.","dc:creator":"Mochizuki T","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Identification of mutations in the alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV)

We aimed to investigate the distribution of gene mutations in adult patients with primary FSGS/SRNS by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS).","dc:creator":"Gast

*COL4A3* gene is located on chromosome 2 at q36.3 and encodes the protein collagen alpha-3(IV) chain. *COL4A3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Alport Syndrome in 1994 (Mochizuki et al., PMID: 7987396). Alport syndrome is characterized by hearing loss, anterior lenticonus, and glomerular basement membrane defects that may progress to end-stage kidney disease. Patients often present with hematuria and worsening proteinuria. Kidney biopsy may identify focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and thin glomerular basement membranes with abnormal ultrastructure. Autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported, leading to an isolated renal phenotype of hematuria, with or without structural changes and progressive disease course. Case reports of digenic inheritance with *COL4A4* or *COL4A5* variants also exist. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism between the reported disease entities and noted that affected families show phenotypic variability with variable expressivity. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into a single disease entity, Alport syndrome 3, autosomal dominant (OMIM:104200), Alport syndrome 2, autosomal recessive (OMIM:203780) and Hematuria, benign familial (OMIM:141200). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘Alport Spectrum - *COL4A3*’. Twenty three variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 17 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 33532864, PMID: 33838161, PMID: 26346198, PMID: 7987396 ) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models (PMID: 32743880, PMID: 16775036, PMID: 33718859, PMID: 14507670), expression studies (PMID: 33718859, PMID: 28495876), and *in vitro* functional assays (PMID: 24262798, PMID: 14633121). In summary, *COL4A3* is definitively associated with Alport Spectrum. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e1ed7d3b-4366-4f4a-98f2-80e431e2d8da"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
