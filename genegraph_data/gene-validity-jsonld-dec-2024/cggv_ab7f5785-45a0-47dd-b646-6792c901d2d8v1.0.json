Impairment of this enzyme in humans results in one of two clinically distinct forms of epimerase-deficiency galactosemia-one benign, the other severe. The molecular and biochemical distinction between these disorders remains unknown. To enable structural and functional studies of both wild-type and patient-derived alleles of human GALE (hGALE), we have developed and applied a null-background yeast expression system for the human enzyme. We have demonstrated that wild-type hGALE sequences phenotypically complement a yeast gal10 deletion, and we have biochemically characterized the wild-type human enzyme isolated from these cells. Furthermore, we have expressed and characterized two mutant alleles, L183P-hGALE and N34S-hGALE, both derived from a patient with no detectable GALE activity in red blood cells but with approximately 14% activity in cultured lymphoblasts. Analyses of crude extracts of yeast expressing L183P-hGALE demonstrated 4% wild-type activity and 6% wild-type abundance. Extracts of yeast expressing N34S-hGALE demonstrated approximately 70% wild-type activity and normal abundance. However, yeast coexpressing both L183P-hGALE and N34S-hGALE exhibited only approximately 7% wild-type levels of activity, thereby confirming the functional impact of both substitutions and raising the intriguing possibility that some form of dominant-negative interaction may exist between the mutant alleles found in this patient. The results reported here establish the utility of the yeast-based hGALE-expression system and set the stage for more-detailed studies of this important enzyme and its role in epimerase-deficiency galactosemia.","dc:creator":"Quimby BB","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Characterization of two mutations associated with epimerase-deficiency galactosemia, by use of a yeast expression system for human UDP-galactose-4-epimerase."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab7f5785-45a0-47dd-b646-6792c901d2d8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab7f5785-45a0-47dd-b646-6792c901d2d8_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:6e2c18a9-b4c2-4996-8b5c-7391ce34815f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e2c18a9-b4c2-4996-8b5c-7391ce34815f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":38,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:59b66868-21cb-4e0f-bd69-5d6161348f04","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001008216.2(GALE):c.668T>C (p.Leu223Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA339008483"}},{"id":"cggv:3304f249-fb02-4192-b51f-472ed700f5e4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001008216.2(GALE):c.382G>A (p.Val128Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA685672"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal bleeding, macrothrombocytopenia, gray platelets, Mental retardation, Mitral valve prolapse and mitral insufficiency, Equine foot, Jaundice, Hepatomegaly","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:56e64e29-bf09-49e1-934b-51cf75825a48_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3304f249-fb02-4192-b51f-472ed700f5e4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36395340","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Glycosylation is recognized as a key process for proper megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation. The enzyme uridine diphosphate (UDP)-galactose-4-epimerase, encoded by GALE, is involved in galactose metabolism and protein glycosylation. Here, we studied 3 patients from 2 unrelated families who showed lifelong severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding diathesis, mental retardation, mitral valve prolapse, and jaundice. Whole-exome sequencing revealed 4 variants that affect GALE, 3 of those previously unreported (Pedigree A, p.Lys78ValfsX32 and p.Thr150Met; Pedigree B, p.Val128Met; and p.Leu223Pro). Platelet phenotype analysis showed giant and/or grey platelets, impaired platelet aggregation, and severely reduced alpha and dense granule secretion. Enzymatic activity of the UDP-galactose-4-epimerase enzyme was severely decreased in all patients. Immunoblotting of platelet lysates revealed reduced GALE protein levels, a significant decrease in N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc), showing a hypoglycosylation pattern, reduced surface expression of gylcoprotein Ibα-IX-V (GPIbα-IX-V) complex and mature β1 integrin, and increased apoptosis. In vitro studies performed with patients-derived megakaryocytes showed normal ploidy and maturation but decreased proplatelet formation because of the impaired glycosylation of the GPIbα and β1 integrin, and reduced externalization to megakaryocyte and platelet membranes. Altered distribution of filamin A and actin and delocalization of the von Willebrand factor were also shown. Overall, this study expands our knowledge of GALE-related thrombocytopenia and emphasizes the critical role of GALE in the physiological glycosylation of key proteins involved in platelet production and function.","dc:creator":"Marín-Quílez A","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Novel variants in GALE cause syndromic macrothrombocytopenia by disrupting glycosylation and thrombopoiesis."}},{"id":"cggv:e8f86adf-9854-4182-9149-402fd5510638_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:59b66868-21cb-4e0f-bd69-5d6161348f04"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36395340"}],"rdfs:label":"Marín-Quílez_2023_B.II.2"},{"id":"cggv:e8f86adf-9854-4182-9149-402fd5510638","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8f86adf-9854-4182-9149-402fd5510638_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e8f86adf-9854-4182-9149-402fd5510638_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"decreased glycosylation (shown, blue), immunoblotting showed 35% protein levels, reduction in GPIbα (~10%) and mature/glycosylated β1 integrin (~1%), altered filaminA/actrin distribution in patient MKs\n"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:56e64e29-bf09-49e1-934b-51cf75825a48","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56e64e29-bf09-49e1-934b-51cf75825a48_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:56e64e29-bf09-49e1-934b-51cf75825a48_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"decreased glycosylation (shown, blue), immunoblotting showed 35% protein levels, reduction in GPIbα (~10%) and mature/glycosylated β1 integrin (~1%), altered filaminA/actrin distribution in patient MKs"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:38d5eecc-cc68-4007-9311-1946841e66a8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38d5eecc-cc68-4007-9311-1946841e66a8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":24,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:84ec9196-fddc-49f6-b249-fedb4797a97c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001008216.2(GALE):c.1004G>A (p.Arg335His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA685396"}},{"id":"cggv:dbc2f250-c166-4d9f-af8a-a39d2c2e6132","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001008216.2(GALE):c.715C>T (p.Arg239Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341699"}}],"detectionMethod":"PCR + RFLP","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0012024","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"severely reduced GALE activity in RBCs (6.2) millimol/hr/gHb [29.47 mean in controls].

Three of the individuals were successfully treated by bone marrow transplant. Whole-exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping of multiple family members, coupled with whole-genome sequencing to reveal shared non-coding variants, revealed one potentially functional variant segregating with thrombocytopenia under a recessive model: GALE p.R51W (c.C151T, NM_001127621). The mutation is extremely rare (allele frequency = 2.5 × 10-05), and the likelihood of the observed co-segregation occurring by chance is 1.2 × 10-06. GALE encodes UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, an enzyme of galactose metabolism and glycosylation responsible for two reversible reactions: interconversion of UDP-galactose with UDP-glucose and interconversion of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The mutation alters an amino acid residue that is conserved from yeast to humans. The variant protein has both significantly lower enzymatic activity for both interconversion reactions and highly significant thermal instability. Proper glycosylation is critical to normal hematopoiesis, in particular to megakaryocyte and platelet development, as reflected in the presence of thrombocytopenia in the context of congenital disorders of glycosylation. Mutations in GALE have not previously been associated with thrombocytopenia. Our results suggest that GALE p.R51W is inadequate for normal glycosylation and thereby may impair megakaryocyte and platelet development. If other mutations in GALE are shown to have similar consequences, this gene may be proven to play a critical role in hematopoiesis.","dc:creator":"Seo A","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Inherited thrombocytopenia associated with mutation of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (GALE)."}},"rdfs:label":"IV.1"},{"id":"cggv:ab437319-5076-4a4a-88f6-516bd9d4618c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab437319-5076-4a4a-88f6-516bd9d4618c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ab437319-5076-4a4a-88f6-516bd9d4618c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Decreased enzyme activity, increased thermal instability "}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This variant was downscored for homozygosity in a consanguineous family "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:05c35bbb-25d3-472e-bd60-b87ae8325803_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05c35bbb-25d3-472e-bd60-b87ae8325803","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":31,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:7031c83a-38db-4aa5-b017-5fc92e47b677","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001008216.2(GALE):c.493G>A (p.Glu165Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA685656"}},{"id":"cggv:2088af4e-059c-4502-a067-5114de011334"}],"detectionMethod":"PCR + RFLP","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0012024","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"severely reduced GALE activity in RBCs (1.7) millimol/hr/gHb [29.47 mean in controls].

Implementation of molecular genetics diagnostic tools and GALT enzyme assays are instrumental in distinguishing classic galactosemia from clinical and biochemical variant forms of GALT deficiency. Better understanding of mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic variation even within the same genotype is essential to provide appropriate counseling for families.

Galactose epimerase deficiency is described in the literature as a spectrum with general, peripheral, and intermediate forms. The general form of the disease is associated with markedly decreased enzyme activity in all tissues in addition to hypotonia, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and developmental delays. Immediate dietary intervention by putting patients on a galactose/lactose-free diet can help prevent further development of these symptoms. The peripheral form is accompanied by enzyme activity deficient in blood cells and normal in other tissues. The intermediate form is similarly demonstrated by deficiency in blood cells, yet can have up to 50% enzyme activity in other tissues (GeneReviews, PMID: 20301295). Recently, thrombocytopenia has been reported as an additional feature of this disease in multiple affected families, and has been recognized as part of the expanded phenotype of galactose epimerase deficiency (PMIDs:7562286, 36395340). \n\n19 variants (17 missense, 2 frameshift) that have been reported in 15 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 36395340, 34159722, 30247636, 36056436, 16301867, 9326324) are included in this curation. Recurrent variant V94M is associated with an especially severe phenotype (PMIDs:36056436, 28247339, 9973283). One consanguineous family with a history of thrombocytopenia was reported in association with the *GALE* variant c.151C>T (p.Arg51Trp). The variant segregated with the disease in 5 affected and 10 unaffected individuals (Estimated LOD score: 4.26, PMID:30247636). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (if applicable. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical assays, functional alteration experiments, model systems, and rescue evidence (PMIDs: 28877911, 20519568, 3948246, 29409891, 7305435). First, *GALE* is known to encode the galactose epimerase enzyme. A deficiency in this enzyme would lead to excess of galactose products according to the Leloir pathway, which is consistent with hypergalactosemia observed in patients with *GALE* deficiency (PMID:7305435). Next, *GALT* is a gene that encodes a separate protein within the Leloir pathway, and is classified as definitely associated with hereditary galactosemia by the General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP (PMID:29409891). Yeast cells with the homolog GAL10 gene removed were functionally altered compared to control cells, as they failed to grow on galactose-based media, which reiterates the importance of this protein in the conversion of galactose to glucose (PMID:3948246). An shRNA knockdown of gale in mice was included as part of this curation, but not scored due to low phenotypic overlap with the disease and absence of gale enzymatic testing (PMID:28877911). An entire cohort (100%) of drosophila with Gale deficiency (and 2 LOF alleles) died within the embryonic stage. Drosophila with partial Gale deficiency (1 LOF allele) survived into adulthood, but could only survive if fed a galactose-free diet. Humans with gale epimerase deficiency can have developmental delays, and can see improvement in symptoms by removing galactose from the diet. When a human copy of *GALE* was inserted into the null Gale drosophila, enzyme activity was restored to wildtype, and survival frequency was also rescued to wild-type levels (PMID:20519568).\n\nIn summary, *GALE* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive galactose epimerase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism on the meeting date 8/25/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ab7f5785-45a0-47dd-b646-6792c901d2d8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
