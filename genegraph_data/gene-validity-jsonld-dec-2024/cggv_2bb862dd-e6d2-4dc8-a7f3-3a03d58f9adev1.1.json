In both mice and humans, loss of function of either gene is associated with ossification defects of the skull vault, although the major effect is on the frontal bones in mice and the parietal bones in humans. This study was undertaken to discover whether Alx4 and Msx2 show a genetic interaction in skull vault ossification, and to test the hypothesis that they interact with the pathway that includes the Fgfr genes, Twist1 and Runx2. We generated Alx4(+/-)/Msx2(+/-) double heterozygous mutant mice, interbred them to produce compound genotypes and analysed the genotype-phenotype relationships. Loss of an increasing number of alleles correlated with an incremental exacerbation of the skull vault defect; loss of Alx4 function had a marginally greater effect than loss of Msx2 and also affected skull thickness. In situ hybridization showed that Alx4 and Msx2 are expressed in the cranial skeletogenic mesenchyme and in the growing calvarial bones. Studies of the coronal suture region at embryonic day (E)16.5 revealed that Alx4 expression was decreased, but not abolished, in Msx2(-/-) mutants, and vice versa; expression of Fgfr2 and Fgfr1, but not Twist1, was reduced in both mutants at the same stage. Runx2 expression was unaffected in the coronal suture; in contrast, expression of the downstream ossification marker Spp1 was delayed. Double homozygous pups showed substantial reduction of alkaline phosphatase expression throughout the mineralized skull vault; they died at birth due to defects of the heart, lungs and diaphragm not previously associated with Alx4 or Msx2. Our observations suggest that Alx4 and Msx2 are partially functionally redundant, acting within a network of transcription factors and signalling events that regulate the rate of osteogenic proliferation and differentiation at a stage after the commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to osteogenesis.","dc:creator":"Antonopoulou I","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Alx4 and Msx2 play phenotypically similar and additive roles in skull vault differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Expression study MSX2 ALX4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2bb862dd-e6d2-4dc8-a7f3-3a03d58f9ade_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:489832e2-f60b-4684-b7f5-e91108bf9f5f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4fe716b7-b8d6-4dbd-a4c6-4cd2522081bc","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"We carried out gel shift assays using a canonical Msx2 DNA-binding site as probe.

Enlarged parietal foramina (PFM) are oval defects of the parietal bones caused by deficient ossification around the parietal notch, which is normally obliterated during the fifth fetal month. PFM are usually asymptomatic, but may be associated with headache, scalp defects and structural or vascular malformations of the brain. Inheritance is frequently autosomal dominant, but no causative mutations have been identified in non-syndromic cases. We describe here heterozygous mutations of the homeobox gene MSX2 (located on 5q34-q35) in three unrelated families with PFM. One is a deletion of approximately 206 kb including the entire gene and the others are intragenic mutations of the DNA-binding homeodomain (RK159-160del and R172H) that predict disruption of critical intramolecular and DNA contacts. Mouse Msx2 protein with either of the homeodomain mutations exhibited more than 85% reduction in binding to an optimal Msx2 DNA-binding site. Our findings contrast with the only described MSX2 homeodomain mutation (P148H), associated with craniosynostosis, that binds with enhanced affinity to the same target. This demonstrates that MSX2 dosage is critical for human skull development and suggests that PFM and craniosynostosis result, respectively, from loss and gain of activity in an MSX2-mediated pathway of calvarial osteogenic differentiation.","dc:creator":"Wilkie AO","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Functional haploinsufficiency of the human homeobox gene MSX2 causes defects in skull ossification."},"rdfs:label":"c.475_480del and c.515G>A functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Used to upgrade case level data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:2bb862dd-e6d2-4dc8-a7f3-3a03d58f9ade_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f14bcc72-d214-490e-8d14-284231474ea2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dae2a84d-8a46-45ac-8742-83dbdafcd2ba","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Phenotypes observed in mice overlap with patients with PFM","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15198690","rdfs:label":"Alx4 and Msx2 in skull development"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The phenotype is not well recapitulated however it does represent skull involvement."},{"id":"cggv:836e5d7a-a0db-4d7c-b249-cb8fd0a6df27","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:878fa98b-3109-4bc5-97c1-53fb960177b7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"While these phenotypes both involve the skull, the mouse phenotype does not recapitulate that seen in humans.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10742104","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The composite structure of the mammalian skull, which forms predominantly via intramembranous ossification, requires precise pre- and post-natal growth regulation of individual calvarial elements. Disturbances of this process frequently cause severe clinical manifestations in humans. Enhanced DNA binding by a mutant MSX2 homeodomain results in a gain of function and produces craniosynostosis in humans. Here we show that Msx2-deficient mice have defects of skull ossification and persistent calvarial foramen. This phenotype results from defective proliferation of osteoprogenitors at the osteogenic front during calvarial morphogenesis, and closely resembles that associated with human MSX2 haploinsufficiency in parietal foramina (PFM). Msx2-/- mice also have defects in endochondral bone formation. In the axial and appendicular skeleton, post-natal deficits in Pth/Pthrp receptor (Pthr) signalling and in expression of marker genes for bone differentiation indicate that Msx2 is required for both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Consistent with phenotypes associated with PFM, Msx2-mutant mice also display defective tooth, hair follicle and mammary gland development, and seizures, the latter accompanied by abnormal development of the cerebellum. Most Msx2-mutant phenotypes, including calvarial defects, are enhanced by genetic combination with Msx1 loss of function, indicating that Msx gene dosage can modify expression of the PFM phenotype.

One of the proteins known to be involved in skull development is the MSX2 homeobox protein. Previously, MSX2 has been shown to be mutated in patients suffering from Boston type craniosynostosis. We have now analyzed the MSX2 gene in five families affected with FPP. An intragenic microsatellite marker did not reveal any recombination and a cumulated LOD score of +3.2 at theta = 0 was obtained. Sequence analysis further showed that in four out of five families an MSX2 mutation was responsible for the skull defect. Moreover, it appears that FPP is caused by haplo-insufficiency of the MSX2 gene.

We analysed ALX4 and MSX2 in 11 new unrelated cases or families with PFM/CB, 181 cases of CRS, and a single family segregating a submicroscopic deletion of 11p11.2, including ALX4. We explored the correlations between skull defect size and age, gene, and mutation type, and reviewed additional phenotypic manifestations. Four PFM cases had mutations in either ALX4 or MSX2; including previous families, we have identified six ALX4 and six MSX2 mutations, accounting for 11/13 familial, but only 1/6 sporadic cases. The deletion family confirms the delineation of a mental retardation locus to within 1.1 Mb region of 11p11.2.

This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/8/2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2bb862dd-e6d2-4dc8-a7f3-3a03d58f9ade"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
