Deletions have been reported in PTCHD1 however there has been little information available regarding the clinical presentation of these individuals. Herein we present 23 individuals with PTCHD1 deletions or truncating mutations with detailed phenotypic descriptions. The results suggest that individuals with disruption of the PTCHD1 coding region may have subtle dysmorphic features including a long face, prominent forehead, puffy eyelids and a thin upper lip. They do not have a consistent pattern of associated congenital anomalies or growth abnormalities. They have mild to moderate global developmental delay, variable degrees of ID, and many have prominent behavioral issues. Over 40% of subjects have ASD or ASD-like behaviors. The only consistent neurological findings in our cohort are orofacial hypotonia and mild motor incoordination. Our findings suggest that hemizygous PTCHD1 loss of function causes an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong propensity to autistic behaviors. Detailed neuropsychological studies are required to better define the cognitive and behavioral phenotype.

Variants in SETD5, ATRX, CUL4B, MECP2, and ARID1B were the most common causes of ID. This study assessed the value of sequencing a cohort of probands to provide a molecular diagnosis of ID, without the availability of DNA from both parents for de novo sequence analysis. This modeling is clinically relevant as 28% of all UK families with dependent children are single parent households. In conclusion, to diagnose patients with ID in the absence of parental DNA, we recommend investigation of all LoF variants in known genes that cause ID and assessment of a limited list of proven pathogenic missense variants in these genes. This will provide 11% additional diagnostic yield beyond the 10%-15% yield from array CGH alone.","dc:creator":"Grozeva D","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Analysis of 1,000 Individuals with Intellectual Disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350204","rdfs:label":"UK10K_FINDWGA5410926"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Frameshifting variant detected in last exon; although predicted to escape NMD, upgraded to a score of 1 because the variant is predicted to result in truncation of a substantial part of the protein."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:05d36fe2-0026-4bbc-af4b-6d952490969b_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a910ca9f-e0d5-408a-8973-da4b572b4b6b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f511a590-c4d8-4947-bb67-5d18da23b959","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001263"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a910ca9f-e0d5-408a-8973-da4b572b4b6b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:92d75c81-e976-4c79-a2d9-0dfe90aaa15a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_173495.2(PTCHD1):c.1444delC (p.Leu482Tyrfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/209087"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25131214"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25131214","rdfs:label":"Proband 1-Family P"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:549fec86-ca7c-43d6-b031-a0477e7ab4c4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bbedc87a-d052-4a33-9e99-3dc65a6159e7","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001249","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:549fec86-ca7c-43d6-b031-a0477e7ab4c4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:fc86bb31-7061-4280-bc71-8196d3cef5b5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_173495.2(PTCHD1):c.1835_1839delTGTTGinsGAA (p.Met612Argfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/208739"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25356970","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Diagnostic exome sequencing was immediately successful in diagnosing patients in whom traditional technologies were uninformative.

It is one of the most highly heritable of the complex disorders, although the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown. Here, we report mutations in the X-chromosome PTCHD1 (patched-related) gene in seven families with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and in three families with intellectual disability. A 167-kilobase microdeletion spanning exon 1 was found in two brothers, one with ASD and the other with a learning disability and ASD features; a 90-kilobase microdeletion spanning the entire gene was found in three males with intellectual disability in a second family. In 900 probands with ASD and 208 male probands with intellectual disability, we identified seven different missense changes (in eight male probands) that were inherited from unaffected mothers and not found in controls. Two of the ASD individuals with missense changes also carried a de novo deletion at another ASD susceptibility locus (DPYD and DPP6), suggesting complex genetic contributions. In additional males with ASD, we identified deletions in the 5' flanking region of PTCHD1 that disrupted a complex noncoding RNA and potential regulatory elements; equivalent changes were not found in male control individuals. Thus, our systematic screen of PTCHD1 and its 5' flanking regions suggests that this locus is involved in ~1% of individuals with ASD and intellectual disability.","dc:creator":"Noor A","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Disruption at the PTCHD1 Locus on Xp22.11 in Autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability."},"rdfs:label":"PTCDH1 transcription analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This data, together with expression data from PMID 27007844, will be awarded 0.5 points total.

Individuals with PTCHD1 deletion show symptoms of ADHD, sleep disruption, hypotonia, aggression, ASD, and ID. Although PTCHD1 is probably critical for normal development, the connection between its deletion and the ensuing behavioural defects is poorly understood. Here we report that during early post-natal development, mouse Ptchd1 is selectively expressed in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic neurons that regulate thalamocortical transmission, sleep rhythms, and attention. Ptchd1 deletion attenuates TRN activity through mechanisms involving small conductance calcium-dependent potassium currents (SK). TRN-restricted deletion of Ptchd1 leads to attention deficits and hyperactivity, both of which are rescued by pharmacological augmentation of SK channel activity. Global Ptchd1 deletion recapitulates learning impairment, hyper-aggression, and motor defects, all of which are insensitive to SK pharmacological targeting and not found in the TRN-restricted deletion mouse. This study maps clinically relevant behavioural phenotypes onto TRN dysfunction in a human disease model, while also identifying molecular and circuit targets for intervention.
