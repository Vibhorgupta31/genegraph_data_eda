Brain MRI results show cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and additional anomalies of the fourth ventricle, corpus callosum, and occipital cortex. The disease has previously been mapped to the centromeric region of chromosome 11. Using homozygosity mapping in 13 patients from eight Ashkenazi Jewish families, we identified a homozygous mutation, R12L, in the TMEM216 gene, in all affected individuals. Thirty individuals heterozygous for the mutation were detected among 2766 anonymous Ashkenazi Jews, indicating a carrier rate of 1:92. Given the small size of the TMEM216 gene relative to other JBTS genes, its sequence analysis is warranted in all JBTS patients, especially those who suffer from associated anomalies.","dc:creator":"Edvardson S","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Joubert syndrome 2 (JBTS2) in Ashkenazi Jews is associated with a TMEM216 mutation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:69639963-17ee-4cbb-a7e5-33c48bca114b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2135d3ab-9c2f-485a-804e-02e1d8c1aa43_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2135d3ab-9c2f-485a-804e-02e1d8c1aa43","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":21,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ce9ba8c3-7d32-4f34-9bf6-5f2f2dfd8fdf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001173990.3(TMEM216):c.341T>G (p.Leu114Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114036"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"meningocele, cystic kidneys, bile ducts proliferation, polydactyly, bowing of long bones, cleft palate, ","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:844a762e-854d-4a95-badf-da870f80ca48_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ce9ba8c3-7d32-4f34-9bf6-5f2f2dfd8fdf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20512146","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Joubert syndrome (JBTS), related disorders (JSRDs) and Meckel syndrome (MKS) are ciliopathies. We now report that MKS2 and CORS2 (JBTS2) loci are allelic and caused by mutations in TMEM216, which encodes an uncharacterized tetraspan transmembrane protein. Individuals with CORS2 frequently had nephronophthisis and polydactyly, and two affected individuals conformed to the oro-facio-digital type VI phenotype, whereas skeletal dysplasia was common in fetuses affected by MKS. A single G218T mutation (R73L in the protein) was identified in all cases of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (n=10). TMEM216 localized to the base of primary cilia, and loss of TMEM216 in mutant fibroblasts or after knockdown caused defective ciliogenesis and centrosomal docking, with concomitant hyperactivation of RhoA and Dishevelled. TMEM216 formed a complex with Meckelin, which is encoded by a gene also mutated in JSRDs and MKS. Disruption of tmem216 expression in zebrafish caused gastrulation defects similar to those in other ciliary morphants. These data implicate a new family of proteins in the ciliopathies and further support allelism between ciliopathy disorders.","dc:creator":"Valente EM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in TMEM216 perturb ciliogenesis and cause Joubert, Meckel and related syndromes."}},"rdfs:label":"F2-1"},{"id":"cggv:844a762e-854d-4a95-badf-da870f80ca48","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:844a762e-854d-4a95-badf-da870f80ca48_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:844a762e-854d-4a95-badf-da870f80ca48_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"impaired centrosome docking"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:bb5d0b23-8f59-45ce-87c3-7738e22c9b84_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb5d0b23-8f59-45ce-87c3-7738e22c9b84","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"cggv:21dbb481-8f19-4b72-a0b7-de2d0a2ca233","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001173990.3(TMEM216):c.218G>T (p.Arg73Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA339800"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"molar tooth sign, nephronophthisis, elevated liver enzymes","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6885de66-6362-40a8-ba11-c21832067670_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:21dbb481-8f19-4b72-a0b7-de2d0a2ca233"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20512146"},"rdfs:label":"COR000-1"},{"id":"cggv:6885de66-6362-40a8-ba11-c21832067670","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6885de66-6362-40a8-ba11-c21832067670_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6885de66-6362-40a8-ba11-c21832067670_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Unstable protein product, Disrupted ciliogenesis\n"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"recurrent"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2cfc96b6-f02c-4f97-8bfa-636af6a1b0ca_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2cfc96b6-f02c-4f97-8bfa-636af6a1b0ca","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:8816f71a-300b-4258-bddc-2c821b2d45e4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001173990.3(TMEM216):c.253C>T (p.Arg85Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144308"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"facial dysmorphism, postural deformities of limbs, small perimembranous, ventricular septal defect, intestinal malrotation, cleft lip/palate; ductal plate malformation, Dandy-Walker malformation, occipital encephalocele, polydactyly","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:e8133a5f-c545-451a-8275-391854a02b34_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8816f71a-300b-4258-bddc-2c821b2d45e4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23351400","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Szymanska K","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Founder mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations in Meckel-Gruber syndrome and associated ciliopathies."}},"rdfs:label":"Szymanska family 1-162"},{"id":"cggv:e8133a5f-c545-451a-8275-391854a02b34","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8133a5f-c545-451a-8275-391854a02b34_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:69639963-17ee-4cbb-a7e5-33c48bca114b_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:dd35373b-e6c9-4f29-ad53-079a177713e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd35373b-e6c9-4f29-ad53-079a177713e2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":{"id":"cggv:21dbb481-8f19-4b72-a0b7-de2d0a2ca233"},"detectionMethod":"Comparing runs of homozygosity longer than 2.4 Mb in each patient, we detected only one homozygous region, spanning 4.46 Mb on chromosome 11 (SNP markers rs11228951–\nrs11230775, corresponding to 56.73–61.19 Mb; marker positions are provided in accordance with the March 2006 release of the UCSC Human Genome Assembly; build hg18), which was shared by the three patients; the genotypes of the 379 SNP markers that are included in this region were identical.

We performed a comprehensive analysis of ten zebrafish TZ mutants, including mks1, tmem216, tmem67, rpgrip1l, cc2d2a, b9d2, cep290, tctn1, nphp1 and nphp4, as well as mutants in ift88 and ift172.

Further, we observed phenotypic variations within progeny of a single TZ mutant, reminiscent of multiple disease syndromes being associated with mutations in one gene. In some mutants, the dynamics of the phenotype became complex with transitory phenotypes that are corrected over time.

These proteins appear to regulate signaling and trafficking properties of other partner proteins, including Wnt receptors. It is expressed in a variety of tissues and organs, including the kidney. Multiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism and/or inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity:  autosomal recessive ciliopathies (MONDOID: 0005308).\n\n*TMEM216* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ciliopathies in 2010 (Enza et al., PMID: 20512146). Clinical presentations associated with *TMEM216* pathogenic variants include hypotonia, ataxia, psychomotor delay, irregular breathing pattern and oculomotor apraxia.  Affected individuals may have multiorgan involvement, mainly retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis, congenital liver fibrosis, occipital encephalocele and other posterior fossa defects, cystic dysplastic kidneys, hepatic bile duct proliferation and polydactyly. Pathogenicity is reported to be due to loss of function. \n9 variants (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in 69 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 20036350, 20512146, 36788019, 23351400) included in this curation. A total of 8.6/12 pts. genetic evidence was reached, considering case-level data and functional data. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by non-patient cells and non-human models. *TMEM216* deficiency induces ciliopathies in paramecia, zebra fish, and mice (PMIDs: 32163404, 32687549, 36533556, 38261656].
