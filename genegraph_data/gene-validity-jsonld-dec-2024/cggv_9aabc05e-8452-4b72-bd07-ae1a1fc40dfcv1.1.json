encodes the large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ (BK) potassium channel α-subunit, and pathogenic gain-of-function variants in this gene have been associated with a dominant form of generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia. Here, we genetically and functionally characterize eight novel loss-of-function (LoF) variants of KCNMA1. Genome or exome sequencing and the participation in the international Matchmaker Exchange effort allowed for the identification of novel KCNMA1 variants. Patch clamping was used to assess functionality of mutant BK channels. The KCNMA1 variants p.(Ser351Tyr), p.(Gly356Arg), p.(Gly375Arg), p.(Asn449fs) and p.(Ile663Val) abolished the BK current, whereas p.(Cys413Tyr) and p.(Pro805Leu) reduced the BK current amplitude and shifted the activation curves toward positive potentials. The p.(Asp984Asn) variant reduced the current amplitude without affecting kinetics. A phenotypic analysis of the patients carrying the recurrent p.(Gly375Arg) de novo missense LoF variant revealed a novel syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe developmental delay, visceral and cardiac malformations, connective tissue presentations with arterial involvement, bone dysplasia and characteristic dysmorphic features. Patients with other LoF variants presented with neurological and developmental symptoms including developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, axial hypotonia, cerebral atrophy and speech delay/apraxia/dysarthria. Therefore, LoF KCNMA1 variants are associated with a new syndrome characterized by a broad spectrum of neurological phenotypes and developmental disorders. LoF variants of KCNMA1 cause a new syndrome distinctly different from gain-of-function variants in the same gene.","dc:creator":"Liang L","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"De novo loss-of-function KCNMA1 variants are associated with a new multiple malformation syndrome and a broad spectrum of developmental and neurological phenotypes."}},{"id":"cggv:bfc2d391-b93e-4e64-b7be-ab8f5cff002f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1ca4f383-b336-4a38-b6b0-2790012ce0fb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31152168"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 6"},{"id":"cggv:bfc2d391-b93e-4e64-b7be-ab8f5cff002f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bfc2d391-b93e-4e64-b7be-ab8f5cff002f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:bfc2d391-b93e-4e64-b7be-ab8f5cff002f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Patch clamp recordings indicate it markedly reduces the amplitude of the BK current and shifts the G-V curve to the positive voltage direction by 38 mV at the 10 μm calcium concentration, consistent with LoF"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5c1086f8-6327-40b1-8aab-3ee4654960e7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c1086f8-6327-40b1-8aab-3ee4654960e7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5c1086f8-6327-40b1-8aab-3ee4654960e7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Patch clamp recordings did not elicit any potassium current under the voltage stimulus from −160 mV–160 mV at a 10 μm calcium concentration"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":4049,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":10.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b710bdf9-0cec-43ad-b17d-14f27da137f0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012276","gene":"hgnc:6284","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The KCNMA1 gene is associated with an autosomal recessive clinical disorder characterized by a movement disorder, seizures, cerebellar atrophy, and developmental delay in the literature (OMIM 617643).  Recent reviews evaluating the phenotype of previously reported patients indicate that homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in KCNMA1 are associated with disorder causing a spectrum of clinical phenotypes consistent with generalized epilepsy-paroxysmal dyskinesia syndrome (PMID 34224328, 31427379).  Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant generalized epilepsy-paroxysmal dyskinesia syndrome, which has been assessed separately.\n\nKCNMA1 was first reported in relation to an autosomal recessive generalized epilepsy-paroxysmal dyskinesia syndrome in 2016 (PMID 27567911).  The mechanism for disease is homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants.  \n\nAt least 4 unique variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and missense substitutions, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.  Variants in this gene have been reported in at least three unrelated probands in three publications (PMIDs: 31152168, 27567911, 29545233). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two siblings from a single family (PMID: 27567911).  Parents who were heterozygous for truncating variants were reported to be unaffected (PMIDs: 31152168, 27567911, 29545233). Although the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive KCNMA1 disorders share overlapping clinical features, the mechanism of disease may be different since haploinsufficiency did not result in clinical features of autosomal dominant generalized epilepsy-paroxysmal dyskinesia syndrome in relatives who were heterozygous for truncating variants (PMID: 31152168). The autosomal recessive KCNMA1 gene-disease association is supported by an animal model (PMID: 35095492 29545233). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel Working Group on March 1, 2022\n(SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9aabc05e-8452-4b72-bd07-ae1a1fc40dfc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
