We implicate 69 genes in ASD risk, including 24 passing genome-wide Bonferroni correction and 16 new ASD risk genes, most supported by rare inherited variants, a substantial extension of previous findings. Biological pathways enriched for genes harboring inherited variants represent cytoskeletal organization and ion transport, which are distinct from pathways implicated in previous studies. Nevertheless, the de novo and inherited genes contribute to a common protein-protein interaction network. We also identified structural variants (SVs) affecting non-coding regions, implicating recurrent deletions in the promoters of DLG2 and NR3C2. Loss of nr3c2 function in zebrafish disrupts sleep and social function, overlapping with human ASD-related phenotypes.

Lamc3 knockdown causes netrin-1a up-regulation in the neural tube and there is increased Netrin-1 protein throughout the trunk of the embryo. Axonal guidance of rostral primary motoneurons is defective in Lamc3 knockdown embryos. Conclusions: We suggest that knockdown of Lamc3 perturbs migration of rostral primary motoneurons at the level of the horizontal myoseptum, indicating that laminin γ3 plays a role in motoneuron guidance.","dc:creator":"Eve AMJ","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Knockdown of Laminin gamma-3 (Lamc3) impairs motoneuron guidance in the zebrafish embryo."},"rdfs:label":"Eve and Smith 2017 zebrafish KD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not relevant for autism, and possible mechanism of disease not established."},{"id":"cggv:ad232733-a0a2-4f9b-80fa-74238c0e5a38","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:666943fa-72fc-4a14-81d0-ac92d03945ec","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"LAMC3 -/- mice maintain gross brain development and show no change in brain size (Fig. 6).

Over 25 unique variants have been reported in humans. Autism spectrum disorder was the primary ascertainment for the largest number of individuals, but variants have also been reported in probands with intellectual disability and/or developmental delay as well. The variants were primarily identified in individuals with limited phenotype data from large cohort studies, and none had experimental evidence of gene impact (21572417: O'Roak et al. 2011; 23160955: O’Roak et al. 2012; 27525107: Yuen et al. 2016; 28965761: Turner et al. 2017; 28191889: Stessman et al. 2017; 30564305: Guo et al. 2018; 31398340: Ruzzo et al. 2019). Recent large-scale case-control studies also failed to identify a significant association between variation in the gene and autism spectrum disorder (31398340: Ruzzo et al. 2019; 31981491: Satterstrom et al. 2020). A potential mechanism of disease has not been delineated, and no experimental data were identified that provided specific support for this gene-disease relationship. In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the relationship between LAMC3 and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role LAMC3 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 09/01/2020. The relationship of the LAMC3 gene with an autosomal recessive cortical malformation phenotype will be addressed separately.\nThere is convincing evidence disputing the relationship between LAMC3 and complex neurodevelopmental disorder.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0ff89702-c97e-4ef9-91ce-2e37b66efd84"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
