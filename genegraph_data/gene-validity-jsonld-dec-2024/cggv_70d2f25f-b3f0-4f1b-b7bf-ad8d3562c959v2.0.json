In this report, we describe the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding human kynureninase. Degenerate oligonucleotides designed from the amino acid sequences of peptides from rat liver kynureninase, were used as primers for reverse-transcription PCR of rat kidney RNA. The resulting rat cDNA product was then used to screen a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2) cDNA library. Analysis of a positive cDNA clone showed the presence of an insert of 1651 nucleotides containing an open reading frame coding for a protein of 456 amino acids (theoretical molecular mass = 52357 Da). The predicted amino acid sequence of human kynureninase displayed high similarity to that reported for the rat enzyme and to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene product putatively ascribed to kynureninase. Profile analysis of kynureninase primary structure indicated the presence of a pyridoxal-P-binding site consensus sequence assigned to class-V aminotransferases, with Lys276 being the residue binding the cofactor. RNA blot analysis of human tissues, including brain, showed the presence of an approximately 2.0-kb mRNA species in all tissues tested.

Mutations in TGDS have been identified as one cause of Catel-Manzke syndrome, but cannot be found as causative in every patient with the clinical diagnosis. We performed a chromosome microarray and/or exome sequencing in three patients with hand hyperphalangism, heart defect, short stature, and mild to severe developmental delay, all of whom were initially given a clinical diagnosis of Catel-Manzke syndrome. In one patient, we detected a large deletion of exons 1-8 and the missense variant c.1282C > T (p.Arg428Trp) in KYNU (NM_003937.2), whereas homozygous missense variants in KYNU were found in the other two patients (c.989G > A (p.Arg330Gln) and c.326G > C (p.Trp109Ser)). Plasma and urine metabolomic analysis of two patients indicated a block along the tryptophan catabolic pathway and urine organic acid analysis showed excretion of xanthurenic acid. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in KYNU were recently described as a cause of NAD deficiency with vertebral, cardiac, renal and limb defects; however, no hand hyperphalangism was described in those patients, and Catel-Manzke syndrome was not discussed as a differential diagnosis. In conclusion, we present unrelated patients identified with biallelic variants in KYNU leading to kynureninase deficiency and xanthurenic aciduria as a very likely cause of their hyperphalangism, heart defect, short stature, and developmental delay. We suggest performance of urine organic acid analysis in patients with suspected Catel-Manzke syndrome, particularly in those with cardiac or vertebral defects or without mutations in TGDS.","dc:creator":"Ehmke N","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Biallelic variants in KYNU cause a multisystemic syndrome with hand hyperphalangism."}},"rdfs:label":"Ehmke Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:c8e3d75c-65b7-4836-89ba-bab6991c5afd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8e3d75c-65b7-4836-89ba-bab6991c5afd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Present in gnomAD at an MAF of 0.000008791 (1/113752) in the non-Finnish European population.\n\nScore was updated from 0.25 to 0.2 for this proband as per scoring rubric in SOPv9."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2c4059f8-ad0d-429c-b81a-fd2010584380_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c4059f8-ad0d-429c-b81a-fd2010584380","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3ddcf496-1a1b-4f63-b66f-f13b88644441","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003937.3(KYNU):c.1282C>T (p.Arg428Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1897043"}},"detectionMethod":"Array CGH detected the deletion allele and whole exome sequencing identified the missense variant.","firstTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","phenotypeFreeText":"elevated urinary 3-hydroxykynurenine 8.89 (0.16 in controls), xanthurenate 7.06 (0.14 in controls), and kynurenine 3.74 (-0.39 in controls)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000308","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0003316","obo:HP_0001662","obo:HP_0030084","obo:HP_0030367","obo:HP_0004383","obo:HP_0007018","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0002553","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0009466","obo:HP_0000750"],"secondTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ae609a7a-a54f-42bf-8fc7-39813f40bba8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3ddcf496-1a1b-4f63-b66f-f13b88644441"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31923704"},"rdfs:label":"Ehmke Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:ae609a7a-a54f-42bf-8fc7-39813f40bba8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae609a7a-a54f-42bf-8fc7-39813f40bba8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ae609a7a-a54f-42bf-8fc7-39813f40bba8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"From Szot et al., 2021 (PMID: 33942433) --\nYeast homozygous for deletion of the KYNU ortholog, Bna5p were transformed with plasmids generating human WT KYNU, or Arg428Trp KYNU and grown in the absence of niacin for 24h.

Congenital defects found in VCRL2 include segmentation defects, cardiac defects such as hypoplastic heart, hypoplastic kidneys, missing kidneys, clinodactyly, radial deviation, and polydactyly. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 14 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, and large deletion) have been reported in 11 probands from 5 publications (PMIDs: 28792876, 33942433, 31923704, 17334708, 34200361). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The gene *KYNU* encodes Kynureninase, one of the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of NAD from Trpytophan. This gene-disease association is further supported by its biochemical function in the kynurenine pathway (PMID: 8706755) and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 28792876) which recapitulates the phenotype on a NAD-restricted diet. In summary, *KYNU* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive vertebral, cardiac, renal, and limb defects syndrome 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 07/10/2020. It was reevaluated on 08/01/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of 5 new cases (PMIDs: 33942433 and 34200361).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:70d2f25f-b3f0-4f1b-b7bf-ad8d3562c959"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
