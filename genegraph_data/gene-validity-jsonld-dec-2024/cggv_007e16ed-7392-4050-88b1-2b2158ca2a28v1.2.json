Because CK2beta is synthesized in excess of CK2alpha, we hypothesized that formation of CK2beta homodimers precedes the incorporation of the catalytic subunits of CK2 into complexes. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected cells with two epitope-tagged variants of CK2beta. The results of these cotransfection studies demonstrate that interactions between two CK2beta subunits take place in the absence of CK2alpha. Together with results from previous biosynthetic labeling studies, these results suggest that formation of CK2beta homodimers occurs before incorporation of catalytic subunits of CK2 into CK2 complexes. We also cotransfected Cos-7 cells with a deletion fragment of CK2beta (i.e. Myc-beta1-166) together with full-length hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CK2beta and/or CK2alpha'. Although complexes between Myc-beta1-166 and HA-beta were readily detected, we obtained no evidence of direct interactions between Myc-beta1-166 and HA-CK2alpha'. These results suggest that residues within the N-terminal 166 amino acids of CK2beta are sufficient for interactions between CK2beta subunits, whereas the C-terminal domain of CK2beta is required for complex formation with the catalytic subunits of CK2. Finally, we observed that expression of full-length HA-beta promotes phosphorylation of Myc-beta1-166 by HA-CK2alpha'.","dc:creator":"Graham KC","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"The regulatory beta subunit of protein kinase CK2 mediates formation of tetrameric CK2 complexes."},"rdfs:label":"Graham Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:903f7798-fb9a-4ac4-b32b-293bc5051564","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:079364e6-78fb-453e-9e40-c9b38484e091","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Serine/threonine kinases have previously been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (ID/DD).\nBRSK2 & complex ND (PMID: 30879638), CAMK2A/B & AD ID 53/54 (PMID: 29560374), mTOR & Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (PMID: 28892148), RPS6KA3 & Coffin-Lowry syndrome (PMID: 19888330). \n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30879638","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Developmental delay and intellectual disability (DD and ID) are heterogeneous phenotypes that arise in many rare monogenic disorders. Because of this rarity, developing cohorts with enough individuals to robustly identify disease-associated genes is challenging. Social-media platforms that facilitate data sharing among sequencing labs can help to address this challenge. Through one such tool, GeneMatcher, we identified nine DD- and/or ID-affected probands with a rare, heterozygous variant in the gene encoding the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRSK2. All probands have a speech delay, and most present with intellectual disability, motor delay, behavioral issues, and autism. Six of the nine variants are predicted to result in loss of function, and computational modeling predicts that the remaining three missense variants are damaging to BRSK2 structure and function. All nine variants are absent from large variant databases, and BRSK2 is, in general, relatively intolerant to protein-altering variation among humans. In all six probands for whom parents were available, the mutations were found to have arisen de novo. Five of these de novo variants were from cohorts with at least 400 sequenced probands; collectively, the cohorts span 3,429 probands, and the observed rate of de novo variation in these cohorts is significantly higher than the estimated background-mutation rate (p = 2.46 × 10","dc:creator":"Hiatt SM","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Deleterious Variation in BRSK2 Associates with a Neurodevelopmental Disorder."},"rdfs:label":"Hiatt Kinase Importance "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:007e16ed-7392-4050-88b1-2b2158ca2a28_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9680fd82-0e6a-47be-bf84-d9a6ff510276","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c1bef6a7-e068-473a-8c90-3d5dd1328210","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"CK2α mutant cells transfected with variants seen in patients (R47G, Y50F, F197I, E27K, P231R, R47Q, S51R, R80H, R191Q, V73E, D175G, I174M, K198R, R312W) demonstrated decreased serine/threonine kinase activity compared to WT cells.

Eighteen different missense CK2α mutations have been identified to date; however, no biochemical or cell biological studies have yet been performed to clarify the functional impact of such mutations.

Gene-targeting experiments have demonstrated that in mice, the CK2beta gene is required for early embryonic development, while the CK2alpha' subunit appears to be essential only for normal spermatogenesis. We have used homologous recombination to disrupt the CK2alpha gene in the mouse germ line. Embryos lacking CK2alpha have a marked reduction in CK2 activity in spite of the presence of the CK2alpha' subunit. CK2alpha(-/-) embryos die in mid-gestation, with abnormalities including open neural tubes and reductions in the branchial arches. Defects in the formation of the heart lead to hydrops fetalis and are likely the cause of embryonic lethality.

Clinical features in reported probands include global developmental delay, intellectual disability, abnormal facial shape, short stature, behavioral abnormalities, hypotonia, sleep disturbance, seizures, ataxia, as well as brain, heart, skin, and pituitary gland abnormalities. Most reported variants are missense, and the rest are nonsense, splice and frameshift variants; the majority are *de novo*. Fourteen unique missense and two protein truncating variants that have been reported in six publications (PMIDs: 27048600, 28725024, 29383814, 30655572, 31729156, 34038195) are included in this curation. Though functional data is available to support many of the variants, it has been scored as experimental evidence rather than at the level of each individual variant. More evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 2961923), but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. Of note, five of the reported missense variants are recurrent.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including functional studies, biochemical function, protein interaction and a mouse model. *CSNK2A1* encodes CK2α, a serine/threonine protein kinase. Variants in *CSNK2A1* have been shown to cause a decrease in the kinase activity of the CK2α protein and changes in the alpha subunit’s subcellular localization (PMID: 33944995). CK2α interacts with the CK2β subunit encoded by *CSNK2B*, which is also implicated in syndromic intellectual disability (Poirier-Bienvenu neurodevelopmental syndrome).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CSNK2A1* and autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 15, 2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:007e16ed-7392-4050-88b1-2b2158ca2a28"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
