Due to the variety of clinical symptoms and the complexity of current diagnostic procedures, accurate diagnosis of PID is often difficult in daily clinical practice. Thanks to the advent of \"next generation\" sequencing technologies and target enrichment methods, the development of multiplex diagnostic assays is now possible. In this study, we applied a selector-based target enrichment assay to detect disease-causing mutations in 179 known PID genes. The usefulness of this assay for molecular diagnosis of PID was investigated by sequencing DNA from 33 patients, 18 of which had at least one known causal mutation at the onset of the experiment. We were able to identify the disease causing mutations in 60% of the investigated patients, indicating that the majority of PID cases could be resolved using a targeted sequencing approach. Causal mutations identified in the unknown patient samples were located in STAT3, IGLL1, RNF168 and PGM3. Based on our results, we propose a stepwise approach for PID diagnostics, involving targeted resequencing, followed by whole transcriptome and/or whole genome sequencing if causative variants are not found in the targeted exons.

SCID, but also some other severe PID, is a group of disorders characterized by the absence of T and/or B and NK cells. Affected infants are susceptible to life-threatening infections, but early detection gives a chance for effective treatment. The prevalence of SCID in the Polish and German populations is unknown but can be comparable to other countries (1:50,000-100,000). SCID NBS tests are based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the measurement of a number of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC), kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KREC), and beta-actin (ACTB) as a quality marker of DNA. This method can also be effective in NBS for other severe PID with T- and/or B-cell lymphopenia, including combined immunodeficiency (CID) or agammaglobulinemia. During the 14 months of collaboration, 44,287 newborns were screened according to the ImmunoIVD protocol. Within 65 positive samples, seven were classified to immediate recall and 58 requested a second sample. Examination of the 58 second samples resulted in recalling one newborn.

The mutant as well as the normal λ5/14.1 could bind to VpreB, however, analysis of supernatants from cells indicated that normal λ5/14.1 was secreted into the supernatant with VpreB, whereas the mutant λ5/14.1 was not secreted. Additionally, the capacity of the normal and mutant λ5/14.1 proteins to fold was compared in reducing and nonreducing conditions. Under nonreducing conditions, ∼50% of the normal λ5/14.1 moved through the gel more rapidly because of protein folding, but none of the mutant λ5/14.1 demonstrated altered migration."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This is the same Pro142Leu missense variant identified in the Minegishi and Gemayel patients.

IGLL1 encodes the omega polypeptide chain which associates with the Ig mu chain to form a molecular complex on the surface of pre-B cells. This complex presumably regulates Ig gene rearrangements in the early steps of B-cell differentiation. Biallelic variation in this gene thus results in B cell deficiency and agammaglobulinemia. This gene-disease relationship is supported by both genetic and experimental evidence. Three variants (nonsense, missense, and frameshift) have been reported in five probands (PMIDs: 25502423, 19302039, 27576013, 9419212, and 33178177) and one additional affected family member (PMID: 25502423). A role in disease is supported by the expression of IGLL1 in the relevant tissue of bone marrow, specifically enriched in naïve B-cells (PMID: 2501791) and by an IGLL1 deficient mouse model which recapitulates the block in B cell development seen in patients (PMID: 1591779). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b483cc35-0599-4313-b71a-835cb1096ca5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
