Using super-resolution and electron microscopy, we find that the human microcephaly protein, RTTN, is recruited to the proximal end of the procentriole at early S phase, and is located at the inner luminal walls of centrioles. Further studies demonstrate that RTTN directly interacts with STIL and acts downstream of STIL-mediated centriole assembly. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated RTTN gene knockout in p53-deficient cells induce amplification of primitive procentriole bodies that lack the distal-half centriolar proteins, POC5 and POC1B. Additional analyses show that RTTN serves as an upstream effector of CEP295, which mediates the loading of POC1B and POC5 to the distal-half centrioles. Interestingly, the naturally occurring microcephaly-associated mutant, RTTN (A578P), shows a low affinity for STIL binding and blocks centriole assembly. These findings reveal that RTTN contributes to building full-length centrioles and illuminate the molecular mechanism through which the RTTN (A578P) mutation causes primary microcephaly.Mutations in many centriolar protein-encoding genes cause primary microcephaly.

According to the genotype-phenotype correlation, we were able to divide the solved cases into three groups: i) the correlation is well established but it was missed due to lack of specificity, unusual presentation or recent description; ii) the clinical presentation is much more severe than currently known for the underlying condition; iii) the correlation does not recapitulate the entire phenotype, possibly due to the fetal presentation or multiple coexisting conditions. Moreover, we found a higher proportion of recessive diagnosis in abnormal fetuses compared to cohorts of individuals with developmental delay.

More than a dozen genes are known to be mutated in autosomal-recessive primary microcephaly in isolation or in association with a more generalized growth deficiency (microcephalic primordial dwarfism), but the genetic heterogeneity is probably more extensive. In a research protocol involving autozygome mapping and exome sequencing, we recruited a multiplex consanguineous family who is affected by severe microcephalic primordial dwarfism and tested negative on clinical exome sequencing. Two candidate autozygous intervals were identified, and the second round of exome sequencing revealed a single intronic variant therein (c.2885+8A>G [p.Ser963(âˆ—)] in RTTN exon 23). RT-PCR confirmed that this change creates a cryptic splice donor and thus causes retention of the intervening 7 bp of the intron and leads to premature truncation. On the basis of this finding, we reanalyzed the exome file of a second consanguineous family affected by a similar phenotype and identified another homozygous change in RTTN as the likely causal mutation. Combined linkage analysis of the two families confirmed that RTTN maps to the only significant linkage peak. Finally, through international collaboration, a Canadian multiplex family affected by microcephalic primordial dwarfism and biallelic mutation of RTTN was identified.

We have identified autosomal-recessive mutations in RTTN, encoding Rotatin, in individuals with bilateral diffuse polymicrogyria from two separate families. Rotatin determines early embryonic axial rotation, as well as anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning in the mouse. Human Rotatin has recently been identified as a centrosome-associated protein. The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of Rotatin, Ana3, is needed for structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies and maintenance of sensory neurons. We show that Rotatin colocalizes with the basal bodies at the primary cilium. Cultured fibroblasts from affected individuals have structural abnormalities of the cilia and exhibit downregulation of BMP4, WNT5A, and WNT2B, which are key regulators of cortical patterning and are expressed at the cortical hem, the cortex-organizing center that gives rise to Cajal-Retzius (CR) neurons. Interestingly, we have shown that in mouse embryos, Rotatin colocalizes with CR neurons at the subpial marginal zone.

With time, a wide variety of other brain malformations has been ascribed to RTTN mutations, including primary microcephaly. Rotatin is a centrosomal protein possibly involved in centriolar elongation and ciliogenesis. However, the function of rotatin in brain development is largely unknown and the molecular disease mechanism underlying cortical malformations has not yet been elucidated. We performed both clinical and cell biological studies, aimed at clarifying rotatin function and pathogenesis. Review of the 23 published and five unpublished clinical cases and genomic mutations, including the effect of novel deep intronic pathogenic mutations on RTTN transcripts, allowed us to extrapolate the core phenotype, consisting of intellectual disability, short stature, microcephaly, lissencephaly, periventricular heterotopia, polymicrogyria and other malformations. We show that the severity of the phenotype is related to residual function of the protein, not only the level of mRNA expression. Skin fibroblasts from eight affected individuals were studied by high resolution immunomicroscopy and flow cytometry, in parallel with in vitro expression of RTTN in HEK293T cells. We demonstrate that rotatin regulates different phases of the cell cycle and is mislocalized in affected individuals. Mutant cells showed consistent and severe mitotic failure with centrosome amplification and multipolar spindle formation, leading to aneuploidy and apoptosis, which could relate to depletion of neuronal progenitors often observed in microcephaly. We confirmed the role of rotatin in functional and structural maintenance of primary cilia and determined that the protein localized not only to the basal body, but also to the axoneme, proving the functional interconnectivity between ciliogenesis and cell cycle progression. Proteomics analysis of both native and exogenous rotatin uncovered that rotatin interacts with the neuronal (non-muscle) myosin heavy chain subunits, motors of nucleokinesis during neuronal migration, and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived bipolar mature neurons rotatin localizes at the centrosome in the leading edge. This illustrates the role of rotatin in neuronal migration. These different functions of rotatin explain why RTTN mutations can lead to heterogeneous cerebral malformations, both related to proliferation and migration defects.","dc:creator":"Vandervore LV","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and cerebral malformations reflected by rotatin cellular dynamics."}},{"id":"cggv:25d6d315-b2e0-4ec9-b0e3-4616bba87f62_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:da6768c8-f909-4ad9-acbf-954cb0b648d9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30879067"}],"rdfs:label":"p.Tyr1235Ter & c.4748-19T>A, two fetuses"},{"id":"cggv:25d6d315-b2e0-4ec9-b0e3-4616bba87f62","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:25d6d315-b2e0-4ec9-b0e3-4616bba87f62_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:e97b878d-7c37-45ee-bea1-d81338b2e022","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e97b878d-7c37-45ee-bea1-d81338b2e022_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1b6e5721-8423-490b-a5c5-72b49c1c0ccd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1b6e5721-8423-490b-a5c5-72b49c1c0ccd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":16,"allele":{"id":"cggv:458da3d8-fdd4-4d0f-a782-121c0a9367f1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_173630.4(RTTN):c.80G>A (p.Cys27Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130104"}},"detectionMethod":"autozygosity mapping on basis of whole genome search","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002307","obo:HP_0002536","obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0001285","obo:HP_0001344"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:56483a9e-0242-4f8c-a3cd-fb9db037f86e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:458da3d8-fdd4-4d0f-a782-121c0a9367f1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22939636"},"rdfs:label":"p.Cys27Tyr (homozyg.)"},{"id":"cggv:56483a9e-0242-4f8c-a3cd-fb9db037f86e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56483a9e-0242-4f8c-a3cd-fb9db037f86e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:56483a9e-0242-4f8c-a3cd-fb9db037f86e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"mRNA levels of WNT5A, WNT2B, and BMP4 were significantly reduced in the mutants compared to the respective control.

Affected probands present with microcephaly, brain malformations, short stature, and developmental delay, each of varying severity. Some of the earlier patients reported, such as from Shamseldin et al. (PMID: 26608784) were diagnosed with primordial dwarfism, a condition where height and weight are both more than 3 standard deviations below the mean at birth, leading to short stature lasting into adulthood. However, other reports simply describe probands as having short stature, without giving specific measurements (PMID: 26846091), and other cases are fetal/neonatal lethal, with probands presenting with intrauterine growth restriction (PMID: 30879067, 32058062). Because of this, the degree of short stature that may be associated with biallelic variants in this gene is currently unclear. Thirteen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) that have been reported in 17 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 22939636, 26608784, 26846091, 26940245, 30879067) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse model, cell culture model, and interaction evidence; PMID: 11900971, 28811500). A mouse model indicates that the homozygotes are significantly smaller than the wild-type in the embryonic period, with dysmorphisms and defective axial rotation. None of the homozygotes live past the embryonic stage. Interaction evidence shows that RTTN interacts directly with STIL, which was classified as definitive for autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Cell culture evidence shows impaired centriole duplication in the mutants. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RTTN and autosomal recessive microcephalic primordial dwarfism. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations GCEP on the meeting date 10/22/2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ebfb3367-c465-4e77-9256-ab34683c8ba7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
