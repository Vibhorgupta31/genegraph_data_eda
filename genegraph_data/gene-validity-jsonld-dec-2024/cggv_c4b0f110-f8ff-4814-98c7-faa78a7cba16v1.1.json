Homozygous BIN1 mutations in ubiquitously expressed exons are associated with autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (CNM), a mildly progressive muscle disorder typically showing abnormal nuclear centralization on biopsies. In addition, misregulation of BIN1 splicing partially accounts for the muscle defects in myotonic dystrophy (DM). However, the muscle-specific function of amphiphysin 2 and its pathogenicity in both muscle disorders are not well understood. In this study we identified and characterized the first mutation affecting the splicing of the muscle-specific BIN1 exon 11 in a consanguineous family with rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal centronuclear myopathy. In parallel, we discovered a mutation in the same BIN1 exon 11 acceptor splice site as the genetic cause of the canine Inherited Myopathy of Great Danes (IMGD). Analysis of RNA from patient muscle demonstrated complete skipping of exon 11 and BIN1 constructs without exon 11 were unable to promote membrane tubulation in differentiated myotubes. Comparative immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analyses of patient and canine biopsies revealed common structural defects, emphasizing the importance of amphiphysin 2 in membrane remodelling and maintenance of the skeletal muscle triad. Our data demonstrate that the alteration of the muscle-specific function of amphiphysin 2 is a common pathomechanism for centronuclear myopathy, myotonic dystrophy, and IMGD.

Here we found that Exon10 also binds to the src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Bin1 itself, and hence blocks the binding of the SH3 domain to its canonical PxxP ligands, including dynamin.

In this study, we create and characterize a novel zebrafish model of CNM2 using antisense morpholinos. Immunofluorescence and histopathological analyses of Bin1-deficient zebrafish skeletal muscle reveal structural defects commonly reported in human CNM2 biopsies. Live imaging of zebrafish embryos shows defective calcium release in bin1 morphants, linking the presence of abnormal triads to impairments in intracellular signaling.

This gene-disease relationship is further supported by expression, protein-protein interaction, functional alteration, and animal model studies. In summary, ​BIN1​​ is definitively associated with ​autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nFive BIN1 variants described in two publications (PMID 25260562 and PMID 27854204) have been associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy, however the phenotype is more mild and onset occurs in adulthood. To date, the variants reported in association with autosomal dominant BIN1-associated centronuclear myopathy do not overlap with those observed in individuals with autosomal recessive BIN1-associated centronuclear myopathy and act through a distinct pathomechanism than recessive BIN1 variants. Given this information, the association between BIN1 and autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy will be evaluated in a separate curation.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c4b0f110-f8ff-4814-98c7-faa78a7cba16"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
