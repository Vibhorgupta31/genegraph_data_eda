We sequenced the DNA from cases with unexplained dominant thrombocytopenia and identified six likely pathogenic variants in ETV6, of which five are novel. We observed low repressive activity of all tested ETV6 variants, and variants located in the E26 transformation-specific binding domain (encoding p.A377T, p.Y401N) led to reduced binding to corepressors. We also observed a large expansion of megakaryocyte colony-forming units derived from variant carriers and reduced proplatelet formation with abnormal cytoskeletal organization. The defect in proplatelet formation was also observed in control CD34+ cell-derived megakaryocytes transduced with lentiviral particles encoding mutant ETV6. Reduced expression levels of key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton CDC42 and RHOA were measured. Moreover, changes in the actin structures are typically accompanied by a rounder platelet shape with a highly heterogeneous size, decreased platelet arachidonic response, and spreading and retarded clot retraction in ETV6 deficient platelets. Elevated numbers of circulating CD34+ cells were found in p.P214L and p.Y401N carriers, and two patients from different families suffered from refractory anemia with excess blasts, while one patient from a third family was successfully treated for acute myeloid leukemia. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the role of ETV6 as a driver of cytoskeletal regulatory gene expression during platelet production, and the impact of variants resulting in platelets with altered size, shape and function and potentially also in changes in circulating progenitor levels.","dc:creator":"Poggi M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Germline variants in ETV6 underlie reduced platelet formation, platelet dysfunction and increased levels of circulating CD34+ progenitors."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27663637","rdfs:label":"F3-II4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The missense variant Tyr401Asn occurs in the ETS DNA-binding domain.

To gain further information on this disorder, we searched for ETV6 mutations in the 130 families with inherited thrombocytopenia of unknown origin from our cohort of 274 consecutive pedigrees with familial thrombocytopenia. We identified 20 patients with ETV6-related thrombocytopenia from seven pedigrees. They have five different ETV6 variants, including three novel mutations affecting the highly conserved E26 transformation-specific domain. The relative frequency of ETV6-related thrombocytopenia was 2.6% in the whole case series and 4.6% among the families with known forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. The degree of thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendency of the patients with ETV6-related thrombocytopenia were mild, but four subjects developed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia during childhood, resulting in a significantly higher incidence of this condition compared to that in the general population. Clinical and laboratory findings did not identify any particular defects that could lead to the suspicion of this disorder from the routine diagnostic workup. However, at variance with most inherited thrombocytopenias, platelets were not enlarged. In vitro studies revealed that the maturation of the patients' megakaryocytes was defective and that the patients have impaired proplatelet formation. Moreover, platelets from patients with ETV6-related thrombocytopenia have reduced ability to spread on fibrinogen. Since the dominant thrombocytopenias due to mutations in RUNX1 and ANKRD26 are also characterized by normal platelet size and predispose to hematologic malignancies, we suggest that screening for ETV6, RUNX1 and ANKRD26 mutations should be performed in all subjects with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia and normal platelet size.","dc:creator":"Melazzini F","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Clinical and pathogenic features of ETV6-related thrombocytopenia with predisposition to acute lymphoblastic leukemia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27365488","rdfs:label":"E/II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The missense variant Trp380Arg occurs in the ETS DNA-binding domain and it is predicted that its substitution to an arginine will greatly destabilize the structure by creating both an uncompensated cavity in the hydrophobic core and electrostatic repulsion of nearby positively charged residues.

We show here that TEL is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor of ETS-binding site-driven transcription of model and natural promoters. Deletion of the oligomerization domain of TEL or its substitution by the homologous region of monomeric ETS1 impaired the ability of TEL to repress. In contrast, substitution of the oligomerization domain of TEL by unrelated oligomerization domains resulted in an active repressor, showing that the ability of TEL to repress depends on its ability to self-associate. The study of the properties of TEL fusions to the heterologous DNA binding domain of Gal4 identified two autonomous repression domains in TEL, distinct from its oligomerization domain, that are essential to the ability of TEL to repress ETS-binding site-containing promoters.

Using the lineage specific conditional KO revealed that bone marrow hematopoiesis is entirely dependent on continuous expression of Etv6. Yet, Etv6 does not function as master regulator in the sense that it directs a hematopoietic differentiation program in a wide spectrum of hematopoietic cells. Rather, it has two independent roles in the context of specific, narrow stages of hematopoietic differentiation. First, Etv6 controls the survival of HSCs so that its disruption indirectly affects the majority of all hematopoietic cells which have limited clonal lifespans and eventually will extinguish without constant regeneration from HSCs. Second, Etv6 is required late in the development of the megakaryocyte lineage, where it presumably acts in concert with transcriptional regulators previously implicated in megakaryopoiesis (Nfe2, Scl, Gfi-1B, Aml1, Gata1, Fli-1, and Fog1; Italiano and Shivdasani 2003) and/or by directly binding ETS motifs known to be critical in megakaryocytic promoters."},{"id":"cggv:da97648b-2475-48a9-9dcc-5a8284b39e00","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d06f837b-587f-4a68-a92f-ab46985ba301","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Examination of embryos injected with either morpholino by light microscopy revealed no overt developmental disruption compared to control embryos, apart from a mild anemia.

At least 16 unique variants (largely missense, but also nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 20 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25581430, 25807284, 26102509, 27365488, 27663637, 26522332, 29034503).
