However, early deletion of Cul4b in mice causes prenatal lethality, which has frustrated attempts to characterize the phenotypes in vivo. In this report, we successfully rescued Cul4b mutant mice by crossing female mice in which exons 4-5 of Cul4b were flanked by loxP sequences with Sox2-Cre male mice. In Cul4b-deficient (Cul4b(Δ)/Y) mice, no CUL4B protein was detected in any of the major organs, including the brain. In the hippocampus, the levels of CUL4A, CUL4B substrates (TOP1, β-catenin, cyclin E and WDR5) and neuronal markers (MAP2, tau-1, GAP-43, PSD95 and syn-1) were not sensitive to Cul4b deletion, whereas the number of parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons was decreased in Cul4b(Δ)/Y mice, especially in the dentate gyrus (DG). Some dendritic features, including the complexity, diameter and spine density in the CA1 and DG hippocampal neurons, were also affected by Cul4b deletion. Together, the decrease in the number of PV-positive neurons and altered dendritic properties in Cul4b(Δ)/Y mice imply a reduction in inhibitory regulation and dendritic integration in the hippocampal neural circuit, which lead to increased epileptic susceptibility and spatial learning deficits. Our results identify Cul4b(Δ)/Y mice as a potential model for the non-syndromic model of XLMR that replicates the CUL4B-associated MR and is valuable for the development of a therapeutic strategy for treating MR.","dc:creator":"Chen CY","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Rescue of the genetically engineered Cul4b mutant mouse as a potential model for human X-linked mental retardation."},"rdfs:label":"Conditional knock-out mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:cc93f3b2-3124-40f8-a86e-c929b09c6f68_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc93f3b2-3124-40f8-a86e-c929b09c6f68_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:cc93f3b2-3124-40f8-a86e-c929b09c6f68_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5878367d-c8e5-4cf3-9f5a-791a1d7c016e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d9a843d-4452-438f-9650-e89874e6320e","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Bidirectional sequencing of  676 vega-annotated genes","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Karyotype - normal\nFragile X testing - normal\nScreen of 61 known XL-ID genes - normal","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:5878367d-c8e5-4cf3-9f5a-791a1d7c016e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:d689fd6f-d52e-4bdc-9b46-60865493201b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001079872.2(CUL4B):c.953_957del (p.Ile318LysfsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/426723"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236139","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have identified three truncating, two splice-site, and three missense variants at conserved amino acids in the CUL4B gene on Xq24 in 8 of 250 families with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). During affected subjects' adolescence, a syndrome emerged with delayed puberty, hypogonadism, relative macrocephaly, moderate short stature, central obesity, unprovoked aggressive outbursts, fine intention tremor, pes cavus, and abnormalities of the toes. This syndrome was first described by Cazebas et al., in a family that was included in our study and that carried a CUL4B missense variant. CUL4B is a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit implicated in the regulation of several biological processes, and CUL4B is the first XLMR gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The relatively high frequency of CUL4B mutations in this series indicates that it is one of the most commonly mutated genes underlying XLMR and suggests that its introduction into clinical diagnostics should be a high priority.","dc:creator":"Tarpey PS","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Mutations in CUL4B, which encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit, cause an X-linked mental retardation syndrome associated with aggressive outbursts, seizures, relative macrocephaly, central obesity, hypogonadism, pes cavus, and tremor."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236139","rdfs:label":"Proband 1 from Family 42"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ce8b554e-7fe7-4e5c-89ea-6544a50581dd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:074029ca-12db-4e7b-a3d5-fd7fda154a91","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0000708","obo:HP_0001249"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ce8b554e-7fe7-4e5c-89ea-6544a50581dd_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:15ac5de3-90bf-4a47-97e5-9184ef6812a3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001079872.2(CUL4B):c.1108C>T (p.Arg370Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/11339"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17273978","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We reevaluated a previously reported family with an X-linked mental retardation syndrome and attempted to identify the underlying genetic defect. Screening of candidate genes in a 10-Mb region on Xq25 implicated CUL4B as the causative gene. CUL4B encodes a scaffold protein that organizes a cullin-RING (really interesting new gene) ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex in ubiquitylation. A base substitution, c.1564C-->T, converted a codon for arginine into a premature termination codon, p.R388X, and rendered the truncated peptide completely devoid of the C-terminal catalytic domain. The nonsense mutation also results in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in patients. In peripheral leukocytes of obligate carriers, a strong selection against cells expressing the mutant allele results in an extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern. Our findings point to the functional significance of CUL4B in cognition and in other aspects of human development.","dc:creator":"Zou Y","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Mutation in CUL4B, which encodes a member of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, causes X-linked mental retardation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17273978","rdfs:label":"Proband 1 from Family 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:4d9a0bb2-199d-4b28-9e1d-311424e5847a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:116cbebb-bb9d-45f9-baec-e88b438242e8","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001999"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4d9a0bb2-199d-4b28-9e1d-311424e5847a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6c422f46-90d9-4bd3-b388-c76a04c6a01b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001079872.2(CUL4B):c.920+1G>T (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA414199728"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17273978"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17273978","rdfs:label":"Proband 1 from Family 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ef6d3282-33d5-4712-896b-f11ab50554c2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59ea8976-66dd-4f05-b5dd-ec8336efc756","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Bidirectional sequencing of 676 vega-annotated genes","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001249"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Karyotype -
