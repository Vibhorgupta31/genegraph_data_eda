The patient was a 30-month-old girl who was referred to us due to developmental delay and seizures which began at 5 months of age. She was seizure free for 5 months with valproic acid and vigabatrin. At presentation, she was found to have microcephaly and hypotonia. Her plasma glutamine concentration was near normal and she had mild hyperammonemia. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild changes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a homozygous c.121C > T (p.R41C) (p.Arg41Cys) pathogenic variant of the GLUL gene. The diagnosis of this patient underlines the importance of careful evaluation of patients with borderline low glutamine levels.

There were reductions in tissue levels of aspartate, glutamate, glutamine and GABA and in mRNA encoding glutamate receptor subunits GRIA1 and GRIN2A as well as in the glutamate transporter proteins EAAT1 and EAAT2. Adult Glul-deficient mice developed progressive neurodegeneration and spontaneous seizures which increased in frequency with age. Importantly, progressive astrogliosis occurred before neurodegeneration and was first noted in astrocytes along cerebral blood vessels.

Crossing GS(fl/lacZ) or GS(fl/fl) mice with hGFAP-Cre mice resulted in prenatal excision of the GS(fl) allele in astrocytes. \"GS-KO/A\" mice were born without malformations, did not suffer from seizures, had a suckling reflex, and did drink immediately after birth, but then gradually failed to feed and died on postnatal day 3. Artificial feeding relieved hypoglycemia and prolonged life, identifying starvation as the immediate cause of death. Neuronal morphology and brain energy levels did not differ from controls. Within control brains, amino acid concentrations varied in a coordinate way by postnatal day 2, implying an integrated metabolic network had developed. GS deficiency caused a 14-fold decline in cortical glutamine and a sevenfold decline in cortical alanine concentration, but the rising glutamate levels were unaffected and glycine was twofold increased. Only these amino acids were uncoupled from the metabolic network. Cortical ammonia levels increased only 1.6-fold, probably reflecting reduced glutaminolysis in neurons and detoxification of ammonia to glycine. These findings identify the dramatic decrease in (cortical) glutamine concentration as the primary cause of brain dysfunction in GS-KO/A mice. The temporal dissociation between GS(fl) elimination and death, and the reciprocal changes in the cortical concentration of glutamine and alanine in GS-deficient and control neonates indicate that the phenotype of GS deficiency in the brain emerges coincidentally with the neonatal activation of the glutamine-glutamate and the associated alanine-lactate cycles.","dc:creator":"He Y","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Glutamine synthetase deficiency in murine astrocytes results in neonatal death."},"rdfs:label":"Astrocyte-specific GS knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous null mouse is early-embryonic lethal (PMID: 17557305).

At least 4 unique variants (all missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 16267323, 21353613, 30440076, 33150193). This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function as glutamine synthetase (PMID: 5336023) and several conditional knockout mouse models with partial recapitulation of disease (PMIDs: 25870278, 20140959, 30053506). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with identification of one new proband (and affected sibling) in PMID: 33150193. It was reevaluated again on 12/9/2024 with no new evidence identified. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Moderate.\n\nOf note, a novel disease entity was reported in relation to *GLUL* in 2024 (PMID: 38579670), glutamine synthetase stabilization disorder (GSSD) was reported due to monoallelic *de novo* dominant negative variants and will be considered seperately from this recessive loss of function curation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d71d7866-437d-48bd-8a98-21e67abdd917"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
