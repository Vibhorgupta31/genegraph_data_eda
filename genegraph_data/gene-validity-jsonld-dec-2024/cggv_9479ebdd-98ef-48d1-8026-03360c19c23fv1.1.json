Only one missense variant that was reported as a de novo occurrence in an individual with congenital heart disease was included in this curation (PMID: 32368696). There were several other probands reported with variants in *MED13L*, however they were not scored due to high minor allele frequency in gnomAD v4 (MAF> 0.00001, PMIDs: 14638541, 27959697, 33448881, 35885997, 36307859, 35910219). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an expression study (PMID: 14638541).  In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *MED13L* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 2/12/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9479ebdd-98ef-48d1-8026-03360c19c23f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
