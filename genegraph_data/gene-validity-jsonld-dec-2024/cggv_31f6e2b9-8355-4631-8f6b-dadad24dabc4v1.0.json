To identify modifiers of α-DG, we performed a haploid screen for Lassa virus entry, a hemorrhagic fever virus causing thousands of deaths annually that hijacks glycosylated α-DG to enter cells. In complementary screens, we profiled cells for absence of α-DG carbohydrate chains or biochemically related glycans. This revealed virus host factors and a suite of glycosylation units, including all known Walker-Warburg genes and five additional factors critical for the modification of α-DG.

It is defined as cortical dysplasia that results when neuroglial overmigration into the arachnoid space forms an extracortical layer that produces agyria and/or a \"cobblestone\" brain surface and ventricular enlargement. Cobblestone lissencephaly is pathognomonic of a continuum of autosomal-recessive diseases characterized by cerebral, ocular, and muscular deficits. These include Walker-Warburg syndrome, muscle-eye-brain disease, and Fukuyama muscular dystrophy. Mutations in POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, LARGE, FKTN, and FKRP identified these diseases as alpha-dystroglycanopathies. Our exhaustive screening of these six genes, in a cohort of 90 fetal cases, led to the identification of a mutation in only 53% of the families, suggesting that other genes might also be involved. We therefore decided to perform a genome-wide study in two multiplex families. This allowed us to identify two additional genes: TMEM5 and ISPD. Because TMEM has a glycosyltransferase domain and ISPD has an isoprenoid synthase domain characteristic of nucleotide diP-sugar transferases, these two proteins are thought to be involved in the glycosylation of dystroglycan. Further screening of 40 families with cobblestone lissencephaly identified nonsense and frameshift mutations in another four unrelated cases for each gene, increasing the mutational rate to 64% in our cohort. All these cases displayed a severe phenotype of cobblestone lissencephaly A. TMEM5 mutations were frequently associated with gonadal dysgenesis and neural tube defects, and ISPD mutations were frequently associated with brain vascular anomalies.","dc:creator":"Vuillaumier-Barrot S","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Identification of mutations in TMEM5 and ISPD as a cause of severe cobblestone lissencephaly."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband A: p.Arg266Glyfs*8 (c.795delG)"},{"id":"cggv:8acdaf08-2af5-47ff-a409-5d5c5b219207","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8acdaf08-2af5-47ff-a409-5d5c5b219207_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"Downgrading because this is a consanguineous family.

Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated protein interactions between these 3 proteins. A protein complex consisting of endogenous fukutin and FKRP, and exogenously expressed TMEM5 exerts activities of each enzyme. Our data showed for the first time that endogenous fukutin and FKRP enzyme activities coexist with TMEM5 enzyme activity, and suggest the possibility that formation of this enzyme complex may contribute to specific and prompt biosynthesis of glycans that are required for dystroglycan function.","dc:creator":"Nishihara R","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Cell endogenous activities of fukutin and FKRP coexist with the ribitol xylosyltransferase, TMEM5."},"rdfs:label":"Golgi apparatus, co-localization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:129a7835-6d00-4436-bb68-07f94856846d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e7ba0491-a4c8-4bc4-be9a-09ea4e0f8b4d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"This article demonstrated, through immunofluorescence analysis in HEK293T cells, fukutin, FKRP, and TMEM5 assemble into a protein complex.

The condition is associated with certain brain and eye anomalies, congenital muscular dystrophy, and severe mental impairment. There is only one disease assertion for this gene, which is for autosomal recessive Walker Warburg Syndrome (OMIM: # 605862). 9 variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense) that have been reported in 7 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23217329, 23519211, 33199158, 36007194) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression level evidence, functional alteration, protein interaction, cell culture model, rescue; PMIDs: 29477842, 27733679). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RXYLT1 and autosomal recessive Walker Warburg Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
