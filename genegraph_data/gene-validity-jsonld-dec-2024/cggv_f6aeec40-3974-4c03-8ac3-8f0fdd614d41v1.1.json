During the past two decades in excess of 100 X-chromosome ID genes have been identified. Yet, a large number of families mapping to the X-chromosome remained unresolved suggesting that more XLID genes or loci are yet to be identified. Here, we have investigated 405 unresolved families with XLID. We employed massively parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons in the index males. The majority of these males were previously tested negative for copy number variations and for mutations in a subset of known XLID genes by Sanger sequencing. In total, 745 X-chromosomal genes were screened. After stringent filtering, a total of 1297 non-recurrent exonic variants remained for prioritization. Co-segregation analysis of potential clinically relevant changes revealed that 80 families (20%) carried pathogenic variants in established XLID genes. In 19 families, we detected likely causative protein truncating and missense variants in 7 novel and validated XLID genes (CLCN4, CNKSR2, FRMPD4, KLHL15, LAS1L, RLIM and USP27X) and potentially deleterious variants in 2 novel candidate XLID genes (CDK16 and TAF1). We show that the CLCN4 and CNKSR2 variants impair protein functions as indicated by electrophysiological studies and altered differentiation of cultured primary neurons from Clcn4(-/-) mice or after mRNA knock-down. The newly identified and candidate XLID proteins belong to pathways and networks with established roles in cognitive function and intellectual disability in particular. We suggest that systematic sequencing of all X-chromosomal genes in a cohort of patients with genetic evidence for X-chromosome locus involvement may resolve up to 58% of Fragile X-negative cases.","dc:creator":"Hu H","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"X-exome sequencing of 405 unresolved families identifies seven novel intellectual disability genes."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c7c1bf7-5e69-4f52-91d5-f7860c34b74c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9482f66-08a8-4d91-8ae9-62e2bf216e7e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25846153","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor protein, regulates the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cells by repressing proneural gene expression via Notch signaling. Previous studies showed that Hes1 expression oscillates in both mouse embryonic stem cells and neural stem cells, and that the oscillation contributes to their potency and differentiation fates. This oscillatory expression depends on the stability of Hes1, which is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms governing Hes1 stability remain unknown. We analyzed Hes1-interacting deubiquitinases purified from mouse embryonic stem cells using an Hes1-specific antibody, and identified the ubiquitin-specific protease 27x (Usp27x) as a new regulator of Hes1. We found that Hes1 was deubiquitinated and stabilized by Usp27x and its homologs ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (Usp22) and ubiquitin-specific protease 51 (Usp51). Knockdown of Usp22 shortened the half-life of Hes1, delayed its oscillation, and enhanced neuronal differentiation in mouse developing brain, whereas mis-expression of Usp27x reduced neuronal differentiation. These results suggest that these deubiquitinases modulate Hes1 protein dynamics by removing ubiquitin molecules, and thereby regulate neuronal differentiation of stem cells.","dc:creator":"Kobayashi T","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Deubiquitinating enzymes regulate Hes1 stability and neuronal differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Mis-expression of Usp27x in the mouse embryonic brain "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The significance of the findings observed after Usp27x miss-expression in the mouse embryonic brain is difficult to interpret, given that Usp27x was not found to be expressed in the developing brain."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ef498a65-de1e-4226-942e-a84f76ccf195","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d81bbd3-0371-492e-ad79-4a146a6038e9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Did not detect any significant phenotypes ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25846153","rdfs:label":"Usp27x knockout mouse embryos "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Data was not provided."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6273,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":3,"subject":{"id":"cggv:616ad7dc-dc80-4478-bbda-d7c65e58bc16","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100284","gene":"hgnc:13486","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The *USP27X* gene encodes a deubiquitinase highly expressed in the brain. To date, three variants in *USP27X* have been published in two large exome sequencing studies of families with X-linked intellectual disability. In 2016, Hu et al. (PMID: 25644381) reported a frameshift variant in a multigenerational family with three affected males with borderline to moderate ID, variable absent or poor speech, and behavioral problems. They also reported a missense variant in a family with four affected males, but only one was genotyped. This variant was not scored as there is insufficient evidence to support its pathogenicity. In 2019, Sanchis-Juan et al. (PMID: 31316545) reported a different frameshift variant in two half-siblings with developmental delay and intellectual disability, as well as dysmorphic facial features in one individual.\n\nClinVar contains one record of a likely pathogenic nonsense variant related to a neurodevelopmental disorder (Variation ID: 1321965). In the absence of additional information about the phenotype and the presence of other pathogenic variants, this variant was not scored. Additionally, DECIPHER has a *de novo* missense variant  in an individual with global developmental delay and mild intellectual disability who also carries a pathogenic frameshift variant in *SHANK3*, implicated in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (DECIPHER Patient ID: 482675). Therefore, the role of the variant in *USP27X* cannot be determined and was not scored. *USP27X* is constrained for both loss-of-function and missense variants (pLI 0.92 and missense Z score 3.18, gnomAD V2.1.1). No experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship was identified.\nIn summary, there is limited evidence at this time to support the relationship between *USP27X* and X-linked intellectual disability. Additional studies are required to verify this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 1, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
