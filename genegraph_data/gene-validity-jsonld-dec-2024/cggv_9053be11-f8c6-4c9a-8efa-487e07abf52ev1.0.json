Individuals with NDD, in addition to their primary neurodevelopmental phenotype, may also have accompanying syndromic features that can be very helpful diagnostically especially those with recognizable facial appearance. In this study, we describe ten similarly affected individuals from six unrelated families of different ethnic origins having bi-allelic truncating variants in TMEM94, which encodes for an uncharacterized transmembrane nuclear protein that is highly conserved across mammals. The affected individuals manifested with global developmental delay/intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features including triangular face, deep set eyes, broad nasal root and tip and anteverted nostrils, thick arched eye brows, hypertrichosis, pointed chin, and hypertelorism. Birthweight in the upper normal range was observed in most, and all but one had congenital heart defects (CHD). Gene expression analysis in available cells from affected individuals showed reduced expression of TMEM94. Global transcriptome profiling using microarray and RNA sequencing revealed several dysregulated genes essential for cell growth, proliferation and survival that are predicted to have an impact on cardiotoxicity hematological system and neurodevelopment. Loss of Tmem94 in mouse model generated by CRISPR/Cas9 was embryonic lethal and led to craniofacial and cardiac abnormalities and abnormal neuronal migration pattern, suggesting that this gene is important in craniofacial, cardiovascular, and nervous system development. Our study suggests the genetic etiology of a recognizable dysmorphic syndrome with NDD and CHD and highlights the role of TMEM94 in early development.","dc:creator":"Stephen J","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Bi-allelic TMEM94 Truncating Variants Are Associated with Neurodevelopmental Delay, Congenital Heart Defects, and Distinct Facial Dysmorphism."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9053be11-f8c6-4c9a-8efa-487e07abf52e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e171f172-8f6e-48d7-8b30-428bb54a17b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e171f172-8f6e-48d7-8b30-428bb54a17b6","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7eb0ce5-1ac2-40e8-af26-7ab04fadf203","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014738.6(TMEM94):c.810del (p.Asp270GlufsTer10)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913190903"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001629","obo:HP_0000431","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0000574","obo:HP_0001263"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:607481b6-76a6-4ad7-8167-a2cf6bcfef50_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c7eb0ce5-1ac2-40e8-af26-7ab04fadf203"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30919572","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Clinical exome sequencing (CES) is rapidly becoming the diagnostic test of choice in patients with suspected Mendelian diseases especially those that are heterogeneous in etiology and clinical presentation.

Detailed psychological evaluation and psychometric assessment were done when indicated. The review was done for a period between January 2018 and December 2020. Genetic investigations included chromosome karyotype, FISH study, metabolic/biochemical tests, chromosome microarray, gene sequencing, targeted mutation testing, trio whole exome and trio genome sequencing. A total of 644 patients with developmental delay, ID, learning difficulty, ASD, ADHD, or NNDs, were seen in genetic clinic from January 2018 to December 2020. A total of 506 patients were included in this review, all completed the genetic evaluations during the study period. There were 398 (61.8%) males and 246 (38.2%) females, with a ratio of 1.6:1. Positive family history of NDD was documented in 132 families, while 115 families had negative history and family history was unknown/unclear in the remaining. Fifty seven (11.26% [57/506]) patients had positive microarray results. Hundred ninety seven (38.9% [197/506]) patients had positive molecular testing. Genetic disorders were found in 133 (67.5% [133/197]) and inborn errors of metabolism were found in 42 (21.3% [42/197]). Consanguinity was documented in 139 patients with positive molecular diagnoses (139/197, 70.5%). Sixty nine (35% [69/197]) patients had autosomal dominant disorders, majority were De Novo (84%). Ninety-five (48% [95/197]) patients had autosomal recessive diseases, 40 mutations involved inborn errors of metabolism and 50 mutations involved genetic disorders. Pathogenic variants causing both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders were found in 98 patients (49.7% [98/197]), likely pathogenic variants causing both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders were found in 66 patients (33.5% [66/197]). X-linked related disorders were found in 10 patients (5% [10/197]). Mitochondrial mutation was found in one patient. Novel mutations were found in 76 patients (76/197 i.e., 38.56%). Twenty two patients had variants of unknown significant. The remaining 252 studied patients (252/506 i.e., 49.8%), remained undiagnosed. This study shows that neuro-genetic disorders in the UAE are very heterogeneous at clinical and molecular levels. Using microarray, WES and WGS a diagnosis was reached in 50% of the patients while no diagnosis was reached in other half of the studied patients. It is possible that some mutations were missed by WGS and WES. However, it is also possible that many of disorders in UAE population are novel and the causative mutation is not yet discovered. More researches need to be done in this population to uncover the molecular basis of these disorders.","dc:creator":"Saleh S","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Spectrum of neuro-genetic disorders in the United Arab Emirates national population."}},"rdfs:label":"Saleh Patient 29"},{"id":"cggv:cb8ec164-5bb8-4a4f-8833-6613ae4e82b6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb8ec164-5bb8-4a4f-8833-6613ae4e82b6_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity and homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:de489f17-0b8b-4a8b-82d2-eec1eda7f294_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de489f17-0b8b-4a8b-82d2-eec1eda7f294","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":28,"allele":{"id":"cggv:43c7e24b-1a69-4195-a096-689cc9c89d0b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014738.6(TMEM94):c.2729-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA401015763"}},"detectionMethod":"trio-WES, CMA with Sanger confirmation","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001561","obo:HP_0001541","obo:HP_0100602","obo:HP_0025678","obo:HP_0025672","obo:HP_0002202"],"secondTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:b43b7f83-8b02-4a54-b4eb-e000f4d3ae72_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:43c7e24b-1a69-4195-a096-689cc9c89d0b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32825426","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Intellectual developmental disorder with cardiac defects and dysmorphic facies (IDDCDF, MIM 618316) is a newly described disorder.

IDDCDF is a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by globally impaired development with intellectual disability and speech delay, congenital cardiac malformations, and dysmorphic facial features. Individuals with this condition present with various types of structural congenital heart disease, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of fallot. Ten unique variants (6 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 3 splice-site) that have been reported in 12 probands with IDDCDF in 7 publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 30526868, 32825426, 30919572, 31607746, 32552793, 37644014, 34374989). Most probands were born from consanguineous parents and variants were identified in a homozygous state in 10 of the 12 probands. More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse modelwhere the homozygous null variants fully replicated the human phenotype (PMID: 30526868). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TMEM94* and autosomal recessive tntellectual developmental disorder with cardiac defects and dysmorphic facies. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
