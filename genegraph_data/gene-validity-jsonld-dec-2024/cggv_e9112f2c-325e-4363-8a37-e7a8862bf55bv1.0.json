Using mice that bear the corresponding variant and recapitulate the B and T cell phenotypes, we show that the mutant AIOLOS homodimers and AIOLOS-IKAROS heterodimers did not bind the canonical AIOLOS-IKAROS DNA sequence. In addition, homodimers and heterodimers containing one mutant AIOLOS bound to genomic regions lacking both canonical motifs. However, the removal of the dimerization capacity from mutant AIOLOS restored B cell development. Hence, the adaptive immunity defect is caused by the AIOLOS variant hijacking IKAROS function. Heterodimeric interference is a new mechanism of autosomal dominance that causes inborn errors of immunity by impairing protein function via the mutation of its heterodimeric partner.","dc:creator":"Yamashita M","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A variant in human AIOLOS impairs adaptive immunity by interfering with IKAROS."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9112f2c-325e-4363-8a37-e7a8862bf55b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9112f2c-325e-4363-8a37-e7a8862bf55b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:502d184d-ecdf-443a-8ec2-62629d252f15","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7fcc5379-0690-4de5-bc50-1bb310915def","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"IKZF1 and IKZF3 are part of the transcription factor family IKAROS.

Patients carrying the AIOLOS p.N160S heterozygous variant displayed impaired humoral responses, abnormal B cell development (high percentage of CD21low B cells and negative CD23 expression), and abrogated CD40 responses. Naive T cells were increased, T cell differentiation was abnormal, and CD40L expression was dysregulated. In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutant protein failed DNA binding and pericentromeric targeting. The mutant was fully penetrant and had a dominant-negative effect over WT AIOLOS but not WT IKAROS. The human immunophenotype was recapitulated in a murine model carrying the corresponding human mutation. As demonstrated here, AIOLOS plays a key role in T and B cell development in humans, and the particular gene variant described is strongly associated with immunodeficiency and likely malignancy.","dc:creator":"Kuehn HS","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"T and B cell abnormalities, pneumocystis pneumonia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia associated with an AIOLOS defect in patients."},"rdfs:label":"B cell proliferation and differentiation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a785dd04-a8d0-43f3-80b5-a994b9f6d095","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9cb658b-6867-4b58-9850-2840b62e7e99","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Analysis of B cell levels in peripheral blood demonstrated undetectable levels of B cells.

Aiolos is a member of the Ikaros family; as a transcription factor, it can bind DNA in essential regions to control hematopoiesis and cell functions of immune cells. Immunodeficiency 84 or immunodeficiency due to IKZF3 deficiency (MONDO:0030333), is characterized by profound defects in B cell differentiation, and severe hypogammaglobulinemia in patients. A total of two missense variants have been reported in 7 patients in 2 publications only (PMID: 34155405, 34694366). The two variants: p.G159R and p.N160S were found in autosomal dominant traits. Experimental evidence includes loss of the ability to form pericentromeric heterochromatin foci in the dimer IKZF1-IKZF3 affecting the transcriptional activity of genes under IKZF3 regulation. Additionally, the Aiolos knock in mice evaluating the homologous variants for p.G159R, and p.N160S showed that mice have profound defects in B cell development and low immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM and IgA), which is consistent with the phenotype seen in patients.  \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship with only two variants identified in two publications.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e9112f2c-325e-4363-8a37-e7a8862bf55b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
