Myomaker, encoded by Mymk (Tmem8c), is a well-conserved plasma membrane protein required for myoblast fusion to form multinucleated myotubes in mouse, chick, and zebrafish. Here, we report that autosomal recessive mutations in MYMK (OMIM 615345) cause Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome in humans (CFZS; OMIM 254940) by reducing but not eliminating MYMK function. We characterize MYMK-CFZS as a congenital myopathy with marked facial weakness and additional clinical and pathologic features that distinguish it from other congenital neuromuscular syndromes. We show that a heterologous cell fusion assay in vitro and allelic complementation experiments in mymk knockdown and mymkinsT/insT zebrafish in vivo can differentiate between MYMK wild type, hypomorphic and null alleles. Collectively, these data establish that MYMK activity is necessary for normal muscle development and maintenance in humans, and expand the spectrum of congenital myopathies to include cell-cell fusion deficits.","dc:creator":"Di Gioia SA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"A defect in myoblast fusion underlies Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:570cb879-d299-41b0-87ba-406bf9567266_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3879cee5-2d23-4d02-a96d-361773a693c5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3879cee5-2d23-4d02-a96d-361773a693c5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":69,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:768d5c9d-4409-4b83-9674-28d03eeed706","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001080483.3(MYMK):c.553T>C (p.Cys185Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA375390429"}},{"id":"cggv:e7957c83-b26c-4bac-8054-899ffbaa1511","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001080483.3(MYMK):c.271C>A (p.Pro91Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5312268"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Juvenile-onset proximal myopathy, marked facial weakness, dysphagia, lagophthalmos, minimal limitations in horizontal gaze, chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, mild dysmorphic features including micrognathia, high-arched palate, and a prominent nasal tip.

However, the identity of muscle-specific proteins that directly govern this fusion process in mammals has remained elusive. Here we identify a muscle-specific membrane protein, named myomaker, that controls myoblast fusion. Myomaker is expressed on the cell surface of myoblasts during fusion and is downregulated thereafter. Overexpression of myomaker in myoblasts markedly enhances fusion, and genetic disruption of myomaker in mice causes perinatal death due to an absence of multi-nucleated muscle fibres. Remarkably, forced expression of myomaker in fibroblasts promotes fusion with myoblasts, demonstrating the direct participation of this protein in the fusion process. Pharmacological perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton abolishes the activity of myomaker, consistent with previous studies implicating actin dynamics in myoblast fusion. These findings reveal a long-sought myogenic fusion protein that controls mammalian myoblast fusion and provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of muscle formation.

The MYMK gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome in 2017 (Di Gioia et al., PMID: 28681861). One initiation codon, one non-canonical splice site, and six unique missense alleles have been reported in humans. A majority of individuals carry one copy of the p.Pro91Thr variant. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in nine unrelated probands in five publications (PMID: 28681861; Alrohaif et al., 2018, PMID:29560417; Hedberg-Oldfors et al., 2018, PMID:30065953; Camacho et al., 2020, PMID:32333597; Lunke et al., 2020, PMID:32573669). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in five additional family members, but none of the families met criteria for scoring segregation. Homozygous loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data, in vitro functional analyses of reported variants, mouse and zebrafish models, and rescue in the zebrafish model (Millay et al., 2013, PMID:23868259; PMID: 28681861). In summary, MYMK is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 03.02.2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:570cb879-d299-41b0-87ba-406bf9567266"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
