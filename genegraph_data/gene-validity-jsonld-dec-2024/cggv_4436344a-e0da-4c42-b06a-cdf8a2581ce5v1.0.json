One subtype, spastic paraplegia type 47 (SPG47 or HSP-AP4B1), is due to bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in the AP4B1 gene. AP4B1 is a subunit of the adapter protein complex 4 (AP-4), a heterotetrameric protein complex that regulates the transport of membrane proteins. Since 2011, 11 individuals from six families with AP4B1 mutations have been reported, nine of whom had homozygous mutations and were from consanguineous families. Here we report eight patients with AP4B1-associated SPG47, the majority born to non-consanguineous parents and carrying compound heterozygous mutations. Core clinical features in this cohort and previously published patients include neonatal hypotonia that progresses to spasticity, early onset developmental delay with prominent motor delay and severely impaired or absent speech development, episodes of stereotypic laughter, seizures including frequent febrile seizures, thinning of the corpus callosum, and delayed myelination/white matter loss. Given that some of the features of AP-4 deficiency overlap with those of cerebral palsy, and the discovery of the disorder in non-consanguineous populations, we believe that AP-4 deficiency may be more common than previously appreciated.","dc:creator":"Ebrahimi-Fakhari D","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Clinical and genetic characterization of AP4B1-associated

Mutations in genes affecting different subunits of AP-4, including AP4B1, AP4E1, AP4S1, and AP4M1, have been reported in patients with the AP-4 deficiency phenotype. We describe two siblings from a non-consanguineous couple who presented with severe ID, absent speech, microcephaly, growth retardation, and progressive spastic tetraplegia. Whole-exome sequencing in the two patients identified the novel homozygous 2-bp deletion c.1160_1161delCA (p.(Thr387Argfs*30)) in AP4B1. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation in the siblings and revealed it in the heterozygous state in both parents.

Here, we report on eight affected individuals who were from three consanguineous families and presented with severe intellectual disability, absent speech, shy character, stereotypic laughter, muscular hypotonia that progressed to spastic paraplegia, microcephaly, foot deformity, decreased muscle mass of the lower limbs, inability to walk, and growth retardation. Using a combination of autozygosity mapping and either Sanger sequencing of candidate genes or next-generation exome sequencing, we identified one mutation in each of three genes encoding adaptor protein complex 4 (AP4) subunits: a nonsense mutation in AP4S1 (NM_007077.3: c.124C>T, p.Arg42(∗)), a frameshift mutation in AP4B1 (NM_006594.2: c.487_488insTAT, p.Glu163_Ser739delinsVal), and a splice mutation in AP4E1 (NM_007347.3: c.542+1_542+4delGTAA, r.421_542del, p.Glu181Glyfs(∗)20).

This study aims to evaluate the impact of loss-of-function variants in AP-4 subunits on intracellular protein trafficking using patient-derived cells. We investigated 15 patient-derived fibroblast lines and generated six lines of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons covering a wide range of AP-4 variants. All patient-derived fibroblasts showed reduced levels of the AP4E1 subunit, a surrogate for levels of the AP-4 complex. The autophagy protein ATG9A accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and was depleted from peripheral compartments. Western blot analysis demonstrated a 3-5-fold increase in ATG9A expression in patient lines. ATG9A was redistributed upon re-expression of AP4B1 arguing that mistrafficking of ATG9A is AP-4-dependent. Examining the downstream effects of ATG9A mislocalization, we found that autophagic flux was intact in patient-derived fibroblasts both under nutrient-rich conditions and when autophagy is stimulated. Mitochondrial metabolism and intracellular iron content remained unchanged. In iPSC-derived cortical neurons from patients with AP4B1-associated SPG47, AP-4 subunit levels were reduced while ATG9A accumulated in the trans-Golgi network. Levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II were reduced, suggesting a neuron-specific alteration in autophagosome turnover. Neurite outgrowth and branching were reduced in AP-4-HSP neurons pointing to a role of AP-4-mediated protein trafficking in neuronal development. Collectively, our results establish ATG9A mislocalization as a key marker of AP-4 deficiency in patient-derived cells, including the first human neuron model of AP-4-HSP, which will aid diagnostic and therapeutic studies.","dc:creator":"Behne R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Adaptor protein complex 4 deficiency: a paradigm of childhood-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by defective protein trafficking."},"rdfs:label":"AP4B1 interaction with other AP4 subunit genes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The finding that all four AP4 subunits result in a very similar, distinct phenotype is\nvery strong evidence; this also demonstrates biochemical functional evidence of\nthe involvement of AP4E1 in the AP4 complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4436344a-e0da-4c42-b06a-cdf8a2581ce5_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:86f4b753-be57-4f75-8f53-2c690f6c4374","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:947f08e1-3388-4dcf-9fa4-0f1b68c6f6a0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mislocalization of ATG9A (cargo protein of AP4 complex) found in patient fibroblasts with AP4 deficiency (both from loss of AP4B1 and other AP4 subunits)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31915823","rdfs:label":"Defective protein trafficking in AP4 deficiency patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4436344a-e0da-4c42-b06a-cdf8a2581ce5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:728c20da-1c57-468e-a7ab-b75eb5534ebf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d06ef129-6b59-4977-8bbe-6007dfd3b471","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Re-expression of AP4B1 in fibroblasts from patients with AP4B1-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (AP4-deficiency syndrome) leads to a reduction of total ATG9A levels and redistribution from the trans-Golgi network to the cell periphery comparable to controls.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31915823","rdfs:label":"Re-expression of AP4B1 in AP4B1-null patient fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3217,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:a8394325-6068-4edf-b46f-764cedd93429","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100176","gene":"hgnc:572","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"AP4B1 loss-of-function variants were first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Adaptor Protein 4 (AP4) deficiency syndrome in 2011 (PMID: 21620353). AP4 deficiency results in severe early-onset developmental delay with motor and speech delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia in infancy followed by spastic paraplegia and later tetraplegia, microcephaly, and seizures (PMID: 32979048). At least 53 individuals from 40 families with biallelic AP4B1 nonsense, frameshift, splicing and missense variants leading to loss of protein function have been reported (PMIDs: 21620353, 29193663, 24781758, 32979048). The gene-disease association is further supported by biochemical and functional evidence demonstrating loss of AP4 complex function and impaired protein localization in fibroblasts from patients with biallelic AP4B1 loss-of-function variants, with the impaired protein localization rescued upon re-expression of AP4B1 (PMID: 31915823). In summary, the AP4B1 gene is definitively associated with autosomal recessive AP4 deficiency syndrome.
