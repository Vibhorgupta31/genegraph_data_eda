Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined with tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry, to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.","dc:creator":"Uhlén M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Proteomics.

In addition to being a central conduit for ATP production, CI activity has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. CI is built in a stepwise fashion through the actions of several assembly factors. We employed interaction proteomics to interrogate the molecular associations of 15 core subunits and assembly factors previously linked to human CI deficiency, resulting in a network of 101 proteins and 335 interactions (edges). TIMMDC1, a predicted 4-pass membrane protein, reciprocally associated with multiple members of the MCIA CI assembly factor complex and core CI subunits and was localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its depletion resulted in reduced CI activity and cellular respiration. Quantitative proteomics demonstrated a role for TIMMDC1 in assembly of membrane-embedded and soluble arms of the complex.

Although genome sequencing in principle reveals all genetic variants, their sizeable number and poorer annotation make prioritization challenging. Here, we demonstrate the power of transcriptome sequencing to molecularly diagnose 10% (5 of 48) of mitochondriopathy patients and identify candidate genes for the remainder. We find a median of one aberrantly expressed gene, five aberrant splicing events and six mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and establish disease-causing roles for each kind. Private exons often arise from cryptic splice sites providing an important clue for variant prioritization. One such event is found in the complex I assembly factor TIMMDC1 establishing a novel disease-associated gene. In conclusion, our study expands the diagnostic tools for detecting non-exonic variants and provides examples of intronic loss-of-function variants with pathological relevance.","dc:creator":"Kremer LS","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Genetic diagnosis of Mendelian disorders via RNA sequencing."},"rdfs:label":"Kremer 2015 rescue in patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"rescue of impaired complex I assembly in patient cells, which fits with reduced complex I activity in patient tissue NOTE: the patient from whom the cells were derived does not meet inclusion criteria for Leigh syndrome"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5},{"id":"cggv:83d26d62-2863-46d9-ad7d-96c086e65e8e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:83d26d62-2863-46d9-ad7d-96c086e65e8e_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d3b46a7e-d33e-4cde-8e97-edfd0a37a8d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6d52dd3-3698-4a24-a198-0807f42fe93c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":20,"detectionMethod":"Whole genome sequencing.

The TIMMDC1 gene encodes translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane domain-containing protein 1, a NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor.\n\nThe TIMMDC1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2017 (PMID: 28604674). There were other individuals in this paper reported to have Leigh syndrome spectrum, however not enough details were provided to confirm this diagnosis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 28604674). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 24344204, 25613900, 28604674). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although the total score (7) falls in the moderate range, only one case with Leigh syndrome spectrum has been reported and confirmed, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 30, 2021 (SOP Version 7).\nOnly one case scored so must downgrade to limited.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:83d26d62-2863-46d9-ad7d-96c086e65e8e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
