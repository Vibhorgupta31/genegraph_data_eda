Among inherited disorders, cytopenias predisposing to leukemia require a timely and accurate diagnosis to ensure appropriate medical management, including adequate monitoring and stem cell transplantation prior to the development of leukemia. We aimed to define the types and prevalences of the genetic causes leading to persistent cytopenias in children. The study comprises children with persistent cytopenias, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, or suspected inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, who were referred for genetic evaluation from all pediatric hematology centers in Israel during 2016-2019. For variant detection, we used Sanger sequencing of commonly mutated genes and a custom-made targeted next-generation sequencing panel covering 226 genes known to be mutated in inherited cytopenias; the minority subsequently underwent whole exome sequencing. In total, 189 children with persistent cytopenias underwent a genetic evaluation. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were identified in 59 patients (31.2%), including 47 with leukemia predisposing syndromes. Most of the latter (32, 68.1%) had inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, nine (19.1%) had inherited thrombocytopenia predisposing to leukemia, and three each (6.4%) had predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome or congenital neutropenia. Twelve patients had cytopenias with no known leukemia predisposition, including nine children with inherited thrombocytopenia and three with congenital neutropenia. In summary, almost one third of 189 children referred with persistent cytopenias had an underlying inherited disorder; 79.7% of whom had a germline predisposition to leukemia. Precise diagnosis of children with cytopenias should direct follow-up and management programs and may positively impact disease outcome.","dc:creator":"Gilad O","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Syndromes predisposing to leukemia are a major cause of inherited cytopenias in children."}},"rdfs:label":"5112"},{"id":"cggv:54b6abf3-2d04-48c6-b193-e87b23343613","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54b6abf3-2d04-48c6-b193-e87b23343613_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5e2d9c89-42ea-49d5-b11c-46bee48ac469_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5e2d9c89-42ea-49d5-b11c-46bee48ac469","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:1172a3ef-a5a9-4392-a6c1-0d1cf64519b5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001085487.3(MYSM1):c.1467C>G (p.Tyr489del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340521330"}},{"id":"cggv:2b3e57b3-58a9-4a28-9fd8-4e99bc35c152","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001085487.3(MYSM1):c.399G>A (p.Leu133=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA417986757"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"\"Further analysis of her lymphocyte subpopulations showed a marked reduction in peripheral CD19+ and CD16+ CD56+ cells, suggesting B-cell and NK-cell deficiency.\"","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001882","obo:HP_0005528","obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0002205","obo:HP_0001873"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:9450a086-bdb5-4460-bdd3-95cc8ceca1ae_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1172a3ef-a5a9-4392-a6c1-0d1cf64519b5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640305","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Myb-like SWIRM and MPN domains (MYSM1) is a chromatin-binding transcriptional regulator that mediates histone 2A deubiquitination, which plays a vital role in hematopoiesis and lymphocyte differentiation. Biallelic variants in MYSM1 cause a rare bone marrow failure syndrome (OMIM #618116). To date, only three pathogenic variants (E390*, R478*, and H656R) of MYSM1 have been reported in nine patients, and all variants are homozygous. Here, we describe a Chinese female patient who mainly presented with leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, severe anemia, and B-cell and natural killer cell deficiency in the peripheral blood, and was diagnosed with bone marrow failure. Trio whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel compound heterozygous variant in MYSM1 (c.399G > A, p.L133L, and c.1467C > G, p.Y489*). The c.399G > A synonymous variant is located at the 3'-end of exon 6, which is predicted to affect MYSM1 mRNA splicing. Analysis of the products obtained from the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the c.399G > A variant leads to exon 6 skipping, resulting in a premature termination codon (c.321_399 del, p.V108Lfs*13). cDNA sequencing suggested that the c.1467C > G variant triggered nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation. Moreover, we identified a novel transcript of MYSM1 mRNA (missing exons 5 and 6) in human blood cells. Our results expand the mutation spectrum of MYSM1; additionally, this is the first report of a synonymous splicing variant that induces post-transcriptional skipping of exon 6 leading to a bone marrow failure syndrome phenotype.","dc:creator":"Li N","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Further delineation of bone marrow failure syndrome caused by novel compound heterozygous variants of MYSM1."}},{"id":"cggv:ead20c09-d4da-4c7f-92c2-57b65adfa0f9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2b3e57b3-58a9-4a28-9fd8-4e99bc35c152"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640305"}],"rdfs:label":"Chinese Female"},{"id":"cggv:9450a086-bdb5-4460-bdd3-95cc8ceca1ae","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9450a086-bdb5-4460-bdd3-95cc8ceca1ae_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ead20c09-d4da-4c7f-92c2-57b65adfa0f9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ead20c09-d4da-4c7f-92c2-57b65adfa0f9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ead20c09-d4da-4c7f-92c2-57b65adfa0f9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR showed that this variant cause exon 6 skipping which results in a premature stop codon (c.321_399 del, p.V108Lfs*13) (Fig. 2D)."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:207bd0ed-8ab7-4d47-944e-1b9b33f2781e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:207bd0ed-8ab7-4d47-944e-1b9b33f2781e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:befaf4bb-6604-4d9a-b6e9-c2802d6f64c5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001085487.3(MYSM1):c.1168G>T (p.Glu390del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340524847"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0005528"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Autozygosity mapping","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9395bd4d-1fc0-45ab-9f36-afc0364f1203_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:befaf4bb-6604-4d9a-b6e9-c2802d6f64c5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24288411"},"rdfs:label":"Index"},{"id":"cggv:9395bd4d-1fc0-45ab-9f36-afc0364f1203","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9395bd4d-1fc0-45ab-9f36-afc0364f1203_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Took off a half point for consanguinity.

We identified two motifs in MYSM1 that were essential for innate immune suppression: the SWIRM domain that interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6 and the metalloproteinase domain that removed K63 polyubiquitins. This study identifies MYSM1 as a key negative regulator of the innate immune system that guards against an overzealous self-destructive immune response.","dc:creator":"Panda S","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Deubiquitinase MYSM1 Regulates Innate Immunity through Inactivation of TRAF3 and TRAF6 Complexes."},"rdfs:label":"TRAF3 and TRAF6 complexes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:62eaafdd-f548-4f65-8230-21df489c3d95","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0001a99e-5a51-48bd-b448-baa0370d1504","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Affected patients exhibit bone marrow failure which could be induced by increased susceptibility to genotoxic stress.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28115216","rdfs:label":"Increased genotoxic stress in MYSM1-deficient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ee22e44c-4239-47f4-b971-c8b5012b8a1c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee8d527d-5f3e-45bc-8efe-4ca88df565ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7f9d783-bff3-4d28-b8d3-dd12317d40f5","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"MYSM1 deficient fetal livers have a significant reduction in hematopoietic cells, specifically B lymphoid lineage cells and fetal liver cells were severely impaired in their contribution to hematopoiesis in the recipient mice (mice transplanted with fetal liver\ncells into irradiated recipients, either alone, or in a direct 1:1 competition with allotype marked wild-type fetal liver cells.)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26125289","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"MYSM1 is a chromatin-interacting deubiquitinase recently shown to be essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and normal progression of hematopoiesis in both mice and humans.

In this study we, for the first time, address these questions first, by performing a detailed analysis of hematopoiesis in the fetal livers of Mysm1-knockout mice, and second, by assessing the effects of an inducible Mysm1 ablation on adult HSC functions. Our data indicate that MYSM1 is essential for normal HSC function and progression of hematopoiesis in the fetal liver. Furthermore, the inducible knockout model demonstrates a continuous requirement for MYSM1 to maintain HSC functions and antagonize p53 activation in adult bone marrow. These studies advance our understanding of the role of MYSM1 in HSC biology, and provide new insights into the human hematopoietic failure syndrome resulting from MYSM1 deficiency.","dc:creator":"Förster M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Deubiquitinase MYSM1 Is Essential for Normal Fetal Liver Hematopoiesis and for the Maintenance of Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Adult Bone Marrow."},"rdfs:label":"Defect in Hematopoiesis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ee22e44c-4239-47f4-b971-c8b5012b8a1c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4ad147e0-361b-4994-9809-2d4168df553c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f34136e6-a622-44e9-bfb2-da0902e9cd2d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"The patient had spontaneous improvement of the patient’s immunohematologic features, including a correction in the number of circulating T and NK lymphocytes, reticulocytes, and neutrophils (Fig 3, A) strikingly, circulating B lymphocytes (CD19 ), which were completely absent in the patient at age 4 months (Table I), were detected at a normal level at 33 and 39 months of age (Fig 3, A).

Ubiquitination of histone H2A (H2A-K119u) is a common chromatin modification associated with gene silencing, and controlled by the ubiquitin-ligase polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) and H2A-deubiquitinating enzymes (H2A-DUBs). The roles of H2A-DUBs in mammalian development, stem cells, and hematopoiesis have not been addressed. Here we characterized an H2A-DUB targeted mouse line Mysm1(tm1a/tm1a) and demonstrated defects in BM hematopoiesis, resulting in lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytosis. Development of lymphocytes was impaired from the earliest stages of their differentiation, and there was also a depletion of erythroid cells and a defect in erythroid progenitor function. These phenotypes resulted from a cell-intrinsic requirement for Mysm1 in the BM. Importantly, Mysm1(tm1a/tm1a) HSCs were functionally impaired, and this was associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, γH2AX DNA damage marker, and p53 protein in the hematopoietic progenitors. Overall, these data establish a role for Mysm1 in the maintenance of BM stem cell function, in the control of oxidative stress and genetic stability in hematopoietic progenitors, and in the development of lymphoid and erythroid lineages.","dc:creator":"Nijnik A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"The critical role of histone H2A-deubiquitinase Mysm1 in hematopoiesis and lymphocyte differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8531,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:42905cf9-2519-4ef7-a367-043c52422ac4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020856","gene":"hgnc:29401","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"MYSM1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive bone marrow syndrome in 2013 (Alsultan et al., PMID: 24288411). Bone marrow failure due to MYSM1 deficiency is characterized by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and B cell deficiency resulting in recurrent infections and in some cases, non hematologic features such as dysmorphic features, skeletal abnormalities, and developmental delay. At least seven variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice) that have been reported in seven probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 24288411, 28115216, 26220525, 33858043, 30735661, 32640305, 35295078) are included in this curation. MYSM1 variants segregated with disease in two families and heterozygous carriers were asymptomatic (PMIDs: 28115216, 24288411). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models, in vivo genetic reversion in an affected patient, biochemical function, functional alteration, and protein interactions studies. (PMIDs: 26125289, 26474655, 22184403, 26220525, 28115216). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between MYSM1 and autosomal recessive bone marrow failure. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
