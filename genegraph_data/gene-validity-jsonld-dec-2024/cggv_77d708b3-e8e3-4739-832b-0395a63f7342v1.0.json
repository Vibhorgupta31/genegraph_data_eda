Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging shows distinct abnormalities. We report the identification of a gene for l-2-HGA aciduria (MIM 236792) using homozygosity mapping. Nine homozygous mutations including three missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, two splice site mutations and two deletions were identified in the gene C14orf160, localized on chromosome 14q22.1, in 21 patients from one non-consanguineous and 14 consanguineous Turkish families.

In principle, TCA cycle intermediates are regenerated on every turn and can facilitate the oxidation of an infinite number of nutrient molecules. However, TCA cycle intermediates can be lost to cataplerotic pathways that provide precursors for biosynthesis, and they must be replaced by anaplerotic pathways that regenerate these intermediates. Together, anaplerosis and cataplerosis help regulate rates of biosynthesis by dictating precursor supply, and they play underappreciated roles in catabolism and cellular energy status. They facilitate recycling pathways and nitrogen trafficking necessary for catabolism, and they influence redox state and oxidative capacity by altering TCA cycle intermediate concentrations. These functions vary widely by tissue and play emerging roles in disease. This article reviews the roles of anaplerosis and cataplerosis in various tissues and discusses how they alter carbon transitions, and highlights their contribution to mechanisms of disease.","dc:creator":"Inigo M","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Ins and Outs of the TCA Cycle: The Central Role of Anaplerosis."},"rdfs:label":"D2HGDH causes similar phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"GCEP elected to not score ATP5F1B as toxic inhibition interaction deviates from previous use of this category\nScored 0.5 for D2HGDH"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:77d708b3-e8e3-4739-832b-0395a63f7342_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96625663-8714-4d22-bd16-b62761200960","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a304b76e-1370-472b-84e2-505eff752265","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"L2hgdh deficiency leads to impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis and late-onset neurodegeneration in mouse brains","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28137912","rdfs:label":"Mouse Model Knockout of L2hgdh"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"0.5 biochemical phenotype  + 0.5 muscular (and early demise) + 0.5 brain mri similarities"},{"id":"cggv:0d8b4942-6ad0-4eb3-915f-1b4c60f3bd5f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da09e8e6-6292-4b6e-be56-b54fd738f4dd","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Urine biochemistry and brain MRI match humans ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17475916","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"l-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (l-2-HGA) is a neurometabolic disorder that produces a variety of clinical neurological deficits, including psychomotor retardation, seizures and ataxia.

LGA has been proposed as an endo- and exogenous cytotoxic organic acid that induces free radical formation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this report, we analyzed 14 L2HGA patients belonging to six unrelated consanguineous families the south of Tunisia. The patients were diagnosed with L2HGA disease confirmed on the presence of high level of LGA in urine. We analyzed the L2HGDH gene in all probands and identified the same c.241A>G homozygous mutation, which was previously reported in Tunisia. We also used intragenic single nucleotide length polymorphisms (SNPs) and two extragenic microsatellites flanking the L2HGDH gene to confirm the founder effect of c.241A>G mutation in the 14 studied cases. In addition, we carried out the measurement of the oxidative stress parameters in the plasma of L2HGA patients which revealed a significant increase in the malondialdehyde levels (MDA), a biomarker of lipid peroxydation, and the reduced glutathione (GSH).

In the three remaining families, no pathogenic mutations in the L-2-HGA were found, which suggests either alterations in regulatory regions of the gene or of its intervening sequences, compound heterozygosity for large genomic deletion and, or further genetic heterogeneity.","dc:creator":"Vilarinho L","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Novel L2HGDH mutations in 21 patients with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria of Portuguese origin."}},{"id":"cggv:98bb42d9-89f7-40ae-94f5-356a31a0c2e8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1abb0a38-65bc-49b5-aa39-e0570438b419"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16134148"}],"rdfs:label":"P4 "},{"id":"cggv:6d0cc9fe-b9a1-49ae-9135-229d3a814a0a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d0cc9fe-b9a1-49ae-9135-229d3a814a0a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:98bb42d9-89f7-40ae-94f5-356a31a0c2e8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:98bb42d9-89f7-40ae-94f5-356a31a0c2e8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9edd2365-8990-481a-82b9-689748b2bcab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9edd2365-8990-481a-82b9-689748b2bcab","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:5096a6ad-2ddd-40fb-9bda-58c61f7f60ea","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024884.3(L2HGDH):c.407del (p.Lys136SerfsTer3)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA706575927"}},{"id":"cggv:f3d7e272-1f17-4dba-afa6-5027f7e9d9b4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024884.3(L2HGDH):c.699dup (p.Asp234ArgfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2580611716"}}],"detectionMethod":" c.407 del A (p.K136SfsTer3) and c.699_c700 ins A (p.D234RfsTer42); confirmed in trans ","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0002134","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0040144"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:53c9e896-d896-4daf-a94f-b1f5257f8a00_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5096a6ad-2ddd-40fb-9bda-58c61f7f60ea"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29980873","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a genetic metabolic disorder.

Accumulation of L-2-hydroxyglutarate has a neurotoxic effect (PMID: 12781789).   \n\n*L2HGDH* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2004 (PMID: 15385440; disease entity first described in 1980; PMID: 6787330), in individuals with central nervous system deterioration including epilepsy and elevated levels of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in numerous body fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *L2HGDH*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *L2HGDH* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight variants (four frameshift, one nonsense, three missense) in six probands from six publications (PMIDs 29980873, 34719772, 25982940, 24573090, 33839641, 16134148). However, more than 100 cases have been reported to date (PMID: 37113859). Of note, individuals with biallelic null variants have been reported. Affected individuals have a generally consistent phenotype with predominant neurologic involvement (intellectual disability, seizures, developmental delay, ataxia movement disorders, spastic paraplegia, white matter disease, basal ganglia lesions) with elevated L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine and other body fluids. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by other genes with a similar biochemical function, RNA expression studies showing high expression of *L2HGDH* in brain, and animal models (mice and canines) which parallel human disease (PMIDs: 34270333, 17475916, 28137912, 15385440). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *L2HGDH* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 31, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
