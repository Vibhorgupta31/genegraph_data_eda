The genetic basis for CIPA is unknown. Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces neurite outgrowth and promotes survival of embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons. Mice lacking the gene for TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase for NGF, share dramatic phenotypic features of CIPA, including loss of responses to painful stimuli, although anhidrosis is not apparent in these animals. We therefore considered the human TRKA homologue as a candidate for the CIPA gene. The mRNA and genomic DNA encoding TRKA were analysed in three unrelated CIPA patients who had consanguineous parents. We detected a deletion-, splice- and missense-mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain in these three patients. Our findings strongly suggest that defects in TRKA cause CIPA and that the NGF-TRKA system has a crucial role in the development and function of the nociceptive reception as well as establishment of thermoregulation via sweating in humans. These results also implicate genes encoding other TRK and neurotrophin family members as candidates for developmental defect(s) of the nervous system.","dc:creator":"Indo Y","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Mutations in the TRKA/NGF receptor gene in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis."}},"rdfs:label":"II.1"},{"id":"cggv:c2eaca4b-aa3f-4f4f-9439-6a59a11b3b1e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2eaca4b-aa3f-4f4f-9439-6a59a11b3b1e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c2eaca4b-aa3f-4f4f-9439-6a59a11b3b1e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional evidence on this variant in Mardy et al., 2001; PMID: 11159935\n"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c87319c2-8019-4834-81fb-54f2c39f5e48_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c87319c2-8019-4834-81fb-54f2c39f5e48","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6724c66c-1d3f-4f07-afbe-2159a5723712","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001007792.1(NTRK1):c.1938+3A>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/12301"}},"detectionMethod":"Legend of Figure 2c, d and e","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007021","obo:HP_0000970","obo:HP_0000007","obo:HP_0002270"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ace57f88-b613-45f5-9235-9598e2561b45_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6724c66c-1d3f-4f07-afbe-2159a5723712"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8696348"},"rdfs:label":"II.1"},{"id":"cggv:ace57f88-b613-45f5-9235-9598e2561b45","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ace57f88-b613-45f5-9235-9598e2561b45_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ace57f88-b613-45f5-9235-9598e2561b45_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Aberrant splicing has been shown in this same paper"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Aberrant splicing has been shown in this same paper"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:889a040a-1186-4921-9f7f-860dd28280fc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:889a040a-1186-4921-9f7f-860dd28280fc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5bbec21b-758d-47b0-a891-8e935b69a4d4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001007792.1(NTRK1):c.1336A>T (p.Lys446Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10584140"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000007","obo:HP_0002270","obo:HP_0001945","obo:HP_0000970","obo:HP_0012333","obo:HP_0007021"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0ec63606-0c27-4491-bed4-b46c4de20f48_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5bbec21b-758d-47b0-a891-8e935b69a4d4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28328124","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN-IV) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that usually begins in infancy and is characterized by anhidrosis, insensitivity to noxious stimuli leading to self-mutilating behavior, and intellectual disability. HSAN-IV is caused by mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene, NTRK1, encoding the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (NGF) which maps to chromosome 1q21-q22. Patients with HSAN-IV lack all NGF-dependent neurons, the primary afferents and sympathetic postganglionic neurons leading to lack of pain sensation and the presence of anhidrosis, respectively. Herein, we report nine patients from nine unrelated families with HSAN-IV due to various mutations in NTRK1, five of which are novel. These are three missense and two nonsense mutations distributed in various domains of NTRK1 involved in binding of NGF. The affected patients had variable intellectual deficits, and some had delayed diagnosis of HSAN-IV.

Human TRKA encodes a high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), a member of the neurotrophin family that induces neurite outgrowth and promotes survival of embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons. We have recently demonstrated that TRKA is responsible for CIPA by identifying three mutations in a region encoding the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of TRKA in one Ecuadorian and three Japanese families. We have developed a comprehensive strategy to screen for TRKA mutations, on the basis of the gene's structure and organization. Here we report 11 novel mutations, in seven affected families. These are six missense mutations, two frameshift mutations, one nonsense mutation, and two splice-site mutations. Mendelian inheritance of the mutations is confirmed in six families for which parent samples are available. Two mutations are linked, on the same chromosome, to Arg85Ser and to His598Tyr;Gly607Val, hence, they probably represent double and triple mutations. The mutations are distributed in an extracellular domain, involved in NGF binding, as well as the intracellular signal-transduction domain. These data suggest that TRKA defects cause CIPA in various ethnic groups.","dc:creator":"Mardy S","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis: novel mutations in the

and characterized the mouse homolog of the human trk proto-oncogene, a member of the protein tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor gene family. Here, we present the first report of a trk-encoded mRNA species in vivo. In situ hybridization analysis in the mouse embryo reveals a striking temporal and spatial regulation of trk transcription, with expression confined to the sensory cranial (trigeminal, superior, jugular) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of neural crest origin. Recent reports have shown that TK receptors can play regulatory roles in embryonic development. Thus, the developmental mutations W in mouse and torso and sevenless in Drosophila represent genes that code for defective TK receptors.

In vivo, NGF decreases the extent of naturally occurring cell death in developing sympathetic ganglia and protects cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and caudatoputamen. NGF interacts with the low-affinity p75 receptor and with Trk, a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the trk proto-oncogene. To study the role of Trk in vivo, we have ablated the gene in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. Mice lacking Trk have severe sensory and sympathetic neuropathies and most die within one month of birth. They have extensive neuronal cell loss in trigeminal, sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia, as well as a decrease in the cholinergic basal forebrain projections to the hippocampus and cortex.

The sensitization of capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 ion channels is necessary for NGF-induced hyperalgesia, but naked mole-rats have fully functional TRPV1 channels. We show that exposing isolated naked mole-rat nociceptors to NGF does not sensitize TRPV1. However, the naked mole-rat NGF receptor TrkA displays a reduced ability to engage signal transduction pathways that sensitize TRPV1. Between one- and three-amino-acid substitutions in the kinase domain of the naked mole-rat TrkA are sufficient to render the receptor hypofunctional, and this is associated with the absence of heat hyperalgesia.

In patients with the same phenotype, including anosmia, and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, NTRK1 was first described in 1996 (PMID: 8696348), followed by the discovery of several missense (e.g. PMID: 11159935​), stop (e.g. PMID: 28328124), frame-shift (e.g. PMID: 28328124​), and splice variants (e.g. PMID: 10330344), all falling into the biallelic loss-of-function cluster. NTRK1 is a nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor and tyrosine kinase. Following internalization, it is involved in several processes, including regulation of inflammatory factor release​ and phagocytosis. One of its substrates is TRPV1, a nonselective cation channel expressed in small nerve endings that is responsible for the perception of heat pain and that can be sensitized by the presence of NGF (PMID: 27732851). Several patient cases and animal models reproduce the highly specific CIP phenotype.\nIn summary, NTRK1 is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal recessive congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP).
