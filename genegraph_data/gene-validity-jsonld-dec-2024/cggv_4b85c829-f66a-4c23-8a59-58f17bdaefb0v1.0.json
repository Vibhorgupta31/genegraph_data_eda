Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs.

A homozygous two base pair deletion was identified in exon 2 of GYS1, and the parents and sibling were confirmed as heterozygous carriers of the deletion. This case highlights the importance of differentiating between mitochondrial compensatory phenomena and true mitochondrial disease, and suggests that GYS1 deficiency could be a common cause of sudden cardiac death in children.

Timed matings established that Mendelian inheritance was followed for up to 18.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and that approximately 90% of GYS1-null animals died soon after birth due to impaired cardiac function. Defects in cardiac development began between 11.5 and 14.5 dpc. At 18.5 dpc, the hearts were significantly smaller, with reduced ventricular chamber size and enlarged atria. Consistent with impaired cardiac function, edema, pooling of blood, and hemorrhagic liver were seen. Glycogen synthase and glycogen were undetectable in cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle from the surviving null mice, and the hearts showed normal morphology and function. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common birth defects in humans, at up to 1 in 50 live births.

The underlying mechanism is an inability to synthesize glycogen in skeletal and cardiac muscle.\n\nFour variants (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) that have been reported in three probands in three publications (PMIDs: 17928598, 19699667, 21958591) are included in this curation.
