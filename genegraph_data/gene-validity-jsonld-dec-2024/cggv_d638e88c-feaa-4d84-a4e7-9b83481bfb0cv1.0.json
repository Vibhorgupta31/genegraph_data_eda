Although many BMD and some AVMD cases harbor mutations in BEST1 or PRPH2, the underlying genetic cause remains unknown for many affected individuals. In a large family with autosomal-dominant VMD, gene mapping and whole-exome sequencing led to the identification of a c.713T>G (p.Leu238Arg) IMPG1 mutation, which was subsequently found in two other families with autosomal-dominant VMD and the same phenotype. IMPG1 encodes the SPACR protein, a component of the rod and cone photoreceptor extracellular matrix domains. Structural modeling indicates that the p.Leu238Arg substitution destabilizes the conserved SEA1 domain of SPACR. Screening of 144 probands who had various forms of macular dystrophy revealed three other IMPG1 mutations. Two individuals from one family affected by autosomal-recessive VMD were homozygous for the splice-site mutation c.807+1G>T, and two from another family were compound heterozygous for the mutations c.461T>C (p.Leu154Pro) and c.1519C>T (p.Arg507(∗)). Most cases had a normal or moderately decreased electrooculogram Arden ratio. We conclude that IMPG1 mutations cause both autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of VMD, thus indicating that impairment of the interphotoreceptor matrix might be a general cause of VMD.","dc:creator":"Manes G","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in IMPG1 cause vitelliform macular dystrophies."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d638e88c-feaa-4d84-a4e7-9b83481bfb0c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bc1dba5-cd2a-4644-bf3a-55ec32d9a08a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bc1dba5-cd2a-4644-bf3a-55ec32d9a08a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":61,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3a44c4fe-d314-4d91-952f-1b4ec3f20b76","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001563.4(IMPG1):c.807+1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA364778645"}},"detectionMethod":"Genotyping was performed using a next-generation sequencing-based RET.6 panel.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient has been diagnosed with best vitelliform macular dystrophy.","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Previous genotyping consisted of next generation sequencing-based RET.6 panel.\n","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3ba99ad6-aaf9-4afa-bedf-c0923fb2a29a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3a44c4fe-d314-4d91-952f-1b4ec3f20b76"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32531858","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We aimed to unravel the molecular genetic basis of inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) in a comprehensive cohort of patients diagnosed in the largest center for IRD in Germany. A cohort of 2,158 affected patients from 1,785 families diagnosed with IRD was analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Patients with single-gene disorders (i.e., choroideremia and retinoschisis) were analyzed by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Our study cohort accounts for ∼7% of the estimated 30,000 patients with IRD in Germany, thereby providing representative data for both the prevalence of IRDs and the mutation spectrum of IRD genes for the population in Germany. We achieved a molecular diagnostic rate of 35-95%, depending on the clinical entities, with a high detection rate for achromatopsia, retinoschisis, and choroideremia, and a low detection rate for central areolar choroidal dystrophy and macular dystrophy. A total of 1,161 distinct variants were identified, including 501 novel variants, reaffirming the known vast genetic heterogeneity of IRD in a mainly outbred European population. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of panel-based NGS in a large and highly heterogeneous cohort from an outbred population and for the first time gives a comprehensive representation of the genetic landscape of IRDs in Germany. The data are valuable and crucial for the scientific community and healthcare providers, but also for the pharmaceutical industry in the progressing field of personalized medicine and gene therapy.","dc:creator":"Weisschuh N","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Genetic architecture of inherited retinal degeneration in Germany: A large cohort study from a single diagnostic center over a 9-year period."}},"rdfs:label":"Weisschuh_2020_Patient_BVMD_75"},{"id":"cggv:3ba99ad6-aaf9-4afa-bedf-c0923fb2a29a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ba99ad6-aaf9-4afa-bedf-c0923fb2a29a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"NM_001563.4(IMPG1):c.807+1G>C is a canonical splice site variant in intron 7 that does not have evidence confirming an impact on the gene product.

Activities crucial to vision occur within the IPM, including trafficking of nutrients and metabolites, retinal attachment, and interactions needed for normal outer segment phagocytosis. The IPM includes the following two unique proteoglycans: IPM proteoglycan 1 (IMPG1) and IMPG2. Patients with mutations in IMPG1/IMPG2 develop visual deficits with subretinal material accumulation, highlighting the critical role of the IPM in vision. To determine the role of these proteoglycans in retinal physiology and the pathologic mechanisms that lead to vision loss, we generated mouse models lacking IMPG1/IMPG2. In normal retina, IMPG1 and IMPG2 occupy distinct IPM compartments, represent the main source of chondroitin sulfate and are fundamental for the constitution of the cone-specific glycocalyx stained by the PNA (peanut agglutinin) lectin marker. No evident morphologic or functional deficits were found in mice lacking IMPG1. In the absence of IMPG2, IMPG1 abnormally accumulated at the subretinal space need, likely leading to the formation of subretinal lesions and reduced visual function. Interestingly, mice lacking both IMPG1 and IMPG2, regardless of sex, showed normal retinal structure and function, demonstrating that the aberrant IMPG1 distribution is the main cause of the visual alterations observed in the absence of IMPG2. In conclusion, our results show the dependence of secreted proteoglycans such as IMPG1 on the extracellular environment to properly integrate into the matrix, demonstrate the role of IMPG2 in shaping the IPM, and shed light on the potential mechanisms leading to the development of subretinal lesions and vision loss.","dc:creator":"Salido EM","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Proteoglycan IMPG2 Shapes the Interphotoreceptor Matrix and Modulates Vision."},"rdfs:label":"CRISPR/Cas9-based disruption of mouse Impg1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Studies of this first mouse model of Impg1 disruption at 5 months and 8 months showed minimal phenotypic match to the human patients, but please note that an independent mouse model was reported with a higher degree of match (PMID: 36140676)."},{"id":"cggv:fe2fb4bd-d955-4530-aca3-9870eca30d20","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c00c52a-09c3-498c-b6bb-7c11933c57be","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Morpholino-injected animals exhibit decreased photoreceptor outer segment length, especially for cones (Figures 4I, 4J).

The known spectrum of disease expanded to include cases with autosomal recessive inheritance with the 2013 identification of *IMPG1* variants in association with vitelliform macular dystrophy (PMID: 23993198). *IMPG1* variants have also been identified as the basis for cases of retinitis pigmentosa with both autosomal dominant (PMID: 32817297) and autosomal recessive (PMID: 32817297) modes of inheritance, indicating the potential for a broad range of phenotypic presentations. Autosomal recessive cases diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 91 generally exhibit features such as night blindness, bone spicule pigmentation of the retina, drusen, a ring of hyper-autofluorescence, retinal thinning / fundus atrophy, retinal blood vessel attenuation, and/or optic disc pallor. Reported cases diagnosed as vitelliform macular dystrophy 4 generally exhibit features such as vitelliform-like macular lesions, foveal detachment, small yellow foveal spots, and/or choroidal neovascularization. Some of the retinitis pigmentosa and vitelliform macular dystrophy cases are reported with reduced visual acuity and reduced electroretinogram (particularly dark-adapted) responses. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (biallelic *IMPG1* loss of function) was found to be consistent among patients with recessive inheritance of vitelliform macular dystrophy (MIM# 616151) or retinitis pigmentosa (MIM# 153870), The phenotypic variability between them appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *IMPG1* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as IMPG1-related recessive retinopathy. On the other hand, carriers from families with autosomal recessive disease have only been subclinically affected, prompting the group to recommend splitting the autosomal dominant cases into a separate curation for IMPG1-related dominant retinopathy.\n\nEight suspected disease-causing variants were scored as part of this curation (one nonsense, four affecting splicing, and three missense), which have been collectively reported in seven probands in four publications (PMID: 23993198, PMID: 28644393, PMID: 32817297, PMID: 32531858). All of the probands scored in this curation harbored biallelic *IMPG1* variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of *IMPG1* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Interestingly, biallelic variants appear to be associated with complete penetrance, while monoallelic variants are generally incompletely penetrant. Large families with a recessive mode of inheritance were not found in the literature, and segregation evidence did not contribute to the scoring of this curation.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that *IMPG1* encodes a component of the interphotoreceptor matrix (PMID: 10601738), an insoluble extracellular layer located between the retinal pigment epithelium and the neural retina that is known to support the function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells (PMID: 7344830). The *IMPG2* gene similarly encodes a component of this structure and harbors variants associated with vitelliform macular dystrophy 5 and retinitis pigmentosa 56 (PMID: 10542133, PMID: 10601738). Gene expression profiling across human tissues shows that *IMPG1* mRNA levels are at their highest in retinal tissues (PMID: 30239781). Within the eye, *IMPG1* expression is detected in cone and rod photoreceptor cells, specifically in the outer nuclear layer (PMID: 10601738). IMPG1-blocking antibody treatment has been shown to disrupt the differentiation of retinal organoids, indicating a role for IMPG1 in the development of photoreceptors, inner and outer segments, connecting cilia, and the interphotoreceptor matrix (PMID: 29777959). Mouse models of homozygous *Impg1* loss-of-function have shown minimal abnormalities limited to the interphotoreceptor matrix during the first 8 months of life (PMID: 32265257), but exhibit late-developing phenotypes between 9 and 14 months of age, such as hyperpigmented subretinal deposits, nummular pigmentation of the fundus, attenuated ERG response, reduced retinal thickness in the outer layer, photoreceptor cell loss, and disorganization of the interphotoreceptor matrix (PMID: 36140676).\n\nIn summary, *IMPG1* is definitively associated with IMPG1-related recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d638e88c-feaa-4d84-a4e7-9b83481bfb0c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
