CLS had previously been mapped to Xp22.2. Recently, mutations in the ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk-2) gene were shown to be associated with CLS. We have tested five unrelated individuals with CLS for mutations in nine exons of Rsk-2 using Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Two patients had the same missense mutation (C340T), which causes an arginine to tryptophan change (R114W). This mutation falls just outside the N-terminal ATP-binding site in a highly conserved region of the protein and may lead to structural changes since tryptophan has an aromatic side chain whereas arginine is a 5 carbon basic amino acid. The third patient also had a missense mutation (G2186A) resulting in an arginine to glutamine change (R729Q). The fourth patient had a 2bp deletion (AG) of bases 451 and 452. This creates a frameshift that results in a stop codon 25 amino acids downstream, thereby producing a truncated protein. This deletion also falls within the highly conserved amino-catalytic domain of the protein. The fifth patient has a nonsense mutation (C2065T) which results in a premature stop codon, thereby producing a truncated protein. These mutations further confirm Rsk-2 as the gene involved in CLS and may help in understanding the structure and function of the protein.","dc:creator":"Abidi F","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Novel mutations in Rsk-2, the gene for Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS)."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094187","rdfs:label":"2598"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:52cc4592-eb0f-4f15-89a4-dc452fe06f42_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:293d3fc8-790a-4806-a165-731509efa042","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sequencing of the RSK2 gene","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Coffin-Lowry syndrome diagnosis","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:52cc4592-eb0f-4f15-89a4-dc452fe06f42_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:36ab1114-7a19-4158-aff3-bed642423837"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094187"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094187","rdfs:label":"CMS0976"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:af32a931-1d55-432f-82cf-ce87f6c26580_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b346f1e-5a26-4e93-85ee-6d266d567432_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c941ac15-b436-4353-9baf-1b807321b261","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sequencing of the RSK2 gene","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"Coffin-Lowry syndrome diagnosis","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4b346f1e-5a26-4e93-85ee-6d266d567432_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:df0772cb-afb2-4f14-afef-eed2dc26d5d5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004586.2(RPS6KA3):c.334C>T (p.Arg112Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/547762"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11180593","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"RSK2 is a growth factor-regulated serine-threonine protein kinase, acting in the Ras-Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.

By screening of 250 patients with clinical features suggestive of Coffin-Lowry syndrome, 71 distinct disease-associated RSK2 mutations have been identified in 86 unrelated families. Thirty-eight percent of mutations are missense mutations, 20% are nonsense mutations, 18% are splicing errors, and 21% are short deletion or insertion events. About 57% of mutations result in premature translation termination, and the vast majority are predicted to cause loss of function of the mutant allele. These changes are distributed throughout the RSK2 gene and show no obvious clustering or phenotypic association. However, some missense mutations are associated with milder phenotypes. In one family, one such mutation was associated solely with mild mental retardation.

Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated signaling has been implicated in regulation of synaptic plasticity. Ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) acts as a regulator and downstream effector of ERK. In the brain, RSK2 is predominantly expressed in regions required for learning and memory. Loss-of-function mutations in human RSK2 cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which is characterized by severe mental retardation and low IQ scores in affected males. Knockout of RSK2 in mice or the RSK ortholog in Drosophila results in a variety of learning and memory defects. However, overall brain structure in these animals is not affected, leaving open the question of the pathophysiological consequences. Using the fly neuromuscular system as a model for excitatory glutamatergic synapses, we show that removal of RSK function causes distinct defects in motoneurons and at the neuromuscular junction. Based on histochemical and electrophysiological analyses, we conclude that RSK is required for normal synaptic morphology and function. Furthermore, loss of RSK function interferes with ERK signaling at different levels. Elevated ERK activity was evident in the somata of motoneurons, whereas decreased ERK activity was observed in axons and the presynapse. In addition, we uncovered a novel function of RSK in anterograde axonal transport. Our results emphasize the importance of fine-tuning ERK activity in neuronal processes underlying higher brain functions. In this context, RSK acts as a modulator of ERK signaling.

Although Rsk2 is expressed in the embryonic brain, its function remains largely uncharacterized. To this end, we isolated murine cortical precursors at embryonic day 12 (E12), a timepoint when neuronal differentiation is initiated, and knocked-down Rsk2 expression levels using shRNA. We performed similar experiments in vivo using in utero electroporations to express shRNA against Rsk2. Rsk2 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in neurogenesis and an increase in the proportion of proliferating Pax6-positive radial precursor cells, indicating that Rsk2 is essential for cortical radial precursors to differentiate into neurons. In contrast, reducing Rsk2 levels in vitro or in vivo had no effect on the generation of astrocytes. Thus, Rsk2 loss-of-function, as seen in CLS, perturbs the differentiation of neural precursors into neurons, and maintains them instead as proliferating radial precursor cells, a defect that may underlie the cognitive dysfunction seen in CLS.","dc:creator":"Dugani CB","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Coffin-Lowry syndrome: a role for RSK2 in mammalian neurogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Decreased levels of RSK2 disrupt neurogenesis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4811dfae-1efc-4f0c-a7e8-620b16101726","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42cf7fa5-8445-4734-8e85-f4b9e83207a9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Despite the known reduction of bone mass, all parameters of motor function were normal, confirming the suitability of Rsk2-deficient mice for behavioral testing.

It is caused by mutations of the Rsk2 gene, which encodes a growth factor regulated kinase. Gene deletion studies in mice have shown an essential role for the Rsk2 gene in osteoblast differentiation and function, establishing a causal link between Rsk2 deficiency and skeletal abnormalities of CLS. Although analyses in mice have revealed prominent expression of Rsk2 in brain structures that are essential for learning and memory, evidence at the behavioral level for an involvement of Rsk2 in cognitive function is still lacking. Here, we have examined Rsk2-deficient mice in two extensive batteries of behavioral tests, which were conducted independently in two laboratories in Zurich (Switzerland) and Orsay (France).

To determine RSK2 function in vivo, mice lacking a functional rsk2 gene were generated and studied in response to insulin and exercise, two potent stimulators of the ERK cascade in skeletal muscle. RSK2 knockout (KO) mice weigh 10% less and are 14% shorter than wild-type (WT) mice. They also have impaired learning and coordination. Hindlimb skeletal muscles were obtained from mice 10, 15, or 30 min after insulin injection or immediately after strenuous treadmill exercise for 60 min. While insulin and exercise significantly increased ERK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from both WT and KO mice, the increases were twofold greater in the KO animals. This occurred despite 27% lower ERK2 protein expression in skeletal muscle of KO mice. KO mice had 18% less muscle glycogen in the fasted basal state, and insulin increased glycogen synthase activity more in KO than WT mice. The enhanced insulin-stimulated increases in ERK and glycogen synthase activities in KO mice were not associated with higher insulin receptor or with IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation or with IRS1 binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. However, insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt was significantly higher in the KO animals. c-fos mRNA was increased similarly in muscle from WT and KO mice in response to insulin (2. 5-fold) and exercise (15-fold). In conclusion, RSK2 likely plays a major role in feedback inhibition of the ERK pathway in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, RSK2 is not required for activation of muscle glycogen synthase by insulin but may indirectly modulate muscle glycogen synthase activity and/or glycogen content by other mechanisms, possibly through regulation of Akt. RSK2 knockout mice may be a good animal model for the study of Coffin-Lowry syndrome.","dc:creator":"Dufresne SD","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Altered extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling and glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle from p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 knockout mice."},"rdfs:label":"RSK2 -/- mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This mouse model is a recapitualiton of the intellectual disability features seen in Coffin-Lowry syndrome"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":550,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:df1e194a-b3c4-4d54-b0da-4ea285e87ea7","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010561","gene":"hgnc:10432","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"RPS6KA3 (aka RSK2) was first reported in relation to X-linked Coffin-Lowry syndrome in 1996 (Trivier et al., PMID 8955270).

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, experimental data. For the purposes of this curation 11 patients with variants in this gene were scored in 2 publications (PMIDs 10094187, 11180593). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is X-linked loss-of-function (PMIDs 11180593, 10094187). This gene-disease association is supported by at least two separately generated knockout mouse models, cell culture models, functional alteration studies, and expression studies during human development (PMIDs 14678837, 26398944, 11113183, 17033934, 20832397). In summary, RPS6KA3 is definitively associated with X-linked Coffin-Lowry syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
