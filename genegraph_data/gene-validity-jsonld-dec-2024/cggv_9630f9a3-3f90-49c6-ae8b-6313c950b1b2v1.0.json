Next-generation sequencing of large cohorts has identified an increasing number of genes implicated in ID, but their roles in neurodevelopment remain largely unexplored. Here we report an ID syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations in BCL11A, encoding a transcription factor that is a putative member of the BAF swi/snf chromatin-remodeling complex. Using a comprehensive integrated approach to ID disease modeling, involving human cellular analyses coupled to mouse behavioral, neuroanatomical, and molecular phenotyping, we provide multiple lines of functional evidence for phenotypic effects. The etiological missense variants cluster in the amino-terminal region of human BCL11A, and we demonstrate that they all disrupt its localization, dimerization, and transcriptional regulatory activity, consistent with a loss of function. We show that Bcl11a haploinsufficiency in mice causes impaired cognition, abnormal social behavior, and microcephaly in accordance with the human phenotype. Furthermore, we identify shared aberrant transcriptional profiles in the cortex and hippocampus of these mouse models. Thus, our work implicates BCL11A haploinsufficiency in neurodevelopmental disorders and defines additional targets regulated by this gene, with broad relevance for our understanding of ID and related syndromes.","dc:creator":"Dias C","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"BCL11A Haploinsufficiency Causes an Intellectual Disability Syndrome and Dysregulates Transcription."},"rdfs:label":"BCL11A structural and behavioral abnormalities in mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9630f9a3-3f90-49c6-ae8b-6313c950b1b2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9630f9a3-3f90-49c6-ae8b-6313c950b1b2_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af5b96c1-aa88-4da0-a27b-c8c3157dd556_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11083f41-a1af-4aed-9115-905a977b971d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000729","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:af5b96c1-aa88-4da0-a27b-c8c3157dd556_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:1d2ea1b5-f1d6-4af6-bfe2-f0740f81a97d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_022893.4(BCL11A):c.56C>T (p.Pro19Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347041210"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28891213","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Cai T","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Identification of novel mutations in the HbF repressor gene BCL11A in patients with autism and intelligence disabilities."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28891213","rdfs:label":"BJ-WJ-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Minimal score applied - little phenotype information (including normal fetal hemoglobin levels).

(PMID: 27453576) described nine individuals with similar phenotypes, all of which had predicted LOF variants in BCL11A. All individuals had neurodevelopmental concerns, such as intellectual disability and developmental delay, and persistent fetal hemoglobin. At the time of curation, 27 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants have been reported in humans, predominantly frameshift variants, though nonsense and pathogenic missense variants have also been observed. Dias-Logan syndrome (also known as Intellectual disability with persistence of fetal hemoglobin) is characterized by developmental delay/intellectual disability, and fetal hemoglobin that remains high in childhood (wheras is normally low after birth), infantile hypotonia, and distinctive but variable facial features. Other features such as language delay, microcephaly, and autism spectrum disorder are also associated with this syndrome.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: \nVariants in this gene have been reported in a number of individual probands since 2007, when Rajcan-Separovic et al. (PMID: 16963482) first described a neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with deletions in 2p15-16.1. This group of features was formally labeled Dias-Logan syndrome by Dias et al. in their 2016 publication, which included robust experimental evidence supporting the pathogenic nature of BCL11A haploinsufficiency. Note that two probands, subjects 5 and 7, could not be entered in the gene curation interface, but were counted towards the scoring total. These subjects both had de novo frameshift variants, and were given scores of 2 and 1.5, respectively (second score downgraded due to lack of information about fetal hemoglobin levels).  The phenotypic spectrum for BCL11A continues to expand, with features such as seizures being reported in more recent cases, along with the typical presentation of Dias-Logan syndrome (e.g. Soblet et al., 2018 (PMID: 28960836); Yoshida et al., 2018 (PMID:28589569)). Most recently, a case was reported by Korenke et al. (2020) of a 13 year old male patient with classic features of Dias-Logan syndrome. \n\nExperimental Evidence: \nNon-human model organisms and cell models have been used to investigate the effect of BCL11A haploinsufficiency on brain function, and behaviours related to Dias-Logan syndrome. In this curation, one strong example is presented from Dias et al. (2016), whereby BCL11A haploinsufficient mouse models were found to have brain and behavioral abnormalities in line with features observed in human Dias-Logan syndrome patients (e.g. microcephaly, impaired cognition, abnormal social behavior). Based on the presented evidence, default points for a non-human model organism (2 points) were awarded. This study also demonstrated (using cell models) that the same three missense variants observed in their described subjects disrupted protein localization, dimerization, and transcriptional regulation, consistent with a LOF effect. This evidence was used to award default points to the de novo missense variants in this curation’s genetic evidence section.\n\nIn summary, at present there is an abundance of evidence to support a definitive classification for this gene-disease relationship. Future recurations will likely continue to support this recently described syndromic condition, and may expand the phenotypic spectrum of Dias-Logan syndrome further.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9630f9a3-3f90-49c6-ae8b-6313c950b1b2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
