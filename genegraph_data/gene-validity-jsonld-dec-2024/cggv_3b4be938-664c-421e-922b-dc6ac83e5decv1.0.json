Loss-of-function mutations in lubricin (a secreted glycoprotein encoded by the gene PRG4) cause the human autosomal recessive disorder camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP). A major feature of CACP is precocious joint failure. In order to delineate the mechanism by which lubricin protects joints, we studied the expression of Prg4 mRNA during mouse joint development, and we created lubricin-mutant mice. Prg4 began to be expressed in surface chondrocytes and synoviocytes after joint cavitation had occurred and remained strongly expressed by these cells postnatally. Mice lacking lubricin were viable and fertile. In the newborn period, their joints appeared normal. As the mice aged, we observed abnormal protein deposits on the cartilage surface and disappearance of underlying superficial zone chondrocytes. In addition to cartilage surface changes and subsequent cartilage deterioration, intimal cells in the synovium surrounding the joint space became hyperplastic, which further contributed to joint failure. Purified or recombinant lubricin inhibited the growth of these synoviocytes in vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle joints, where morphologic changes and abnormal calcification of these structures were observed.

It also has a chondroprotective feature and acts by preventing protein deposition from the synovial fluid onto the cartilage surface. PRG4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive, camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome in 1999 (Marcelino et al., 1999 PMID 10545950). This is a rare disorder characterized by early onset camptodactyly, non-inflammatory arthropathy with synovial hyperplasia, and progressive coxa vara deformity. Pericardial or pleural effusions have also been reported in some patients. Camptodactyly is usually the first finding in the majority of patients, followed by swellings of the wrists, knees, and elbows around the age of 4 years. Large joint involvement and age of onset of pain varies among patients. Severe hip and vertebral involvement developed after 20 years of age. At least 7 unique loss of function variants have been reported in literature. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands from 3 publications (Marcelino et al., 1999 PMID 10545950; Peters et al., 2016 PMID 27224999; Yilmaz et al., 2018 PMID 29397575). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three families. One clan comprising five families reported 12 affected family members, five of whom were homozygous for the same variant (PMID 29397575). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by two independent Prg4 KO mouse modes that recapitulate the human disease (Rhee et al., 2005 PMID 15719068; Coles et al., 2010 PMID 20191580). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PRG4 and autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date April 27th, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3b4be938-664c-421e-922b-dc6ac83e5dec"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
