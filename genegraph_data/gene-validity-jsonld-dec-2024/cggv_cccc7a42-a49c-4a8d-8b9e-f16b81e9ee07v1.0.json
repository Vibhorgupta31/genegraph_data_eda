Patients present with normal female external genitalia, streak gonads and XY karyotype and frequently develop gonadoblastoma. Glomerular symptoms consist of childhood proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, characterized by unspecific focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis, progressing to end-stage renal failure in adolescence or early adulthood. No case of Wilms' tumour has been reported, even in patients with extended follow-up. In contrast with FS patients, most individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS; refs 6,7) have ambiguous genitalia or a female phenotype, an XY karyotype and dysgenetic gonads. Renal symptoms are characterized by diffuse mesangial sclerosis, usually before the age of one year, and patients frequently develop Wilms' tumour. Mutations of the Wilms'-tumour gene, WT1, cause different pathologies of the urogenital system, including DDS. WT1 is composed of ten exons and encodes a protein with four zinc-finger motifs and transcriptional and tumour-suppressor activities. Alternative splicing generates four isoforms: the fifth exon may or may not be present, and an alternative splice site in intron 9 allows the addition of three amino acids (KTS) between the third and fourth zinc fingers of WT1 (ref. 17). Here we demonstrate that FS is caused by mutations in the donor splice site in intron 9 of WT1, with the predicted loss of the +KTS isoform.

In addition to causing Wilms' tumor, mutations in WT1 often cause two distinct but overlapping urogenital defects in men, Denys-Drash syndrome and Frasier syndrome. In this study we investigated the regulation of the sex determination gene SRY by WT1. Our results showed that WT1 up-regulates the SRY gene through the proximal early growth response gene-1-like DNA-binding sequences in the core promoter. Mutant WT1 proteins in Denys-Drash syndrome patients were unable to activate this promoter. These mutants did not act in a dominant negative manner, as expected over the wild-type WT1 in this promoter. We also found that WT1 could transactivate the endogenous SRY gene. These observations, together with the overlapping expression patterns of WT1 and SRY in human gonads, led us to propose that WT1 regulates SRY in the initial sex determination process in humans and activates a cascade of genes ultimately leading to the complete organogenesis of the testis.","dc:creator":"Hossain A","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"The human sex-determining gene SRY is a direct target of WT1."},"rdfs:label":"Ectopic Expression of WT1 Activates the SRY Promoter"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"WT1 Activates the SRY Promoter in Different Cell Lines including human teratocarcinoma cell line NT2D1 derived from testicular tumor,  the mouse Sertoli cell line TM4 and HeLa cells, suggesting that WT1 is able to transactivate the human SRY promoter."},{"id":"cggv:e2c6a594-8be6-43c1-834e-58045ef5d593","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4be33fbe-153f-40f1-8d99-9f2bb7ffbe0f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Endogenous SRY Expression was increased  by the Inducible Expression of WT1 in NT2D1 Cells.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11278460","rdfs:label":"tetracycline-regulated inducible expression of WT1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:cccc7a42-a49c-4a8d-8b9e-f16b81e9ee07_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c9b29a2-d8b5-4996-9610-226104ad66b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d79b12c5-a83f-418d-81a2-273848e22b9a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The WT1 protein is capable of binding to 32p-labeled EGR oligonucleotide.

The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations, such as Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease. DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis, XY pseudohermaphroditism, and/or Wilms tumor (WT). DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1, which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) region. We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele, Wt1(tmT396), which truncates ZF3 at codon 396, induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice. Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event, implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice. However, the mutant WT1(tmT396) protein accounted for only 5% of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT.

One common feature of renal failure is glomerulosclerosis, the pathobiology of which is unclear. To help elucidate this, we generated a mouse strain carrying the missense mutation Wt1 R394W, which predisposes humans to glomerulosclerosis and early-onset renal failure (Denys-Drash syndrome [DDS]). Kidney development was normal in Wt1(+/R394W) heterozygotes. However, by 4 months of age 100% of male heterozygotes displayed proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis characteristic of DDS patients. This phenotype was observed in an MF1 background but not in a mixed B6/129 background, suggestive of the action of a strain-specific modifying gene(s). WT1 encodes a nuclear transcription factor, and the R394W mutation is known to impair this function. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of Wt1 R394W-induced renal failure, the expression of genes whose deletion leads to glomerulosclerosis (NPHS1, NPHS2, and CD2AP) was quantitated. In mutant kidneys, NPHS1 and NPHS2 were only moderately downregulated (25 to 30%) at birth but not at 2 or 4 months. Expression of CD2AP was not changed at birth but was significantly upregulated at 2 and 4 months. Podocalyxin was downregulated by 20% in newborn kidneys but not in kidneys at later ages. Two other genes implicated in glomerulosclerosis, TGFB1 and IGF1, were upregulated at 2 months and at 2 and 4 months, respectively. It is not clear whether the significant alterations in gene expression are a cause or a consequence of the disease process. However, the data do suggest that Wt1 R394W-induced glomerulosclerosis may be independent of downregulation of the genes for NPHS1, NPHS2, CD2AP, and podocalyxin and may involve other genes yet to be implicated in renal failure. The Wt1(R394W) mouse recapitulates the pathology and disease progression observed in patients carrying the same mutation, and the mutation is completely penetrant in male animals. Thus, it will be a powerful and biologically relevant model for investigating the pathobiology of the earliest events in glomerulosclerosis.","dc:creator":"Gao F","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"The Wt1+/R394W mouse displays glomerulosclerosis and early-onset renal failure characteristic of human Denys-Drash syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"The Wt1 R394W Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3201,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d6a2161e-5484-4213-b889-361ab8dc362b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008682","gene":"hgnc:12796","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"WT1 associated congenital malformation syndromes include Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), Frasier syndrome, Meacham syndrome, and nephrotic syndrome, type 4. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found that these congenital malformation syndromes have similar or overlapping clinical features and share a postulated dominant-negative mechanism. Therefore, we have lumped curations of these congenital malformation syndromes associated with WT1 into DDS, in which they are part of a spectrum and not distinct conditions although Wilms Tumor is more frequent in DDS than in Frasier syndrome. Of note, the WT1 gene has also been implicated in Wilms tumor type 1 which results from loss of function variants and a high risk of Wilms Tumor and was curated separately. WT1 is composed of ten exons and encodes a protein with four zinc-finger motifs with both transcriptional and tumor suppressor activities. WT1 was first reported in 10 patients affected by Denys-Drash syndrome in 1991, where heterozygous constitutional variants in WT1 were found in all tested affected individuals (PMID: 1655284). Variants in the WT1 gene have been identified in >95% of DDS patients (PMID: 1655284). The most commonly seen WT1 variant in DDS is the missense variant WT1 R394W, which is critical for interaction with a guanine in the DNA target. An alternative splice site in intron 9 allows the addition of 3 amino acids (KTS) between the third and fourth zinc fingers of the WT1 protein, resulting in the so-called +KTS isoform. Patients with Frasier syndrome specifically have unique variants in the donor splice site of intron 9 of the WT1 gene with a predicted loss of the +KTS isoform (PMID:9398852). Nine probands with DDS in four publications are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by mouse models, biochemical function and functional alteration studies (PMID:11278460, 1655284, 10077614, 15509792). In summary, WT1 is definitively associated with the autosomal-dominant (AD) Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome and related disorders. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
