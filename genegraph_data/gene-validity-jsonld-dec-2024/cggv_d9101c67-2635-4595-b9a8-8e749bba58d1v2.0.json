They had a normal development and normal weight gain and were indistinguishable from WT mice in their behavior and in their urinary volume and creatine excretions. They differed however, from WT by having elevated plasma and urinary levels of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline. This is the same phenotype as human subjects, who are otherwise normal except for elevated plasma levels of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline.

","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31821850","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The major clinical manifestation of the Primary Hyperoxalurias (PH) is increased production of oxalate, as a consequence of genetic mutations that lead to aberrant glyoxylate and hydroxyproline metabolism. Hyperoxaluria can lead to the formation of calcium-oxalate kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis and renal failure. Current therapeutic approaches rely on organ transplants and more recently modifying the pathway of oxalate synthesis using siRNA therapy. We have recently reported that the metabolism of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp), an amino acid derived predominantly from collagen metabolism, is a significant source of oxalate production in individuals with PH2 and PH3. Thus, the first enzyme in the Hyp degradation pathway, hydroxyproline dehydrogenase (HYPDH), represents a promising therapeutic target for reducing endogenous oxalate production in these individuals. This is supported by the observation that individuals with inherited mutations in HYPDH (PRODH2 gene) have no pathological consequences. The creation of mouse models that do not express HYPDH will facilitate research evaluating HYPDH as a target. We describe the phenotype of the Prodh2 knock out mouse model and show that the lack of HYPDH in PH mouse models results in lower levels of urinary oxalate excretion, consistent with our previous metabolic tracer and siRNA-based knockdown studies. The double knockout mouse, Grhpr KO (PH2 model) and Prodh2 KO, prevented calcium-oxalate crystal deposition in the kidney, when placed on a 1% Hyp diet. These observations support the use of the Grhpr KO mice to screen HYPDH inhibitors in vivo. Altogether these data support HYPDH as an attractive therapeutic target for PH2 and PH3 patients.","dc:creator":"Buchalski B","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"The effects of the inactivation of Hydroxyproline dehydrogenase on urinary oxalate and glycolate excretion in mouse models of primary hyperoxaluria."},"rdfs:label":"Buchalski Knock out PRODH2 mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:d9101c67-2635-4595-b9a8-8e749bba58d1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bf242ec-373a-4081-9959-846c95969e23_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bf242ec-373a-4081-9959-846c95969e23","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:80d45ea2-3cbb-46e6-8e1e-243596a61222","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021232.1(PRODH2):c.457C>T (p.Arg153Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9389519"}},{"id":"cggv:9851653d-4ee0-4ebd-8935-6c8db3d0c9a3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021232.1(PRODH2):c.1538G>T (p.Arg513Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA405398784"}}],"detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing, forward and reverse, of all coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of the PRODH2 gene.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Identified with elevated Xle (hydroxyproline, leucine, isoleucine and valine) on Tandem mass Spectrometry newborn screening.

Hydroxyprolinemia is a benign condition. Most individuals are identified by newborn screening because the mass spectra of hydroxyproline, isoleucine and leucine cannot be differentiated, resulting in false positive screening results for maple syrup urine disease in individuals with hydroxyprolinemia. PRODH2 encodes hydroxyproline dehydrogenase, which converts hydroxyproline to delta-1-pyrroline-3-hydroxy-5-carboxylate. Biallelic variants in PRODH2 causing hydroxyprolinemia were first reported by Staufner et al in 2016 (PMID 27139199); this is currently the only available publication reporting variants in PRODH2 in individuals with hydroxyprolinemia. Data from 5 patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for PRODH2 variants were curated, including 7 unique variants (missense, nonsense, inframe deletion). Of note, an individual with a heterozygous missense variant in PRODH2 and a very mildly elevated hydroxyproline level was also reported. However, further studies are required to determine whether heterozygous variants in this gene are consistently associated with hydroxyprolinemia.  An individual with hydroxyprolinemia and no identified PRODH2 variants was also reported, suggesting that other genes may also be involved. However, biochemical evidence is consistent with a defect in PRODH2. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of hydroxyproline dehydrogenase, which is consistent with the elevation of hydroxyproline observed in affected individuals (Carnie et al, 1982, PMID 7083820). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with one added article citing a knock out mouse model.
