This mutation co-segregated with NS-UHL/AHL as a dominant trait with reduced penetrance. By screening a panel of probands with NS-UHL/AHL, we found an additional mutation, c.200_202del (p.His67_Cys68delinsArg). In vitro studies revealed that the p.His67_Cys68delinsArg transmembrane isoform of KITLG is not detectable at the cell membrane, supporting pathogenicity. KITLG encodes a ligand for the KIT receptor. Also, KITLG-KIT signaling and MITF are suggested to mutually interact in melanocyte development. Because mutations in MITF are causative of Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2), we screened KITLG in suspected WS2-affected probands. A heterozygous missense mutation, c.310C>G (p.Leu104Val), that segregated with WS2 was identified in a small family. In vitro studies revealed that the p.Leu104Val transmembrane isoform of KITLG is located at the cell membrane, as is wild-type KITLG. However, in culture media of transfected cells, the p.Leu104Val soluble isoform of KITLG was reduced, and no soluble p.His67_Cys68delinsArg and p.Ser96Ter KITLG could be detected. These data suggest that mutations in KITLG associated with NS-UHL/AHL have a loss-of-function effect. We speculate that the mechanism of the mutation underlying WS2 and leading to membrane incorporation and reduced secretion of KITLG occurs via a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect. Our study unveils different phenotypes associated with KITLG, previously associated with pigmentation abnormalities, and will thereby improve the genetic counseling given to individuals with KITLG variants.

Stimulation of melanoma cells with S1 results in activation of MAP kinase, which in turn phosphorylates Mi at a consensus target serine. This phosphorylation upregulates Mi transactivation of the tyrosinase pigmentation gene promoter. In addition to modulating pigment production, such signalling may regulate the expression of genes essential for melanocyte survival and development. The pathway represents a new application of the general MAP kinase machinery in transducing a signal between a tissue-specific receptor at the cell surface and a tissue-specific transcription factor in the nucleus.","dc:creator":"Hemesath TJ","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"MAP kinase links the transcription factor Microphthalmia to c-Kit signalling in melanocytes."},"rdfs:label":"Hemesath Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded because most, if not all, Waardenburg genes interact with MITF in some way"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":122,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:cf710019-6e40-450c-9c66-5b77c1436dfe","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:6343","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The KITLG​ gene has been associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss​ using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 1/5/2018​. This association was made using case-level data only. At least 2​ variants, an in-frame indel and nonsense, have been reported in humans. KITLG​ was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2015​ (Zazo Seco et al.​). Association is seen in at least 2​ probands in 1​ publications (26522471​). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 9 additional family members. There is evidence for reduced penetrance of a KITLG variant in one family. This gene-disease association is supported by an expression study and a protein interaction assay. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association.
