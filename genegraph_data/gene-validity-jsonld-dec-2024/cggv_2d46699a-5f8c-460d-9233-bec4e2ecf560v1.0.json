Genetic mutations have long been considered to be associated with this disease. At present, mutations in over 50 genes related to DCM have been documented. This study was carried out to elucidate the characteristics of gene mutations in patients with DCM. The candidate genes that may cause DCM include MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, LMNA, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYPN, MYL3, TPM1, SCN5A, DES, ACTC1 and RBM20. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subsequent mutation confirmation with traditional capillary Sanger sequencing analysis, possible causative non-synonymous mutations were identified in ~57% (12/21) of patients with DCM. As a result, 7 novel mutations (MYPN, p.E630K; TNNT2, p.G180A; MYH6, p.R1047C; TNNC1, p.D3V; DES, p.R386H; MYBPC3, p.C1124F; and MYL3, p.D126G), 3 variants of uncertain significance (RBM20, p.R1182H; MYH6, p.T1253M; and VCL, p.M209L), and 2 known mutations (MYH7, p.A26V and MYBPC3, p.R160W) were revealed to be associated with DCM. The mutations were most frequently found in the sarcomere (MYH6, MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNC1, TNNT2 and MYL3) and cytoskeletal (MYPN, DES and VCL) genes. As genetic testing is a useful tool in the clinical management of disease, testing for pathogenic mutations is beneficial to the treatment of patients with DCM and may assist in predicting disease risk for their family members before the onset of symptoms.","dc:creator":"Zhao Y","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing of candidate genes reveals novel mutations in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26458567","rdfs:label":"DCM-29"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The variant p.Met209Leu is rare (MAF 0.00003602 in gnomAD), but there is no evidence in support of its functional impact whatsoever.

While it is appreciated that clinically relevant variants exhibit a wide spectrum of penetrance, accurately assessing and expressing the pathogenicity of variants with lower penetrance can be challenging. The vinculin (VCL) gene illustrates these challenges. Model organism data provideÂ evidence that loss of function of VCL may play a role in cardiomyopathy and aggregate case-control studies suggest low penetrance.Â VCL loss of function variants, however, are rarely identified in affected probands and therefore there is a paucity of family studies clarifying the clinical significance of individual variants. This study, which aggregated data from >18,000 individuals who underwent gene panel or exome testing for inherited cardiomyopathies, identified 32 probands with VCL loss-of-function variants and confirmed enrichment in probands with dilated cardiomyopathy (odds ratio [OR]â€‰=â€‰9.01; confidence interval [CI]â€‰=â€‰4.93-16.45). Our data revealed that the majority of these individuals (89.5%) had pediatric onset of disease. Family studies demonstrated that heterozygous loss of function of VCL alone is insufficient to cause cardiomyopathy but that these variants do contribute to disease risk. In conclusion, VCL loss-of-function variants should be reported in a diagnostic setting but need to be clearly distinguished as having lower penetrance.","dc:creator":"Hawley MH","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"An assessment of the role of vinculin loss of function variants in inherited cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516855","rdfs:label":"10"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"No functional data in support, and no family information."},{"id":"cggv:371ea184-8633-4b01-b2e5-d0710fe12eb6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87d8280b-9db1-4b49-89b0-f6d423b87fc1","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"NGS panel targeting 135 genes, including all main DCM genes","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:371ea184-8633-4b01-b2e5-d0710fe12eb6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:79dec50c-9490-4aeb-822b-d0f61731b409","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003373.4(VCL):c.2328del (p.Lys778SerfsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139532493"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516855"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516855","rdfs:label":"19"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"No family info, and no functional evidence in support of the variant's impact.

Metavinculin, a cardiac isoform of the cytoskeletal protein vinculin, connects actin microfilaments to the intercalated disk and membrane costameres of the heart.","dc:creator":"Maeda M","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with deficiency of the cytoskeletal protein metavinculin."},"rdfs:label":"PCR and WB on vinculin/metavinculin in 33 heart samples"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d8a85845-af48-453e-b6d1-274d10a6387d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e646f98a-1806-41b6-bb7f-6da0e0477179","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"From the manuscript: \"Our finding that vinculin is capable of bundling actin filaments very effectively into paracristalline structures (Fig. 7) indicate that vinculin interacts directly with actin.

Sudden death was found in 49% of the knockout (cVclKO) mice younger than 3 months of age despite preservation of contractile function. Conscious telemetry documented ventricular tachycardia as the cause of sudden death, while defective myocardial conduction was detected by optical mapping. cVclKO mice that survived through the vulnerable period of sudden death developed dilated cardiomyopathy and died before 6 months of age. Prior to the onset of cardiac dysfunction, ultrastructural analysis of cVclKO heart tissue showed abnormal adherens junctions with dissolution of the intercalated disc structure, expression of the junctional proteins cadherin and beta1D integrin were reduced, and the gap junction protein connexin 43 was mislocalized to the lateral myocyte border.

VCL encodes a mechanosensitive protein incorporated in Z-disks, of which two splicing isoforms are produced. Metavinculin is 68 residues longer than vinculin, with exon 19 additionally spliced in, and both isoforms are expressed in the human heart. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship include case-level data and case-control data. One study on 350 DCM patients sequenced on exon 19 identified 2 distinct VCL variants (one missense and one inframe deletion) in 3 patients, both absent in 500 controls. Using viscometry analysis, authors demonstrated that both variants alter actin filament organization, and confirmed this using electron microscopy. In addition, they demonstrated that the missense variant also causes disruption of the intercalated discs. Wells et al. (2011, PMID: 24062880) reported a  missense variant segregating in a family with DCM. However, the presence of only 4 affected individuals and of also another candidate variant (in MYBPC3) made segregation not scorable, enabling this study to contribute as case-level evidence only. In 2020, a large cohort-based study - comprising a primary cohort of 1040 patients and a secondary cohort of 1498 patients - highlighted a significant enrichment of predicted protein-truncating variants in the secondary cohort compared with the ExAC population database (Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID: 31983221). In the primary cohort, one proband was found to carry a predicted protein-truncating variant in VCL and 11 others were found to carry 9 distinct, rare,  missense variants, which were scored as case-level evidence. A second large cohort-based study demonstrated again significant enrichment of rare, predicted protein-truncating VCL variants in 3118 DCM patients (of which 1624 overlapping those analyzed by Mazzarotto et al) compared with population individuals (Hawley et al, 2020, PMID: 32516855). Variants carried by DCM patients not overlapping those used to score case-control enrichment in Mazzarotto et al were scored as case-level evidence, with scores adjusted based on available evidence (e.g. presence/absence of family information, presence/absence of other variants, genes screened etc). Given a lack of substantial evidence in support of VCL missense variantsâ€™ pathogenicity, isolated missense variants in absence of any supportive evidence were not scored (1 in Zhao et al, 2015, PMID: 26458567; and 11 in the primary cohort of Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID: 31983221).  In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by in vitro protein-protein interaction assays, expression studies and animal models. Direct protein-protein interaction with cardiac muscle alpha actin (encoded by ACTC1, classified as a moderate-evidence gene for DCM) was demonstrated in 1981 using in vitro viscometry analysis and light and electron microscopy (Jockusch et al, 1981, PMID: 6789327). A study on 33 human heart specimens detected deficiency of both mRNA and protein expression in one sample from a DCM patient (Maeda et al, 1997, PMID: 8994410). In addition, Zemljic-Harpf et al described how VCL knock-out mice showed progressive dilation of the left ventricle and a parallel decline of left-ventricular function (Zemljic-Harpf et al, 2007, PMID: 17785437). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to establish the relationship of VCL with autosomal dominant DCM definitively. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on April 10, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2d46699a-5f8c-460d-9233-bec4e2ecf560"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
