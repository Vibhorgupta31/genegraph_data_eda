To determine the molecular basis of this anisotropy, we measured material properties of TMs from mice with a targeted deletion of Col11a2, which encodes for collagen XI. In light micrographs, the density of TM radial collagen fibers was lower in Col11a2 -/- mice than wild-types. Tone-evoked distortion product otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem response measurements in Col11a2 -/- mice were reduced by 30-50 dB independent of frequency as compared with wild-types, showing that the sensitivity loss is cochlear in origin. Stress-strain measurements made using osmotic pressure revealed no significant dependence of TM bulk compressibility on the presence of collagen XI. Charge measurements made by placing the TM as an electrical conduit between two baths revealed no change in the density of charge affixed to the TM matrix in Col11a2 -/- mice. Measurements of mechanical shear impedance revealed a 5.5 +/- 0.8 dB decrease in radial shear impedance and a 3.3 +/- 0.3 dB decrease in longitudinal shear impedance resulting from the Col11a2 deletion. The ratio of radial to longitudinal shear impedance fell from 1.8 +/- 0.7 for TMs from wild-type mice to 1.0 +/- 0.1 for those from Col11a2 -/- mice. These results show that the organization of collagen into radial fibrils is responsible for the mechanical anisotropy of the TM. This anisotropy can be attributed to increased mechanical coupling provided by the collagen fibrils. Mechanisms by which changes in TM material properties may contribute to the threshold elevation in Col11a2 -/- mice are discussed.","dc:creator":"Masaki K","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Col11a2 deletion reveals the molecular basis for tectorial membrane mechanical anisotropy."},"rdfs:label":"Masaki Functional Alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Scored 1 point for multiple points of evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:27b13a91-0a04-4393-bf1c-4f8418154c9b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:053c4a88-ad63-4a98-ba76-46b85fe4e7e0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d762149-31a6-491e-b377-49b9f013cf86","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Confirmed Col11a2 allele was inactivated by testing rib cartilage from wild type and homozygous transgenic mice, and found a2XI chain of collagen was absent.

The targeted allele was transcribed in shortened mRNAs, which could be detected by Northern blotting. However, translation of the full-length Col11a2 chain was unable to occur because of the presence of premature termination codons within the inverted neomycin-resistant gene. Analysis of pepsin-resistant collagen chains from rib cartilage of homozygous mice demonstrated the lack of synthesis of intact alpha2(XI) chains. However, pepsin-resistant collagen chains of either alpha1(XI) or alpha1(V) were still detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Therefore, alpha2(XI) chains are not essential for the assembly of some molecular forms of triple-helical type V/XI collagen. The phenotype was milder than in the cho/cho mouse in which, as the result of mutation, translation of the full-length alpha1(XI) chain fails to occur and the mice die at birth (Li et al., 1995). Homozygous mice without expression of an alpha2(XI) chain had a smaller body size, receding snouts, and deafness. Nasal bones in the homozygous transgenic mice were specifically shorter and dimpled on their external surfaces. Chondrocytes in growth plates of all long bones were markedly disorganized and failed to align in columns. Analysis of growth plates from transgenic mice by in situ hybridization showed expression of alpha1(II) and alpha1(XI) but not of alpha1(I) or alpha1(V) which, in contrast, were expressed in the developing bone and in the bone collar. Expression of alpha1(X) specifically in the hypertrophic cartilage was observed in normal and transgenic mice. No obvious osteoarthritis was observed throughout the life of homozygous mice up to 1 year of age, although minor morphologic anomalies in the articular cartilages were discernible. The mild phenotype is consistent with similar mutations in the COL11A2 gene seen in patients with nonocular Stickler syndrome and some patients with otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED), as well as in patients with a nonsyndromic form of deafness called DFNA13.","dc:creator":"Li SW","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Targeted disruption of Col11a2 produces a mild cartilage phenotype in transgenic mice: comparison with the human disorder otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED)."},"rdfs:label":"Li Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1885,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b70a32eb-5863-4859-bb1b-0696dd4d7a3f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008975","gene":"hgnc:2187","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The COL11A2 gene has been reported in association with multiple conditions and inheritance patterns. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in variant type, inheritance pattern, and phenotype within reported COL11A2 cases. Therefore we have split curations by inheritance pattern and again by nonsyndromic hearing loss and otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia and assessed separately. This assessment focuses on its association to autosomal recessive otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia. The COL11A2 gene was first associated with autosomal recessive otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia in humans as early as 1995 (Vikkula et al.). At least 8 variants in 8 probands (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans (PMIDs: 7859284, 16637051, 15558753, 21204229, 21208667, 10677296) with all variants demonstrated or expected to lead to the expression of an altered protein, consistent with a dominant-negative impact on the triple chain collagen molecule. For example, most reported variants affect the Gly-X-Y triplet of the protein. Several of these variants segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The gene-disease association is supported by a homozygous mouse model (Li et al. 2001). In summary, COL11A2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 12/20/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:27b13a91-0a04-4393-bf1c-4f8418154c9b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
