The resulting sustained Ca(2+) signals are required for many physiological responses, such as T cell activation and differentiation. Here, we monitored receptor-triggered Ca(2+) signals in cells transfected with siRNAs against 2,304 human signaling proteins, and we identified two proteins required for Ca(2+)-store-depletion-mediated Ca(2+) influx, STIM1 and STIM2. These proteins have a single transmembrane region with a putative Ca(2+) binding domain in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca(2+) store depletion led to a rapid translocation of STIM1 into puncta that accumulated near the plasma membrane. Introducing a point mutation in the STIM1 Ca(2+) binding domain resulted in prelocalization of the protein in puncta, and this mutant failed to respond to store depletion.

Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is the main Ca(2+) sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, and all mutations were found in the highly conserved intraluminal Ca(2+)-binding EF hands.

Previous reports have suggested a genotype-phenotype correlation with mutations in the N-terminal EF-hand domain associated with tubular aggregate myopathy, and a common mutation at p.R304W in a coiled coil domain associated with Stormorken syndrome. In this study individuals with STIM1 variants were identified by exome sequencing or STIM1 direct sequencing, and assessed for neuromuscular, haematological and biochemical evidence of the allelic disorders of STIM1. STIM1 mutations were investigated by fibroblast calcium imaging and 3D modelling. Six individuals with STIM1 mutations, including two novel mutations (c.262A>G (p.S88G) and c.911G>A (p.R304Q)), were identified. Extra-neuromuscular symptoms including thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, hypocalcaemia or hyposplenism were present in 5/6 patients with mutations in both the EF-hand and CC domains. 3/6 patients had psychiatric disorders, not previously reported in STIM1 disease. Review of published STIM1 patients (n = 49) confirmed that neuromuscular symptoms are present in most patients.

We studied a German family with tubular aggregate myopathy and defined cellular consequences of altered STIM1 function.

Functional characterization of the new STIM1 mutation by calcium imaging revealed that calcium influx was significantly increased in primary myoblasts of the index patient compared to controls pointing at a severe alteration of intracellular calcium homeostasis.

Exome capture was performed with the SureSelect Human All Exon kit v2 (Agilent Technologies). The final amplified exome captured library was quantified using a Qubit Flourometer (Life Technologies) and qPCR using primers binding in adapter sequence and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). Illumina PhiX control kit v2.0 DNA (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for standard curve generation. Fragment size distribution of the input library was measured using a 2100 Bioanalyzer and Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent Technologies). The exome captured library was sequenced onanIlluminaHiSeq2000with 100 bp pairedend reads. Reads that did not pass Illumina’s standard filter were removed prior to alignment. Remaining reads were aligned to the reference human genome (GRCh37/hg19), using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner tool [Li and Durbin, 2009] (bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). PCR duplicates were removed. Approximately 90% of the reads mapped uniquely to the reference sequence yielding an average of \u000290x coverage per targeted base. Variant calling was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [McKenna et al., 2010] (broadinstitute.org/gatk). Variants were annotated with SeattleSeq (snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation) and ANNOVAR [Wang et al., 2010] (openbioinformatics.org/annovar). VCFtools (vcftools.sourceforge.net) were used to manipulate vcf files and The Integrative Genomic Viewer (broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for data visualization. Pathogenicity prediction of the mutation was checked with SIFT [Ng and Henikoff, 2001] (sift.jcvi.org/) and PolyPhen-2 [Adzhubei et al., 2010] (genetics. bwh.harvard.edu/pph/). Sanger sequencing to verify the variant: Genomic DNA from the patients, their healthy relatives, and 257 healthy controls was used to generate PCR products with primers flanking the point mutation (STIM1ex7 F TGGAGCTGTCATTTTCCTCTTT and STIM1ex7 R GGCCTCCCAAAGTGCTAGAAT). PCR products were Sanger sequenced using an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer and ABI BigDye dye terminator cycle-sequencing kits (Life Technologies).

A heterozygous missense mutation in STIM1 exon 7 (c.910C>T; p.Arg304Trp) (NM_003156.3) was found to segregate with the disease in six Stormorken syndrome patients in four families. Upon sensing Ca(2+) depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, STIM1 undergoes a conformational change enabling it to interact with and open ORAI1, a Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel located in the plasma membrane. The STIM1 mutation found in Stormorken syndrome patients is located in the coiled-coil 1 domain, which might play a role in keeping STIM1 inactive. In agreement with a possible gain-of-function mutation in STIM1, blood platelets from patients were in a preactivated state with high exposure of aminophospholipids on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Resting Ca(2+) levels were elevated in platelets from the patients compared with controls, and store-operated Ca(2+) entry was markedly attenuated, further supporting constitutive activity of STIM1 and ORAI1. Thus, our data are compatible with a near-maximal activation of STIM1 in Stormorken syndrome patients. We conclude that the heterozygous mutation c.910C>T causes the complex phenotype that defines this syndrome.

Variants in this gene have also been reported in association with Stormorken Syndrome, York Platelet Syndrome, and an Immunodeficiency phenotype (PMIDs: 25577287, 24591628, 24619930). Stormorken and York Platelet have been evaluated by ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines and determined to be the same entity as Tubular Aggregate Myopathy with a spectrum of phenotypic severity. At least 17 unique predominantly missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 23332920, 25326555, 25577287, 24591628, 24619930, 28624464, 27876257, 24570283, 25953320, 27066587). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in a number of additional family members, however no families were large enough to draw meaningful evidence. More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\nThe mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function, with alteration of particularly the EF-hand domain responsible for altered calcium signalling detection and resulting consitutive activation of store-operated calcium entry regardless of the intracellular calcium levels. (Morin et al. 2019, PMID: 31448844) This gene-disease association and mechanism is supported by several mouse and zebrafish models, biochemical function evidence, and functional studies. Each model recapitulates some amount of the phenotypes shown in humans including thrombocytopenia, muscle weakness, and muscle fiber atrophy. Additionally, STIM1's role in SOCE and the resulting always activated state when the expression and function of the protein is altered show clear correlations with the displayed phenotypes as both platelet function/clotting and skeletal muscle signalling relies on calcium flow. \nIn summary, STIM1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant tubular aggregate myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9419adda-b3fb-4c2d-8562-6a0318260bbd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
