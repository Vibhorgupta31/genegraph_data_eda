This variant is observed at a high allele frequency in gnomAD, 0.03761 (2561/251344) in South Asian exomes, bringing into question the pathogenicity of the variant. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. In summary, *TMTC2* is classified as disputed in association with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic genetic hearing loss. It was reevaluated on 4/20/2022. This does not change the classification initially reached on 3/10/2017 when this gene-disease relationship was originally classified by the Hearing Loss GCEP.\nOne missense variant has been reported in one family segregating with AD hearing loss, however the variant is present in high frequency in population databases.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
