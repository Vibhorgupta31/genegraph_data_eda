We now report, for the first time, mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, located on the X chromosome, that encodes a 613-amino acid protein with 12 predicted transmembrane domains. The propositi of two unrelated families are males with abnormal relative concentrations of three circulating iodothyronines, as well as neurological abnormalities, including global developmental delay, central hypotonia, spastic quadriplegia, dystonic movements, rotary nystagmus, and impaired gaze and hearing.

Six large families with the syndrome have been identified, and linkage studies have placed the gene locus in Xq13.2. Mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (MCT8) have been found in each of the six families. One essential function of the protein encoded by this gene appears to be the transport of triiodothyronine into neurons. Abnormal transporter function is reflected in elevated free triiodothyronine and lowered free thyroxine levels in the blood. Infancy and childhood in the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome are marked by hypotonia, weakness, reduced muscle mass, and delay of developmental milestones. Facial manifestations are not distinctive, but the face tends to be elongated with bifrontal narrowing, and the ears are often simply formed or cupped. Some patients have myopathic facies. Generalized weakness is manifested by excessive drooling, forward positioning of the head and neck, failure to ambulate independently, or ataxia in those who do ambulate. Speech is dysarthric or absent altogether. Hypotonia gives way in adult life to spasticity. The hands exhibit dystonic and athetoid posturing and fisting. Cognitive development is severely impaired. No major malformations occur, intrauterine growth is not impaired, and head circumference and genital development are usually normal. Behavior tends to be passive, with little evidence of aggressive or disruptive behavior. Although clinical signs of thyroid dysfunction are usually absent in affected males, the disturbances in blood levels of thyroid hormones suggest the possibility of systematic detection through screening of high-risk populations.","dc:creator":"Schwartz CE","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome and the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15889350","rdfs:label":"VII 7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"In vitro functional study showed that this variant has reduced T3 uptake (PMID:18187543)"},{"id":"cggv:b00e72eb-1b67-4c8d-aa9f-e0f5bced18dc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee039572-f2fa-4cdf-80f4-b5afe061dbf3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was prepared using a high-salt precipitation method with peripheral blood (Schwartz et al. 1990).

However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls TH entry into the brain, and reduced TH availability to neural cells could instead underlie the diseased phenotype. To test potential BBB involvement, we generated an iPSC-based BBB model of MCT8 deficiency, and we found that MCT8 was necessary for polarized influx of the active form of TH across the BBB.

In humans, deficiency of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), involved in cellular uptake of THs before their action, results in severe neurological abnormalities, known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. While the brain lesions predominantly originate prenatally, it remains unclear how and when exactly MCT8 dysfunction affects cellular processes crucial for corticogenesis. We investigated this by inducing in vivo RNAi vector-based knockdown of MCT8 in neural progenitors of the chicken optic tectum, a layered structure that shares many developmental features with the mammalian cerebral cortex. MCT8 knockdown resulted in cellular hypoplasia and a thinner optic tectum. This could be traced back to disrupted cell-cycle kinetics and a premature shift to asymmetric cell divisions impairing progenitor cell pool expansion. Birth-dating experiments confirmed diminished neurogenesis in the MCT8-deficient cell population as well as aberrant migration of both early-born and late-born neuroblasts, which could be linked to reduced reelin signaling and disorganized radial glial cell fibers. Impaired neurogenesis resulted in a reduced number of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but the latter additionally showed decreased differentiation. Moreover, an accompanying reduction in untransfected GABAergic neurons suggests hampered intercellular communication. These results indicate that MCT8-dependent TH uptake in the neural progenitors is essential for early events in corticogenesis, and help to understand the origin of the problems in cortical development and function in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential to establish the stereotypical layered structure of the human forebrain during embryonic development. Before their action on gene expression, THs require cellular uptake, a process facilitated by the TH transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). We investigated how and when dysfunctional MCT8 can induce brain lesions associated with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, characterized by psychomotor retardation. We used the layered chicken optic tectum to model cortical development, and induced MCT8 deficiency in neural progenitors. Impaired cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation resulted in an underdeveloped optic tectum and a severe reduction in nerve cells. Our data underline the need for MCT8-dependent TH uptake in neural progenitors and stress the importance of local TH action in early development.","dc:creator":"Vancamp P","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Deficiency of the Thyroid Hormone Transporter Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 in Neural Progenitors Impairs Cellular Processes Crucial for Early Corticogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"in vivo knockdown of MCT8 in neural progenitors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"I downgrade the score because it is a chicken knockdown experiment, may not be the best model organism to study intellectual disability."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":471,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:37322f95-d242-44a8-b310-4e78c96f9ea6","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010354","gene":"hgnc:10923","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The SLC16A2 gene has been associated with X-linked Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 8/8/2018. The affected males show high serum 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3 ) concentration and low serum 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T3 or rT3) concentration, along with other phenotypes: severe cognitive deficiency, infantile hypotonia, progressive spastic quadriplegia, and joint contractures. While heterozygous female carriers do not manifest psychomotor abnormalities, they have intermediate thyroid test abnormalities between affected and normal individuals. This disease association was made using case-level data and experimental data. At least 11 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift), either familial or de novo, were curated from six publications (PMID: 20713192, 14661163, 15488219, 17899191, 15889350, and 19194886). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The disease association was first reported in human as early as 2004 (Dumitrescu et al., 2004 PMID: 14661163). To date, 33 unique variants within SLC16A2 have been classified as Pathogenic in ClinVar. This gene-disease association is supported by animal model (chicken) and patient-derived neural cells, although mouse models do not show apparent neurological phenotype (not curated here). In summary, SLC16A2 is definitively associated with X-linked Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nAccording to the curation SOP, the segregation score should downgrade from 3.0 to 1.5, because all of the LOD scores calculated in this curation are based on candidate gene sequencing instead of exome/genome or all genes sequenced in the linkage regions. SLC16A2 encodes for two potential proteins, 613 and 539 amino acids, due to two alternative start sites on exon 1, although NCBI Gene only lists the one with 539 amino acids (NM_006517.4). All of the variants described in this curation is based on NM_006517.4, therefore some of the variants may seem different from the original study.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b9242e32-a339-4426-8ef5-39df0960d390"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
