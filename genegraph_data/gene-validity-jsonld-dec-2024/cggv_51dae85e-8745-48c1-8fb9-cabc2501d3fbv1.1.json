Three of these probands, however, had Brugada syndrome with a relatively short QT interval (PMIDs 17224476, 20817017) and one had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without a convincing SQTS phenotype (PMID 28427417). Accordingly, the SQTS Gene Curation Expert Panel decided these patients did not have an isolated SQTS phenotype and the genetic evidence derived from these cases should not be scored toward relationship of CACNA1C with SQTS. The final proband was identified as having a de novo variant (PMID 24291113), however, the gnomAD MAF was regarded as too high for a rare condition such as SQTS and there was no other evidence supporting this variantâ€™s impact. \nThe Expert Panel concluded there is an absence of any substantive evidence to support a gene-disease relationship between CACNA1C and SQTS.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:51dae85e-8745-48c1-8fb9-cabc2501d3fb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
