Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.","dc:creator":"UhlÃ©n M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Proteomics.

To date, 31 families have been described with mutations in MORC2, indicating that this gene is frequently involved in axonal CMT cases. While the genetic data clearly establish the causative role of MORC2 in CMT2Z, the impact of its mutations on neuronal biology and their phenotypic consequences in patients remains to be clarified. We show that the full-length form of MORC2 is highly expressed in both embryonic and adult human neural tissues and that Morc2 expression is dynamically regulated in both the developing and the maturing murine nervous system. To determine the effect of the most common MORC2 mutations, p.S87L and p.R252W, we used several in vitro cell culture paradigms. Both mutations induced transcriptional changes in patient-derived fibroblasts and when expressed in rodent sensory neurons. These changes were more pronounced and accompanied by abnormal axonal morphology, in neurons expressing the MORC2 p.S87L mutation, which is associated with a more severe clinical phenotype. These data provide insight into the neuronal specificity of the mutated MORC2-mediated phenotype and highlight the importance of neuronal cell models to study the pathophysiology of CMT2Z.","dc:creator":"Sancho P","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying the axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy caused by MORC2 mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624633","rdfs:label":"Subject 5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:bfce76f5-5983-449d-b996-8097322543d9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:822316ca-2756-41b0-a35e-adac9acf098c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Brain MRI demonstrated esions of the periaqueductal gray matter, thalami, substantia nigra, and geniculocalcarine tract at 17 months; periaqueductal gray matter lesions had resolved by age 4 years, whereas other lesions remained stable.

The MORC2 gene encodes Microrchidia family CW-type zinc finger 2, a DNA-dependent ATPase that has several important roles including in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair and regulating transcription.\n\nThe MORC2 gene was first reported in relation to de novo dominant Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2019 (PMID: 30624633). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two de novo variants identified in two cases in one publication (PMID: 30624633). No segregation data were available. MORC2 variants have also been reported to be associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2Z and a syndrome of developmental delay, impaired growth, dysmorphic facies, and axonal neuropathy (DIGFAN). Haploinsufficiency is implicated as the mechanism of disease but this is still being studied. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression (PMID: 25613900).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 24, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:23358115-fe60-41c7-b01e-44d1cb8329b1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
