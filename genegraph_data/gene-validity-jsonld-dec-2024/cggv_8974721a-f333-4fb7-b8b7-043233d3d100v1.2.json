Mutations in the myosin head are thought to affect the ATPase and actin-binding properties of the molecule. To date, however, there are no reports of the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis for mutations in the rod region of muscle myosins. Here, we present analysis of 4 mutations responsible for MSM: L1793P, R1845W, E1886K, and H1901L. We show that each MSM mutation has a different molecular phenotype, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms by which MSM can be caused. These mechanisms range from thermodynamic and functional irregularities of individual proteins (L1793P), to varying defects in the assembly and stability of filaments formed from the proteins (R1845W, E1886K, and H1901L). In addition to furthering our understanding of MSM, these observations provide the first insight into how mutations affect the rod region of muscle myosins, and provide a framework for future studies of disease-causing mutations in this region of the molecule.","dc:creator":"Armel TZ","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in the beta-myosin rod cause myosin storage myopathy via multiple mechanisms."},"rdfs:label":"MSM rod region mutations"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:8974721a-f333-4fb7-b8b7-043233d3d100_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:24b3cb12-7b87-481b-899f-82320e7cb280","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7c626a4-16e1-4da1-8588-2d6c43bac009","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Both A1603P and K1617del mutations affected filament formation in vitro and also affect the localization of myosin into the muscle sarcomere in cultured skeletal muscle myotubes.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29660325","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Over 20 mutations in β-cardiac myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), expressed in cardiac and slow muscle fibers, cause Laing early-onset distal myopathy (MPD-1), a skeletal muscle myopathy.

Both mutations affected secondary structure, decreasing the helical content of 15 heptad and light meromyosin constructs.

Mutant eGFP-tagged β-MHC accumulated abnormally into the M-line of sarcomeres in cultured skeletal muscle myotubes. Incorporation of eGFP-tagged β-MHC into sarcomeres in adult rat cardiomyocytes was reduced. Molecular dynamics simulations using a composite structure of part of the coiled coil demonstrated that both mutations affected the structure, with the mutation to proline (A1603P) having a smaller effect compared to K1617del.

Drosophila MSM models were generated for comprehensive physiological, structural, and biochemical assessment of the mutations' consequences on muscle and myosin structure and function. L1793P, R1845W, and E1883K MSM mutant myosins were expressed in an indirect flight (IFM) and jump muscle myosin null background to study the effects of these variants without confounding influences from wild-type myosin. Mutant animals displayed highly compromised jump and flight ability, disrupted muscle proteostasis, and severely perturbed IFM structure. Electron microscopy revealed myofibrillar disarray and degeneration with hyaline-like inclusions. In vitro assembly assays demonstrated a decreased ability of mutant myosin to polymerize, with L1793P filaments exhibiting shorter lengths. In addition, limited proteolysis experiments showed a reduced stability of L1793P and E1883K filaments.

Despite similar histological findings, the clinical severity and age of onset are highly variable, ranging from no weakness to severe impairment of ambulation, and usually childhood-onset to onset later in life. Mutations located in the distal end of the tail of slow/ß-cardiac myosin heavy chain are associated with myosin storage myopathy. Four missense mutations (L1793P, R1845W, E1883K and H1901L), two of which have been reported in several unrelated families, are located within or closed to the assembly competence domain. This location is critical for the proper assembly of sarcomeric myosin rod filaments. To assess the mechanisms leading to protein aggregation in myosin storage myopathy and to evaluate the impact of these mutations on myosin assembly and muscle function, we expressed mutated myosin proteins in cultured human muscle cells and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. While L1793P mutant myosin protein efficiently incorporated into the sarcomeric thick filaments, R1845W and H1901L mutants were prone to formation of myosin aggregates without assembly into striated sarcomeric thick filaments in cultured muscle cells.

The mechanisms by which different phenotypes are produced by mutations in MYH7, even in the same region of the gene, are not known. To explore the clinical spectrum and pathobiology, we screened the MYH7 gene in 88 patients from 21 previously unpublished families presenting with distal or generalized skeletal muscle weakness, with or without cardiac involvement. Twelve novel mutations have been identified in thirteen families. In one of these families, the father of the proband was found to be a mosaic for the MYH7 mutation. In eight cases, de novo mutation appeared to have occurred, which was proven in four. The presenting complaint was footdrop, sometimes leading to delayed walking or tripping, in members of 17 families (81%), with other presentations including cardiomyopathy in infancy, generalized floppiness, and scoliosis. Cardiac involvement as well as skeletal muscle weakness was identified in nine of 21 families. Spinal involvement such as scoliosis or rigidity was identified in 12 (57%).

Interestingly, we identified the identical mutation in an unrelated Norwegian family and, as a de novo mutation, in one sporadic Finnish patient. Described in detail are the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of 5 patients from the French family. The phenotype in the Finnish patient and the Norwegian patients is largely similar. This mutation causes a benign myopathy within the range of previously reported Laing myopathy phenotype variations. Onset of weakness in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles occurred in early childhood in all patients. Finger extensor and neck flexor weakness together with Achilles tendon retractions were other frequent findings. The independent recurrence of the identical mutation without any founder background may reflect a mutational susceptibility of this residue, in accordance with some other MYH7 mutations previously reported. De novo mutations seem to be frequent in Laing distal myopathy. This is of clinical importance since a dominant family history is missing, which may confuse differential diagnostic efforts.","dc:creator":"Dubourg O","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A novel MYH7 mutation occurring independently in French and Norwegian Laing distal myopathy families and de novo in one Finnish patient."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21279644","rdfs:label":"Finnish patient"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"E1508del reported as mutation in three unrelated families (French, Norwegian, Finnish) with Laing early-onset distal myopathy.

This variant and two previously published mutations (c.5655G > A and c.5655 + 1G > A), also presumably leading to exon 38 skipping, were studied by expression analysis in the HEK293T cell line transfected with 4 plasmids containing the MYH7 minigene (wt, c.5655G > C, c.5655 + 1G > A and c.5655 + 5G > A). A quantitative difference in expression was shown for cell lines with each of the three mutant plasmids. All mutation carriers had a similar phenotype and included congenital axial myopathy and variable cardiac involvement. Prominent dropped head syndrome was mentioned in all patients. Early-onset axial myopathy with a dropped head syndrome is a distinct clinical entity within MYH7-related disorders.

At least 50 variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17​ probands in ​8​​ publications (​PMID27387980, 24664454,21211974,21279644,14520662,27519903,15322983,30794915).
