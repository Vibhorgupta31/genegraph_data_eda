In the present study, genetic screening for POU4F3 variants was carried out for a large series of Japanese hearing loss (HL) patients to clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DFNA15 in the Japanese population. Massively parallel DNA sequencing of 68 target candidate genes was utilized in 2,549 unrelated Japanese HL patients (probands) to identify genomic variations responsible for HL. The detailed clinical features in patients with POU4F3 variants were collected from medical charts and analyzed. Novel 12 POU4F3 likely pathogenic variants (six missense variants, three frameshift variants, and three nonsense variants) were successfully identified in 15 probands (2.5%) among 602 families exhibiting autosomal dominant HL, whereas no variants were detected in the other 1,947 probands with autosomal recessive or inheritance pattern unknown HL. To obtain the audiovestibular configuration of the patients harboring POU4F3 variants, we collected audiograms and vestibular symptoms of the probands and their affected family members. Audiovestibular phenotypes in a total of 24 individuals from the 15 families possessing variants were characterized by progressive HL, with a large variation in the onset age and severity with or without vestibular symptoms observed. Pure-tone audiograms indicated the most prevalent configuration as mid-frequency HL type followed by high-frequency HL type, with asymmetry observed in approximately 20% of affected individuals. Analysis of the relationship between age and pure-tone average suggested that individuals with truncating variants showed earlier onset and slower progression of HL than did those with non-truncating variants.

To explore the pathological mechanisms underlying the development of DFNA15, the effect of the mutation in Pou4f3 on the activity of the myosin VI (Myo6) promoter, was investigated. The upstream regulatory sequence of Myo6 (2625 bp), consisting of an 1899 bp upstream sequence and a 727 bp intron 1 sequence, was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pGL3‑Basic vector expressing firefly luciferase. For verification of inserted fragments, plasmids were subjected to restriction analysis and then sequenced. HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells were transiently transfected with renilla luciferase‑thymidine kinase vectors expressing Renilla luciferase and the Myo6 promoter‑driven firefly luciferase expressing vectors along with pIRES2‑enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)‑Pou4f3 (expressing wild‑type Pou4f3) or pIRES2‑EGFP‑Pou4f3 (expressing the truncation mutant of Pou4f3). The relative luciferase activities were measured to determine the activity of the Myo6 promoter. The Myo6 promoter activity was not affected by co‑expression of wild‑type Pou4f3, as indicated by the comparable relative luciferase activities in the presence of the pIRES2‑EGFP‑Pou4f3 and the empty control vectors. However, co‑expression of mutated Pou4f3 significantly inhibited the activity of the Myo6 promoter to almost half of that of the control (P<0.001). The data suggests that mutated Pou4f3 has a negative role in the promoter activity of Myo6, and by extension, the expression of myosin VI, and this may be an underlying mechanism of DFNA15 hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Ma DB","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Inhibition of Myo6 gene expression by co‑expression of a mutant of transcription factor POU4F3 (BRN‑3C) in hair cells."},"rdfs:label":"Altered expressions in HEK293 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7aa167b1-24d9-4cb8-8ffd-5ce9ac77d4f1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5032c92-3605-4983-89a7-8533fb44831b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Strong evidence that Pou4f3 is involved in hair cell development","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26697340","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To gain new insights about the genetic networks controlling hair cell (HC) development, we previously developed a direct genetic programming strategy to generate an inexhaustible supply of HC-like cells (induced HCs, iHCs) in vitro, starting from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC).

A mutation of POU4F3 underlies human autosomal dominant non-syndromic progressive hearing loss DFNA15. Through a comparison of inner ear gene expression profiles of E16.5 wild-type and Pou4f3 mutant deaf mice using a high density oligonucleotide microarray, we identified the gene encoding growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1) as a likely in vivo target gene regulated by Pou4f3. To validate this result, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridizations for Gfi1 on wild-type and Pou4f3 mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that a deficiency of Pou4f3 leads to a statistically significant reduction in Gfi1 expression levels and that the dynamics of Gfi1 mRNA abundance closely follow the pattern of expression for Pou4f3. To examine the role of Gfi1 in the pathogenesis of Pou4f3-related deafness, we performed comparative analyses of the embryonic inner ears of Pou4f3 and Gfi1 mouse mutants using immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. The loss of Gfi1 results in outer hair cell degeneration, which appears comparable to that observed in Pou4f3 mutants. These results identify Gfi1 as the first downstream target of a hair cell specific transcription factor and suggest that outer hair cell degeneration in Pou4f3 mutants is largely or entirely a result of the loss of expression of Gfi1.","dc:creator":"Hertzano R","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Transcription profiling of inner ears from Pou4f3(ddl/ddl) identifies Gfi1 as a target of the Pou4f3 deafness gene."},"rdfs:label":"GFI1 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1476f1d9-7538-40bd-b602-b76781630cee_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:14e8df28-66fb-4a0a-8eab-d35d86cda47d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2a5f4b9-d610-4ae8-82b0-811b00f80ed3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"both mouse and humans display hearing loss","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15254021","rdfs:label":"Dreidel mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Two copies of mutant allele were required to cause phenotype"},{"id":"cggv:e0457e8a-5466-4f73-a1ce-d90b5b8df429","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0642058e-3e0e-4172-bd4a-90cd8879c852","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"both mice and humans have hearing loss","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637595","rdfs:label":"POU4F3 null mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Two copies of mutant allele were required to cause phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":281,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:1ef4dec0-5481-452e-b499-c8a4caf64870","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:9220","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The POU4F3 gene has been associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNA15 in at least 18 probands in 18 publications. Missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion variants have been reported in humans, and variants in this gene segregated with disease in over 60 additional family members. POU4F3 was first associated with this disease in humans in 1998 (Vahava et al.). The hearing loss in DFNA15 individuals is progressive, with a highly variable age of onset between the second and fifth decades of life. The mechanism for disease is likely haploinsufficiency, due to the wide variant spectrum, however mice require only one copy of the functional gene to retain hearing (Erkman 1997, Keithley 1999, Hertzano 2004). This gene-disease association is supported by multiple mouse models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, POU4F3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 11/21/2017.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1476f1d9-7538-40bd-b602-b76781630cee"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
