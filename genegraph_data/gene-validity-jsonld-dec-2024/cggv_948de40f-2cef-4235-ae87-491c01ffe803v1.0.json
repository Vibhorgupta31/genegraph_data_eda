Recently, mutations in the PFN1 gene have been identified as a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The co-aggregation of PFN1 bearing mutations that cause ALS with TDP-43 (a key molecule in both sporadic and some familial forms of ALS), together with the classical TDP-43 pathology detected in post-mortem tissues of patients with autosomal dominant PFN1 mutation, imply that gain-of-toxic-function of PFN1 mutants is associated with the onset of ALS. However, it remains unknown how PFN1 mutants cause ALS. We found mutant PFN1 that causes ALS formed cytoplasmic aggregates positive for ubiquitin and p62, and these aggregates sequestered endogenous TDP-43. In cells harboring PFN1 aggregates, formation of aggresome-like structures was inhibited in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, and conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was suppressed in the presence of lysosome inhibitor. Further, insoluble TDP-43 was increased in both cases. Co-expression of ALS-linked mutant PFN1 and TDP-43 increased insoluble and phosphorylated TDP-43 levels. The C-terminal region of TDP-43, essential for aggregation of TDP-43, was also indispensable for the interaction with PFN1. Interestingly, insoluble fractions prepared from cells expressing ALS-linked mutant PFN1 functioned as a seed to induce accumulation and phosphorylation of TDP-43, indicating that TDP-43 accumulated in the presence of the PFN1 mutants is converted to prion-like species.

Mutations in the gene profilin 1 (PFN1) have very recently been shown to be the cause of a subgroup of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we performed a large screen of US, Nordic, and German familial and sporadic ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTLD) patients for PFN1 mutations to get further insight into the spectrum and pathogenic relevance of this gene for the complete ALS/FTLD continuum. Four hundred twelve familial and 260 sporadic ALS cases and 16 ALS/FTLD cases from Germany, the Nordic countries, and the United States were screened for PFN1 mutations. Phenotypes of patients carrying PFN1 mutations were studied. In a German ALS family we identified the novel heterozygous PFN1 mutation p.Thr109Met, which was absent in controls. This novel mutation abrogates a phosphorylation site in profilin 1. The recently described p.Gln117Gly sequence variant was found in another familial ALS patient from the United States. The ALS patients with mutations in PFN1 displayed spinal onset motor neuron disease without overt cognitive involvement. PFN1 mutations were absent in patients with motor neuron disease and dementia, and in patients with only FTLD. We provide further evidence that PFN1 mutations can cause ALS as a Mendelian dominant trait. Patients carrying PFN1 mutations reported so far represent the \"classic\" ALS end of the ALS-FTLD spectrum. The novel p.Thr109Met mutation provides additional proof-of-principle that mutant proteins involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics can cause motor neuron degeneration. Moreover, this new mutation suggests that fine-tuning of actin polymerization by phosphorylation of profilin 1 might be necessary for motor neuron survival.","dc:creator":"Ingre C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A novel phosphorylation site mutation in profilin 1 revealed in a large screen of US, Nordic, and German amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia cohorts."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23141414","rdfs:label":"III:6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The missense variant Thr109Met, identified in two affected family members, is positioned close to the actin binding domain of profilin 1 at a phosphorylation site.

At least 7 variants (all missense) with a possible association with ALS18 have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands with ALS in 6 publications (PMIDs: 22801503, 23141414, 23428184, 25499087, 31802421, 31401564). Variants in this gene have been found to segregate with disease in at least 17 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models( PMIDs:\n28040732, 27681617) and functional assays in patient (PMID: 31444357) and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 22801503, 26908597, 31444357). The mechanism for disease is currently unclear but is suspected to involve heterozygous toxic gain-of-function, a dominant-negative mechanism, or a loss-of-function mechanism, though the former appears most likely (Wu et al, 2012 - PMID: 22801503; Yang et al, 2016 - PMID: 27681617; Tanaka et al, 2016 - PMID: 26908597; Fil et al, 2017 - PMID: 28040732; Giampetruzzi et al, 2019 - PMID: 31444357). In summary, there is currently definitive evidence that has been replicated over time to support this gene-disease relationship, and no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. Of note, one additional variant (a NMD- frameshift variant) has been reported in at least 3 reportedly unrelated families (though they may be distantly related) with autosomal dominant Paget disease of bone in 2 publications (Merlotti et al, 2020 - PMID 32392277; Scotto di Carlo et al, 2020 - PMID: 31991009). Due to the differences in apparent molecular mechanism and phenotype his gene-disease relationship was not assessed as part of the PFN1-ALS curation.
