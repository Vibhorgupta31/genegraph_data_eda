Mutations in the LBR gene can affect neutrophil segmentation and sterol reductase activity and have been associated with two different recognized clinical conditions, Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA) and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia. PHA is a benign autosomal co-dominant laminopathy resulting in bilobed neutrophil nuclei in heterozygotes, and unsegmented (ovoid) neutrophil nuclei in homozygotes. Some putative PHA homozygotes have been reported with minor skeletal malformations. Greenberg skeletal dysplasia is a severe autosomal recessive, perinatal lethal dwarfing disorder in which heterozygous carriers are usually without clinical manifestations. We here report a girl who has bilobed neutrophil nuclei and a mild skeletal dysplasia. Mutation analysis showed two novel mutations in the LBR gene: c.651_653 delinsTGATGAGAAA (p.Ile218Aspfs*19) and c.1757G > A (p.Arg586His). These mutations were found to be in trans, and, thus, she is a compound heterozygote. Sterol analysis found trace amounts of cholesta-8,14-dien-3beta-ol, which is normally undetected in healthy individuals. This and previously reported cases suggest that mutations in LBR can result in a continuum of phenotypic manifestations.","dc:creator":"Borovik L","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Pelger-huet anomaly and a mild skeletal phenotype secondary to mutations in LBR."}},{"id":"cggv:48b3bfae-e528-49a2-90ba-939407005650_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4283b011-f79d-44e6-820c-5de5b41dbd68"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23824842"}],"rdfs:label":"Borovik_1"},{"id":"cggv:48b3bfae-e528-49a2-90ba-939407005650","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48b3bfae-e528-49a2-90ba-939407005650_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:7ae62e91-d11c-4cac-903d-ffd8f0266b97","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ae62e91-d11c-4cac-903d-ffd8f0266b97_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Missense variant was upgraded for relevant radiographs included in the publication."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e4138992-9354-42a6-b29c-9ee9fd8fe3a6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e4138992-9354-42a6-b29c-9ee9fd8fe3a6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0564bdc1-174f-418b-9b3d-b35d8a4c2a21","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002296.4(LBR):c.1534C>T (p.Arg512Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1417118"}},"detectionMethod":"Exome sequencing was performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes on patients and their parents.

Pathogenic variants in LBR are associated with marked phenotypic variability, ranging from the benign Pelger-Huët anomaly to lethal Greenberg Dysplasia. We performed trio exome sequencing (ES) on two patients with atypical variants of skeletal dysplasia and their unaffected parents. Patient 1 exhibited frontal bossing, mid-face hypoplasia, short stature with rhizomelic limb shortening, and relative macrocephaly at birth. Although remained short, Patient 1 later showed spontaneous improvement in her skeletal findings. Exome sequencing revealed two novel variants in LBR, c.1504C > G (p.Arg502Gly) in exon 12 and c.1748G > T (p.Arg583Leu) in exon 14, which were inherited from her unaffected father and mother, respectively. Sterol analysis revealed an increased level of cholesta‑8,14‑dien‑3β‑ol to 2.9% of total sterols, consistent with a functional deficiency of 3β‑hydroxysterol Δ14‑reductase. Patient 2 presented at birth with short stature and marked rhizomelic limb shortening but later exhibited decreasing severity of shortening of the long bones and improvement in the radiographic skeletal abnormalities although he continued to be significantly short at age 10 years. Exome sequencing revealed that Patient 2 is homozygous for a pathogenic variant c.1534C > T (p.Arg512Trp) in exon 12 of LBR, which was inherited from his unaffected consanguineous parents. This report provides further evidence for a phenotypic spectrum of LBR-associated disorders and expands the genotypic spectrum by describing 3 novel disease-causing variants that have not been previously associated with a disease. Moreover, our data on Patient 1 demonstrate that variants throughout the gene appear to influence both the sterol reductase and nuclear functions of LBR.","dc:creator":"Thompson E","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Lamin B receptor-related disorder is associated with a spectrum of skeletal dysplasia phenotypes."}},"rdfs:label":"Thompson_2"},{"id":"cggv:f22ed671-3d3b-4920-a06d-35f5e89ac19c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f22ed671-3d3b-4920-a06d-35f5e89ac19c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Missense variant upgraded once for relevant radiographs and second allele was upgraded for being in a hotspot location."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9363af5e-5076-4f7b-bff3-3c15751bca92_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9},{"id":"cggv:64dc17fd-09c9-4c8f-a10b-935feb7cb5a5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64dc17fd-09c9-4c8f-a10b-935feb7cb5a5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:ef3f5ff0-6e30-4802-b530-3d5a48018f55","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002296.4(LBR):c.1174G>A (p.Gly392Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA344996417"}},{"id":"cggv:4615452d-dfa3-4b5e-bf22-2fcccf80cdac","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002296.4(LBR):c.1535G>A (p.Arg512Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1417117"}}],"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and/or cultured fibroblasts or chondrocytes of all probands and available parents and siblings.

A subset of these disorders is distinguished by profound abnormalities of the skeleton that include a long narrow chest with markedly short ribs, extremely short limbs, and polydactyly. These include the perinatal lethal short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) and the less severe asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD), Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome, and cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) phenotypes. To identify new genes and define the spectrum of mutations in the skeletal ciliopathies, we analyzed 152 unrelated families with SRPS, ATD, and EVC. Causal variants were discovered in 14 genes in 120 families, including one newly associated gene and two genes previously associated with other ciliopathies. These three genes encode components of three different ciliary complexes; FUZ, which encodes a planar cell polarity complex molecule; TRAF3IP1, which encodes an anterograde ciliary transport protein; and LBR, which encodes a nuclear membrane protein with sterol reductase activity. The results established the molecular basis of SRPS type IV, in which mutations were identified in four different ciliary genes. The data provide systematic insight regarding the genotypes associated with a large cohort of these genetically heterogeneous phenotypes and identified new ciliary components required for normal skeletal development.","dc:creator":"Zhang W","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Expanding the genetic architecture and phenotypic spectrum in the skeletal ciliopathies."}},{"id":"cggv:bd621b8f-5289-46d8-acb3-652553f80661_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4615452d-dfa3-4b5e-bf22-2fcccf80cdac"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29068549"}],"rdfs:label":"Zhang_R09-162"},{"id":"cggv:bd621b8f-5289-46d8-acb3-652553f80661","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd621b8f-5289-46d8-acb3-652553f80661_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The missense variant was upgraded for relevant radiographs in the publication.

We recently found that human PHA is caused by mutations in the gene (LBR) encoding lamin B receptor, an evolutionarily conserved inner nuclear membrane protein involved in nuclear assembly and chromatin binding. Mice homozygous for deleterious alleles at the ichthyosis (ic) locus present with a blood phenotype similar to PHA, and develop other phenotypic abnormalities, including alopecia, variable expression of syndactyly and hydrocephalus. The ic locus on mouse chromosome 1 shares conserved synteny with the chromosomal location of the human LBR locus on human chromosome 1. In this study, we identified one nonsense (815ins) and two frameshift mutations (1088insCC and 1884insGGAA) within the Lbr gene of mice homozygous for either of three independent mutations (ic, ic(J) and ic(4J), respectively) at the ichthyosis locus. These allelic mutations are predicted to result in truncated or severely impaired LBR protein. Our studies of mice homozygous for the ic(J) mutation revealed a complete loss of LBR protein as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. The findings provide the molecular basis for the heterochromatin clumping and other distinct phenotypes caused by ic mutations. These spontaneous Lbr mutations confirm the molecular basis of human PHA and provide a small animal model for determination of the precise function of LBR in normal and pathological states.","dc:creator":"Shultz LD","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations at the mouse ichthyosis locus are within the lamin B receptor gene: a single gene model for human Pelger-Huët anomaly."},"rdfs:label":"Shultz_Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score was downgraded since some skeletal phenotypes were noted but it is not exact to the human phenotype.

Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia, AKA Rhizomelic skeletal dysplasia with or without Pelger-Huet anomaly, is a rare, primary bone dysplasia characterized by mild short stature, rhizomelic shortening of the arms and legs, bowing of long bones with widened and irregular metaphyses, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and metacarpal shortening. A marked improvement of the radiologic skeletal features is typical. Variants in LBR have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Reynold’s syndrome, Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia, Pelger-Huet anomaly, and Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into four disease entities, Reynold’s syndrome (OMIM:613471), Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia (OMIM:215140), Pelger-Huet anomaly (OMIM:169400), and Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia (OMIM:618019). The split curation for AR Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia will be curated separately by the Skeletal Disorders GCEP.  Eight missense variants and three nonsense variants that have been reported in eight probands in six publications (PMIDs: 23824842, 25348816, 29068549, 30448303, 34467646, 36400164) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model (PMID: 12490533). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date August 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9363af5e-5076-4f7b-bff3-3c15751bca92"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
