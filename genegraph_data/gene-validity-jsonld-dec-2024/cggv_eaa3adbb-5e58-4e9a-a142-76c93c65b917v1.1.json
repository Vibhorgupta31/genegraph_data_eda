The relationship of this gene with SQTS is based on a single report which used a candidate-gene approach in patients with Brugada syndrome and a short QT interval (PMID 17224476). Because the proband identified as carrying the rare genetic variant (ClinVar Variation ID# 9547) had a positive ajmaline test, his phenotype was regarded by the Expert Panel to be concordant with Brugada syndrome and not SQTS. Therefore, the Expert Panel classified the relationship of this gene with SQTS as ‘Disputed’. \n\nThe Expert Panel concluded there is an absence of any substantive evidence to support a gene-disease relationship between CACNB2 and SQTS.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:eaa3adbb-5e58-4e9a-a142-76c93c65b917"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
