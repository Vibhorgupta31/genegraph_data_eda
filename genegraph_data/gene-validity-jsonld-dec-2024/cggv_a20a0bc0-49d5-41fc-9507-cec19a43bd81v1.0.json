Their PED was accompanied by epilepsy, mild developmental delay, reduced CSF glucose levels, hemolytic anemia with echinocytosis, and altered erythrocyte ion concentrations. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified a causative deletion of 4 highly conserved amino acids (Q282_S285del) in the pore region of the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes and human erythrocytes revealed that this mutation decreased glucose transport and caused a cation leak that alters intracellular concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium. We screened 4 additional families, in which PED is combined with epilepsy, developmental delay, or migraine, but not with hemolysis or echinocytosis, and identified 2 additional GLUT1 mutations (A275T, G314S) that decreased glucose transport but did not affect cation permeability. Combining these data with brain imaging studies, we propose that the dyskinesias result from an exertion-induced energy deficit that may cause episodic dysfunction of the basal ganglia, and that the hemolysis with echinocytosis may result from alterations in intracellular electrolytes caused by a cation leak through mutant GLUT1.","dc:creator":"Weber YG","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"GLUT1 mutations are a cause of paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesias and induce hemolytic anemia by a cation leak."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18451999","rdfs:label":"Weber_PED4_Proband_III-15"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"he proband was heterozygous for a missense variant, Ala275Thr, at the cytoplasmic end of the 7th transmembrane segment.

Stereospecific high-capacity carriers, including those that recognize glucose, are key components of this barrier, which also protects the brain against noxious substances. Facilitated glucose transport in vertebrates is catalyzed by a family of carriers consisting of at least five functional isoforms with distinct tissue distributions, subcellular localizations and transport kinetics. Several of these transporters are expressed in the mammalian brain. GLUT-1, whose sequence was originally deduced from cDNAs cloned from human hepatoma and rat brain, is present at high levels in primate erythrocytes and brain endothelial cells. GLUT1 has been cloned and positionally mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p35-p31.3; refs 6-8). Despite substantial metabolic requirements of the central nervous system, no genetic disease caused by dysfunctional blood-brain barrier transport has been identified. Several years ago, we described two patients with infantile seizures, delayed development and acquired microcephaly who have normal circulating blood glucose, low-to-normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate, but persistent hypoglycorrachia (low CSF glucose) and diminished transport of hexose into isolated red blood cells (RBC). These symptoms suggested the existence of a defect in glucose transport across the blood brain barrier. We now report two distinct classes of mutations as the molecular basis for the functional defect of glucose transport: hemizygosity of GLUT1 and nonsense mutations resulting in truncation of the GLUT-1 protein.","dc:creator":"Seidner G","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of the blood-brain barrier hexose carrier."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9462754","rdfs:label":"Seidner_Proband_Ca"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The proband was hemizygous for the SLC2A1 gene: a deletion of one of the alleles was detected by FISH.

SLC2A1 encodes GLUT-1, a facilitated glucose transporter, significantly expressed in the blood-brain barrier, placenta and erythrocytes, among other tissues. GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome is characterized by reduced glucose levels in the brain and CSF (hypoglycorrhachia), intellectual deficits, seizures, movement disorders, paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia, and in some cases, hemolytic anemia, cation-leaky erythrocytes, stomatin-deficient cryohydrocytosis. In OMIM, SLC2A1 is associated with the following disease entities: Dystonia 9 (MIM: 601042); \t\nsevere infantile-onset GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 1 (MIM: 606777); childhood-onset GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 2 (MIM: 612126); Stomatin-deficient cryohydrocytosis with neurologic defects (MIM: 608885); susceptibility to idiopathic generalized epilepsy 12 (MIM: 614847). And, in Orphanet, it is associated with childhood absence epilepsy (ORPHA:64280);\nEncephalopathy due to GLUT1 deficiency (ORPHA:71277);\nHereditary cryohydrocytosis with reduced stomatin (ORPHA:168577);\nParoxysmal dystonic choreathetosis with episodic ataxia and spasticity (ORPHA:53583); and Paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (ORPHA:98811). The condition shows a phenotypic spectrum and heterogeneity and is reported to be a continuum in GeneReviews (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1430/#glut1.Nomenclature).  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome is known to show intrafamilial and interfamilial variability (PMID: 27725288, 18451999). A ketogenic diet is effective in reducing seizure occurrences and improving gait disturbances (PMIDs: 9462754, 18451999, 22282645, 21555602, 21832227, 22492876). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (MONDO:0000188).  \n\nAt least 90 missense, nonsense, frameshift, in-frame and out-of-frame deletion, exon and whole gene deletion variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation and experimental data.  \n \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 26193382, 9462754, 18451999). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 11 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n  \nHeterozygous variants in SLC2A1 are the predominant cause of GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome. Most variants are de novo, but familial cases are also reported. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency, causing reduced transport activity of the GLUT-1 protein (PMID: 9462754). At least three reports of autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported, in whom the severity of the disease was determined by the degree of haploinsufficiency (PMID: 20687207) of the protein. They have not been included in this curation, however. Complete loss of function of SLC2A1 is incompatible with life (PMID: 16497725).   \n\nExperimental Evidence: 4.5 POINTS\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays (PMID: 2348864, 10562431, 2710134) mouse models recapitulating the disease (PMID: 16497725, 16880609) and gene-therapy mediated rescue in mice (PMID: 28119822).  \n  \nIn summary, SLC2A1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Autism and Intellectual Disability Gene Curation Expert Panel on 04/17/2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a20a0bc0-49d5-41fc-9507-cec19a43bd81"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
