LMAN1 is a mannose-binding type 1 transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC; refs. 2,3), suggesting that F5F8D could result from a defect in secretion of factor V and factor VIII (ref. 4). Correctly folded proteins destined for secretion are packaged in the ER into COPII-coated vesicles, which subsequently fuse to form the ERGIC. Secretion of certain abundant proteins suggests a default pathway requiring no export signals (bulk flow; refs. 6,7). An alternative mechanism involves selective packaging of secreted proteins with the help of specific cargo receptors. The latter model would be consistent with mutations in LMAN1 causing a selective block to export of factor V and factor VIII. But approximately 30% of individuals with F5F8D have normal levels of LMAN1, suggesting that mutations in another gene may also be associated with F5F8D. Here we show that inactivating mutations in MCFD2 cause F5F8D with a phenotype indistinguishable from that caused by mutations in LMAN1. MCFD2 is localized to the ERGIC through a direct, calcium-dependent interaction with LMAN1. These findings suggest that the MCFD2-LMAN1 complex forms a specific cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of selected proteins.","dc:creator":"Zhang B","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Bleeding due to disruption of a cargo-specific ER-to-Golgi transport complex."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12717434","rdfs:label":"Family 4 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant Asp129Glu was experimentally determined, in transfected HeLa cells, to impact the localization of MCFD2 (with diffuse staining rather than localization in the ERGIC) and protein interaction with LMAN1 (with loss of co-immunoprecipitation)."},{"id":"cggv:d22a69d9-52e8-403a-aa3f-f8d7117e61eb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d67c4b6-1e72-4a3a-85c5-27f91468d125","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":24,"detectionMethod":"MCFD2 coding regions and intron/exon boundaries were amplified and Sanger sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"16.2% Factor V, 16.7% factor VIII","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003225","obo:HP_0000225","obo:HP_0003125","obo:HP_0000421"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"LMAN1 mutations were not detected","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:d22a69d9-52e8-403a-aa3f-f8d7117e61eb_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ae4f6bfc-7c65-4f03-aa08-f5afb9901c24","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001171511.2(MCFD2):c.154_188del (p.Glu52Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA916084417"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17610559","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Combined FV and FVIII deficiency (F5F8D) is a rare (1:1.000.000) autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the LMAN1 or MCFD2 genes, encoding for a FV and FVIII cargo receptor complex.

Four homozygous mutations, including two frame shift, one missense and one splice site, were identified in all the nine patients. Three of them, a 72-bp deletion in LMAN1 (c.813_822 + 62del72, p.K272fs), a 35-bp deletion in MCFD2 (c.210_244del35) and a missence mutation in MCFD2 (p.D122V), identified in four patients, were novel mutations.

Genetic deficiency of LMAN1 or MCFD2 in humans results in the moderate bleeding disorder combined FV and FVIII deficiency, with a similar phenotype previously observed in LMAN1-deficient mice. We now report that MCFD2-deficient mice generated by gene targeting also demonstrate reduced plasma FV and FVIII, with levels lower than those in LMAN1-deficient mice, similar to previous observations in LMAN1- and MCDF2-deficient humans. Surprisingly, FV and FVIII levels in doubly deficient mice match the higher levels observed in LMAN1-deficient mice. In contrast to the strain-specific partial lethality previously observed in LMAN1-null mice, MCFD2-null mice demonstrate normal survival in different genetic backgrounds, although doubly deficient mice exhibit partial embryonic lethality comparable to LMAN1-deficient mice. These results suggest that an alternative pathway is responsible for FV/FVIII secretion in doubly deficient mice and distinct cargo-specific functions for LMAN1 and MCFD2 within the ER-to-Golgi secretory pathway. We also observed decreased plasma levels of α1-antitrypsin (AAT) in male mice for all 3 groups of deficient mice. Comparable accumulation of AAT was observed in hepatocyte ER of singly and doubly deficient mice, demonstrating a role for LMAN1 and MCFD2 in efficient ER exit of AAT.","dc:creator":"Zhu M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Analysis of MCFD2- and LMAN1-deficient mice demonstrates distinct functions in vivo."},"rdfs:label":"MCFD2 KO Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"F5F8D is recapitulated in mild form in this KO mouse model.

At least 21 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 12717434, 17610559). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function as a cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of factor V and factor VIII ( PMID: 15886209), its interaction with LMAN1 (PMID: 12717434) which is also implicated in this disease, and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 29735583) that also exhibits reductions of both factor V and factor VIII. In summary, MCFD2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of factor V and factor VIII, combined deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:afa4ae2a-c40d-4f25-affe-852a67144cdd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
