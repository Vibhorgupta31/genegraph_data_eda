Since that time, several other variants in *CNTNAP5* have been reported in individuals with various neurodevelopmental presentations including autism, intellectual disability, seizures, and language impairment. Because of this the Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP decided to curate this using the term complex neurodevelopmental disorder. \n\nAt least 10 individuals with variants in this gene have been reported (PMIDs: 35982159, 37007974, 37543562, 31398340, 20346443, 35982159).However, none of them were assigned scores. In some cases, the variants reported were either inherited from unaffected parents or found at high frequencies in gnomADv4.1. In other cases, the probands had other variants in other genes that could also be suspected to be causative for complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, there are a few reports of individuals with intragenic copy number variants in this gene; these were also excluded from case level evidence given presence of the same variants in unaffected family members, or the presence of additional copy number variants in the same proband (PMIDs: 34553698, 34553698, 32329157, 23275889).\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CNTNAP5* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder has been refuted and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. New evidence would be needed to support this claim. This classification was approved by ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on August 20, 2024 (SOP Version 10). \n\n\nThis curation refutes the proposed link of this gene with complex neurodevelopmental disorders published in multiple large cohort studies of individuals with Autism.
