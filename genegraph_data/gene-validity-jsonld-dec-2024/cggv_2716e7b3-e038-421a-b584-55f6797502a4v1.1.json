We set out to test the hypothesis that rare variants in many different genes, including de novo variants, could predispose to these conditions in a fraction of cases. In addition, for both disorders, males are either more significantly or more severely affected than females, which may be explained in part by X-linked genetic factors. Therefore, we directly sequenced 111 X-linked synaptic genes in individuals with ASD (n = 142; 122 males and 20 females) or SCZ (n = 143; 95 males and 48 females). We identified >200 non-synonymous variants, with an excess of rare damaging variants, which suggest the presence of disease-causing mutations. Truncating mutations in genes encoding the calcium-related protein IL1RAPL1 (already described in Piton et al. Hum Mol Genet 2008) and the monoamine degradation enzyme monoamine oxidase B were found in ASD and SCZ, respectively. Moreover, several promising non-synonymous rare variants were identified in genes encoding proteins involved in regulation of neurite outgrowth and other various synaptic functions (MECP2, TM4SF2/TSPAN7, PPP1R3F, PSMD10, MCF2, SLITRK2, GPRASP2, and OPHN1).","dc:creator":"Piton A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Systematic resequencing of X-chromosome synaptic genes in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20479760","rdfs:label":"II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"prediction tolerated\ngroup suggestion 0"},{"id":"cggv:67186f83-b62f-4216-bd0b-54cbf97a7c82_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1d38706-90fa-4da9-956d-f94610e15c72","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:67186f83-b62f-4216-bd0b-54cbf97a7c82_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:61720f05-d452-40cd-a8e7-51f6234881ac"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10655063","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"X-linked forms of mental retardation (MR) affect approximately 1 in 600 males and are likely to be highly heterogeneous.

At least five MRX genes have been identified by positional cloning, but each accounts for only 0.5%-1.0% of MRX cases. Here we show that the gene TM4SF2 at Xp11.4 is inactivated by the X breakpoint of an X;2 balanced translocation in a patient with MR. Further investigation led to identification of TM4SF2 mutations in 2 of 33 other MRX families. RNA in situ hybridization showed that TM4SF2 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. TM4SF2 encodes a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins, which are known to contribute in molecular complexes including beta-1 integrins.

We previously reported that, in cultured neurons, shRNA-mediated down-regulation of TSPAN7 affects AMPAR trafficking by enhancing PICK1-GluA2 interaction, thereby increasing the intracellular retention of AMPAR. Here, we found that loss of TSPAN7 function in mice causes alterations in hippocampal excitatory synapse structure and functionality as well as cognitive impairment. These changes occurred along with alterations in AMPAR expression levels. We also found that interfering with PICK1-GluA2 binding restored synaptic function in Tm4sf2-/y mice.

A female with mild intellectual disability was found to carry a balanced translocation [46,X,t(X;2)(p11.4;p21.3)] with a breakpoint within TSPAN7 that disrupted its expression. Though this case was not scored, it ultimately led to further investigation of this gene as a potential cause for X-linked intellectual disability (PMID: 10655063). One family with multiple affected males was found to have a nonsense variant. Another family was found to have a missense variant (NM_004615.3:c.515C>A, p.Pro172His); this variant was also reported in other manuscripts as being observed in individuals with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder (PMIDs: 14735593, 20479760). This variant was subsequently found to be observed at frequencies too high in the general population to be consistent with disease (205 total alleles across various populations in gnomAD v.2.1.1, including 66 hemizygotes), and was therefore not scored as evidence to support this gene disease relationship. Since the initial report, only two other frameshift variants have been reported: one in four affected males in a family with X-linked intellectual disability (PMID: 12070254), and the other in a male with intellectual disability (PMID: 26350204). Other articles reported individuals with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder with a partial duplication of TSPAN7 spanning exons 2-8 (PMID: 22511893, 19339915, 24768552, 25661985). This recurrent duplication is of uncertain significance and was therefore not scored.\nThere is experimental evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including functional alteration in hippocampal neurons (PMID:22445342) and a mouse model (PMID:28968657).\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting a relationship between TSPAN7 and X-linked intellectual disability.
