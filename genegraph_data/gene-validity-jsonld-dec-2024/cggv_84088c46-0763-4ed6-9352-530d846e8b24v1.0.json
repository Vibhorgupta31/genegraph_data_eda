PCD is characterized by bronchiectasis and upper respiratory tract infections, and half of the patients with PCD have situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome). We characterized the transcript and the genomic organization of the axonemal heavy chain dynein type 11 (DNAH11) gene, the human homologue of murine Dnah11 or lrd, which is mutated in the iv/iv mouse model with situs inversus. To assess the role of DNAH11, which maps on chromosome 7p21, we searched for mutations in the 82 exons of this gene in a patient with situs inversus totalis, and probable Kartagener syndrome associated with paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (patUPD7). We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (R2852X) in the DNAH11 gene. This patient is remarkable because he is also homozygous for the F508del allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Sequence analysis of the DNAH11 gene in an additional 6 selected PCD sibships that shared DNAH11 alleles revealed polymorphic variants and an R3004Q substitution in a conserved position that might be pathogenic.

The mechanisms that direct this handed development of left-right asymmetries have been elusive, but recent studies of mutations that affect left-right development have shed light on the molecules involved. One molecule implicated in left-right specification is left-right dynein (LRD), a microtubule-based motor protein. In the LRD protein of the inversus viscerum (iv) mouse, there is a single amino acid difference at a conserved position, and the lrd gene is one of many genes deleted in the legless (lgl) mutation. Both iv and lgl mice display randomized left-right development. Here we extend the analysis of the lrd gene at the levels of sequence, expression and function. The complete coding sequence of the lrd gene confirms its classification as an axonemal, or ciliary, dynein. Expression of lrd in the node at embryonic day 7.5 is shown to be symmetric. At embryonic day 8.0, however, a striking asymmetric expression pattern is observed in all three germ layers of the developing headfold, suggesting roles in both the establishment and maintenance of left-right asymmetries. At later times, expression of lrd is also observed in the developing floorplate, gut and limbs. These results suggest function for LRD protein in both ciliated and non-ciliated cells, despite its sequence classification as axonemal. In addition, a targeted mutation of lrd was generated that deletes the part of the protein required for ATP binding, and hence motor function. The resulting left-right phenotype, randomization of laterality, is identical to that of iv and lgl mutants. Gross defects in ciliary structure were not observed in lrd/lrd mutants. Strikingly, however, the monocilia on mutant embryonic node cells were immotile. These results prove the identity of the iv and lrd genes. Further, they argue that LRD motor function, and resulting nodal monocilia movement, are required for normal left-right development.","dc:creator":"Supp DM","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Targeted deletion of the ATP binding domain of left-right dynein confirms its role in specifying development of left-right asymmetries."},"rdfs:label":"Genetic disruption of mouse Dnah11 catalytic domain"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"While some of the features of this mouse model overlap with those of the other mouse model separately scored in PMID: 9353118 and PMID: 22102620, this model detects additional ciliary abnormalities in at the embryonic node.

We present a German family in which five individuals have PCD and one has KS. PCD was confirmed by analysis of native and cultured respiratory ciliated epithelia with high-speed video microscopy. Respiratory ciliated cells from the affected individuals showed an abnormal nonflexible beating pattern with a reduced cilium bending capacity and a hyperkinetic beat. Interestingly, the axonemal ultrastructure of these respiratory cilia was normal and outer dynein arms were intact, as shown by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite analysis indicated genetic linkage to the dynein heavy chain DNAH11 on chromosome 7p21. All affected individuals carried the compound heterozygous DNAH11 mutations c.12384C>G and c.13552_13608del. Both mutations are located in the C-terminal domain and predict a truncated DNAH11 protein (p.Y4128X, p.A4518_A4523delinsQ). The mutations described here were not present in a cohort of 96 PCD patients. In conclusion, our findings support the view that DNAH11 mutations indeed cause PCD and KS, and that the reported DNAH11 nonsense mutations are associated with a normal axonemal ultrastructure and are compatible with normal male fertility.","dc:creator":"Schwabe GC","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with normal axoneme ultrastructure is caused by DNAH11 mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:e667a206-efb9-4f9d-a5ad-df77f054599a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c4e29bb1-ad67-4fb5-830f-8f5a523abf99"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18022865"}],"rdfs:label":"Schwabe_2008_Patient_II-6"},{"id":"cggv:2d898c83-b6f3-46ab-a690-fd4ae198059e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d898c83-b6f3-46ab-a690-fd4ae198059e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2d898c83-b6f3-46ab-a690-fd4ae198059e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The NM_001277115.2(DNAH11):c.12363C>G (p.Tyr4121Ter) nonsense variant introduces a premature stop codon that perturbs the C-terminus of the DNAH11 protein product.

The specific disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 7, is one of at least 40 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a specific monogenic cause. Affected patients frequently present as neonates or in early childhood with recurrent respiratory infections including sinusitis, as well as decreased nasal nitric oxide, otitis media, and/or bronchiectasis. Biopsies of the airway epithelium exhibit normal ciliary ultrastructure but ciliary motility is abnormal, characterized by a stiff ciliary appearance and beating with abnormally high frequency and low amplitude (PMID: 33243178). Evidence of randomization of left-right abdominal symmetry is also observed, with approximately 50% penetrance of heterotaxy (often in the form of situs inversus totalis). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited DNAH11 variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 7 (MONDO:0012748, OMIM #611884). Twenty-eight suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (seven missense, two small in-frame deletions, nine nonsense, four frameshift, and six affecting splicing), which have been collectively reported in fifteen probands in three publications (PMID: 22184204, PMID: 22102620, PMID: 18022865). More case-level evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 12142464, PMID: 26909801, PMID: 32633470, PMID: 33243178), but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points). This gene-disease relationship has not been studied in case-control studies at the single variant level or aggregate variant level. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by the absence of a gene product (PMID: 26909801). All probands scored in this curation harbored two variant alleles within the DNAH11 locus. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence of DNAH11 localization specifically to tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including respiratory epithelium (PMID: 12859898) and the node region of the developing embryo (PMID: 9353118). Biochemical evidence indicates that DNAH11 is one of the most abundant components of the airway ciliary proteome but only a minor constituent of the sperm proteome (PMID: 31178125). DNAH11 localizes to proximal but not distal regions of respiratory cilia (PMID: 26909801), and longitudinal electron tomography can detect reduced outer dynein arm volume in proximal but not distal regions of motile cilia from patient nasal epithelial cells (PMID: 33479112). Normal ciliary motility was successfully restored to patient-derived airway cells by correcting the pathogenic DNAH11 variant at the DNA level using TALEN-based homology-directed gene editing (PMID: 26729821). Two homozygous mouse models harboring Dnah11 defects (one spontaneously occurring and one genetically engineered for loss-of-function) share ciliary, upper respiratory, and organ asymmetry phenotypes with affected human patients (PMID: 9353118, PMID: 22102620, PMID: 10556073). Additional evidence is available in the literature but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points).\nIn summary, DNAH11 is definitively associated with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 7. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on September 13, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:84088c46-0763-4ed6-9352-530d846e8b24"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
