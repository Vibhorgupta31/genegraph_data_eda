Previous studies in our laboratory mapped the causative gene for this disease to a 6.5-Mb region in chromosomal region 9q31-33, flanked by D9S302 and D9S1850. We have now used additional families and a panel of 26 microsatellite markers to construct haplotypes. Twelve recombination events that reduced the size of the candidate region to 560 kb were identified or inferred. This region is flanked by D9S1126 and D9S737 and contains at least four genes. Exons of these genes were sequenced in one affected individual, and four sequence variations were identified. The families included in our study and 100 control individuals were tested for these variations. On the basis of our results, the mutation in the tripartite-motif-containing gene (TRIM32) that replaces aspartate with asparagine at position 487 appears to be the causative mutation of LGMD2H. All affected individuals were found to be homozygous for D487N, and this mutation was not found in any of the controls. This mutation occurs in an NHL (named after the proteins NCL1, HT2A, and LIN-41) domain at a position that is highly conserved. NHL domains are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Although the function of TRIM32 is unknown, current knowledge of the domain structure of this protein suggests that it may be an E3-ubiquitin ligase. If proven, this represents a new pathogenic mechanism leading to muscular dystrophy.","dc:creator":"Frosk P","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H associated with mutation in TRIM32, a putative E3-ubiquitin-ligase gene."},"rdfs:label":"TRIM32 in Skeletal Muscle"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Although the high presence of RNA and protein expression in skeletal muscle yields some evidence towards pathogenicity, the ubiquity of the expression does not provide significant enough evidence to award points."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:fbabe4ea-579e-4d98-a4b7-5ff84ee7f245_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:384f4051-7b8c-44d0-b96c-ee37cb5c25c5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:458456e8-f8b3-4ba2-a504-b9727a615957","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"TRIM32-Knockout (T32KO) mice were generated via a gene-trap method. Compared to the WT, the T32KO mice were consistently heavier and had reduced muscle mass. Multiple tests of muscle strength, such as the grip strength and wire hang tests, also resulted in an impaired performance compared to the controls. Histological analysis of muscle confirmed variable fiber diameter and apoptotic nuclei, as well as classic myopathy phenotypes such as centrally-nucleated muscle fibers and fragmented/split fibers not caused by denervation. Reduced NADH-TR and SDH enzymatic activity in muscle fibers was observed, congruent to other myogenic and neurogenic disorders. Electron microscopy confirmed the similarities to the human probands, with similar features to a dilated sarcotubular system and proliferation of the T-tubule system with abundant sarcotubular profiles, vacuoles and degenerative changes in the myofibrils with Z-line streaming. Neurogenic changes were noted in the mice as well, specifically the reduction of myelinated axon diameters.

We previously identified TRIM32 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to myosin and ubiquitinates actin. To date four TRIM32 mutations have been linked to LGMD2H, all of which occur in the C-terminal NHL domains. Unexpectedly, a fifth mutation in the B-box of TRIM32 causes a completely different, multisystemic disorder, Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11. It is not understood how allelic mutations in TRIM32 can create such diverse phenotypic outcomes. To generate a tool for elucidating the complex in vivo functions of TRIM32, we created the first murine Trim32 knock-out model (T32KO). Histological analysis of T32KO skeletal muscles revealed mild myopathic changes. Electron microscopy showed areas with Z-line streaming and a dilated sarcotubular system with vacuoles -- the latter being a prominent feature of sarcotubular myopathy. Therefore, our model replicates phenotypes of LGMD2H and sarcotubular myopathy. The level of Trim32 expression in normal mouse brain exceeds that observed in skeletal muscle by more than 100 times, as we demonstrated by real-time PCR. Intriguingly, analysis of T32KO neural tissue revealed a decreased concentration of neurofilaments and a reduction in myelinated motoraxon diameters. The axonal changes suggest a shift toward a slower motor unit type. Not surprisingly, T32KO soleus muscle expressed an elevated type I slow myosin isotype with a concomitant reduction in the type II fast myosin. These data suggest that muscular dystrophy due to TRIM32 mutations involves both neurogenic and myogenic characteristics.","dc:creator":"Kudryashova E","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Deficiency of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 in mice leads to a myopathy with a neurogenic component."},"rdfs:label":"TRIM32 KO Mice Show LGMD/Myopathy"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"These TRIM32 KO mice recapitulated the phenotype of both sarcotubular myopathy and LGMD, both of which are on a similar spectrum of disease.

Recently, three novel homozygous TRIM32 mutations have been described in LGMD patients. Here we describe a three generation Swedish family clinically presenting with limb girdle muscular weakness and histological features of a microvacuolar myopathy. The two index patients were compound heterozygotes for a frameshift mutation in TRIM32 (c.1560delC ) and a 30 kb intragenic deletion, encompassing parts of intron 1 and the entire exon 2 of TRIM32. In these patients, no full-length or truncated TRIM32 could be detected. Interestingly, heterozygous family members carrying only one mutation showed mild clinical symptoms and vacuolar changes in muscle. In our family, the phenotype encompasses additionally a mild demyelinating polyneuropathic syndrome.

In the case of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, multiplex Western blot analysis is a very useful initial step, but that often fails to identify the primarily affected protein. We report how homozygosity analysis using a genome-wide SNP array allowed us to solve the diagnostic enigma in a patient with a moderate form of LGMD, born from consanguineous parents. The genome-wide scan performed on the patient's DNA revealed several regions of homozygosity, that were compared to the location of known LGMD genes. One such region indeed contained the TRIM32 gene. This gene was previously found mutated in families with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H), a mild autosomal recessive myopathy described in Hutterite populations and in 4 patients with a diagnosis of sarcotubular myopathy. A single missense mutation was found in all these patients, located in a conserved domain of the C-terminal part of the protein. Another missense mutation affecting the N-terminal part of TRIM32, observed in a single consanguineous Bedouin family, was reported to cause the phenotypically unrelated and genetically heterogeneous Bardet-Biedl syndrome, defining the BBS11 locus. Sequencing of TRIM32 in our patient revealed a distal frameshift mutation, c.1753_1766dup14 (p.Ile590Leu fsX38). Together with two recently reported mutations, this novel mutation confirms that integrity of the C-terminal domain of TRIM32 is necessary for muscle maintenance.","dc:creator":"CossÃ©e M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Use of SNP array analysis to identify a novel TRIM32 mutation in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H."}},"rdfs:label":"CO"},{"id":"cggv:24acb746-25a4-472b-8a0a-69f51f5820c9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:24acb746-25a4-472b-8a0a-69f51f5820c9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"NMD not expected, no functional support, downgraded for homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6863c7bf-be16-4980-8224-b53debe22162_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6863c7bf-be16-4980-8224-b53debe22162","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c5204b36-76f5-4122-8436-1c3b80edcab8"},"detectionMethod":"Families were genotyped for the D487N variant in TRIM32 and L276I in FKRP as described.

At least five unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nA founder variant in this gene, D487N, was first characterized by Frosk et al as causative for an LGMD in a Hutterite population, stemming from Eastern Europe. A follow-up publication by Schoser et al (PMID:15786463) observed that Hutterite LGMD probands and German sarcotubular myopathy probands shared this same variant and similar phenotypic features, concluding that both were part of the same spectrum of disorder. Since this initial characterization, several isolated variants have been reported in at least five other probands in four publications (PMIDs: 17994549, 19492423, 19303295, 31309175). In the initial pubication the D487N variant also segregated with disease in 18 additional probands in four families, yielding a maximum LOD score of 7.61. \nThe mechanism for disease appears to be biallelic loss of function, with the disruption of the c-terminal NHL repeats impacting protein interactions and affecting proteins important to the skeletal muscle. However, no exact protein has been implicated. \nOf note, a variant in the TRIM32 B-box domain has also been implicated in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome. Due to the significant phenotypic and mechanistic differences, this assertion will be assessed separately.\nThis gene-disease association is primarily supported by multiple animal models, with both a TRIM32 Knock-Out model and a D487N Knock-In model recapitulating phenotypes of the human probands such as muscle weakness and atrophy.\nIn summary, TRIM32 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on Nov. 5, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nThis gene curation was re-approved and published on 11/14/24 by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP to reflect the change in the panel's name from LGMD GCEP to MDM GCEP. As part of this process, the genetic evidence was re-scored in accordance with SOP version 11.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fbabe4ea-579e-4d98-a4b7-5ff84ee7f245"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
