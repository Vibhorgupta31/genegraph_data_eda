Having cloned, expressed, and purified MMACHC in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated its monodispersity by dynamic light scattering and measured its hydrodynamic radius, either alone or in complex with each of four vitamin B₁₂ derivatives. Using solution-phase intrinsic fluorescence and label-free, real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR), MMACHC bound cyanocobalamin and hydroxycobalamin with similar low micromolar affinities (K(D) 6.4 and 9.8 μM, respectively); adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin also shared similar binding affinities for MMACHC (K(D) 1.7 and 1.4 μM, respectively). To predict specific regions of interaction between MMACHC and the proposed partner protein MMADHC, MMACHC was subjected to phage display. Five putative MMACHC-binding sites were identified.

Next, mouse MMADHC was analyzed by X-ray crystallography to further elucidate the MMACHC interaction. Key findings included that MMADHC binds Cbl-bound MMACHC after Cbl has been processed by MMACHC; and the MMACHC interaction region of MMADHC contains a modified nitrogen reductase (NTR) fold that abolishes homodimerization, and favors heterodimerization with another modified NTR fold from MMACHC.

The intracellular proteins MMACHC and MMADHC play important roles in processing and targeting the Cbl cofactor to its destination enzymes, and recent evidence suggests that they may interact while performing these essential trafficking functions. To better understand the molecular basis of this interaction, we have mapped the crucial protein regions required, indicate that Cbl is likely processed by MMACHC prior to interaction with MMADHC, and identify patient mutations on both proteins that interfere with complex formation, via different mechanisms. We further report the crystal structure of the MMADHC C-terminal region at 2.2 Å resolution, revealing a modified nitroreductase fold with surprising homology to MMACHC despite their poor sequence conservation. Because MMADHC demonstrates no known enzymatic activity, we propose it as the first protein known to repurpose the nitroreductase fold solely for protein-protein interaction. Using small angle x-ray scattering, we reveal the MMACHC-MMADHC complex as a 1:1 heterodimer and provide a structural model of this interaction, where the interaction region overlaps with the MMACHC-Cbl binding site. Together, our findings provide novel structural evidence and mechanistic insight into an essential biological process, whereby an intracellular \"trafficking chaperone\" highly specific for a trace element cofactor functions via protein-protein interaction, which is disrupted by inherited disease mutations.

They found that the C-terminal residues are very important for conversion of cobalamin into the MeCbl form, but less so for AdoCbl. Specifically, regions Arg197-Asp226 and Asp246-Leu259, shown by site directed mutagenesis and patient variants respectively, appear to be important for production of MeCbl but not AdoCbl and may represent protein interaction domain. Notably, regions previously shown to be important in interaction with cblC (based on phage display experiments) overlapped with the regions shown to be important in MeCbl production in this study. This suggests that interaction between MMACHC and MMADHC will target cobalamin to the cytosolic pathway, while MMACHC does not seem to be involved in the mitochondrial pathway (the protein does not localize to the mitochondria, and the mitochondrial leader sequence of MMADHC is not needed for interaction with MMACHC). Taken together, the results of these and previous studies indicate an important role for the targeting of Cbl towards the mitochondria by the N-terminus of MMADHC and distribution towards the cytosol governed by the C-terminus. This is consistent with the variable phenotypes seen in patients with variants in MMADHC (isolated MMA, isolated homocystinuria, or combined phenotype) based on the location and type of the variant in the protein.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24722857","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In humans vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) must be converted into two coenzyme forms, methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), in order to maintain intracellular homeostasis of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, respectively. Previously we have shown that in cblD patients three types of MMADHC mutations exist: 1) null mutations N-terminal to Met116 cause isolated methylmalonic aciduria (cblD-MMA) due to AdoCbl deficiency; 2) null mutations across the C-terminus (p.Y140-R250) cause combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria (cblD-MMA/HC) due to AdoCbl and MeCbl deficiency; 3) missense mutations in a conserved C-terminal region (p.D246-L259) cause isolated homocystinuria (cblD-HC) due to MeCbl deficiency. To better understand the domain boundaries related to MeCbl formation, we made selected point mutations and C-terminal truncations in MMADHC and tested rescue of MeCbl and AdoCbl synthesis in immortalized cblD-MMA/HC patient fibroblasts. Testing 20 mutations (15 missense and five C-terminal truncations) across p.P154-S287 revealed the presence of a region (p.R197-D226) responsible for MeCbl synthesis, which gave a similar cellular phenotype as cblD-HC. Further, mutation of the polypeptide stretch between the new and patient defined regions (p.D226-D246) and directly C-terminal to the patient region (p.L259-R266), gave cellular phenotypes intermediate to those of cblD-HC and cblD-MMA/HC. Finally, C-terminal truncation of more than 20 amino acids resulted in a cblD-MMA/HC like cellular phenotype, while truncation of between ten and 20 amino acids resulted in a cblD-HC like cellular phenotype. These data suggest that specific regions of MMADHC are involved in differential regulation of AdoCbl and MeCbl synthesis and help better define the boundaries of these regions.

This was supported by the observation that cblC-dependent dealkylation of MeCbl was not impaired in cblD cell lines. However, the subsequent partitioning of the cobalamin product to MeCbl versus AdoCbl was affected by the location of the variant in CblD. This was shown by studies of incorporation of  [57Co]-HOCbl into AdoCbl and MeCbl in fibroblasts from patients with either cblD-MMA or cblD-homocystinuria. The results suggested that the failure of the CblD protein to direct newly processed cobalamin into the biosynthesis of one of the cofactors leads to an overproduction of the other cofactor. Therefore, while CblD is not required for the activity of CblC per se, it seems to affect partitioning of the processed cobalamin product of CblC into the cytoplasmic (AdoCbl) and mitochondrial (MeCbl) pathways.

We have demonstrated that fibroblast cell lines from patients with mutations in CblD, can dealkylate exogenously supplied methylcobalamin (MeCbl), an activity catalyzed by the CblC protein, but show imbalanced intracellular partitioning of the cofactor into the MeCbl and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) pools. These results confirm that CblD functions downstream of CblC in the cofactor assimilation pathway and that it plays an important role in controlling the traffic of the cofactor between the competing cytoplasmic and mitochondrial routes for MeCbl and AdoCbl synthesis, respectively. In this study, we report the interaction of CblC with four CblD protein variants with variable N-terminal start sites. We demonstrate that a complex between CblC and CblD can be isolated particularly under conditions that permit dealkylation of alkylcobalamin by CblC or in the presence of the corresponding dealkylated and oxidized product, hydroxocobalamin (HOCbl). A weak CblC·CblD complex is also seen in the presence of cyanocobalamin. Formation of the CblC·CblD complex is observed with all four CblD variants tested suggesting that the N-terminal 115 residues missing in the shortest variant are not essential for this interaction. Furthermore, limited proteolysis of the CblD variants indicates the presence of a stable C-terminal domain spanning residues ∼116-296.

MMADHC is involved in the intracellular conversion of cobalamin to its two coenzymes, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) in mitochondria and methylcobalamin (MeCbl) in the cytoplasm, where it is involved in the metabolism of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine respectively. Dependent upon the type and location of the variant(s) within MMADHC, patients have either methylmalonic aciduria (MMA), homocystinuria (HC), or both (combined phenotype). For the purposes of this curation, these biochemical phenotypes were lumped together under an inborn disorder of cobalamin metabolism and transport. Of note, MMADHC has been reported to result in the cblD complementation group of cobalamin disorders. Biallelic variants in MMADHC were first reported in patients with cblD cobalamin disorder in 2008 (Coelho et al, 2008 PMID 18385497). Data from 11 probands who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for MMADHC variants were curated, including 14 unique variants (missense, inframe duplication, frameshift, nonsense, intronic) from three publications (Coelho et al, 2008, PMID 18385497; Miousse et al, 2009, PMID 19058814; Wang et al, 2018, PMID 30334532). More data is available in the literature but the maximum points for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nThe gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of MMADHC, which is consistent with the biochemical features in patients with MMADHC variants (Gherasim et al, 2013, PMID 23415655; Jusufi et al, 2014, PMID 24722857), interaction of the MMADHC gene product with that of MMACHC which also causes an inborn disorder of cobalamin metabolism and transport resulting in homocystinuria and methylmalonic aciduria (Plesa et al, 2011, PMID 21071249; Froese et al, 2015, PMID 26483544), functional alterations studies in which variants from patients with cblD disorder were expressed in cblD fibroblasts showing that the type and location of the variants correlates with the biochemical phenotype (Stucki et al, 2012, PMID 22156578) and rescue studies with wild type MMADHC (Coelho et al, PMID 18385497). In summary, MMADHC is definitively associated with an inborn disorder of cobalamin metabolism and transport. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 30, 2021.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:40ec59af-a143-4424-9218-7fd75deb6a61"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
