Zoospore motility is a critical component of the infection process because it allows zoospores to actively target suitable infection sites on potential hosts. Flagellar assembly and function in eukaryotes depends on a number of dynein-based molecular motors that facilitate retrograde intraflagellar transport and sliding of adjacent microtubule doublets in the flagellar axonemes. Dynein light chain 1 (DLC1) is one of a number of proteins in the dynein outer arm multiprotein complex. It is a 22 kDa leucine-rich repeat protein that binds to the catalytic motor domain of the dynein gamma heavy chain. We report the cloning and characterization of DLC1 homologues in Phytophthora cinnamomi and Phytophthora nicotianae (PcDLC1 and PnDLC1). PcDLC1 and PnDLC1 are single copy genes that are more highly expressed in sporulating hyphae than in vegetative hyphae, zoospores or germinated cysts. Polyclonal antibodies raised against PnDLC1 locallized PnDLC1 along the length of the flagella of P. nicotianae zoospores. RNAi-mediated silencing of PnDLC1 expression yielded transformants that released non-flagellate, non-motile zoospores from their sporangia. Our observations indicate that zoospore motility is not required for zoospore release from P. nicotianae sporangia or for breakage of the evanescent vesicle into which zoospores are initially discharged.","dc:creator":"Narayan RD","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Phytophthora nicotianae transformants lacking dynein light chain 1 produce non-flagellate zoospores."},"rdfs:label":"Phytophthora RNAi Silencing"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:54088550-2704-4c1b-ac1b-51b62353a223_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54088550-2704-4c1b-ac1b-51b62353a223_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.1},{"id":"cggv:7bb5c3e0-ef95-46fd-a21f-098d92f5da6a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7bb5c3e0-ef95-46fd-a21f-098d92f5da6a","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:a11e2a44-6306-420e-a5a7-52b932787b64","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031427.4(DNAL1):c.347A>T (p.Lys116Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7261475"}},{"id":"cggv:9b387fee-80b9-4cfb-85bd-47cc0288a2a6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031427.4(DNAL1):c.485G>A (p.Trp162Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA390334352"}}],"detectionMethod":"TruSight One Gene Panel","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:e938936b-2992-45ad-9a65-c61e3539098e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a11e2a44-6306-420e-a5a7-52b932787b64"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30300419","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder that mainly affects lungs. Dysfunction of respiratory cilia causes symptoms such as chronic rhinosinusitis, coughing, rhinitis, conductive hearing loss and recurrent lung infections with bronchiectasis. It is now well known that pathogenic genetic changes lead to ciliary dysfunction. Here we report usage of clinical-exome based NGS approach in order to reveal underlying genetic causes in cohort of 21 patient with diagnosis of PCD. By detecting 18 (12 novel) potentially pathogenic genetic variants, we established the genetic cause of 11 (9 unrelated) patients. Genetic variants were detected in six PCD disease-causing genes, as well as in SPAG16 and SPAG17 genes, that were not detected in PCD patients so far, but were related to some symptoms of PCD. The most frequently mutated gene in our cohort was DNAH5 (27.77%). Identified variants were in homozygous, compound heterozygous and trans-heterozygous state. For detailed characterization of one novel homozygous genetic variant in DNAI1 gene (c. 947_948insG, p. Thr318TyrfsTer11), RT-qPCR and Western Blot analysis were performed. Molecular diagnostic approach applied in this study enables analysis of 29 PCD disease-causing and related genes. It resulted in mutation detection rate of 50% and enabled discovery of twelve novel mutations and pointed two possible novel PCD candidate genes.","dc:creator":"Andjelkovic M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Genomic profiling supports the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia and reveals novel candidate genes and genetic variants."}},{"id":"cggv:2f1508cd-d841-4f60-ba51-6088c952eaab_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9b387fee-80b9-4cfb-85bd-47cc0288a2a6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30300419"}],"rdfs:label":"P1"},{"id":"cggv:2f1508cd-d841-4f60-ba51-6088c952eaab","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f1508cd-d841-4f60-ba51-6088c952eaab_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:e938936b-2992-45ad-9a65-c61e3539098e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e938936b-2992-45ad-9a65-c61e3539098e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:730ad7ad-e1bf-438a-be9e-dcc3dc5860ab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:730ad7ad-e1bf-438a-be9e-dcc3dc5860ab","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c128e347-5928-4088-a935-574614e71feb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031427.4(DNAL1):c.449A>G (p.Asn150Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342751"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001696","obo:HP_0002110","obo:HP_0000389","obo:HP_0002257"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:bd679b51-1176-4a8c-acd7-e12e862112ef_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c128e347-5928-4088-a935-574614e71feb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21496787","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), genetic defects affecting motility of cilia and flagella cause chronic destructive airway disease, randomization of left-right body asymmetry, and, frequently, male infertility. The most frequent defects involve outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs and IDAs) that are large multiprotein complexes responsible for cilia-beat generation and regulation, respectively. Although it has long been suspected that mutations in DNAL1 encoding the ODA light chain1 might cause PCD such mutations were not found. We demonstrate here that a homozygous point mutation in this gene is associated with PCD with absent or markedly shortened ODA. The mutation (NM_031427.3: c.449A>G; p.Asn150Ser) changes the Asn at position150, which is critical for the proper tight turn between the β strand and the α helix of the leucine-rich repeat in the hydrophobic face that connects to the dynein heavy chain. The mutation reduces the stability of the axonemal dynein light chain 1 and damages its interactions with dynein heavy chain and with tubulin.

PCD is a condition of impaired ciliary function characterized by neonates with respiratory distress, recurrent chest infections, cough and/or pneumonia. Heterotaxy is present with approximately 50% penetrance, most often in the form of situs inversus totalis. Immotile sperm and female infertility are also reported for some affected patients. *DNAL1* was evaluated for gene-disease association with PCD because it encodes the ortholog to *Chlamydomonas* axonemal dynein light chain 1, which is an outer dynein arm component that assists cilia movement (PMID: 21496787).\n\nAt the time of this review, at least eight probands with phenotypes consistent with PCD and variants in *DNAL1* consistent with an expected autosomal recessive inheritance pattern have been identified in the literature. Of these variants, 1 was reported to have variant level functional evidence and was identified as homozygous in the patient (PMID: 21496787, PMID: 30300419, PMID: 36841509, PMID: 33479112). Supporting experimental data have been reported from a study of the *Chlamydomonas* ortholog, in which RNAi-based silencing of the gene resulted in non-flagellate, non-motile zoospores (PMID: 20451645).\n\nIn summary, *DNAL1* has Limited association to primary ciliary dyskinesia 16, with additional case-level evidence required to reach a higher classification of the gene-disease relationship.
