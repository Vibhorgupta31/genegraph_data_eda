This study describes the results of the GALT gene analysis of four unrelated Filipino patients with Classic Galactosemia. DNA extracted from dried blood spots and peripheral blood of the patients, age one month to two and a half years, underwent PCR-amplification with subsequent bidirectional sequencing of all eleven exons with their flanking intronic regions following standard protocols. Clinical data of these patients were reviewed. The patients presented with jaundice, hepatomegaly, diarrhea, vomiting, poor feeding and seizures during their neonatal period. They were diagnosed with elevated blood galactose and galactose-1-phosphate and absent GALT activity. Four missense mutations were found wherein two were previously reported (p.V168L and p.A345D) and two were novel (p.L116P and p.M178R). The most frequent mutation in our cohort is p.V168L. This study suggests that GALT mutations are ethnic-specific and that galactosemia is a heterogeneous disorder at the molecular level. The importance of early detection, immediate and proper medical management and genetic counseling of the patients and their families cannot be overemphasized.

The coding region of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT; UDPglucose:alpha-D-galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.12) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from total cDNA of a classic galactosemic individual and was characterized by direct sequencing of the products. Two missense mutations were identified: (i) replacement of valine-44 by methionine and (ii) replacement of methionine-142 by lysine. These mutations led to a drastic reduction in GALT activity when individual mutant cDNAs were overexpressed in a mammalian cell system, although full-length protein is synthesized in this assay. The two galactosemia mutations account for 3 of the 15 galactosemia alleles analyzed. These results suggest that galactosemia is caused by a variety of mutations, which might be responsible for the observed clinical heterogeneity of this disorder. We also present the molecular characterization of two GALT polymorphisms: (i) replacement of leucine-62 by methionine and (ii) replacement of asparagine-314 by aspartate. It appears that galactosemia mutations tend to occur in regions that are highly conserved throughout evolution while the polymorphisms change variable residues.","dc:creator":"Reichardt JK","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Molecular basis of galactosemia: mutations and polymorphisms in the gene encoding human galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase."}},{"id":"cggv:3a4441ef-d54d-4281-9e1a-5990b4ff09d5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:22453310-44a5-4666-9e97-81c901fd268f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2011574"}],"rdfs:label":"GM2795"},{"id":"cggv:84eda592-6d78-4874-8119-a44d273d1279","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84eda592-6d78-4874-8119-a44d273d1279_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:84eda592-6d78-4874-8119-a44d273d1279_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transient transfection of COS cells with cDNA carrying the variant resulted in 0% normal activity (Table 1)."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Variants are not confirmed to be in trans."},{"id":"cggv:3a4441ef-d54d-4281-9e1a-5990b4ff09d5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a4441ef-d54d-4281-9e1a-5990b4ff09d5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3a4441ef-d54d-4281-9e1a-5990b4ff09d5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transient transfection of COS cells with cDNA carrying the variant resulted in 4% normal activity (Table 1)."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Variants are not confirmed to be in trans."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1d1a9b3e-5c2c-4f9d-a063-ed0823d5817d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d1a9b3e-5c2c-4f9d-a063-ed0823d5817d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5a2f79c7-3b63-45a7-a656-87e7da413820","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000155.4(GALT):c.855G>T (p.Lys285Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340107"}},"detectionMethod":"genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood, PCR of 11 exons and intronic boundaries of GALT, direct sequence analysis","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"At 2 days old: pathological hyperbilirubinemia; at 10 days: hepatopathy.

Treatment with dietary galactose restriction corrects these complications immediately; however, most of these children develop long-term complications of verbal dyspraxia, mental retardation and ovarian failure. Our previous molecular study showed that the most common mutation of the GALT gene is a missense mutation of Q188R (replacement of glutamine-188 by arginine) in approximately 60-65% of the German galactosaemic population. The coding region of GALT was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of classical galactosaemic individuals, who are negative or heterozygous for Q188R, and was further characterized by direct sequencing. Three new disease-causing mutations, two missense and a stop codon mutation, were identified in three patients from two families with mild galactosaemic variants: firstly R67C, replacement of arginine-67 by cysteine and W316X, the stop codon at tryptophan-316 in one male; secondly A330V, replacement of alanine-330 by valine in two female siblings. In the first family the patient was also heterozygous for the polymorphism N314D and in the second family both girls were compound heterozygotes for Q188R and A330V. All three galactosaemic individuals have a considerable amount of the residual GALT activity in RBC and the galactose-1-phosphate (GALP) level decreased much faster on treatment than that of other galactosaemic patients with missense mutations such as Q188R. The clinical and biochemical data of these patients were much more favourable in comparison with those of two female galactosaemic individuals, one homozygous for L195P and the other compound heterozygous for Q188R and L195P.

One novel missense mutation was an G-to-A transition in exon 8, resulting in the substitution of arginine by histidine at the codon 231 (R231H). GALT activity of the R231H mutant construct was reduced to 15% of normal controls in a COS cell expression system. The other was a splicing mutation, an A-to-G transition at the 38th nucleotide in exon 3 (318A-->G), resulting in a 38-bp deletion in the GALT cDNA by activating a cryptic splice acceptor site. In seven Japanese families (14 alleles for classic form and one allele for Duarte variant) with GALT deficiency, the R231H and 318A-->G mutations were found only on both alleles of the proband. The N314D and R333W mutations were found on one allele each. The Q188R was prevalent in the United States but not in Japanese patients. The N314D mutation was associated with the Duarte variant in Japanese persons, as well as in the United States. We speculate that classic galactosemia mutations appear to differ between Japanese and Caucasian patients. Our limited data set on galactosemia mutations in Japanese suggests that the N314D GALT mutation encoding the Duarte variant arose before Asian and Caucasian people diverged and that classic galactosemia mutations arose and/or accumulated after the divergence of Asian and Caucasian populations.","dc:creator":"Ashino J","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Molecular characterization of galactosemia (type 1) mutations in Japanese."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:8093757a-beba-4af7-a402-7e83aec4dab4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8093757a-beba-4af7-a402-7e83aec4dab4_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8093757a-beba-4af7-a402-7e83aec4dab4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Variant expressed in COS cells, dot-blot hybridization of serially diluted RNA from transfected cells showed WT GALT mRNA was expressed at 1.5x that of mutant GALT mRNA; mutant GALT activity was 15% of WT."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1df1b341-6e69-4a4f-829f-b9e10f8a5719_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1df1b341-6e69-4a4f-829f-b9e10f8a5719","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:85f3b292-5ac7-4540-9df0-905435fb4bbc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000155.4(GALT):c.974C>T (p.Pro325Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA259554"}},"detectionMethod":"GALT 11 exons and flanking intronic regions amplified via PCR, products directly sequenced","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Galactosemia detected via NBS, galactose-restricted diet started immediately after diagnosis, normal psychomotor development.","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"GALT activity = 1% - measured in patient's RBCs","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:9a5cbbc4-3a19-4ee5-a3c5-51ab8e742d48_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:85f3b292-5ac7-4540-9df0-905435fb4bbc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10573007","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We identified 14 mutations in 15 Japanese subjects from 13 families with galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequence analysis. These mutations accounted for 22 (96%) of 23 mutant alleles in 15 Japanese subjects. The mutational spectrum included nine missense mutations (M142V, G179D, A199T, R231H, W249R, N314D, P325L, R333Q, and R333W), two deletions (L275fsdelT and Q317fsdelC), a nonsense mutation (W249X), and two splicing mutations (V85-N97fsdel38bp and IVS4nt+1). Ten of the 14 mutations have not been reported in Caucasians. Differences in frequency and spectrum of GALT mutations suggest that the mutations may have occurred after racial divergence of Caucasians and Asians. The Duarte variant in Japanese was associated with the N314D mutation, g.1105G > C, g.1323G > A, and g.1391G > A (SacI -) polymorphisms, as in Caucasians. The Duarte variant may have occurred before racial divergence, and was an ancient mutation. In vitro GALT activities of nine missense mutations were determined by a COS cell expression system, and indicated between 1.3% and 35% of wild-type control. Patients with R333Q (29% in vitro GALT activity) or A199T (35%) showed mild clinical phenotypes, i.e. no ovarian failure or neurological deterioration.

First, we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine. The mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution (conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. The arginine 188 mutation is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date. It accounts for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied. Second, we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan, caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025. The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from E. coli, yeast, and humans, and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity, suggesting that this is a severe mutation. This second mutation appears to be rare, since it was found only in the patient we sequenced.

Cohorts of rats in the two older groups were weaned to diets containing either 1% or 3% of calories from galactose.

All treated rats showed dramatic metabolic rescue through 1Â month, and those weaned to the lower galactose diet showed continued strong metabolic rescue into adulthood (2Â months). Prepubertal growth delay and cataracts were both partially rescued by treatment. Finally, we found that UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP), which offers a metabolic bypass around missing GALT, was 3-fold more active in brain samples from adult rats than from young pups, offering a possible explanation for the improved ability of older GALT-null rats to metabolize galactose.

GALT encodes for galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, the second enzyme in the galactose metabolic pathway, also known as the Leloir pathway. \nGalactosemia can be classified into three categories based on the residual GALT activity. Patients with classic galactosemia patients have absent or barely detectable erythrocyte and hepatic GALT activity. These patients present with life-threatening complications including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage, bleeding, and E coli sepsis unless a lactose-restricted diet is implemented in the first ten days of life. Even on a lactose-restricted diet, affected children are at increased risk for developmental delays, speech problems, and cataracts, and almost all females with classic galactosemia manifest hypergonadatropic hypogonadism or premature ovarian insufficiency. Clinical variant galactosemia is associated with residual GALT activity in erythrocytes and liver (<15%) but also presents with life-threatening complications requiring lactose restriction. Biochemical variant galactosemia (also known as Duarte galactosemia) is typically clinically asymptomatic and there is discussion regarding whether lactose restriction in the first year of life is warranted (Fridovich-Keil, et al, 2020, PMID: 25473725). \nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by genetic and experimental evidence. Biallelic variants in GALT were first reported in individuals with galactosemia in 1991 (Reichardt and Woo, PMID: 2011574). Over 300 GALT variants causing galactosemia have been reported in humans, with a predominance of missense variants (Coelho et al, 2017, PMID: 28281081). This curation included 25 variants from 15 probands from 7 publications (Reichardt and Woo, 1991, PMID: 2011574; Reichardt et al, 1991, PMID: 1897530; Ashino et al, 1995, PMID: 7550229; Sommer et al, 1995, PMID: 8598637; Hirokawa et al, 1999, PMID: 10573007; Estrada et al, 2013, PMID: 24045215; RamadÅ¾a et al, 2018, PMID: 29252199). Several pathogenic variants are reported as common in various populations (Coelho et al, 2017, PMID 28281081; Berry, 2021, PMID: 20301691). Of note, one GALT pathogenic variant in trans with the GALT Duarte (D2; c.[940A>G;-119_116delGTCA]) variant or with the D2 allele in homozygosity, is associated with Duarte galactosemia ((Fridovich-Keil, et al, 2020, PMID: 25473725). More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of the gene product which is consistent with the phenotype in patients (Friedman et al, 1971, PMID: 167035; Timson et al, 2016, PMID: 26143117; Coelho et al, 2017, PMID: 28281081), studies on mutant yeast expressing various human GALT variants (Riehman et al, 2001, PMID: 11152465), biochemical studies on expression of the clinical and biochemical phenotype of a GALT null mouse (Tang et al, 2014, PMID: 24549051), and the impact of gene therapy on a the biochemical and clinical features of a rat model (Daenzer et al, 2022, PMID: 34964137).  Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \nIn summary, GALT is definitively associated with autosomal recessive galactosemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7c4b67f6-4084-48bc-9f71-536b23d45511"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
