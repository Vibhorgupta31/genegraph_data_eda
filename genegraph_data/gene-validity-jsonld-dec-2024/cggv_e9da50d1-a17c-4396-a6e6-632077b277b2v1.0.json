Additionally, families with left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and congenital heart disease (CHD), typically septal defects or Ebstein anomaly, have been identified to have heterozygous pathogenic variants in MHY7. One previous case of single ventricle CHD with heart failure due to a MYH7 variant has been identified. Herein, we present a single center's experience of complex CHD due to MYH7 variants. Three probands with a history of CHD, LVNC, and/or arrhythmias were identified to have MYH7 variants through multigene panel testing or exome sequencing. These three patients collectively had 12 affected family members, four with a history of Ebstein anomaly and seven with a history of LVNC. These findings suggest a wider phenotypic spectrum in MYH7-related CHD than previously understood. Further investigation into the possible role of MYH7 in CHD and mechanism of disease is necessary to fully delineate the phenotypic spectrum of MYH7-related cardiac disease. MYH7 should be considered for families with multiple individuals with complex CHD in the setting of a family history of LVNC or arrhythmias.","dc:creator":"Ritter A","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"MYH7 variants cause complex congenital heart disease."},"rdfs:label":"GTEx Expression data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e9da50d1-a17c-4396-a6e6-632077b277b2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.7}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":7997,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":1.2,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e1b490f0-7776-4a56-89a1-b9e097e6246c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:7577","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"MYH7 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2021 (Hirono et al.; PMID: 33309763). Three variants (missense, in-frame indel) that have been reported in three probands in three publications (PMID: 33309763, 35993536, 35491958) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (GTEx expression data). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
