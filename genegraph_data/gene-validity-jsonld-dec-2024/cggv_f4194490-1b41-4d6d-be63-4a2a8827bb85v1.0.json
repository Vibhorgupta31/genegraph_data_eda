Six different USH1 loci have been reported. So far, only MYO7A (USH1B), encoding myosin VIIA, has been identified as a gene whose mutation causes the disease. Here, we report a gene underlying USH1C (MIM 276904), a USH1 subtype described in a population of Acadian descendants from Louisiana and in a Lebanese family. We identified this gene (USH1C), encoding a PDZ-domain-containing protein, harmonin, in a subtracted mouse cDNA library derived from inner ear sensory areas. In patients we found a splice-site mutation, a frameshift mutation and the expansion of an intronic variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR). We showed that, in the mouse inner ear, only the sensory hair cells express harmonin. The inner ear Ush1c transcripts predicted several harmonin isoforms, some containing an additional coiled-coil domain and a proline- and serine-rich region. As several of these transcripts were absent from the eye, we propose that USH1C also underlies the DFNB18 form of isolated deafness.","dc:creator":"Verpy E","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"A defect in harmonin, a PDZ domain-containing protein expressed in the inner ear sensory hair cells, underlies Usher syndrome type 1C."},"rdfs:label":"Inner ear-specific expression of transcripts of harmonin"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f4194490-1b41-4d6d-be63-4a2a8827bb85_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:88b5fd79-6200-479b-8e87-6d2a436adf17","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:296d05fb-8c93-4a77-88b9-4ab00ed45c72","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The mouse model described has no retinal phenotype but exhibits hearing loss due to a deletion in the USH1C gene.

Both were shown to be mutations of the Ush1c gene, the mouse ortholog of the gene responsible for human Usher syndrome type IC and for the non-syndromic deafness disorder DFNB18. The Ush1c gene contains 28 exons, 20 that are constitutive and eight that are alternatively spliced. The dfcr mutation is a 12.8 kb intragenic deletion that eliminates three constitutive and five alternatively spliced exons. The dfcr-2J mutation is a 1 bp deletion in an alternatively spliced exon that creates a transcriptional frame shift, changing 38 amino acid codons before introducing a premature stop codon. Both mutations cause congenital deafness and severe balance deficits due to inner ear dysfunction. The stereocilia of cochlear hair cells are disorganized and splayed in mutant mice, with subsequent degeneration of the hair cells and spiral ganglion cells. Harmonin, the protein encoded by Ush1c, has been shown to bind, by means of its PDZ-domains, with the products of other Usher syndrome genes, including Myo7a, Cdh23 and Sans. The complexes formed by these protein interactions are thought to be essential for maintaining the integrity of hair cell stereocilia. The Ush1c mutant mice described here provide a means to directly investigate these interactions in vivo and to evaluate gene structure-function relationships that affect inner ear and eye phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Johnson KR","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mouse models of USH1C and DFNB18: phenotypic and molecular analyses of two new spontaneous mutations of the Ush1c gene."},"rdfs:label":"Spontaneous dfcr-2J from Jackson Laboratory"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:36fcea0d-0fff-42f8-9a62-4fc64be754a0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ed6662e-7d58-46c2-9d63-fb7d3172d165","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"It has been reported that the retina of 9 month old dfcr mice show some degeneration in their periphery (Johnson 2003), but this study found no degeneration  in the central or periphery at 12 months.
