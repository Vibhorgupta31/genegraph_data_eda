Here, we sought to identify genetic determinants for sigmoidal-HCM and hypothesized that Z-disc-HCM may be associated preferentially with a sigmoidal phenotype. Utilizing PCR, DHPLC, and direct DNA sequencing, we performed mutational analysis of five genes encoding cardiomyopathy-associated Z-disc proteins. The study cohort consisted of 239 unrelated patients with HCM previously determined to be negative for mutations in the eight genes associated with myofilament-HCM. Blinded to the Z-disc genotype status, the septal contour was graded qualitatively using standard transthoracic echocardiography. Thirteen of the 239 patients (5.4%) had one of 13 distinct HCM-associated Z-disc mutations involving residues highly conserved across species and absent in 600 reference alleles: LDB3 (6), ACTN2 (3), TCAP (1), CSRP3 (1), and VCL (2). For this subset with Z-disc-associated HCM, the septal contour was sigmoidal in 11 (85%) and apical in 2 (15%). While Z-disc-HCM is uncommon, it is equal in prevalence to thin filament-HCM. In contrast to myofilament-HCM, Z-disc-HCM is associated preferentially with sigmoidal morphology.","dc:creator":"Theis JL","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Echocardiographic-determined septal morphology in Z-disc hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6710e329-d391-4355-85a5-02d03f8791a3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6710e329-d391-4355-85a5-02d03f8791a3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8e24d07-d660-4f01-9f07-0d45a1b9b889","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48b1d3a6-e02b-43cf-9301-52e2ddf8229c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Northern blot analysis of adult mouse mRNA showed ACTN2 is highly expressed in heart muscle, and also in skeletal muscle, where it localizes to Z discs (Haywood et al, 2016, PMID  27287556).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1339456","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Conserved sequences of dystrophin, beta-spectrin, and alpha-actinin were used to plan a set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers with which we amplified a portion of a human alpha-actinin gene transcript.

As with other muscle-specific isoforms, the EF-hand domains in ACTN2 and ACTN3 are predicted to be incapable of binding calcium, suggesting that actin binding is not calcium sensitive. ACTN2 was mapped to human chromosome 1q42-q43 and ACTN3 to 11q13-q14 by somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescent in situ hybridization.

Increasing evidence suggests that MLP has an important role in both myogenic differentiation and myocyte cytoarchitecture, although the full spectrum of its intracellular roles has not been delineated. We report the discovery of an alternative splice variant of MLP, designated as MLP-b, showing distinct expression in neuromuscular disease and direct roles in actin dynamics and muscle differentiation. This novel isoform originates by alternative splicing of exons 3 and 4. At the protein level, it contains the N-terminus first half LIM domain of MLP and a unique sequence of 22 amino acids. Physiologically, it is expressed during early differentiation, whereas its overexpression reduces C2C12 differentiation and myotube formation. This may be mediated through its inhibition of MLP/cofilin-2-mediated F-actin dynamics. In differentiated striated muscles, MLP-b localizes to the sarcomeres and binds directly to Z-disc components, including Î±-actinin, T-cap and MLP.

The molecular mechanism that underlies the expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that cytoskeleton proteins can be involved in the regulation of cell surface expression and localization of several ion channels. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Na(v)1.5-associated proteins that may be involved in channel function and expression. We identified alpha-actinin-2 as an interacting partner of the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains III and IV of Na(v)1.5 (Na(v)1.5/LIII-IV). Co-immunoprecipitation and His(6) pull-down assays confirmed the physical association between Na(v)1.5 and alpha-actinin-2 and showed that the spectrin-like repeat domain is essential for binding of alpha-actinin-2 to Na(v)1.5. Patch-clamp studies revealed that the interaction with alpha-actinin-2 increases sodium channel density without changing their gating properties. Consistent with these findings, coexpression of alpha-actinin-2 and Na(v)1.5 in tsA201 cells led to an increase in the level of expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane as determined by cell surface biotinylation. Lastly, immunostaining experiments showed that alpha-actinin-2 was colocalized with Na(v)1.5 along the Z-lines and in the plasma membrane.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism underlying the disease entities. The cardiomyopathy reported in families carrying ACTN2 variants does not fit well into the classical categories of HCM or DCM. Individuals can show variable combinations of hypertrophy, dilatation, and hyper/hypocontractility, and the phenotype can vary between individuals in the same family. For clinical management, all the phenotypes are cardiovascular, and individuals should be monitored appropriately. Therefore, all disease entities have been lumped into one inclusive disease entity, intrinsic cardiomyopathy. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in congenital myopathy 8 (MIM: 618654) and myopathy, distal, 6, adult onset (MIM: 618655). These will be assessed separately.\n\nAt least 30 unique heterozygous variants (22 missense, 4 nonsense, 3 deletions, 1 frameshift) and one nonsense homozygous variant, with little to no experimental evidence to support their pathogenicity, have been reported in ACTN2 in humans. A majority of the points and compelling evidence for this curation came from null variants which ââappear to commonly present with hypertrabeculation in addition to the myocardial dysfunction. Although there are some null variants reported in other phenotypes, there is an enrichment of truncating variants in individuals with LVNC cardiomyopathy compared to controls (0.65% vs 0.01%, p=1.3E-06) (Mazzarotto et al, 2021, PMID 33500567). There have also been some reports of missense variants in this gene, including 4 variants with segregation data in families that have diverse cardiac phenotypes, and 3 variants with functional data. Of note, loss-of-function variants in ACTN2 are highly constrained, while there is a lack of constraint for missense variants. The mechanism for disease is not well-understood. Case-control studies have found no increased frequency of rare ACTN2 variants in individuals with typical HCM, suggesting that much of the observed variation may be benign (Walsh et al, 2017, PMIDs 27532257, 28082330). This gene-disease association is supported by the function of the protein (Bagnall et al, 2014, PMID 25224718), protein interaction with CSRP3 and SCN5A (Louis et al, 2007, PMID 9341203; Ziane et al, 2010, PMID 19943616; Vafiadaki et al, 2014, PMID 24860983), expression of the gene product (alpha actinin-2) in the heart (Beggs et al, 1992, 1339456; Haywood et al, 2016, PMID 27287556), functional alteration in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (Zech et al, 2022, PMID 36078153), a mouse model with a missense variant that displays a biochemical HCM-like phenotype (Broadway-Stringer et al, 2023, PMID 36899856), and DCM phenotype in a zebrafish model that is rescued by restoration of WT ACTN2 (Gupta et al, 2012, PMID 22253474). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between ACTN2 and intrinsic cardiomyopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. Based on curated literature, this gene can cause seemingly isolated left ventricular hypertrophy. This classification of ACTN2 for intrinsic cardiomyopathy (HCM and DCM) was originally approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 10, 2018. It was reevaluated on May 10, 2023 and expanded to include LVNC, RCM, and ACM. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from moderate to definitive due to new evidence in the literature.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6710e329-d391-4355-85a5-02d03f8791a3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
