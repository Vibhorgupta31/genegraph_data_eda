A heterozygous HOXA11 mutation has been identified in two unrelated families as a cause of RUSAT. However, HOXA11 mutations are absent in a number of individuals with RUSAT, which suggests that other genetic loci contribute to RUSAT. In the current study, we performed whole exome sequencing in an individual with RUSAT and her healthy parents and identified a de novo missense mutation in MECOM, encoding EVI1, in the individual with RUSAT. Subsequent analysis of MECOM in two other individuals with RUSAT revealed two additional missense mutations. These three mutations were clustered within the 8(th) zinc finger motif of the C-terminal zinc finger domain of EVI1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR assays of the regions harboring the ETS-like motif that is known as an EVI1 binding site showed a reduction in immunoprecipitated DNA for two EVI1 mutants compared with wild-type EVI1. Furthermore, reporter assays showed that MECOM mutations led to alterations in both AP-1- and TGF-Î²-mediated transcriptional responses. These functional assays suggest that transcriptional dysregulation by mutant EVI1 could be associated with the development of RUSAT. We report missense mutations in MECOM resulting in a Mendelian disorder that provide compelling evidence for the critical role of EVI1 in normal hematopoiesis and in the development of forelimbs and fingers in humans.","dc:creator":"Niihori T","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Mutations in MECOM, Encoding Oncoprotein EVI1, Cause Radioulnar Synostosis with Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1d25a48-f664-49c6-8ea4-dfddd0651209_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1d25a48-f664-49c6-8ea4-dfddd0651209_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb3462ba-d08a-4169-b01f-223bd2ce0734","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89a8fb41-8f93-42cd-860d-9d029033087c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Evi1 expression marks in vivo long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in adult bone marrow, consistent with the bone marrow failure seen in patients.

Here, we generate reporter mice in which an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-GFP cassette is knocked-in to the Evi1 locus. Using these mice, we find that Evi1 is predominantly expressed in long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) in adult bone marrow, and in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor fraction in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros, placenta, and fetal liver of embryos. In both fetal and adult hematopoietic systems, Evi1 expression marks cells with long-term multilineage repopulating activity. When combined with conventional HSC surface markers, sorting according to Evi1 expression markedly enhances purification of cells with HSC activity. Evi1 heterozygosity leads to marked impairment of the self-renewal capacity of LT-HSCs, whereas overexpression of Evi1 suppresses differentiation and boosts self-renewal activity. Reintroduction of Evi1, but not Mds1-Evi1, rescues the HSC defects caused by Evi1 heterozygosity. Thus, in addition to documenting a specific relationship between Evi1 expression and HSC self-renewal activity, these findings highlight the utility of Evi1-IRES-GFP reporter mice for the identification and sorting of functional HSCs.","dc:creator":"Kataoka K","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Evi1 is essential for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, and its expression marks hematopoietic cells with long-term multilineage repopulating activity."},"rdfs:label":"HSC expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":" "},{"id":"cggv:e82f5be9-a148-49e4-9737-43b60e49cc7a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:306385a4-78b8-41ce-8e81-db60dce6c5f9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Northern analysis in mouse tissues found that Evi1 was expressed in specific structures of the developing urogenital system, in the developing lung and heart, and, in a transient manner, in the emerging limb buds.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1893871","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Evi-1 is a putative protooncogene first identified as a common site of retroviral integration in murine myeloid leukemias.

These features suggest that Evi-1 encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein. In Drosophila, zinc-finger proteins such as Kruppel are involved in body plan patterning, and exhibit a spatially restricted pattern of expression in the embryo. To determine if Evi-1 may be involved in morphogenetic processes in the mouse embryo, we have performed in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis on embryonic and adult mouse tissues to delineate the spatial and temporal pattern of Evi-1 expression. Our results show that Evi-1 is expressed at high levels in a few tissues in the embryo and is widely expressed, albeit at generally low levels, in the adult. Regions that exhibit high-level expression in the embryo include: the urinary system and the Mullerian ducts; the bronchial epithelium of the lung; focal areas within the nasal cavities; the endocardial cushions and truncus swellings in the heart; and the developing limbs.

We identified an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced dominant mouse mutant Junbo with hearing loss due to chronic suppurative OM and otorrhea. This develops from acute OM that arises spontaneously in the postnatal period, with the age of onset and early severity dependent on the microbiological status of the mice and their air quality. We have identified the causal mutation, a missense change in the C-terminal zinc finger region of the transcription factor Evi1. This protein is expressed in middle ear basal epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and neutrophil leukocytes at postnatal day 13 and 21 when inflammatory changes are underway.

Overexpression of Evi1 has been observed in a number of myeloid disorders and is associated with poor patient survival. It is also amplified and/or overexpressed in many epithelial cancers including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, ependymomas, and lung and colorectal cancers. Two murine knockout models have also demonstrated Evi1's critical role in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell renewal with its absence resulting in the death of mutant embryos due to hematopoietic failure. Here we characterize a novel mouse model (designated Evi1(fl3)) in which Evi1 exon 3, which carries the ATG start, is flanked by loxP sites. Unexpectedly, we found that germline deletion of exon3 produces a hypomorphic allele due to the use of an alternative ATG start site located in exon 4, resulting in a minor Evi1 N-terminal truncation and a block in expression of the Mds1-Evi1 fusion transcript. Evi1(Î´ex3/Î´ex3) mutant embryos showed only a mild non-lethal hematopoietic phenotype and bone marrow failure was only observed in adult Vav-iCre/+, Evi1(fl3/fl3) mice in which exon 3 was specifically deleted in the hematopoietic system. Evi1(Î´ex3/Î´ex3) knockout pups are born in normal numbers but die during the perinatal period from congenital heart defects. Database searches identified 143 genes with similar mutant heart phenotypes as those observed in Evi1(Î´ex3/Î´ex3) mutant pups. Interestingly, 42 of these congenital heart defect genes contain known Evi1-binding sites, and expression of 18 of these genes are also effected by Evi1 siRNA knockdown. These results show a potential functional involvement of Evi1 target genes in heart development and indicate that Evi1 is part of a transcriptional program that regulates cardiac development in addition to the development of blood.

The clinical picture can also include clinodactyly, cardiac and renal malformations, B-cell deficiency, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and presenile hearing loss. MECOM codes for a zinc finger transcription factor with important roles in normal development and oncogenesis. The MECOM locus encodes a number of differentially spliced transcripts yielding the MDS1, MDS1-EVI1, and EVI1 protein isoforms. At least 10 missense variants and 5 predicted null variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 26581901, 29519864, 29540340, 29097497). The mechanism for disease may be haploinsufficiency.
