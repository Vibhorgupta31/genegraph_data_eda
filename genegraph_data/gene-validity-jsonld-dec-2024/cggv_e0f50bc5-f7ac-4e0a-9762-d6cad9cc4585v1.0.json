This enzyme has been proposed to regulate the timing of quality control glycoprotein degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Human expressed sequence tag clones were identified by sequence similarity to mammalian and yeast oligosaccharide-processing mannosidases, and the full-length coding region of the putative mannosidase homolog was isolated by a combination of 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and direct polymerase chain reaction from human placental cDNA. The open reading frame predicted a 663-amino acid type II transmembrane polypeptide with a short cytoplasmic tail (47 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (22 amino acids), and a large COOH-terminal catalytic domain (594 amino acids). Northern blots detected a transcript of approximately 2.8 kilobase pairs that was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Expression of an epitope-tagged full-length form of the human mannosidase homolog in normal rat kidney cells resulted in an ER pattern of localization. When a recombinant protein, consisting of protein A fused to the COOH-terminal luminal domain of the human mannosidase homolog, was expressed in COS cells, the fusion protein was found to cleave only a single alpha1,2-mannose residue from Man(9)GlcNAc(2) to produce a unique Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomer (Man8B). The mannose cleavage reaction required divalent cations as indicated by inhibition with EDTA or EGTA and reversal of the inhibition by the addition of Ca(2+). The enzyme was also sensitive to inhibition by deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine, but not swainsonine. The results on the localization, substrate specificity, and inhibitor profiles indicate that the cDNA reported here encodes an enzyme previously designated ER mannosidase I. Enzyme reactions using a combination of human ER mannosidase I and recombinant Golgi mannosidase IA indicated that that these two enzymes are complementary in their cleavage of Man(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharides to Man(5)GlcNAc(2).","dc:creator":"Gonzalez DS","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Identification, expression, and characterization of a cDNA encoding human endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I, the enzyme that catalyzes the first mannose trimming step in mammalian Asn-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis."},"rdfs:label":"Recombinant human mannosidase expression in COS cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e0f50bc5-f7ac-4e0a-9762-d6cad9cc4585_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e025ded2-f849-4fd5-aa88-0da3785ac269","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:455adec5-2529-4b2c-98f8-da714f0df54d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"startle reflex is a neurological phenotype, hence similar to the neurological phenotype seen for MAN1B1","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10409699","rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Since there is no published literature available on the mouse model and only one neurological phenotype is significant for the model, it was scored as 0.5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:e0f50bc5-f7ac-4e0a-9762-d6cad9cc4585_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0f50bc5-f7ac-4e0a-9762-d6cad9cc4585_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:889cb6ef-2428-4388-a623-c3bc9d6c8953_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e53b1f66-693c-48a3-b4b1-ce3536a13cdd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells or\nfibroblasts from the patients and controls.

All individuals presented slight facial dysmorphism, psychomotor retardation and truncal obesity. Generally, MAN1B1 is believed to be an ER resident alpha-1,2-mannosidase acting as a key factor in glycoprotein quality control by targeting misfolded proteins for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). However, recent studies indicated a Golgi localization of the endogenous MAN1B1, suggesting a more complex role for MAN1B1 in quality control. We were able to confirm that MAN1B1 is indeed localized to the Golgi complex instead of the ER. Furthermore, we observed an altered Golgi morphology in all patients' cells, with marked dilatation and fragmentation. We hypothesize that part of the phenotype is associated to this Golgi disruption. In conclusion, we linked mutations in MAN1B1 to a Golgi glycosylation disorder. Additionally, our results support the recent findings on MAN1B1 localization. However, more work is needed to pinpoint the exact function of MAN1B1 in glycoprotein quality control, and to understand the pathophysiology of its deficiency.

The molecular basis of the majority of the congenital disorders of glycosylation type I subtypes, localized in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, has been solved. However, elucidation of causative genes for defective Golgi glycosylation (congenital disorders of glycosylation type II) remains challenging because of a lack of sufficiently specific diagnostic serum methods. In a single patient with intellectual disability, whole-exome sequencing revealed MAN1B1 as congenital disorder of glycosylation type II candidate gene. A novel mass spectrometry method was applied for high-resolution glycoprofiling of intact plasma transferrin. A highly characteristic glycosylation signature was observed with hybrid type N-glycans, in agreement with deficient mannosidase activity. The speed and robustness of the method allowed subsequent screening in a cohort of 100 patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation type II, which revealed the characteristic glycosylation profile of MAN1B1-congenital disorder of glycosylation in 11 additional patients. Abnormal hybrid type N-glycans were also observed in the glycoprofiles of total serum proteins, of enriched immunoglobulins and of alpha1-antitrypsin in variable amounts. Sanger sequencing revealed MAN1B1 mutations in all patients, including severe truncating mutations and amino acid substitutions in the alpha-mannosidase catalytic site. Clinically, this group of patients was characterized by intellectual disability and delayed motor and speech development. In addition, variable dysmorphic features were noted, with truncal obesity and macrocephaly in âˆ¼65% of patients. In summary, MAN1B1 deficiency appeared to be a frequent cause in our cohort of patients with unsolved congenital disorder of glycosylation type II. Our method for analysis of intact transferrin provides a rapid test to detect MAN1B1-deficient patients within congenital disorder of glycosylation type II cohorts and can be used as efficient diagnostic method to identify MAN1B1-deficient patients in intellectual disability cohorts. In addition, it provides a functional confirmation of MAN1B1 mutations as identified by next-generation sequencing in individuals with intellectual disability.

It is shown to be Golgi localized and is an enzyme involved in the maturation of N-linked glycans in the secretory pathway [PMIDs: 21697506, 24627495, 24348268]. Bi-allelic variants in MAN1B1 are reported in individuals characterized by syndromic intellectual disability and biochemical glycosylation defects [PMIDs: 20345473, 24348268, 24566669, 26279649, 28940310, 29908352, 30221345, 30776362]. Serum isoelectric focusing assay shows a CDG type II N-glycosylation defect in samples from these affected individuals. Hence, this curation is for MAN1B1 associated autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation (MAN1B1-CDG). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. There are about ~35 affected individuals from ~21 families reported in the published literature, comprising mostly of consanguineous families [PMIDs: 20345473, 24348268, 24566669, 30221345, 28940310, 29908352, 30776362]. The MAN1B1 variants seen in affected individuals include nonsense, frameshift and missense changes. Many of these variants are shown to either result in reduced enzyme activity and expression levels, distinct structure of N-linked glycans on serum glycoproteins when compared to controls using mass spectrometry and aberrant Golgi morphology in fibroblasts from affected individuals [PMIDs: 21763484, 24348268, 24566669]. In regards to experimental data, biochemical function and an animal model support this gene-disease association [PMIDs: 10409699, 10521544, 10995765, 18003979; https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2684954].
