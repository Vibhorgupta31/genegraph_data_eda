This cohesion depends on a complex of proteins called cohesins. In budding yeast, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) pathway initiates anaphase by removing cohesins from chromosomes. In vertebrates, cohesins dissociate from chromosomes already in prophase. To study their mitotic regulation we have purified two 14S cohesin complexes from human cells. Both complexes contain SMC1, SMC3, SCC1, and either one of the yeast Scc3p orthologs SA1 and SA2. SA1 is also a subunit of 14S cohesin in Xenopus. These complexes interact with PDS5, a protein whose fungal orthologs have been implicated in chromosome cohesion, condensation, and recombination. The bulk of SA1- and SA2-containing complexes and PDS5 are chromatin-associated until they become soluble from prophase to telophase. Reconstitution of this process in mitotic Xenopus extracts shows that cohesin dissociation does neither depend on cyclin B proteolysis nor on the presence of the APC. Cohesins can also dissociate from chromatin in the absence of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity. These results suggest that vertebrate cohesins are regulated by a novel prophase pathway which is distinct from the APC pathway that controls cohesins in yeast.","dc:creator":"Sumara I","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Characterization of vertebrate cohesin complexes and their regulation in prophase."},"rdfs:label":"Purification of human cohesin complexes."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c281f5fd-d868-4425-a7b4-8e39e3b2090e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9e724ce-247a-4639-90bd-5bdb671e4fea","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9d25e82a-34fe-4c65-8df1-1e3d779b927a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In order to detect possible subtle differences in the DNAbinding\nproperties, we titrated the mutant dimers into the\nbinding reaction (Fig. 1A–E).

Mutations in the sister chromatid cohesion factor genes NIPBL, SMC1A and SMC3 are present in approximately 65% of CdLS patients. In addition to their canonical roles in chromosome segregation, the cohesin proteins are involved in other biological processes such as regulation of gene expression, DNA repair and maintenance of genome stability. To gain insights into the molecular basis of CdLS, we analyzed the affinity of mutated SMC1A and SMC3 hinge domains for DNA. Mutated hinge dimers bind DNA with higher affinity than wild-type proteins. SMC1A- and SMC3-mutated CdLS cell lines display genomic instability and sensitivity to ionizing radiation and interstrand crosslinking agents. We propose that SMC1A and SMC3 CdLS mutations affect the dynamic association between SMC proteins and DNA, providing new clues to the underlying molecular cause of CdLS.","dc:creator":"Revenkova E","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome mutations in SMC1A or SMC3 affect binding to DNA."},"rdfs:label":"Relative efficiency of DNA binding"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:58c3e8ad-9415-4762-89a9-83e381c6d0a2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac44833f-3764-48b1-95a1-74640da5bec4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"CdLS cell lines were analyzed for spontaneous chromosome\naberrations and the results are reported in Figure 3.

Variants in SMC1A  have been reported in humans as early as 1995 (7757075, 7757074, 7757076). This disease association was made using case-level data and experimental data. At least 20 missense, 1 splicing, and 5 small deletions have been reported in humans. Variants have been found in at least 28 probands in 5 publications (28166369, 26752331, 24124034, 1660407, 19701948). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by patient cells functional alteration and protein interactions. In summary, SMC1A is definitively associated with X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
