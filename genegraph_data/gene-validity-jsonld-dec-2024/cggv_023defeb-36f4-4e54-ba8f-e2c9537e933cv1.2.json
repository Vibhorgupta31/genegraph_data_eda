Defects in cobalamin metabolism lead to disorders characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine in blood and urine. The most common inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, cblC type, is caused by mutations in MMACHC. However, several individuals with presumed cblC based on cellular and biochemical analysis do not have mutations in MMACHC. We used exome sequencing to identify the genetic basis of an X-linked form of combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, designated cblX. A missense mutation in a global transcriptional coregulator, HCFC1, was identified in the index case. Additional male subjects were ascertained through two international diagnostic laboratories, and 13/17 had one of five distinct missense mutations affecting three highly conserved amino acids within the HCFC1 kelch domain. A common phenotype of severe neurological symptoms including intractable epilepsy and profound neurocognitive impairment, along with variable biochemical manifestations, was observed in all affected subjects compared to individuals with early-onset cblC. The severe reduction in MMACHC mRNA and protein within subject fibroblast lines suggested a role for HCFC1 in transcriptional regulation of MMACHC, which was further supported by the identification of consensus HCFC1 binding sites in MMACHC. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HCFC1 expression resulted in the coordinate downregulation of MMACHC mRNA. This X-linked disorder demonstrates a distinct disease mechanism by which transcriptional dysregulation leads to an inborn error of metabolism with a complex clinical phenotype.

Here, we extend our previous HCFC1 over-expression studies by employing short hairpin RNA to reduce the expression of Hcfc1 in embryonic neural cells. We show that in contrast to over-expression, loss of Hcfc1 favoured proliferation of neural progenitor cells at the expense of differentiation and promoted axonal growth of post-mitotic neurons. To further support the involvement of HCFC1 in neurological disorders, we report two novel HCFC1 missense variants found in individuals with intellectual disability (ID). One of these variants, together with three previously reported HCFC1 missense variants of unknown pathogenicity, were functionally assessed using multiple cell-based assays. We show that three out of the four variants tested result in a partial loss of HCFC1 function. While over-expression of the wild-type HCFC1 caused reduction in HEK293T cell proliferation and axonal growth of neurons, these effects were alleviated upon over-expression of three of the four HCFC1 variants tested. One of these partial loss-of-function variants disrupted a nuclear localization sequence and the resulting protein displayed reduced ability to localize to the cell nucleus. The other two variants displayed negative effects on the expression of the HCFC1 target gene MMACHC, which is responsible for the metabolism of cobalamin, suggesting that these individuals may also be susceptible to cobalamin deficiency.

This study offers further support for mutations of HCFC1 being implicated in XLID and microcephaly, but that these are not necessarily associated with cobalamin disorder.","dc:creator":"Koufaris C","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"A novel "}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26893841","rdfs:label":"Koufaris 2016: 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The variant identified in both the siblings (p.Ala897Val) is located within the GA‑binding protein (GABP) interaction domain.

HCF-1 is a conserved metazoan transcriptional co-regulator long implicated in cell proliferation and more recently in human metabolic disorders and mental retardation. Loss of HCF-1 in a subset of ventral telencephalic Nkx2.1-positive progenitors leads to reduced numbers of GABAergic interneurons and glia, owing not to decreased proliferation but rather to increased apoptosis before cell migration. The loss of these cells leads to development of severe commissural and cortical defects in early postnatal mouse brains. These defects include mild and severe structural defects of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, respectively, and increased folding of the cortex resembling polymicrogyria.

HCFC1 is a transcriptional co-regulator that modulates the expression of numerous downstream target genes including MMACHC, but it is not clear how these HCFC1 targets play a role in the clinical manifestations of cblX. To begin to elucidate the mechanism by which HCFC1 modulates disease phenotypes, we have carried out loss of function analyses in the developing zebrafish. Of the two HCFC1 orthologs in zebrafish, hcfc1a and hcfc1b, the loss of hcfc1b specifically results in defects in craniofacial development. Subsequent analysis revealed that hcfc1b regulates cranial neural crest cell differentiation and proliferation within the posterior pharyngeal arches. Further, the hcfc1b-mediated craniofacial abnormalities were rescued by expression of human MMACHC, a downstream target of HCFC1 that is aberrantly expressed in cblX. Furthermore, we tested distinct human HCFC1 mutations for their role in craniofacial development and demonstrated variable effects on MMACHC expression in humans and craniofacial development in zebrafish. Notably, several individuals with mutations in either HCFC1 or MMACHC have been reported to have mild to moderate facial dysmorphia. Thus, our data demonstrates that HCFC1 plays a role in craniofacial development, which is in part mediated through the regulation of MMACHC expression.

Knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 1). While hcfc1a morphants did not exhibit any craniofacial abnormalities, hcfc1b morphants at 5 dpf resulted in a shortening of Meckel’s cartilage, inversion of the ceratohyal, and a complete loss of the ceratobranchial arches (Figure 2B). Approximately 60% of the embryos injected with hcfc1b MO presented with a craniofacial phenotype. Rescue experiments with in vitro synthesized human HCFC1 mRNA were performed by co-injection of hcfc1b MO with HCFC1 mRNA. The hcfc1b-mediated craniofacial phenotype was rescued (Figure 2D and 2D’ and Supplementary Table 1) showing that the human protein can substitute for the zebrafish protein. An appropriate rescue included an appropriately formed meckel’s cartilage, the appropriate directionality of the ceratohyal, and the formation of ceratobranchial arches. \nReal time PCR was used to examine if loss of hcfc1b resulted in reduced mmachc expression. hcfc1b MO demonstrated significantly reduced levels of mmachc mRNA at 1 dpf to approximately 10% of the normal levels (Figure 6). The hcfc1a MO also reduced mmachc mRNA levels, but only by about 40% of normal (Figure 6). Simultaneous knockdown of hcfc1a and hcfc1b reduced mmachc mRNA levels more than the individual knockdowns (Figure 6), indicating that both hcfc1a and hcfc1b promote mmachc expression. Further, co-injection of human MMACHC  efficiently rescued the craniofacial defects resulting from hcfc1b knockdown (Figure 7E-E’).

HCFC1 was first reported in relation to X-linked intellectual disability (ID) in 2012 (PMID: 23000143). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Cases from twenty-one families were curated; most of the identified HCFC1 variants are missense changes, with 9 missense variants, one 5’UTR variant, and one splice variant resulting in an in-frame exonic deletion reported (PMIDs: 23000143, 24011988, 25740848, 26893841, 28363510, and 33517344). Most individuals inherited the HCFC1 variant from an unaffected mother, with only one de novo case scored. Most reported cases were males but mildly affected females have been described in one family with a splice variant (PMID: 33517344). Affected males present with either methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, type cblX, a severe metabolic disorder associated with ID; or with ID with mild or absent metabolic abnormalities. There is a tentative genotype-phenotype correlation in which the metabolic form is associated with HCFC1 missense variants in the conserved kelch domain and the non-metabolic phenotype is associated with HCFC1 variants outside the kelch domain, in domains important for protein interactions, heterodimerization, and nuclear localization (PMID: 33517344). This gene-disease association is supported by functional alteration in both non-patient and patient cells, demonstrating that HCFC1 binds to the MMACHC promoter, which may underlie the metabolic phenotype in severely affected patients (PMIDs: 24011988, 25281006). A zebrafish knockdown model results in craniofacial defects that can be rescued by co-injection of human HCFC1 or MMACHC (PMID: 25281006). Conditional knockout of HCFC1 in the ventral telencephalon in mouse showed reduced Nkx2.1-derived neurons and glia due to increased cell death, defects of the anterior commissure and corpus callosum, and alteration in cortical lamination (PMID: 31207118). In summary, HCFC1 is definitively associated with X-linked ID. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Please note, due to a known issue in which the Gene Curation Interface is capping the total number of points allotted for missense variants at 7 points (not yet reflective of the change in scoring in SOP version 8), the total number of points for genetic evidence is not reflecting the true amount, which is the maximum of 12 points. This curation was approved by the ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 3/17/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:023defeb-36f4-4e54-ba8f-e2c9537e933c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
