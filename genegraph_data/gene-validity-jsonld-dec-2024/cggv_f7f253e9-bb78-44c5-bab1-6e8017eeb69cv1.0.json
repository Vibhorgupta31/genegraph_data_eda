We evaluated the association between 19 polymorphisms in seven genes in this pathway (XRCC2, XRCC3, BRCA2, ZNF350, BRIP1, XRCC4, LIG4) and breast cancer risk in two population-based studies in USA (3,368 cases and 2,880 controls) and Poland (1,995 cases and 2,296 controls). These data suggested weak associations with breast cancer risk for XRCC3 T241M and IVS7-14A>G (pooled odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.18 (1.04-1.34) and 0.85 (0.73-0.98) for homozygous variant vs wild-type genotypes, respectively), and for an uncommon variant in ZNF350 S472P (1.24 (1.05-1.48)), with no evidence for study heterogeneity. The remaining variants examined had no significant relationships to breast cancer risk. Meta-analyses of studies in Caucasian populations, including ours, provided some support for a weak association for homozygous variants for XRCC3 T241M (1.16 (1.04-1.30); total of 10,979 cases and 10,423 controls) and BRCA2 N372H (1.13 (1.10-1.28); total of 13,032 cases and 13,314 controls), and no support for XRCC2 R188H (1.06 (0.59-1.91); total of 8,394 cases and 8,404 controls). In conclusion, the genetic variants evaluated are unlikely to have a substantial overall association with breast cancer risk; however, weak associations are possible for XRCC3 (T241M and IVS7-14A>G), BRCA2 N372H, and ZNF350 S472P.

We studied 1,018 women with a strong family history for breast cancer (families with hereditary breast cancer; HBC) from genetically homogenous population of Poland, which is populated by ethnic Slavs, for mutations in 14 cancer susceptibility genes. Additionally, we compared the frequency of candidate pathogenic variants in breast cancer cases and controls. Germline mutations were detected in 512 of 1,018 probands with breast cancer (50.3%), including BRCA1/2 mutations detected in 420 families and non-BRCA mutations seen in 92 families. Thirteen BRCA1/2 founder mutations represented 84% of all BRCA1/2-positive cases. Seven founder mutations of CHEK2, PALB2, NBN and RECQL represented 73% of all non-BRCA-positive cases. Odds ratios for hereditary breast cancer were 87.6 for BRCA1, 15.4 for PALB2, 7.2 for CHEK2, 2.8 for NBN and 15.8 for RECQL. Odds ratios for XRCC2, BLM and BARD1 were below 1.3. In summary, we found that 20 founder mutations in six genes (BRCA1/2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN and RECQL) are responsible for 82% of Polish hereditary breast cancer families. A simple test for these 20 mutations will facilitate genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility in Poland. It may also facilitate genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility in other Slavic populations and women of Slavic descent worldwide.","dc:creator":"Cybulski C","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"The spectrum of mutations predisposing to familial breast cancer in Poland."},"rdfs:label":"XRCC2 Cybulski Ethnic Slavs Poland"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:46cb5d97-0f88-4120-9d44-dc1d5652b92e","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Contradicts","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46cb5d97-0f88-4120-9d44-dc1d5652b92e_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","caseCohort":{"id":"cggv:a8fd348f-bdb7-4c12-af9d-5fb42c354a2d","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":952,"alleleFrequency":0.007352941176470588,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46cb5d97-0f88-4120-9d44-dc1d5652b92e_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":7,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0007254"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"cggv:5e2192f8-674f-4945-8694-6fb3d80afd21","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":1237,"alleleFrequency":0.004850444624090542,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46cb5d97-0f88-4120-9d44-dc1d5652b92e_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":6},"lowerConfidenceLimit":0.49,"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.3,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.46,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":4.42,"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578164","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genetic polymorphisms in double-strand break repair genes may influence DNA repair capacity and, in turn, confer predisposition to breast cancer.

Frequencies of spontaneous chromosomal aberration have previously been reported to be higher in these two cell lines than in parental, wild-type cell lines. Microcell-mediated chromosome transfer was used to introduce complementing or non-complementing human chromosomes into each cell line. irs1 cells received human chromosome 7 (which contains the human XRCC2 gene) or, as a control, human chromosome 4. irs1SF cells received human chromosome 14 (which contains the XRCC3 gene) or human chromosome 7. For each set of hybrid cell lines, clones carrying the complementing human chromosome recovered MMC resistance to near-wild-type levels, while control clones carrying noncomplementing chromosomes remained sensitive to MMC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a human-specific probe revealed that the human chromosome in complemented clones remained intact in almost all cells even after extended passage. However, the human chromosome in noncomplemented clones frequently underwent chromosome rearrangements including breaks, deletions, and translocations. Chromosome aberrations accumulated slowly in the noncomplemented clones over subsequent passages, with some particular deletions and unbalanced translocations persistently transmitted throughout individual subclones.

Xrcc2(-/-) embryos surviving until later stages of embryogenesis commonly showed developmental abnormalities and died at birth. Neonatal lethality, apparently due to respiratory failure, was associated with a high frequency of apoptotic death of post- mitotic neurons in the developing brain, leading to abnormal cortical structure. Embryonic cells showed genetic instability, revealed by a high level of chromosomal aberrations, and were sensitive to gamma-rays.

It forms the BCDX2 complex with RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D, and is required for HR repair.  There are 3 exons that make up the protein, and there is a G to A transition located in exon 3 that results in a substitution of histidine (His) by arginine (Arg), known as R188H (Arg188His, rs3218536).  This polymorphism has been widely investigated to explore its potential impact on cancer susceptibility. Biallelic XRCC2 mutations are associated with Fanconi anemia, complementation group U, Premature ovarian failure, and Spermatogenic failure. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we only focus on hereditary breast cancer (refute the association with breast cancer) in this curation. Evidence refuting this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data, while experimental data supports the role of XRCC2 in DNA repair. \n \n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 POINTS**\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 11 case-control studies at the aggregate variant level. In 2021, two large case-control studies [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) and BCAC (PMID: 33471991); both with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in XRCC2 and breast cancer. Nine other case-control studies, with smaller populations ranging from 150 to 13078, likewise, did not show any association of LOF variants with breast cancer. Various populations were involved, including Pakistani (PMID: 25556451), South Indian (PMID: 35061678), Tanzania (PMID: 35691022), British (PMID: 28779002), Ethnic Slavs (PMID: 31173646), Chinese (PMID: 4642895), Cyprus (PMID: 16485136), and US American (PMID: 14578164 and 18188695).\n \n**Summary of Experimental Data: 2 POINTS**\n\nWhile case control studies did not support the gene-disease association, two experimental studies showing the role of XRCC2 in heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation and particularly to the DNA cross-linking chemical mitomycin C (0.5 point for each study, PMID: 10422536, 11025669). Another study reported that in chicken cells, RAD51 paralog mutant cells (like XRCC2), exhibited that same pattern of hypermutation (0.5 point, PMID:15657438).  Lastly, knock-out mice exhibited chromosomal instability and embryonic lethality (0.5 point, PMID:11118202).   \n \n**Overall Summary:**\n\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between XRCC2 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 5/10//2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 2/17/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between XRCC2 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.
