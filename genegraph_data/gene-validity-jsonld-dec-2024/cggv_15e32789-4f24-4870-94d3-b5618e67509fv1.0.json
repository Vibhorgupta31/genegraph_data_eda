Clinical features include facial dysmorphism with oral, tooth, and distal abnormalities, polycystic kidney disease, and central nervous system malformations. Large interfamilial and intrafamilial clinical variability has been widely reported, and 18 distinct mutations have been previously reported within OFD1. A French and Belgian collaborative study collected 25 cases from 16 families. OFD1 was analysed using direct sequencing and phenotype-genotype correlation was performed using chi2 test. X inactivation studies were performed on blood lymphocytes. In 11 families, 11 novel mutations, including nine frameshift, one nonsense, and one missense mutation were identified, which spanned nine different exons. A combination of our results with previously reported cases showed that the majority of mutations (65.5%) was located in exons 3, 8, 9, 13, and 16. There was phenotype-genotype correlation between (a) polycystic kidney disease and splice mutations; (b) mental retardation and mutations located in exons 3, 8, 9, 13, and 16; and (c) tooth abnormalities and mutations located in coiled coil domains. Comparing the phenotype of the families with a pathogenic mutation to families with absence of OFD1 mutation, polycystic kidneys and short stature were significantly more frequent in the group with no OFD1 mutation, whereas lingual hamartomas were significantly more frequent in the group with OFD1 mutation. Finally, an X inactivation study showed non-random X inactivation in a third of the samples. Differential X inactivation between mothers and daughters in two families with high intrafamilial variability was of particular interest. Slight phenotype-genotype correlations were established, and X inactivation study showed that skewed X inactivation could be partially involved in the pathogenesis of intrafamilial clinical variability.","dc:creator":"Thauvin-Robinet C","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Clinical, molecular, and genotype-phenotype correlation studies from 25 cases of oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1: a French and Belgian collaborative study."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16397067","rdfs:label":"II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:e90c0eee-1399-4eeb-82a6-8e38e57e4579_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3834b0e4-bbec-4254-95c1-9cc3117beff0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Primers for amplification of all exons of OFD1 (GenBank ID\nNM_003588.3) were designed with the Primer3 program (Table\nS1).32 Of the last exon, 374 nucleotides of the 30-untranslated\nregion were analyzed.

The presence of asymptomatic obligate carrier females suggested an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. Affected males presented with mental retardation accompanied by postaxial polydactyly and retinitis pigmentosa. Brain MRIs showed the presence of a \"molar tooth sign,\" which classifies this syndrome as classic JS with retinal involvement. Linkage analysis showed linkage to Xpter-Xp22.2 and a maximum LOD score of 2.06 for marker DXS8022. Mutation analysis revealed a frameshift mutation, p.K948NfsX8, in exon 21 of OFD1. In an isolated male with JS, a second frameshift mutation, p.E923KfsX3, in the same exon was identified. OFD1 has previously been associated with oral-facial-digital type 1 (OFD1) syndrome, a male-lethal X-linked dominant condition, and with X-linked recessive Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2 (SGBS2). In a yeast two-hybrid screen of a retinal cDNA library, we identified OFD1 as an interacting partner of the LCA5-encoded ciliary protein lebercilin. We show that X-linked recessive mutations in OFD1 reduce, but do not eliminate, the interaction with lebercilin, whereas X-linked dominant OFD1 mutations completely abolish binding to lebercilin. In addition, recessive mutations in OFD1 did not affect the pericentriolar localization of the recombinant protein in hTERT-RPE1 cells, whereas this localization was lost for dominant mutations.

Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a group of genetic syndromes known as ciliopathies. However, the regulatory mechanisms of primary ciliogenesis in normal and cancer cells are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that autophagic degradation of a ciliopathy protein, OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1), at centriolar satellites promotes primary cilium biogenesis. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway in which cytosol, damaged organelles and protein aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for destruction. We show that the population of OFD1 at the centriolar satellites is rapidly degraded by autophagy upon serum starvation. In autophagy-deficient Atg5 or Atg3 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, OFD1 accumulates at centriolar satellites, leading to fewer and shorter primary cilia and a defective recruitment of BBS4 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4) to cilia. These defects are fully rescued by OFD1 partial knockdown that reduces the population of OFD1 at centriolar satellites. More strikingly, OFD1 depletion at centriolar satellites promotes cilia formation in both cycling cells and transformed breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally do not form cilia. This work reveals that removal of OFD1 by autophagy at centriolar satellites represents a general mechanism to promote ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings define a newly recognized role of autophagy in organelle biogenesis.","dc:creator":"Tang Z","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Autophagy promotes primary ciliogenesis by removing OFD1 from centriolar satellites."},"rdfs:label":"Autophagy promotes cilia biogenesis by regulating OFD1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:15e32789-4f24-4870-94d3-b5618e67509f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa721a78-2249-4a0b-b037-8daa3741bcd4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9fc65688-70d6-49d3-8397-cada3086ebaf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In contrast, the OFD1 syndrome-associated\np.N630fs and p.S586fs mutant proteins localized diffusely\nthroughout the cytoplasm and showed only a limited,\nseverely reduced concentration around the basal body\n(Figures 6M–6R).

In addition, we found impaired patterning of the neural tube and altered expression of the 5' Hoxa and Hoxd genes in the limb buds of mice lacking Ofd1, suggesting that Ofd1 could have a role beyond primary cilium organization and assembly.","dc:creator":"Ferrante MI","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Oral-facial-digital type I protein is required for primary cilia formation and left-right axis specification."},"rdfs:label":"Ofd1 KO"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":380,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:1d6fa43a-afc2-4b66-b892-51a944cd28a4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005308","gene":"hgnc:2567","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"OFD1 (Oro-facial-difital syndrome 1) is a gene that codes for a suppressor of primary ciliogenesis in human cells. It localizes at centrioles and centriolar satellites and is involved in primary cilium biogenesis. Most reported OFD1 mutations are loss of function (indels with frameshift) and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. OFD1 has been associated with 4 different diseases: Retinitis pigmentosa 23, Joubert syndrome 10 (XL-JS), Orofaciodigital syndrome I (OFD1), and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, type 2 (SGBS2). Intra-familial variability within these diseases has been reported and X inactivation studies have shown that skewed X inactivation could be partially involved in the pathogenesis of intrafamilial clinical variability.\nOFD1 interacts with the LCA5-encoded protein lebercilin. Mutations in LCA5 cause the Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), a rare inherited eye disease. The destabilization of lebercilin in conditions of OFD1 deficiency might be the basis of Retinitis pigmentosa 23 diagnoses in these patients.\nThere is an inverse correlation between OFD1 mutant protein length and phenotypic severity, which could be explained by differences in binding to functionally interacting proteins and disruption of ciliary localization. All mutations before amino acid residue 631 are lethal for males and cause OFD1 syndrome in females. The SGBS2-associated p.E709fs mutation causes macroencephaly and early death in males but it leaves females unaffected. Male patients with the p.K948fs and p.E923fs mutations have JS and may live beyond the age of 30 years, whereas carrier females are not affected.\nBased on this data, the ID/Autism EP decided to lump together the OFD1, SGBS2, and XL-JS disease assertions under Ciliopathy, a MONDO Disease Ontology that is inclusive of all three assertions. This decision has been made as OFD1 mutations cause Ciliopathy with differing severity of phenotype (OFD1 > SGBS2 > XL-JS, OFD1 being the most severe); the phenotype depends on the OFD1 mutant protein length left.\nRegarding the correlation of OFD1 and XLID, in Del Giudice et al. 2014 (PMID: 24884629) the authors identified patients displaying neurological symptoms and/or cognitive/behavioral abnormalities, brain structural anomalies in 88.7%, cognitive impairment in 68%, and associated neurological disorders and signs in 53% of cases. The most frequently observed structural brain anomalies included agenesis of the corpus callosum, neuronal migration/organization disorders, intracerebral cysts, porencephaly, and cerebellar malformations. The results from Del Giudice et al. 2014 support recently published findings indicating that CNS involvement in this condition is found in more than 60% of cases. Additionally, the authors described specific neuropsychological aspects such as reduced ability processing verbal information, slow thought process, difficulties in attention and concentration, and notably, long-term memory deficits which may indicate a specific role of OFD1 and/or primary cilia in higher brain functions. Thus the association of ODF1 and XLID is definitive.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:15e32789-4f24-4870-94d3-b5618e67509f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
