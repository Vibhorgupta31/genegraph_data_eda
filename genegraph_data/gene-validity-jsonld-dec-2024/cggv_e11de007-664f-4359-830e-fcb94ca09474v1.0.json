We report 28 bi-allelic variants in SPATA5L1 associated with sensorineural hearing loss in 47 individuals from 28 (26 unrelated) families. In addition, 25/47 affected individuals (53%) presented with microcephaly, developmental delay/intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and/or epilepsy. Modeling indicated damaging effect of variants on the protein, largely via destabilizing effects on protein domains. Brain imaging revealed diminished cerebral volume, thin corpus callosum, and periventricular leukomalacia, and quantitative volumetry demonstrated significantly diminished white matter volumes in several individuals. Immunofluorescent imaging in rat hippocampal neurons revealed localization of Spata5l1 in neuronal and glial cell nuclei and more prominent expression in neurons. In the rodent inner ear, Spata5l1 is expressed in the neurosensory hair cells and inner ear supporting cells. Transcriptomic analysis performed with fibroblasts from affected individuals was able to distinguish affected from controls by principal components. Analysis of differentially expressed genes and networks suggested a role for SPATA5L1 in cell surface adhesion receptor function, intracellular focal adhesions, and DNA replication and mitosis. Collectively, our results indicate that bi-allelic SPATA5L1 variants lead to a human disease characterized by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with or without a nonprogressive mixed neurodevelopmental phenotype.","dc:creator":"Richard EM","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Bi-allelic variants in SPATA5L1 lead to intellectual disability, spastic-dystonic cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and hearing loss."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse expression (gEAR portal)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7c71615b-d977-4abd-a9d1-391762369136","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:19089966-dd1a-4a5d-a5ea-bcb5b262245e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Based on immunofluorescence analysis, there was expression of SPATA5L1 in rat organ of Corti at embryonic day 20.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found clear differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, DFNB119 (OMIM: 619615) and autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with hearing loss and spasticity (NEDHLS; OMIM: 619616). The split curation for NEDHLS has been done separately. 4 variants (missense, frameshift) that have been reported in over 20 probands in one publication (PMID: 34626583) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression-level evidence (PMID: 34626583; GTEx expression data). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role of AFG2B/SPATA5L1 in isolated hearing loss, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 2/21/2024 (SOP Version 10).\nThe total genetic evidence score is actually 4.3 pts., as the panel upgraded 0.5 pts. for the recurrent missense variant p.Ile466Met, so the overall total score is 5.3 pts.
