In two probands with elevated plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduced triglycerides, we identified a mutation in GALNT2. It is shown that carriers have improved postprandial triglyceride clearance, which is likely attributable to attenuated glycosylation of apolipoprotein (apo) C-III, as observed in their plasma. This protein inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which hydrolyses plasma triglycerides. We show that an apoC-III-based peptide is a substrate for ppGalNAc-T2 while its glycosylation by the mutant enzyme is impaired. In addition, neuraminidase treatment of apoC-III which removes the sialic acids from its glycan chain decreases its potential to inhibit LPL. Combined, these data suggest that ppGalNAc-T2 can affect lipid metabolism through apoC-III glycosylation, thereby establishing GALNT2 as a lipid-modifying gene.","dc:creator":"Holleboom AG","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Heterozygosity for a loss-of-function mutation in GALNT2 improves plasma triglyceride clearance in man."},"rdfs:label":"p.D314A mutation in ppGalNAc-T2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8107f647-e731-44f5-ba38-46e648febab1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7b370a40-8f43-44da-960b-9da3a97817e4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b53fa806-c9c0-4ddd-b908-9b0acea59f08","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27508872","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Human genetics studies have implicated GALNT2, encoding GalNAc-T2, as a regulator of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) metabolism, but the mechanisms relating GALNT2 to HDL-C remain unclear.

Additional glycoproteomics in rodents identified targets influencing HDL-C, including phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). GALNT2 deficiency reduced plasma PLTP activity in humans and rodents, and in mice this was rescued by reconstitution of hepatic Galnt2.

Here, we report the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of seven patients from four families with GALNT2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (GALNT2-CDG), an O-linked glycosylation disorder. GALNT2 encodes the Golgi-localized polypeptide N-acetyl-d-galactosamine-transferase 2 isoenzyme. GALNT2 is widely expressed in most cell types and directs initiation of mucin-type protein O-glycosylation. All patients showed loss of O-glycosylation of apolipoprotein C-III, a non-redundant substrate for GALNT2. Patients with GALNT2-CDG generally exhibit a syndrome characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability with language deficit, autistic features, behavioural abnormalities, epilepsy, chronic insomnia, white matter changes on brain MRI, dysmorphic features, decreased stature, and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Rodent (mouse and rat) models of GALNT2-CDG recapitulated much of the human phenotype, including poor growth and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. In behavioural studies, GALNT2-CDG mice demonstrated cerebellar motor deficits, decreased sociability, and impaired sensory integration and processing. The multisystem nature of phenotypes in patients and rodent models of GALNT2-CDG suggest that there are multiple non-redundant protein substrates of GALNT2 in various tissues, including brain, which are critical to normal growth and development.","dc:creator":"Zilmer M","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Novel congenital disorder of O-linked glycosylation caused by GALNT2 loss of

was first reported in relation to autosomal receive congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIt in 2012 ( Holleboom A, et al., 2012, PMID: 22152306). Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIt is a multisystemic metabolic disorder characterized by global developmental delay, poor overall growth, severely impaired intellectual development with absent language, and behavioral abnormalities. Most patients develop early-onset seizures. This gene encodes a member of the glycosyltransferase 2 protein family. Members of this family initiate mucin-type O-glycoslation of peptides in the Golgi apparatus. (O'Leary NA et al., 2016, PMID: 26553804) \n\nFour variants (1 missense, 3 nonsense) that have been reported in approximately 4 probands in 1 publications (Zilmer M, et al., 2020, PMID: 32293671), are included in this curation. The mechanism of disease for Immunodeficiency 23 is gene mutations result in the production of an enzyme with reduced activity.  \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including expression of enzymatic activity in mouse models (Greig KT, et al., 2007, PMID: 17548465).  In summary, there is strong evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
