To investigate NTE function in vivo, we used the cre/loxP site-specific recombination strategy to generate mice with a specific deletion of NTE in neuronal tissues. Here we show that loss of NTE leads to prominent neuronal pathology in the hippocampus and thalamus and also defects in the cerebellum. Absence of NTE resulted in disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuolation of nerve cell bodies, and abnormal reticular aggregates. Thus, these results identify a physiological role for NTE in the nervous system and indicate that a loss-of-function mechanism may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by vacuolation and neuronal loss.","dc:creator":"Akassoglou K","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Brain-specific deletion of neuropathy target esterase/swisscheese results in neurodegeneration."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse brain specific conditional knock-out"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Lowered score to 1 because the conditional brain-specific knock-out mice did not have ataxia or paralysis."},{"id":"cggv:269906d3-b6b1-4bdf-8cb2-0d5ab648a2a4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:581fe325-4f80-49d3-97f0-7a34a79a7dba","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The severe reduction in locomotion in mutant flies at 7-days-old which became worse at 14-days-old is similar to progressive spasticity observed in many patients.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31780887","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6 (PNPLA6) have been linked with a number of inherited diseases with clinical symptoms that include spastic paraplegia, ataxia, and chorioretinal dystrophy.

We evaluated a consanguineous kindred and a genetically unrelated nonconsanguineous kindred in which affected subjects exhibited progressive spastic paraplegia and distal muscle wasting. Affected subjects resembled those with OPIDN and those with Troyer Syndrome due to SPG20/spartin gene mutation (excluded by genetic linkage and SPG20/spartin sequence analysis). Genome-wide analysis suggested linkage to a 22 cM homozygous locus (D19S565 to D19S884, maximum multipoint LOD score 3.28) on chromosome 19p13 to which NTE had been mapped (GenBank AJ004832). NTE was a candidate because of its role in OPIDN and the similarity of our patients to those with OPIDN. Affected subjects in the consanguineous kindred were homozygous for disease-specific NTE mutation c.3034A-->G that disrupted an interspecies conserved residue (M1012V) in NTE's catalytic domain. Affected subjects in the nonconsanguineous family were compound heterozygotes: one allele had c.2669G-->A mutation, which disrupts an interspecies conserved residue in NTE's catalytic domain (R890H), and the other allele had an insertion (c.2946_2947insCAGC) causing frameshift and protein truncation (p.S982fs1019). Disease-specific, nonconserved NTE mutations in unrelated MND patients indicates NTE's importance in maintaining axonal integrity, raises the possibility that NTE pathway disturbances contribute to other MNDs including ALS, and supports the role of NTE abnormalities in axonopathy produced by neuropathic OP compounds.","dc:creator":"Rainier S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Neuropathy target esterase gene mutations cause motor neuron disease."}},{"id":"cggv:759f9abc-a7db-4d51-be51-917844fe8782_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:272acd19-5cee-4cb4-8152-2464a22dcb22"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18313024"}],"rdfs:label":"No label, only indicated by an arrow in Figure 1B"},{"id":"cggv:d71ce77b-188b-48f4-89bd-9f606d81be6c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d71ce77b-188b-48f4-89bd-9f606d81be6c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d71ce77b-188b-48f4-89bd-9f606d81be6c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"• PMID:20382209 (2010):\nRecombinant purified mutant esterase domain had 71.6% ± 2.7% hydrolase activity compared to wild-type (Table 1).\n\n• PMID:25480986 (2015):\nHuman p.Arg928His failed to rescue zebrafish morphant phenotypes of small head, small eyes, curvy tails, and curvy bodies (Fig. 4E).\n\n• PMID:20603202 (2015):\nPNPLA6 enzyme activity in fibroblasts of both affecteds was ~60% of wild-type and heterozygotes (Fig 1)."}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:759f9abc-a7db-4d51-be51-917844fe8782","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:759f9abc-a7db-4d51-be51-917844fe8782_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6fe710cd-f856-4965-a592-9d1baf2db1e9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6fe710cd-f856-4965-a592-9d1baf2db1e9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:c7fb226d-07d7-47c7-ac8c-b475631520ab","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166114.2(PNPLA6):c.3005G>T (p.Gly1002Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA403131694"}},{"id":"cggv:f3c35c3a-f9e8-49be-8d13-fdee79015987","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166114.2(PNPLA6):c.3781C>T (p.Arg1261Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9140576"}}],"detectionMethod":"An NGS panel of 200 genes associated with ataxia and spastic paraplegia was used to screen for variants.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"spastic gait, lower limb spasticity, nystagmus, Babinski sign, cognitive impairment, neuropathy, distal weakness, and scoliosis.

In five of seven Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome/Gordon Holmes syndrome families, we identified nine rare conserved and damaging mutations by applying whole exome sequencing. Further, by dissecting the complex clinical presentation of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome and Gordon Holmes syndrome into its neurological system components, we set out to analyse an additional 538 exomes from families with ataxia (with and without hypogonadism), pure and complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. We identified four additional PNPLA6 mutations in spastic ataxia and hereditary spastic paraplegia families, revealing that Boucher-Neuhäuser and Gordon Holmes syndromes in fact represent phenotypic clusters on a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases caused by mutations in PNPLA6. Structural analysis indicates that the majority of mutations falls in the C-terminal phospholipid esterase domain and likely inhibits the catalytic activity of PNPLA6, which provides the precursor for biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Our findings show that PNPLA6 influences a manifold of neuronal systems, from the retina to the cerebellum, upper and lower motor neurons and the neuroendocrine system, with damage of this protein causing an extraordinarily broad continuous spectrum of associated neurodegenerative disease.

Here we report three patients from a single-family with a novel pathogenic mutation in the PNPLA6 gene which led to predominantly spastic-ataxia, and intractable Holmes tremor. The PNPLA6-related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spastic-ataxias even in the absence of chorioretinal dystrophy, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Further studies should unravel the factors which account for the phenotypic variability present in patients with PNPLA6 gene mutations.","dc:creator":"Emekli AS","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A novel PNPLA6 mutation in a Turkish family with intractable Holmes tremor and spastic ataxia."}},"rdfs:label":"Case report"},{"id":"cggv:2038e311-6f60-47c7-9d8c-e651c6140562","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2038e311-6f60-47c7-9d8c-e651c6140562_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f05d3811-d318-4d8e-be25-8b9da90e6d23_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10},{"id":"cggv:5b1742d9-ec63-49c5-9bcc-0cb6acbec481_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b1742d9-ec63-49c5-9bcc-0cb6acbec481","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:d13831fc-ef0d-4af5-8078-931dc3fafb1e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166114.2(PNPLA6):c.3464C>T (p.Thr1155Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA403134698"}},{"id":"cggv:ad281662-c46f-491f-a8bd-fa4706c014a0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166114.2(PNPLA6):c.3314C>T (p.Thr1105Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA403133770"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Toe walking, spasticity, motor neuropathy, saccadic smooth pursuit","previousTestingDescription":"Spinocerebellar ataxias 1-8, 17, Friedreich ataxia, ataxia telangiectasia, chromosomal microarray (60 K oligonucleotide array)","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:1b8d1bcc-5508-4ad5-94f9-5feb7d8a5aab_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ad281662-c46f-491f-a8bd-fa4706c014a0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34816117","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Spastic diplegia presenting in infancy is common to both cerebral palsy (CP) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP).

Mutations in 78 genes have been identified in autosomal dominant hereditary SPG (AD-HSP) and autosomal recessive hereditary SPG (AR-HSP). Compared to familial HSP, much less is known about the genetic and clinical profiles of sporadic SPGs. In this study, we have screened mutations for 18 sporadic SPGs or AR-HSP patients (mainly Northern Chinese) by whole-exome sequencing. We identified 12 mutations in five genes in 9 (50%) patients, including 9 novel ones: SPG5A/CYP7B1 (c.851C > A; c.122 + 2 T > G), SPG11/KIAA1840 (c.1735 + 3_ 1735 + 6del AAGT); SPG7/SPG7 (c.1454G > A; c.1892_ 1906dup GAGGACGGGCCTCGG); SPG39/PNPLA6 (c.1591G > A; c. 2990C > T); SPG15/ ZFYVE26 (c. 4804C > T; c. 4278 G > A). Among all the mutations, 7 were detected in the SPG5A and SPG11. Age at onset was significantly younger in cases with mutations (15.45 ± 6.78 years) than those without mutations (25.56 ± 10.90 years) (P = 0.03). Except for two cases with the SPG5A mutations, all cases presented with complicated SPGs. Three cases carrying mutations in SPG7, SPG15, SPG39 showed symptoms and signs of ataxia. One case carrying the homozygous c.259 + 2 T > C mutation in CYP7B1 showed serum parameters indicating liver impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed significantly thinned corpus callosum in cases with SPG11 and SPG15, but not in those with SPG5A, SPG7 or SPG39. In contrast, cerebellar atrophy was prominent in the SPG7 and SPG39 cases. These findings expand the spectrum of genetic, clinical and imaging features of sporadic SPG and AR-HSP, and have important implications in genetic counselling, molecular mechanisms and precise diagnosis of the disease.","dc:creator":"Dong Y","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Genetic, clinical and neuroimaging profiles of sporadic and autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia cases in Chinese."}},{"id":"cggv:ccd7ef61-42c3-4701-9f79-62499643d5ef_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ea21e296-2bf8-4836-8ec8-deb821b143ca"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34256108"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 9"},{"id":"cggv:ccd7ef61-42c3-4701-9f79-62499643d5ef","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ccd7ef61-42c3-4701-9f79-62499643d5ef_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:f5ae5ed1-cde9-4089-841c-3479a3397312","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f5ae5ed1-cde9-4089-841c-3479a3397312_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The score for this variant was increased because it is a recurrent variant which has been reported in the following patients with phenotypes related to this gene:\n\na).

Patients with documented corticospinal tract abnormalities were screened by whole gene sequencing and multiplex ligation probe amplification for mutations in nine genes known to cause ARHSP. Of a cohort of 39 patients, a genetic diagnosis was established in 17 (44 %) and heterozygous mutations were detected in 8 (21 %). Mutations were most frequent in SPG7 (12 patients), followed by SPG11 (10 patients), PNPLA6 (SPG39, 2 patients), and ZFYVE26 (SPG15, 2 patients). Although there are associations between some clinical manifestations of ARHSP and specific genes, many patients are tested at an early stage of the disease when phenotype/genotype correlations are not obvious. Accurate molecular characterization of well-phenotyped cohorts of patients will be essential to establishing the natural history of these rare degenerative disorders to enable future clinical trials.

PNPLA6 was first reported in relation to PNPLA6-related spastic paraplegia with or without ataxia in 2008 (Rainier et al., PMID: 18313024). This disease is characterized by childhood to adult onset of progressive spasticity usually in the lower limbs, muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, increased reflexes, cerebellar atrophy, and ataxia. Cognitive impairment and growth hormone deficiency may also be present in some cases. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability in the following disease entities which ended up being lumped into one disease entity: Boucher-Neuhauser syndrome (OMIM:215470), Oliver-McFarlane syndrome (OMIM:275400), Laurence-Moon syndrome (OMIM:245800), and Gordon-Holmes syndrome (no OMIM entry, but Orphanet lists this as cerebellar ataxia hypogonadism syndrome (ORPHA:1173). The disorder listed in OMIM as spastic paraplegia 39, autosomal recessive (OMIM:612020) was split from the aforementioned lumped entity due to significant phenotypic variability and is curated here as PNPLA6-related spastic paraplegia with or without ataxia. \n\nSixteen variants (13 missense, one nonsense, one frameshift, and one intragenic two-exon deletion) that have been reported in 11 probands in seven publications (PMID: 18313024; Yoon et al., 2013, PMID: 23733235; Synofzik et al., 2014, PMID: 24355708; Suchowersky et al., 2021, PMID: 34816117; Dong et al., 2021, PMID: 34256108; Emekli et al., 2021, PMID: 33210227; Nanetti et al., 2022, PMID: 35069422) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function based on various observations including reduced in-vitro enzymatic activity of recombinantly purified proteins containing patients’ variants, reduced enzymatic activity measured directly in patients’ fibroblasts, and the failure of proteins containing patients’ variants to rescue the phenotypes of zebrafish morphants as well as Drosophila null mutant animals. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models (Akassoglou et al., 2004, PMID: 15051870; Kretzschmar et al., 1997, PMID: 9295388, Sunderhaus et al., 2019, PMID: 31780887). In particular, the mouse conditional brain specific knockout model showed abnormal flexion reflex as well as significantly poor motor coordination, whereas the Drosophila null model showed progressively severe reduction in locomotion. Additionally, non-genetic inhibition of PNPLA6 enzyme activity in humans through environmental exposure to certain toxic organophosphate compounds is well known to result in organophosphate compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity or OPIDN, a condition that resembles PNPLA6-related spastic paraplegia with or without ataxia that occurs due to biallelic genetic defects in this gene (Richardson et al., 2020, PMID: 32518884). In summary, PNPLA6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive PNPLA6-related spastic paraplegia with or without ataxia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 11.02.2022 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f05d3811-d318-4d8e-be25-8b9da90e6d23"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
