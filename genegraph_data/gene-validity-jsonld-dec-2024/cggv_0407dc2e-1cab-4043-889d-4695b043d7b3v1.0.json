The large sizes of these genes and the absence of mutation hot spots have complicated mutational analysis by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches. Here, in order to design a rapid and effective method for the genetic diagnosis of AS, we developed a strategy by utilizing targeted capture associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 simultaneously in 20 AS patients. All the coding exons and flanking sequences of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 from the probands were captured followed by HiSeq 2500 sequencing. Candidate mutations were validated by classic Sanger sequencing and quantitative (q)PCR. Sixteen patients (16/20, 75%) showed X-linked inheritance, and four patients (4/20, 20%) showed autosomal recessive inheritance. None of the individuals had autosomal-dominant AS. Fifteen novel mutations, 6 known mutations, and 2 novel fragment deletions were detected by targeted capture and NGS. Of these novel mutations, 12, 3, and 2 mutations were detected in COL4A5, COL4A4, and COL4A3, respectively. A comparison of the clinical manifestations caused by different types of mutations in COL4A5 suggested that nonsense mutations and glycine substitution by an acidic amino acid are more severe than the other missense mutations. Pathogenic mutations were detected in 20 patients. These novel mutations can expand the genotypic spectrum of AS. Our results demonstrated that targeted capture and NGS technology are effective in the genetic diagnosis of AS.","dc:creator":"Liu JH","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Novel mutations in COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 in Chinese patients with Alport Syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28542346","rdfs:label":"IID1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD.

Ultrastructural abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane, including lamellation and splitting, were characteristic of human XLAS. The mouse model described here recapitulates essential clinical and pathologic findings of human XLAS. With alpha5(IV) expression reflecting X-inactivation patterns, it will be especially useful in studying determinants of disease variability in the carrier state.","dc:creator":"Rheault MN","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mouse model of X-linked Alport syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Rheault Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Variant is from a patient in Crus-Robles et al. 1999 (10563487)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":152,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7d74db82-c8bf-41df-8ea6-8b3a4d0ca29c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018965","gene":"hgnc:2207","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"COL4A5 was first reported in relation to X-linked Alport syndrome in 1990 (Myers et al., 2339699). Eight missense, frameshift, nonsense and splice-site variants reported in humans were included in this curation, however approximately 1000 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in this gene have been reported in ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 7 publications (10563487, 14993485, 23085274, 25572247, 27725546, 28542346, 27796712). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 18 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by knock-in mouse models and expression studies in humans (15153557, 30582011, 16301374). In summary, COL4A5 is definitely associated with X-linked Alport syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 3/19/19 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0407dc2e-1cab-4043-889d-4695b043d7b3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
