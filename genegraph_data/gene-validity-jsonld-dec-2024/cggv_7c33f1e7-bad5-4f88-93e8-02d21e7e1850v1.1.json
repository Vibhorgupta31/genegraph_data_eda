Analysis of PIGL genomic sequences for repetitive elements demonstrated that Alu repeats represent ∼34% of its intronic sequence, suggesting that the genomic architecture may predispose the gene to disease-causing copynumber changes.

Mutations in 18 genes that encode components of GPI-anchor biogenesis result in a phenotypic spectrum that includes learning disability, epilepsy, microcephaly, congenital malformations and mild dysmorphic features. To determine the incidence of GPI-anchor defects, we analysed the exome data from 4293 parent-child trios recruited to the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study. All probands recruited had a neurodevelopmental disorder. We searched for variants in 31 genes linked to GPI-anchor biogenesis and detected rare biallelic variants in PGAP3, PIGN, PIGT (n=2), PIGO and PIGL, providing a likely diagnosis for six families. In five families, the variants were in a compound heterozygous configuration while in a consanguineous Afghani kindred, a homozygous c.709G>C; p.(E237Q) variant in PIGT was identified within 10-12 Mb of autozygosity. Validation and segregation analysis was performed using Sanger sequencing. Across the six families, five siblings were available for testing and in all cases variants co-segregated consistent with them being causative. In four families, abnormal alkaline phosphatase results were observed in the direction expected. FACS analysis of knockout HEK293 cells that had been transfected with wild-type or mutant cDNA constructs demonstrated that the variants in PIGN, PIGT and PIGO all led to reduced activity. Splicing assays, performed using leucocyte RNA, showed that a c.336-2A>G variant in PIGL resulted in exon skipping and p.D113fs*2. Our results strengthen recently reported disease associations, suggest that defective GPI-anchor biogenesis may explain ~0.15% of individuals with developmental disorders and highlight the benefits of

In CHIME syndrome, a recurrent missense mutation c.500T > C (p.Leu167Pro) is found in the majority of patients, associated with a null mutation in the other allele, including an overrepresentation of large deletions. The latter are not detected by the standard analysis in sequencing techniques, including next-generation sequencing.

Recent studies have revealed mutations in PIGV, PIGW, PIGO, PGAP2, and PGAP3 (genes that encode molecules of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis pathway) in patients with HPMRS. We performed whole-exome sequencing of a patient with severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial appearance, fragile nails, and persistent increased serum levels of ALP. The result revealed a compound heterozygote with a 13-bp deletion in exon 1 (c.36_48del) and a two-base deletion in exon 2 (c.254_255del) in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor, class L (PIGL) that caused frameshifts resulting in premature terminations. The 13-bp deletion was inherited from the father, and the two-base deletion was inherited from the mother. Expressing c.36_48del or c.254_255del cDNA with an HA-tag at the C- or N-terminus in PIGL-deficient CHO cells only partially restored the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Nonsynonymous changes or frameshift mutations in PIGL have been identified in patients with CHIME syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by colobomas, congenital heart defects, early onset migratory ichthyosiform dermatosis, intellectual disability, and ear abnormalities. Our patient did not have colobomas, congenital heart defects, or early onset migratory ichthyosiform dermatosis and hence was diagnosed with HPMRS, and not CHIME syndrome. These results suggest that frameshift mutations that result in premature termination in PIGL cause a phenotype that is consistent with HPMRS.","dc:creator":"Fujiwara I","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Mutations in PIGL in a patient with Mabry syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:ed87ee37-bba0-4133-98d7-c5c5d23ed6d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9060de9b-25bb-406b-a48e-c0f5b7bfae80"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25706356"}],"rdfs:label":"Fujiwara Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:4cacea35-8b5b-4fa5-8ae7-546bc79419c4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4cacea35-8b5b-4fa5-8ae7-546bc79419c4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Maximum 2 points allocated to a proband with a recessive disorder as per GCEP."},{"id":"cggv:ed87ee37-bba0-4133-98d7-c5c5d23ed6d2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed87ee37-bba0-4133-98d7-c5c5d23ed6d2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Maximum 2 points allocated to a proband with a recessive disorder as per GCEP."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:67cc40aa-c355-491a-b342-11323116ea1a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67cc40aa-c355-491a-b342-11323116ea1a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7c25c40a-010d-4454-8efb-221e4e24989e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004278.4(PIGL):c.701G>A (p.Arg234His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA288216359"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The phenotypes of the subjects were not consistent with CHIME syndrome or Mabry syndrome, as reported in previous studies.

Here we show that recombinant rat PIG-L protein purified from Escherichia coli as a complex with GroEL has GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity in vitro. The activity was not enhanced by GTP, which is known to enhance the de-N-acetylase activity of mammalian cell microsomes. As with other de-N-acetylases that act on the GlcNAc moiety, metal ions, in particular Mn2+ and Ni2+, enhanced the enzyme activity of PIG-L. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YMR281W open reading frame encodes a protein (termed Gpi12p) with 24% amino acid identity with rat PIG-L. On transfection into mammalian PIG-L-deficient cells, this gene, GPI12, restored the cell-surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins and GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity. The disruption of the gene caused lethality in S. cerevisiae.

Five unrelated probands with CHIME syndrome had compound heterozygous variants in *PIGL*; they all shared the same p.Leu167Pro missense variant and had different null variants in the second allele .\n Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 22444671, 25706356, 28327575, 28371479, 29444765, 29473937, 30023290, 35258128), including 11 missense (p.Leu167Pro recurrent 8 times), 3 frameshift, 3 nonsense, 2 splice-site, and 3 partial or whole gene deletions . Affected individuals had CHIME syndrome, Mabry syndrome, overlapping features of both syndromes, or intellectual disability with dysmorphic features and seizures. Of note, all individuals with CHIME syndrome reported thus far carried the recurrent p.Leu167Pro variant. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by protein interaction with MEIS2 (PMID: 26186194), biochemical function (PMID: 10085243) and functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 22444671).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PIGL* and autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 7, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7c33f1e7-bad5-4f88-93e8-02d21e7e1850"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
