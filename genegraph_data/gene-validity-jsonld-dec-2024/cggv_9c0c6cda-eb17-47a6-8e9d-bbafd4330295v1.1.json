SPATA7 has recently been identified as the LCA3 and juvenile RP gene in humans, whose function in the retina remains elusive. Here, we show that SPATA7 localizes at the primary cilium of cells and at the connecting cilium (CC) of photoreceptor cells, indicating that SPATA7 is a ciliary protein. In addition, SPATA7 directly interacts with the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1), a key connecting cilium protein that has also been linked to LCA. In the retina of Spata7 null mutant mice, a substantial reduction of RPGRIP1 levels at the CC of photoreceptor cells is observed, suggesting that SPATA7 is required for the stable assembly and localization of the ciliary RPGRIP1 protein complex. Furthermore, our results pinpoint a role of this complex in protein trafficking across the CC to the outer segments, as we identified that rhodopsin accumulates in the inner segments and around the nucleus of photoreceptors. This accumulation then likely triggers the apoptosis of rod photoreceptors that was observed. Loss of Spata7 function in mice indeed results in a juvenile RP-like phenotype, characterized by progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells and a strongly decreased light response. Together, these results indicate that SPATA7 functions as a key member of a retinal ciliopathy-associated protein complex, and that apoptosis of rod photoreceptor cells triggered by protein mislocalization is likely the mechanism of disease progression in LCA3/ juvenile RP patients.","dc:creator":"Eblimit A","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Spata7 is a retinal ciliopathy gene critical for correct RPGRIP1 localization and protein trafficking in the retina."},"rdfs:label":"SPATA7_Localization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2112f061-22aa-43bc-98d3-02394b963b7a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2029c229-f486-40f5-ab19-e8b90e1ba36e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"We examined the expression pattern of Spata7 in the mouse retina at several developmental stages, using both mRNA ISH and IHC.

Affected individuals with *SPATA7*-related retinopathy show a wide range of age at onset, with a subset of cases presenting in infancy and others developing symptoms later in life. Common clinical features include nystagmus and severe visual loss, but significant inter- and inta-familial phenotypic variability has been described, including diagnoses of Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa with variable age at onset. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *SPATA7* disruption) were found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis 3 (MIM# 604232) or retinitis pigmentosa 94, variable age at onset, autosomal recessive (MIM# 604232). The phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *SPATA7* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as SPATA7-related retinopathy.\n\nNine variants (two nonsense, four frameshift, two missense and one in-frame indel) that have been reported in ten probands in six publications (PMIDs: 19268277, 22136677, 26854980, 29411205, 28481129, 21310915) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies showing that *SPATA7* is expressed in multiple layers of the mouse retina (PMID: 19268277). More specifically, Eblimit et. al. show that *SPATA7* is localized to the connecting cilium of hTERT RPE-1 cells and mouse photoreceptors. This same group also provides evidence that *SPATA7* interacts with RPGRIP1, a protein that has previously been implicated in an X-linked form of retinal dystrophy. Finally, the relevant publication also discusses the findings in a *Spata7*-null mouse model. Mutant mice had severely reduced outer nuclear layer thickness, defective light response as measured by electroretinogram (ERG), as well as a reduction in expression and mislocalization of the RPGRIP1 and RHO proteins (PMID: 25398945). Another *Spata7* knockout mouse model supports these results (PMID: 35368022).\n\nIn summary, *SPATA7* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive SPATA7-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 1, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9c0c6cda-eb17-47a6-8e9d-bbafd4330295"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
