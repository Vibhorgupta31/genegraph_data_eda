We previously identified that CFEOM1 results from heterozygous missense mutations in KIF21A, which encodes a kinesin motor protein. Here we evaluate the expression pattern of KIF21A in human brain and muscles of control and CFEOM1 patients, and during human and mouse embryonic development. KIF21A is expressed in the cell bodies, axons, and dendrites of many neuronal populations including those in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum, and motor neurons of the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei from early development into maturity, and its spatial distribution is not altered in the CFEOM1 tissues available for study. Multiple splice isoforms of KIF21A are identified in human fetal brain, but none of the reported CFEOM1 mutations are located in or near the alternatively spliced exons. KIF21A immunoreactivity is also observed in extraocular and skeletal muscle biopsies of control and CFEOM1 patients, where it co-localizes with triadin, a marker of the excitation-contractile coupling system. The diffuse and widespread expression of KIF21A in the developing human and mouse central and peripheral nervous system as well as in extraocular muscle does not account for the restricted ocular phenotype observed in CFEOM1, nor does it permit the formal exclusion of a myogenic etiology based on expression patterns alone.","dc:creator":"Desai J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Spatiotemporal expression pattern of KIF21A during normal embryonic development and in congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1)."},"rdfs:label":"KIF21A expression in EOM "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:cc32bbc2-de76-42d0-8a6b-b3c3393ddd30_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eba1b071-3f64-4c79-9e47-935351d26cf0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f9b0ffd-c4ba-4363-b828-6fcf64194c19","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Adult 129/S1 Kif21aKI mice exhibit the CFEOM1 external phenotype of unilateral or bilateral ptosis and/or globe retraction that is 92% penetrant and primarily homozygous in Kif21aKI/KI mice, 43% penetrant and primarily heterozygous in Kif21a+IKI mice, and absent in Kif21a+/+  WT mice.

We demonstrate that Kif21a knockin mice harboring the most common human mutation develop CFEOM. The developing axons of the oculomotor nerve's superior division stall in the proximal nerve; the growth cones enlarge, extend excessive filopodia, and assume random trajectories. Inferior division axons reach the orbit but branch ectopically. We establish a gain-of-function mechanism and find that human motor or stalk mutations attenuate Kif21a autoinhibition, providing in vivo evidence for mammalian kinesin autoregulation. We identify Map1b as a Kif21a-interacting protein and report that Map1b⁻/⁻ mice develop CFEOM. The interaction between Kif21a and Map1b is likely to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CFEOM1 and highlights a selective vulnerability of the developing oculomotor nerve to perturbations of the axon cytoskeleton.","dc:creator":"Cheng L","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Human CFEOM1 mutations attenuate KIF21A autoinhibition and cause oculomotor axon stalling."},"rdfs:label":"KIf21A knock-in mouse "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:cc32bbc2-de76-42d0-8a6b-b3c3393ddd30_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cc32bbc2-de76-42d0-8a6b-b3c3393ddd30_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3537,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:60e3739a-3d7c-4e5d-875a-691752a395ff","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007614","gene":"hgnc:19349","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"KIF21A was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) in 2003 (Yamada et al., PMID:14595441). CFEOM is a syndrome of congenital nonprogressive bilateral ophthalmoplegia affecting the extraocular muscles innervated by the oculomotor and/or trochlear nerves. Classic presentations of CFEOM are characterized by ptosis, severe limitation of vertical gaze, and inability to raise either eye above the midline with variable limitation of the horizontal gaze. This disorder has historically been referred to as both CFEOM1 and CFEOM3, the latter characterized by a milder, sometimes unilateral presentation.Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, CFEOM1 (OMIM:135700) and CFEOM3 (OMIM:135700). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. Eleven missense variants reported across 33 probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 14595441,15621877, 15621876, 18332320, 15223798, 19551685, 17511870) are included in this curation. Of the variants reported in this curation, all were absent from gnomAD and the most frequent variant (R954W) was reported in 21 probands, 9 of which were de novo observations. This specific variant is the most common for this syndrome, and variants at this residue (R954) account for the majority of cases. This residue has been shown to contain a CpG dinucleotide that is methylated, providing some insight into the high mutability of this region in KIF21A (PMID:15621877). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be gain of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and expression studies (PMIDs:24656932, 22465342). Knock-in mice containing the R954W variant have been shown to exhibit CFEOM phenotypes with minimal differences, and KIF21A has been shown to be expressed normally in human and murine extraocular and skeletal muscle cells. In summary, KIF21A is definitively associated with autosomal dominant CFEOM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Expert Panel on the meeting date 09/28/21 (SOP Version 8).
