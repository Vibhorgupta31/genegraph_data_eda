We show here that inactivation of Roundabout (Robo) receptors 1 and 2 in mice leads to mispositioning of the stomach in the thoracic instead of the abdominal cavity, which likely contributes to poor lung inflation and lethality at birth, reminiscent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) cases in humans. Unexpectedly, in Robo mutant mice, the primary defect preceding organ misplacement and diaphragm malformation is a delayed separation of foregut from the dorsal body wall. Foregut separation is a rarely considered morphogenetic event, and our data indicate that it occurs via repulsion of Robo-expressing foregut cells away from the Slit ligand source.

Here, we report a novel role of the Drosophila slit, robo, and robo2 genes in heart morphogenesis. Slit and Robo proteins specifically accumulate at the dorsal midline between the bilateral myocardial progenitors forming a linear tube. Manipulation of Slit localization or its overexpression causes disruption in heart tube alignment and assembly, and slit-deficient hearts show disruptions in cell-polarity marker localization within the myocardium. Similar phenotypes are observed when Robo and Robo2 are manipulated. Rescue experiments suggest that Slit is secreted from the myocardial progenitors and that Robo and Robo2 act in myocardial and pericardial cells, respectively. Genetic interactions suggest a cardiac morphogenesis network involving Slit/Robo, cell-polarity proteins, and other membrane-associated proteins. We conclude that Slit and Robo proteins contribute significantly to Drosophila heart morphogenesis by guiding heart cell alignment and adhesion and/or by inhibiting cell mixing between the bilateral compartments of heart cell progenitors and ensuring proper polarity of the myocardial epithelium.","dc:creator":"Qian L","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Slit and Robo control cardiac cell polarity and morphogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Fly expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:18673cc6-d19d-42ef-baae-db1e8217088c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c271dac-a451-496a-8282-4ed848b7dbe7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"in situ hydridization at E9.5","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23255421","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The Slit-Roundabout (Robo) signaling pathway has pleiotropic functions during Drosophila heart development.

Despite growing knowledge of the genetic causes of CAKUT, the majority of cases remain etiologically unsolved. Genetic alterations in roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) have been associated with neuronal and cardiac developmental defects in living individuals. Although Slit-Robo signaling is pivotal for kidney development, diagnostic ROBO1 variants have not been reported in viable CAKUT to date. By next-generation-sequencing methods, we identified six unrelated individuals and two non-viable fetuses with biallelic truncating or combined missense and truncating variants in ROBO1. Kidney and genitourinary manifestation included unilateral or bilateral kidney agenesis, vesicoureteral junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valve, genital malformation, and increased kidney echogenicity. Further clinical characteristics were remarkably heterogeneous, including neurodevelopmental defects, intellectual impairment, cerebral malformations, eye anomalies, and cardiac defects. By in silico analysis, we determined the functional significance of identified missense variants and observed absence of kidney ROBO1 expression in both human and murine mutant tissues. While its expression in multiple tissues may explain heterogeneous organ involvement, variability of the kidney disease suggests gene dosage effects due to a combination of null alleles with mild hypomorphic alleles. Thus, comprehensive genetic analysis in CAKUT should include ROBO1 as a new cause of recessively inherited disease. Hence, in patients with already established ROBO1-associated cardiac or neuronal disorders, screening for kidney involvement is indicated.","dc:creator":"Münch J","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Biallelic pathogenic variants in roundabout guidance receptor 1 associate with syndromic congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract."}},{"id":"cggv:11bff286-f18c-47e6-a37d-2fdb167253de_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:eb607331-4a74-4f86-bf9b-dd41a54ceecd"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35227688"}],"rdfs:label":"ID5"},{"id":"cggv:11bff286-f18c-47e6-a37d-2fdb167253de","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11bff286-f18c-47e6-a37d-2fdb167253de_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Caveat: pLI is 0"},{"id":"cggv:cdcdfb64-80a3-4559-b87d-114b0639435f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cdcdfb64-80a3-4559-b87d-114b0639435f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Caveat: pLI is 0"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0f2b7361-fa97-45a0-818e-e29b52bf4943_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f2b7361-fa97-45a0-818e-e29b52bf4943","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ad0a012d-f397-4fa3-82cd-cfd71c85c3a1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002941.4(ROBO1):c.2882+1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353656883"}},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4182b4df-47d7-460a-8041-d1d81b1bc20e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ad0a012d-f397-4fa3-82cd-cfd71c85c3a1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35227688"},"rdfs:label":"ID3"},{"id":"cggv:4182b4df-47d7-460a-8041-d1d81b1bc20e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4182b4df-47d7-460a-8041-d1d81b1bc20e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Frequent site of insertion/deletion in reference cohorts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":9413,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7ebb845f-371d-49dd-8273-64e5631350ae","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:10249","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"ROBO1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive congenital heart disease in 2022 (Munch et al., PMID: 35227688).

The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (fly and mouse expression-level data; and fly and mouse models) (PMIDs: 23255421, 20941780, 23328398, 25691540, 16360689, 18663139, 23825967, 21385766, 28592524). The mouse models have somewhat variable phenotypes but generally indicate increased rates of ventricular septal defects and outflow tract anomalies in Robo1 null mice. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
