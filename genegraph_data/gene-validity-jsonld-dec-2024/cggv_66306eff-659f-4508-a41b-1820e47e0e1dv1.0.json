It is most common among children of Ashkenazi Jewish descent but has been diagnosed in many diverse ethnic groups. Two mutations comprise the majority of mutant alleles in Jewish patients, while mutations in the ASPA gene among non-Jewish patients are different and more diverse. In the present study, the ASPA gene was analysed in 22 unrelated non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease, and 24 different mutations were found. Of these, 14 are novel, including five missense mutations (E24G, D68A, D249V, C152W, H244R), two nonsense mutations (Q184X, E214X), three deletions (923delT, 33del13, 244delA), one insertion mutation (698insC), two sequence variations in one allele ([10T>G; 11insG]), an elimination of the stop codon (941A>G, TAG-->TGG, X314W), and one splice acceptor site mutation (IVS1 - 2A>T). The E24G mutation resulted in substitution of an invariable amino acid residue (Glu) in the first esterase catalytic domain consensus sequence. The IVS1 - 2A>T mutation caused the retention of 40 nucleotides of intron 1 upstream of exon 2. The results of transient expression of the mutant ASPA cDNA containing these mutations in COS-7 cells and assays for ASPA activity of patient fibroblasts indicated that these mutations were responsible for the enzyme deficiency. In addition, patients with the novel D249V mutation manifested clinically at birth and died early. Also, patients with certain other novel mutations, including C152W, E214X, X314W, and frame shift mutations in both alleles, developed clinical manifestations at an earlier age than in classical Canavan disease.","dc:creator":"Zeng BJ","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Identification and characterization of novel mutations of the aspartoacylase gene in non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12638939","rdfs:label":"Patent 14"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This patient, with Canavan disease, is homozygous for a stop loss variant, p.Ter314Trp, in ASPA.

Hence, these results are included here, under Biochemical Evidence.\nThe authors showed that ASPA is exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes and that these cells are at the root of Canavan disease pathology. Transgenic mice with extra copies of the Nat8l gene (involved in NAA synthesis), under the neuronal Thy-1 promoter and in the Aspa WT background (ThyNAT mice), did not show signs of neurotoxicity even though they had higher NAA levels in the cortex than ASPA knock out mice. In these mice, NAA accumulation does not occur in oligodendrocytes due to normal ASPA function. Therefore, elevated NAA in the brain alone does not appear to be responsible for disease pathology. Rather, NAA toxicity appears to depend on the lack of its degradation in oligodendocytes. This indicated that the normal ASPA activity in the oligodendrocytes of ThyNAT mice was able to keep oligodendrocyte NAA at normal concentrations, preventing disease.\nDeletion of the Aspa gene exclusively in oligodendrocytes triggered a Canavan disease-like pathology, with delayed progression and partially attenuated late-stage severity. The authors conclude that deficiency of ASPA, which causes a detrimental increase NAA in oligodendrocytes, is the root cause for Canavan disease pathology.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29116375","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is the second most abundant organic metabolite in the brain, but its physiological significance remains enigmatic. Toxic NAA accumulation appears to be the key factor for neurological decline in Canavan disease-a fatal neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the NAA-degrading enzyme aspartoacylase. To date clinical outcome of gene replacement therapy for this spongiform leukodystrophy has not met expectations. To identify the target tissue and cells for maximum anticipated treatment benefit, we employed comprehensive phenotyping of novel mouse models to assess cell type-specific consequences of NAA depletion or elevation. We show that NAA-deficiency causes neurological deficits affecting unconscious defensive reactions aimed at protecting the body from external threat. This finding suggests, while NAA reduction is pivotal to treat Canavan disease, abrogating NAA synthesis should be avoided. At the other end of the spectrum, while predicting pathological severity in Canavan disease mice, increased brain NAA levels are not neurotoxic per se. In fact, in transgenic mice overexpressing the NAA synthesising enzyme Nat8l in neurons, supra-physiological NAA levels were uncoupled from neurological deficits. In contrast, elimination of aspartoacylase expression exclusively in oligodendrocytes elicited Canavan disease like pathology. Although conditional aspartoacylase deletion in oligodendrocytes abolished expression in the entire CNS, the remaining aspartoacylase in peripheral organs was sufficient to lower NAA levels, delay disease onset and ameliorate histopathology. However, comparable endpoints of the conditional and complete aspartoacylase knockout indicate that optimal Canavan disease gene replacement therapies should restore aspartoacylase expression in oligodendrocytes. On the basis of these findings we executed an ASPA gene replacement therapy targeting oligodendrocytes in Canavan disease mice resulting in reversal of pre-existing CNS pathology and lasting neurological benefits. This finding signifies the first successful post-symptomatic treatment of a white matter disorder using an adeno-associated virus vector tailored towards oligodendroglial-restricted transgene expression.","dc:creator":"von Jonquieres G","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Uncoupling N-acetylaspartate from brain pathology: implications for Canavan disease gene therapy."},"rdfs:label":"Cell type specific ASPA-KO mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0a1a53b9-1c2a-4a6c-9102-eda3f4ef87d3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be10a9b6-f356-4c74-8442-d3fbc3908239","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The authors purified and sequenced purified fragments of bovine aspartoacylase protein and used that information to generate bovine ASPA-specific primers and isolated bovine ASPA cDNA.

Aspartoacylase has been purified to apparent homogeneity with a specific activity of approximately 19,000-20,000 nmol of aspartate released/mg of protein. The native enzyme is a 58-kDa monomer. The purified aspartoacylase activity is enhanced by divalent cations, nonionic detergents, and dithiothreitol. Low levels of dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol are required for enzyme stability. Aspartoacylase has a Km of 8.5 x 10(-4) M and a Vmax of 43,000 nmol/min/mg of protein. Inhibition of aspartoacylase by glycyl-L-aspartate and amino derivatives of D-aspartic acid suggests that the carbon backbone of the substrate is primarily involved in its interaction with the active site and that a blocked amino group is essential for the catalytic activity of aspartoacylase. Biochemical and immunocytochemical studies revealed that aspartoacylase is localized to white matter, whereas the N-acetylaspartic acid concentration is threefold higher in gray matter than in white matter.

NAA appears to be synthesized exclusively in neurons. NAA and its related dipeptide N‐acetyl‐aspartyl‐glutamate (NAAG) are transported from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space by transporters, and NAA is taken up by oligodendrocytes through a dicarboxylic acid transporter prior to being hydrolyzed by ASPA (see Figure 4). Of note, the precise function of NAA in the central nervous system remains unknown. Several theories for the pathogenesis of Canavan disease are discussed including that the conversion of NAA to acetate is important in the production of myelin (therefore lack of acetate due to deficiency of ASPA could cause the neurodegeneration see in Canavan disease), and that abnormal acetylation of histones (again due to lack of acetate) may be the cause of previously noted abnormal gene expression within the brain. It has also been suggested that elevated NAA in the brain may result in abnormal osmotic pressure causing the spongy degeneration, fluid accumulation, vacuolation, and swollen astrocytes observed in Canavan disease, but this remains debatable.\nIn summary, this review article not only cites evidence for the biochemical function of ASPA but also discusses how deficiency of ASPA and resultant elevation of NAA and lack of acetate may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24977939","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Canavan disease (CD) is a genetic neurodegenerative leukodystrophy that results in the spongy degeneration of white matter in the brain. CD is characterized by mutations in the gene encoding aspartoacylase (ASPA), the substrate enzyme that hydrolyzes N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) to acetate and aspartate. Elevated NAA and subsequent deficiency in acetate associated with this disease cause progressive neurological symptoms, such as macrocephaly, visuocognitive dysfunction, and psychomotor delay. The prevalence of CD is higher among Ashkenazi Jewish people, and several types of mutations have been reported in the gene coding ASPA. Highly elevated NAA is more specific to CD than other leukodystrophies, and an examination of urinary NAA concentration is useful for diagnosing CD. Many researchers are now examining the mechanisms responsible for white matter degeneration or dysmyelination in CD using mouse models, and several persuasive hypotheses have been suggested for the pathophysiology of CD. One is that NAA serves as a water pump; consequently, a disorder in NAA catabolism leads to astrocytic edema. Another hypothesis is that the hydrolyzation of NAA in oligodendrocytes is essential for myelin synthesis through the supply of acetate. Although there is currently no curative therapy for CD, dietary supplements are candidates that may retard the progression of the symptoms associated with CD. Furthermore, gene therapies using viral vectors have been investigated using rat models. These therapies have been found to be tolerable with no severe long-term adverse effects, reduce the elevated NAA in the brain, and may be applied to humans in the future.

Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy, characterized by fatal spongiform encephalopathy of the brain. For most affected patients, onset of symptoms occurs in the first months of life, with hypotonia, macrocephaly, developmental delays, and seizures. These children usually pass away in early childhood. Later onset, milder forms of the condition have also been described (Matalon et al, 2018, PMID 20301412). Canavan disease is most prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, but has been reported in individuals of many different ethnicities (Matalon et al, 2018, PMID 20301412). ASPA, the gene implicated in Canavan disease, encodes aspartoacylase, an enzyme that converts N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) into acetate and aspartic acid. In patients with Canavan disease, NAA is elevated in patient urine and blood. The disease mechanism is loss of function.\nBiallelic variants in ASPA were first reported in patients with Canavan disease in 1993 (Kaul et al, PMID 8252036). Since then, about 70 variants in ASPA have been associated with Canavan disease (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/ASPA/unique), including two variants, p.Gla285Ala and p.Tyr231Ter, that together account for 98% of alleles in Ashkenazi Jewish patients, and another variant, p.Ala305Glu, that accounts for 30-60% of alleles in non-Jewish patients (Matalon et al, 2018, PMID 20301412).\nThe relationship between ASPA and Canavan disease is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Sixteen unique variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) in 16 probands from 7 publications were curated (Kaul et al, 1993, PMID 8252036; Kaul et al, 1994, PMID 8023850; Kaul et al, 1996, PMID 8659549; Zen et al, 2002, PMID 12638939; Janson et al, 2006, PMID 16437572; Mendes et al, 2017, PMID 28101991; Froukh, 2019, PMID 30834272). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of ASPA, which is consistent with the biochemical findings and disease process in patients (Kaul et al, 1991, PMID 1987315; Kaul et al 1993, PMID 8252036; Hoshino and Kubota et al, 2014, PMID 24977939 von Jonquieres et al, 2018, PMID  29116375), the features of a mouse model, Deaf14, which is homozygous for a nonsense variant in Aspa (Carpinelli et al, 2014, PMID 24682784), and gene therapy studies in mice and humans (Leone et al, 2012, PMID 23253610; Carpanelli et al, 2014, PMID 24682784). Further evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\nIn summary, ASPA is definitively associated with Canavan disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:66306eff-659f-4508-a41b-1820e47e0e1d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
