is an inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization and a deficiency of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) activity. The disease is highly variable in its clinical expression, because of various mutations in the TNSALP gene. In approximately 14% of the patients tested in our laboratory, only one TNSALP gene mutation was found, despite exhaustive sequencing of the gene, suggesting that missing mutations are harbored in intron or regulatory sequences or that the disease is dominantly transmitted. The distinction between these two situations is of importance, especially in terms of genetic counseling, but dominance is sometimes difficult to conclusively determine by using familial analysis since expression of the disease may be highly variable, with parents of even severely affected children showing no or extremely mild symptoms of the disease. We report here the study of eight point mutations (G46 V, A99T, S164L, R167 W, R206 W, G232 V, N461I, I473F) found in patients with no other detectable mutation. Three of these mutations, G46 V, S164L, and I473F, have not previously been described. Pedigree and/or serum alkaline phosphatase data suggested possible dominant transmission in families with A99T, R167 W, and G232 V. By means of site-directed mutagenesis, transfections in COS-1 cells, and three-dimensional (3D) modeling, we evaluated the possible dominant effect of these eight mutations. The results showed that four of these mutations (G46 V, A99T, R167 W, and N461I) exhibited a negative dominant effect by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the heterodimer, whereas the four others did not show such inhibition. Strong inhibition resulted in severe hypophosphatasia, whereas partial inhibition resulted in milder forms of the disease. Analysis of the 3D model of the enzyme showed that mutations exhibiting a dominant effect were clustered in two regions, viz., the active site and an area probably interacting with a region having a particular biological function such as dimerization, tetramerization, or membrane anchoring.","dc:creator":"Lia-Baldini AS","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A molecular approach to dominance in

(HPP) is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by low tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) typically caused by ALPL gene mutations. HPP is heterogeneous, with clinical presentation correlating with residual TNSALP activity and/or dominant-negative effects (DNE). We measured residual activity and DNE for 155 ALPL variants by transient transfection and TNSALP enzymatic activity measurement. Ninety variants showed low residual activity and 24 showed DNE. These results encompass all missense variants with carrier frequencies above 1/25,000 from the Genome Aggregation Database. We used resulting data as a reference to develop a new computational algorithm that scores ALPL missense variants and predicts high/low TNSALP enzymatic activity. Our approach measures the effects of amino acid changes on TNSALP dimer stability with a physics-based implicit solvent energy model. We predict mutation deleteriousness with high specificity, achieving a true-positive rate of 0.63 with false-positive rate of 0, with an area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.9, better than all in silico predictors tested. Combining this algorithm with other in silico approaches can further increase performance, reaching an AUC of 0.94. This study expands our understanding of HPP heterogeneity and genotype/phenotype relationships with the aim of improving clinical ALPL variant interpretation.","dc:creator":"Del Angel G","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Large-scale in vitro functional testing and novel variant scoring via protein modeling provide insights into alkaline phosphatase activity in hypophosphatasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160374","rdfs:label":"ID-265"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Dominant negative effect shown (37.9% of WT activity)"},{"id":"cggv:eb00ef89-9191-402b-90b0-33ba0c08122a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:530e1421-7785-4a75-8ff8-c0b407e00b3d","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:eb00ef89-9191-402b-90b0-33ba0c08122a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:7f6776f7-6f3b-470f-8126-2834ebc7c54a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.1250A>G (p.Asn417Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA199266"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388","rdfs:label":"Patient 6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6ebee93f-7567-4953-8378-1a2b59b1310b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2551ed80-e9c4-4bb0-8320-bf7059a427a9","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with childhood HPP","secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:6ebee93f-7567-4953-8378-1a2b59b1310b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:553e64d5-b9bf-432c-b60b-bb9fed30f841","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.299C>T (p.Thr100Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338877051"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388","rdfs:label":"Patient 11"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Dominant negative effect shown in COS cells (28.2% compared to WT)"},{"id":"cggv:e3e53953-3050-439a-bb69-4be13532bbb5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42640b47-e2a0-4e1b-8317-f0ac60fa835d","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:e3e53953-3050-439a-bb69-4be13532bbb5_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5b8e9f60-256d-442c-a411-8de67a168ace","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.1285G>A (p.Glu429Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/558387"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388","rdfs:label":"Patient 18"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Dominant negative effect shown in COS cells (31% compared to WT)"},{"id":"cggv:dcc3881f-b2cf-47bd-94ed-e45e34464cd2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed0e5e7f-3907-42d0-b0ba-9aaa8aa0fb4d","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"diagnosed with childhood hypophosphatasia, specific phenotypes not provided","secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:dcc3881f-b2cf-47bd-94ed-e45e34464cd2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4c0b0dff-5385-403b-9d4e-7a406739744e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.1366G>T (p.Gly456Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338882045"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500388","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The dominant negative effect was measured by co-transfecting wild type (WT) and mutant cDNAs in COS cells and assaying the AP activity.

Although the disease is usually autosomal recessive, an autosomal dominant form is also recognized. Approximately 50 mutations have been found in the TNSALP gene in patients with hypophosphatasia. However, the mutations identified to date do not seem to account for the dominantly inherited form of the disease. We have examined a German family in which the father and all 4 children were affected with hypophosphatasia, whereas the mother was healthy. The affected members of this family showed premature loss of deciduous teeth at or shortly before 2 yr of age and low levels of serum ALP with elevated levels of urinary phosphoethanolamine. DNA analysis by direct sequencing revealed a heterozygous missense mutation that caused the conversion of amino acid Asp to Val at position 361 (D361V) in the patients. Another substitution was detected in exon 12 (Val to Ala conversion at codon 505: V505A) in 1 allele of the mother and 3 children, indicating no association of the substitution with the disease. Reconstruction experiments demonstrated that the D361V mutant protein lost its enzymatic activity and that it inhibited the function of wild-type enzyme when coexpressed in COS-7 cells. On the other hand, the V505A mutant exhibited enzymatic activities equal to those of the wild-type ALP. It is likely that the mutant D361V protein forms dimers with the wild-type protein, and the protein-protein interaction contributes to the dominant effect of the mutant D361V. The mutation that causes D361V is the first one proven to be associated with the dominant form of hypophosphatasia.","dc:creator":"Müller HL","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Asp361Val Mutant of alkaline phosphatase found in patients with dominantly inherited hypophosphatasia inhibits the activity of the wild-type enzyme."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10690885","rdfs:label":"Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Mutant showed decreased activities in COS cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7},{"id":"cggv:52e23281-c9c5-42fe-a089-2652c3b849f8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:52e23281-c9c5-42fe-a089-2652c3b849f8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:919ff0dd-2fa2-4a72-a467-f17dd736c0af","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:582a69e3-7961-4caf-b977-487c07d5b0fe","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both humans and sheep experience dental abnormalities","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25716980","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in ALPL result in hypophosphatasia (HPP), a disease causing defective skeletal mineralization. ALPL encodes tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme that promotes mineralization by reducing inorganic pyrophosphate, a mineralization inhibitor. In addition to skeletal defects, HPP causes dental defects, and a mild clinical form of HPP, odontohypophosphatasia, features only a dental phenotype. The Alpl knockout (Alpl (-/-)) mouse phenocopies severe infantile HPP, including profound skeletal and dental defects. However, the severity of disease in Alpl (-/-) mice prevents analysis at advanced ages, including studies to target rescue of dental tissues. We aimed to generate a knock-in mouse model of odontohypophosphatasia with a primarily dental phenotype, based on a mutation (c.346G>A) identified in a human kindred with autosomal dominant odontohypophosphatasia. Biochemical, skeletal, and dental analyses were performed on the resulting Alpl(+/A116T) mice to validate this model. Alpl(+/A116T) mice featured 50% reduction in plasma ALP activity compared with wild-type controls. No differences in litter size, survival, or body weight were observed in Alpl(+/A116T) versus wild-type mice. The postcranial skeleton of Alpl(+/A116T) mice was normal by radiography, with no differences in femur length, cortical/trabecular structure or mineral density, or mechanical properties. Parietal bone trabecular compartment was mildly altered. Alpl(+/A116T) mice featured alterations in the alveolar bone, including radiolucencies and resorptive lesions, osteoid accumulation on the alveolar bone crest, and significant differences in several bone properties measured by micro-computed tomography. Nonsignificant changes in acellular cementum did not appear to affect periodontal attachment or function, although circulating ALP activity was correlated significantly with incisor cementum thickness. The Alpl(+/A116T) mouse is the first model of odontohypophosphatasia, providing insights on dentoalveolar development and function under reduced ALP, bringing attention to direct effects of HPP on alveolar bone, and offering a new model for testing potential dental-targeted therapies in future studies.

Moderate hypophosphatasia is a rare, moderate form of hypophosphatasia characterized by defective mineralization of bone and/or teeth, premature loss of teeth with intact roots, and reduced serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Individuals can present with this form of hypophosphatasia in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Based upon the severity and mode of inheritance of the hypophosphatasia clinical subtypes, the curations for autosomal recessive severe hypophosphatasia, autosomal recessive moderate hypophosphatasia, and autosomal dominant mild hypophosphatasia have been split and curated separately (PMID: 32973344). Twenty-one variants (missense) that have been reported in 21 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 10690885, 11479741, 19500388, 18340466, 32160374) are included in this curation. The mechanism of disease is reported to be dominant negative. This gene-disease association is also supported by two animal models (PMID: 25716980, 30446691). In summary, ALPL is definitively associated with autosomal dominant moderate hypophosphatasia.
