Patients in some families develop many tumors at an early age and have rapid clinical progression, whereas in other families, patients may not have symptoms until much later and vestibular schwannomas may be the only tumors. The NF2 gene has been cloned from chromosome 22q; most identified germ-line mutations result in a truncated protein and severe NF2. To look for additional mutations and clinical correlations, we used SSCP analysis to screen DNA from 32 unrelated patients. We identified 20 different mutations in 21 patients (66%): 10 nonsense mutations, 2 frameshifts, 7 splice-site mutations, and 1 large in-frame deletion. Clinical information on 47 patients from the 21 families included ages at onset and at diagnosis, numbers of meningiomas, spinal and skin tumors, and presence of cataracts and retinal abnormalities. We compared clinical findings in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations to those with splice-site mutations. When each patient was considered as an independent random event, the two groups differed (P < or = .05) for nearly every variable. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were younger at onset and at diagnosis and had a higher frequency and mean number of tumors, supporting the correlation between nonsense and frameshift mutations and severe NF2. When each family was considered as an independent random event, statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed only for mean ages at onset and at diagnosis. A larger data set is needed to resolve these discrepancies. We observed retinal hamartomas and/or epiretinal membranes in nine patients from five families with four different nonsense mutations. This finding, which may represent a new genotype-phenotype correlation, merits further study.","dc:creator":"Parry DM","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Germ-line mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 gene: correlations with disease severity and retinal abnormalities."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8751853","rdfs:label":"G5722"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The variant in this individuals (and family) is an in frame deletion.

The NF2 gene has recently been isolated and found to encode a new member of the protein 4.1 family of cytoskeletal associated proteins, which we have named merlin. To define the molecular basis of NF2 in affected individuals, we have used SSCP analysis to scan the exons of the NF2 gene from 33 unrelated patients with NF2. Twenty unique SSCP variants were seen in 21 patients; 10 of these individuals were known to be the only affected person in their kindred, while 7 had at least one other known affected relative. In all cases in which family members were available, the SSCP variant segregated with the disease; comparison of sporadic cases with their parents confirmed the de novo variants. DNA sequence analysis revealed that 19 of the 20 variants observed are predicted to lead to a truncated protein due to frameshift, creation of a stop codon, or interference with normal RNA splicing. A single patient carried a 3-bp deletion removing a phenylalanine residue. We conclude that the majority of NF2 patients carry an inactivating mutation of the NF2 gene and that neutral polymorphism in the gene is rare.","dc:creator":"MacCollin

Two isoforms of merlin have been described which differ by the presence (type 2 merlin) or absence (type 1 merlin) of exon 16 sequences inserted into the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein. To determine the role of this important negative growth regulator during normal embryonic development, the expression of these two merlin isoforms was examined at representative stages of rat embryogenesis and in adult tissues. Partial sequence analysis of the rat merlin gene demonstrated striking amino acid identity to the published mouse and human merlin gene sequences. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that rat merlin is widely expressed during embryogenesis and early postnatal life in most tissues but becomes restricted to the brainstem, cerebellum, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, adrenal gland and testis in adult animals. The elucidation of the pattern of merlin gene expression in adult and embryonic tissues provides the foundations for future studies aimed at determining the function(s) of this protein during cell differentiation and embryonic development.","dc:creator":"Gutmann DH","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Expression of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene isoforms during rat embryonic development."},"rdfs:label":"Merlin expression during rat development"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a185a859-a499-4c4a-bebe-996b16fb3cf3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1864aed3-abed-47ef-9951-a1d0761de6b3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:70642ad8-739a-48fa-8598-591a38a101ea","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Paxillin is a scaffolding protein that anchors the p21-activated kinase (PAK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), as well as other rac signaling proteins.

To test directly whether merlin inactivation promotes invasion in a nonmalignant system, we used small interfering RNA to silence Nf2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and found that downregulation of merlin resulted in enhanced cell spreading and invasion. To delineate signaling events connected with this phenotype, we investigated the effect of merlin expression on focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key component of cellular pathways affecting migration and invasion. Expression of merlin attenuated FAK phosphorylation at the critical phosphorylation site Tyr397 and disrupted the interaction of FAK with its binding partners Src and p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. In addition, NF2-null MM cells stably overexpressing FAK showed increased invasiveness, which decreased significantly when merlin expression was restored.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is characterized by the formation of benign bilateral or unilateral tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, gliomas, and/or neurofibromas) in the central nervous, most commonly on the eighth cranial nerve (reviewed on www.ctf.org). Current evidence suggests a prevalence of Neurofibromatosis type 2 of 1 in 25,000 (www.ctf.org).

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, functional data, and model organisms. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for more than 20 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data is available and the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) and experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. In particular, earlier compelling evidence suggestive of the gene-disease relationship, such as linkage data, may not be reflected in the current curation.\n\n\nThe mechanism for the gene-disease relationship is protein loss of function, as the NF2 protein product, termed Merlin or Schwannomin, is a tumor suppressor protein (Trofatter et al., 1993; PMID: 8453669). NF2 tumor suppressor function is regulated by the protein confirmation, with the closed form acting as the active tumor suppressor form (reviewed in Cooper and Giancotti, 2014 PMID:24726726). \n\nNF2 has been associated with multiple disease entities and/or phenotypes, including: \n(1) Meningioma, NF2-related, somatic (MIM: 607174)\n(2) Schwannomatosis, somatic\n\nOf note, these other phenotypes are noted as somatic, and therefore are not represented/ counted in this gene-disease relationship, and will be assessed separately. \n\n\nIn summary, NF2 is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant Neurofibromatosis Type 2.
