Mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 (∼85% and ∼15% of resolved cases, respectively) are the known causes of ADPKD. Extrarenal manifestations include an increased level of intracranial aneurysms and polycystic liver disease (PLD), which can be severe and associated with significant morbidity. Autosomal-dominant PLD (ADPLD) with no or very few renal cysts is a separate disorder caused by PRKCSH, SEC63, or LRP5 mutations. After screening, 7%-10% of ADPKD-affected and ∼50% of ADPLD-affected families were genetically unresolved (GUR), suggesting further genetic heterogeneity of both disorders. Whole-exome sequencing of six GUR ADPKD-affected families identified one with a missense mutation in GANAB, encoding glucosidase II subunit α (GIIα). Because PRKCSH encodes GIIβ, GANAB is a strong ADPKD and ADPLD candidate gene. Sanger screening of 321 additional GUR families identified eight further likely mutations (six truncating), and a total of 20 affected individuals were identified in seven ADPKD- and two ADPLD-affected families. The phenotype was mild PKD and variable, including severe, PLD. Analysis of GANAB-null cells showed an absolute requirement of GIIα for maturation and surface and ciliary localization of the ADPKD proteins (PC1 and PC2), and reduced mature PC1 was seen in GANAB(+/-) cells. PC1 surface localization in GANAB(-/-) cells was rescued by wild-type, but not mutant, GIIα. Overall, we show that GANAB mutations cause ADPKD and ADPLD and that the cystogenesis is most likely driven by defects in PC1 maturation.","dc:creator":"Porath B","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in GANAB, Encoding the Glucosidase IIα Subunit, Cause Autosomal-Dominant Polycystic Kidney and Liver Disease."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27259053","rdfs:label":"M263_II-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The variant is predicted to be pathogenic by in-silico tools (including conservation in multi-sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins orthologous to yeast and related glucosidases) and  experimental evidence suggests that the variant causes the disruption of PC1 maturation."},{"id":"cggv:ea0c85e2-f1e0-4904-ae09-e8381808604b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9b83e14-a352-4731-8861-470303c5b55b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":43,"detectionMethod":"Variant mining on whole exome sequencing data and variants filtered based on criteria: (1) quality filter of read depth ≥ 10× and genotype quality ≥ 20, (2) selection according to autosomal-dominant sample genotype pattern, (3) removal of Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Browser variants with a minor allele frequency > 0.1%, and (4) characterization of coding and non-coding SNVs within 14 bp of the splice site and subsequent removal of SNPs predicted to be neutral by one or more of six dbNSFP tools (SIFT, PolyPhen-2 HVAR, MutationTaster, Mutation Assessor, FATHMM, and FATHMM MKL) and dbscSNV (removal of SNVs with Ada and RF scores < 0.6).

We inactivated these candidate genes in cell line models to show that loss of function of each results in defective maturation and trafficking of polycystin-1, the central determinant of cyst pathogenesis.
