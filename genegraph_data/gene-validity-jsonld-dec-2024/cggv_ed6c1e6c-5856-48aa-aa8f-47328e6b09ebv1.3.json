Previously, we reported three species of human GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA in a human liver cDNA library (Togari, A., Ichinose, H., Matsumoto, S., Fujita, K., and Nagatsu, T. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 187, 359-365). Furthermore, very recently, we found that the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene is causative for hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation, also known as DOPA-responsive dystonia (Ichinose, H., Ohye, T., Takahashi, E., Seki, N., Hori, T., Segawa, M., Nomura, Y., Endo, K., Tanaka, H., Tsuji, S., Fujita, K., and Nagatsu, T. (1994) Nature Genetics 8, 236-242). To clarify the mechanisms that regulate transcription of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene and to generate multiple species of mRNA, we isolated genomic DNA clones for the human and mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I genes. Structural analysis of the isolated clones revealed that the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene is encoded by a single copy gene and is composed of six exons spanning approximately 30 kilobases. We sequenced all exon/intron boundaries of the human and mouse genes. Structural analysis also demonstrated that the heterogeneity of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA is caused by an alternative usage of the splicing acceptor site at the sixth exon. The transcription start site of the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene and the 5'-flanking sequences of the mouse and human genes were determined. We performed regional mapping of the mouse gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene was assigned to region C2-3 of mouse chromosome 14. We identified missense mutations in patients with GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency and expressed mutated enzymes in Escherichia coli to confirm alterations in the enzyme activity.","dc:creator":"Ichinose H","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Characterization of mouse and human GTP cyclohydrolase I genes.

The high serum phenylalanine level was decreased to normal after adequate BH4 oral supplementation. Serum and urinary pteridine examination revealed very low levels of neopterin and biopterin. Sequence analysis of GCH1 revealed compound heterozygous point mutations, including a novel point mutation (p.R235W). Replacement therapy with BH4 and L-dopa/carbidopa were started at the age of 1month, and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was started at the age of 5months. At 10months of age, the patient showed slight dystonia but no obvious developmental delay. Cerebrospinal fluid should be examined to determine the appropriate dosage of supplement drugs. In conclusion, it is important to control the serum phenylalanine level and perform early replacement of neurotransmitters to prevent neurological dysfunction.

Patients who are monoallelic for GCH1 deleterious variants may develop dopa-responsive dystonia. In these patients, the GTPCH deficiency leads to deficiency of L-dopa (resulting from reduced activity of tyrosine hydroxylase), and the clinical features of dystonia. Hence, treatment with L-dopa typically results in resolution of the phenotype.

Hyperphenylalaninemia is present at birth in human infants with severe GTPCH deficiency as a result of low PAH activity, but is not present in human patients with residual GTPCH activity. There is transient postnatal hyperphe in hph-1 mice, but this normalized a few weeks after birth after accumulation of BH4 in the liver.

This is also noted in human individuals with GTPCH deficiency, even if they do not have ver hyperphenylalaninemia. In brain of hph-1 mice, levels of BH4 were about 40% normal, and there were significant decreases in serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and their major metabolites, 5-HIAA, homovanillic acid, and MHPG. Decreases in these neurotansmitters and their metabolites is also observed in humans with GCTPCH deficiency. Unlike humans with GTPCH deficiency, Hph-1 animals do not show any signs of a movement disorder, but more detailed studies are required to investigate this issue. Of note, there is lack of penetrance dystonia in human individuals with monoallelic variants in GCH1.

However, the variant localizes to an interval of 1.6-2.8 Mb on chromosome 14 which contains the murine Gch1 gene.

GCH1 encodes GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) which catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of BH4, a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, trypthophan hydroxylase, and phenylalanine hydroxylase. \n\n\nLumping and splitting:\nMonoallelic variants in GCH1 have been associated with dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD, also known as hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation, Segawa syndrome, dystonia 5). DRD is characterized by childhood-onset dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation, and a dramatic and sustained response to relatively low doses of levodopa (Furukawa, 2019, PMID: 20301681). Individuals with monoallelic variants in GCH1 typically have less than 50% GTPCH activity, leading to the suggestion that there may be a dominant negative effect from the altered protein and/or mRNA (Hirano et al, 1988, PMID 9749603; Suzuki et al, 1999, PMID 10582612; Hwu et al, 2000, PMID 11026444; Garavaglia et al, 2004, PMID 15303002). Biallelic variants in GCH1 typically result in severe deficiency of GTPCH activity, and result in hyperphenylalaninemia due to secondary PAH deficiency. This can be identified by newborn screening. However, patients with phenotypes that are intermediate between the classic DRD and severe GTPCH deficiency symptoms have been described, such those with severe DRD and additional neurological features but without hyperphenylalaninemia (for review, see Table in Brüggemann et al 2012, PMID 22473768). Because the mechanism of disease in both the monoallelic and biallelic cases is loss of function of GTPCH, and there is a range of GTPCH activity that can cause disease, the decision was made to curate  GCH1 for GTPCH deficiency with semi-dominant inheritance. Note that heterozygous parents of biallelic individuals are usually reported as unaffected, although there are some exceptions (Furukawa et al, 1998, PMID 9667588; Bodzioch et al, 2010, PMID 20842687). Reduced penetrance has been reported for individuals with monoallelic GCH1 variants, with penetrance varying according to age and diagnostic criteria. In addition, some variants (e.g. p.Arg184His and p.Lys224Arg) have been reported in monallelic and biallelic individuals. This data was presented to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group on November 3, 2020 and there was agreement that GTPCH deficiency should be curated as a semi-dominant trait, including individuals with monoallelic and biallelic GCH1 variants.\n\n\nClinical Validity Summary:\nThe relationship between GCH1 and GTPCH deficiency is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Monoallelic variants in GCH1 were first reported in individuals with DRD in 1994 (Ichinose et al, PMID 7874165) and biallelic variants in 1995 (Blau et al, PMID 7869202). More than 100 variants have been reported to be associated with GTPCH deficiency.\nIn this curation, twenty four unique variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, splice site) in 22 probands (14 monoallelic, 8 biallelic) from 11 publications were included (Ichinose et al, 1994, PMID 7874165; Blau et al, 1995, PMID 7869202; Ichinose et al, 1005, PMID  7730309; Bandmann et al, 1998, PMID 9778264; Furukawa et al, 1998, PMID 9667588; Hwu et al, 1999, PMID 10987649; Hahn et al, 2001, PMID 11346370; Nardocci et al, 2003, PMID 12552057; Trender-Gerhard et al, 2009, PMID 19332422; Sato et al, 2014, PMID 23660475; Dobričić et al, 2017, PMID 28958832). The data includes a large family demonstrating segregation of a variant with monoallelic DRD (Hahn et al, 2001, PMID 11346370). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of GTPCH, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical abnormalities observed in these patients (Burg and Brown, 1968, PMID 4296838; Wijemanne and Jankovic, 2015, PMID 26100751), and various mouse models including a GTPCH null mouse (Douglas et al, 2015, PMID 25557619), ethyl nitroso urea-generated hph-1 mouse (Hyland et al, 2003, PMID 12891653), and a mouse with a knock in missense variant analogous to a variant identified in a human patient (Jiang et al, 2019, PMID 30742839). In summary, GCH1 is definitively associated with GTPCH deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ed6c1e6c-5856-48aa-aa8f-47328e6b09eb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
