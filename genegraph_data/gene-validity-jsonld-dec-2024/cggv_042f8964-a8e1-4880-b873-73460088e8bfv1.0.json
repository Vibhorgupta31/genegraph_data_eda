Of the 21 Czech and Slovak patients who have been diagnosed with MPS I in the last 30 years, 16 have a severe clinical presentation (Hurler syndrome), 2 less severe manifestations (Scheie syndrome), and 3 an intermediate severity (Hurler/Scheie phenotype). Mutation analysis was performed in 20 MPS I patients and 39 mutant alleles were identified. There was a high prevalence of the null mutations p.W402X (12 alleles) and p.Q70X (7 alleles) in this cohort. Four of the 13 different mutations were novel: p.V620F (3 alleles), p.W626X (1 allele), c.1727 + 2T > G (1 allele) and c.1918_1927del (2 alleles). The pathogenicity of the novel mutations was verified by transient expression studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Seven haplotypes were observed in the patient alleles using 13 intragenic polymorphisms. One of the two haplotypes associated with the mutation p.Q70X was not found in any of the controls. Haplotype analysis showed, that mutations p.Q70X, p.V620F, and p.D315Y probably have more than one ancestor. Missense mutations localized predominantly in the hydrophobic core of the enzyme are associated with the severe phenotype, whereas missense mutations localized to the surface of the enzyme are usually associated with the attenuated phenotypes.

Previous studies in Caucasian populations showed that (1) homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for the W402X and Q70X mutations are the common causes of MPS-I with a severe form (Hurler syndrome), and (2) the presence of R89Q may lead to a milder phenotype. We studied mutations in the IDUA gene from 19 MPS-I patients, including two pairs of siblings, with various clinical phenotypes (Hurler, 6 cases; Hurler/Scheie, 7 cases; Scheie, 6 cases). We report the presence of two common mutations that account for 42% of the 38 alleles in these patients. One is a novel 5-bp insertion between the thymidine at nt 704 and a cytosine at nt 705 (704ins5), which is seen only in the Japanese population. The other is a missense mutation, R89Q, which is also seen in Caucasians, although uncommonly. In the 19 Japanese MPS-I patients, the 704ins5 mutation accounted for 7 of 38 alleles (18%), while the R89Q accounted for 9 of 38 (24%). No Japanese patient was found to carry the W402X or Q70X alleles, the two most common MPS-I mutations in Caucasians. Homozygosity for the 704ins5 mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, and for the R89Q mutation with a mild phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for these two mutations produced an intermediate phenotype. Haplotype analysis using polymorphisms linked to the IDUA locus demonstrated that each mutation occurs on a different specific haplotype, suggesting that individuals with each of these common mutations derive from common founders.

IDUA encodes alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase results in the lysosomal accumulation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The resulting clinical phenotype, MPS 1, is a progressive multisystem disease. Historically, patients have been categorized as either Hurler (early onset, most severe), Scheie (later onset, least severe), or Hurler-Scheie (intermediate) phenotypes. However, the MPS 1 has a clinically continuous spectrum from severe to mild and, more recently, patients have been described as either “severe” or “attenuated” MPS 1 (see GeneReviews, Clarke, 2016, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1162/). Children with severe MPS1 may have nonspecific symptoms, such as umbilical or inguinal hernia, or frequent upper respiratory-tract infections in the first year of life. These children develop coarse of the facial features, gibbus deformity of the lower spine, progressive skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex), and decreased linear growth, as well as progressive and profound intellectual disability, and hearing loss. Death, usually caused by cardiorespiratory failure, typically occurs by age 10 years. The severity and rate of disease progression ranges in individuals with attenuated MPS1 from serious life-threatening complications leading to death in the second to third decades to a normal life span complicated by significant disability from progressive joint manifestations and cardiorespiratory disease. Learning difficulties are present in some individuals (from GeneReviews, Clarke, 2016, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1162/). Variants in IDUA were first reported in humans with MPS 1 in 1992 (Scott et al, PMID 1301196). Since then, over 200 variants in IDUA have been reported (PMID 29393969). The most commonly reported variants are p.Gln70Ter and p.Trp402Ter (PMID 29393969). The mechanism of disease is loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Thirteen variants in twelve probands from six publications were curated (Scott et al, 1992, PMID 1301196; Yamagishi et al, 1996, PMID 8664897; Vazna et al, 2009, PMID 19396826; Chkioua et al, 2011, PMID 22074387; Bertola et al, 2011, PMID 21394825; Ngiwsara et al, 2018, PMID 29282708) and included frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense, and stop loss variants. More information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the function of alpha-L-iduronidase, which is consistent with the accumulation of GAGs observed in patients (Dorfman et al, 1976, PMID  813230), functional studies in fibroblasts from patients with MPS 1 (Ashton et al, 1992, PMID 1550122), the biochemical and clinical features of a mouse model with a variant analogous to a human IDUA variant causing MPS1 (Wang et al, 2010, PMID 19751987), and the impact of enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, on clinical phenotype (Clarke et al, 2009, PMID 19117887). More information is available in the literature but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. In summary, IDUA is definitively associated with MPS 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
