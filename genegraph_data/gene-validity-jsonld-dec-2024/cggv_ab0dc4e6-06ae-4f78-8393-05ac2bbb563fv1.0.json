Impaired licensing of origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle has been implicated in Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a disorder defined by the triad of short stature, microtia, and a/hypoplastic patellae. Biallelic partial loss-of-function mutations in multiple components of the pre-replication complex (preRC; ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, or CDC6) as well as de novo stabilizing mutations in the licensing inhibitor, GMNN, cause MGS. Here we report the identification of mutations in CDC45 in 15 affected individuals from 12 families with MGS and/or craniosynostosis. CDC45 encodes a component of both the pre-initiation (preIC) and CMG helicase complexes, required for initiation of DNA replication origin firing and ongoing DNA synthesis during S-phase itself, respectively, and hence is functionally distinct from previously identified MGS-associated genes. The phenotypes of affected individuals range from syndromic coronal craniosynostosis to severe growth restriction, fulfilling diagnostic criteria for Meier-Gorlin syndrome. All mutations identified were biallelic and included synonymous mutations altering splicing of physiological CDC45 transcripts, as well as amino acid substitutions expected to result in partial loss of function. Functionally, mutations reduce levels of full-length transcripts and protein in subject cells, consistent with partial loss of CDC45 function and a predicted limited rate of DNA replication and cell proliferation. Our findings therefore implicate the preIC as an additional protein complex involved in the etiology of MGS and connect the core cellular machinery of genome replication with growth, chondrogenesis, and cranial suture homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Fenwick AL","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in CDC45, Encoding an Essential Component of the Pre-initiation Complex, Cause Meier-Gorlin Syndrome and Craniosynostosis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab0dc4e6-06ae-4f78-8393-05ac2bbb563f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab0dc4e6-06ae-4f78-8393-05ac2bbb563f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:196cc62d-11be-4805-b322-344467e1ec00","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1b428505-4067-4908-b0ec-ab62e76be4cc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Per GenCC database additional genes identified in association with Meier-Gorlin syndrome:\nCDC6 - Supportive by OrphaNet\nCDT1- Strong by Invitae, supportive by OrphaNet\nORC1- Definitive by TGMI, Strong by Ambry, Supportive by OrphaNet, Strong by Invite\nORC4- Def by TGMI, Moderate by Ambry, Strong by Invitae, Supportive by Orphanet\nORC6- Def by TGMI, Strong by Invitae, Supportive by OrphaNet\nGMNN- Strong by Invitae, supportive OrphaNet","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21358631","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Meier-Gorlin syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition whose primary clinical hallmarks include small stature, small external ears and small or absent patellae.

of the initiation of DNA replication is significantly associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGORS), an autosomal recessive condition of reduced growth, microtia and patellar a/hypoplasia. Biallelic mutations in CDC45, a member of the pre-initiation complex in DNA replication, cause a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from MGORS with craniosynostosis, through to isolated short stature and craniosynostosis. Here we report two affected sibs with MGORS and craniosynostosis, with biallelic variants in CDC45 identified by 10X Chromium whole genome sequencing. One variant is a frameshift mutation, predicted to be pathogenic, and is inherited in trans with a synonymous variant in a non-canonical exon (exon 7) of CDC45. An in vitro splicing assay showed that while the canonical CDC45 exon 6-exon 8 transcript (with skipping of exon 7; numbering as per NM001178010.2) remained as the predominant transcript, the variant allele induced the use of novel splice acceptor sites in intron 6, all of which produced transcripts harbouring premature stop codons. This perturbation of canonical splicing provides evidence that this synonymous variant is indeed a deleterious alteration in this family. This report adds to the initial patient cohort in which several synonymous variants were also described, further highlighting the contribution of this variant type in CDC45. It also reiterates the true potential pathogenicity of synonymous variants, which is a mutation type that is commonly ignored in variant prioritization strategies.","dc:creator":"Knapp KM","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A synonymous variant in a non-canonical exon of CDC45 disrupts splicing in two affected sibs with Meier-Gorlin syndrome with craniosynostosis."}},{"id":"cggv:50a7d334-c662-4dfb-97b8-240eaf6904aa_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4ef4ece9-7d1a-4deb-99fc-f485ad34acf1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33639314"}],"rdfs:label":"Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:cf872d70-0ac1-42c7-b6e4-0349b7354b1f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf872d70-0ac1-42c7-b6e4-0349b7354b1f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cf872d70-0ac1-42c7-b6e4-0349b7354b1f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Minigene splicing assay was used to evaluate the synonymous variant using HeLa cells.

CDC45 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Meier-Gorlin syndrome in 2016 (Fenwick et al., PMID: 27374770). Characteristic features for this disorder include craniosynostosis, microtia, short stature, and absent or small patellae. Additional features include microcephaly, Chiari malformation, mild to severe developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, cleft palate, feeding difficulties, anorectal malformations, joint laxity, delayed bone age, genital anomalies, gastro-esophageal reflux, syndactyly, digital clubbing, proptosis, thin eyebrows, ventricular septal defects, and hearing loss. At least 21 variants (including frameshift, stop-gained, intragenic deletion, splice region, and missense variants) have been reported in 14 individuals from four publications (PMID: 27374770; Ting et al., 2019, PMID: 30986546; Knapp et al. 2021, PMID: 33639314; Li et al. 2021, PMID: 34000999) and are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is presumed to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model and biochemical function (Yoshida et al., 2001, PMID: 11416137; Guernsey et al., 2011, PMID: 21358631). In summary, CDC45 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Meier-Gorlin syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 05Oct2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ab0dc4e6-06ae-4f78-8393-05ac2bbb563f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
