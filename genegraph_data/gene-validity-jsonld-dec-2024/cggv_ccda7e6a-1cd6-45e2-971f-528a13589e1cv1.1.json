Type A disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, whereas type B disease has no neurologic manifestations and is characterized primarily by reticuloendothelial involvement and survival into adulthood. Both disorders are more frequent among individual of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population. The recent isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic sequences encoding ASM has facilitated investigation of the molecular lesions causing the NPD subtypes. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the ASM cDNA from an Ashkenazi Jewish type A patient was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular analysis of the PCR products revealed a G----T transversion of nucleotide 1487, which occurred at a CpG dinucleotide and predicted an Arg----Leu substitution in residue 496. Hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotides indicated that the proband was homoallelic for the Arg----Leu substitution and that both parents and several other relatives were heterozygous. This mutation was detected in 32% (10 of 31) of the Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type A alleles studied and occurred in only 5.6% (2 of 36) of ASM alleles from non-Jewish type A patients. Of interest, the Arg----Leu substitution occurred in one of the ASM alleles from the two Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type B patients studied and in none of the ASM alleles of 15 non-Jewish type B patients. In contrast, the mutation was not present in 180 ASM alleles from normal individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. These findings identify a frequent missense mutation among NPD patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry that results in neuronopathic type A disease when homoallelic and can result in the nonneuronopathic type B phenotype when heteroallelic. The identification of this ASM mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish patients should facilitate the prevention of NPD in this population by carrier detection with molecular diagnostic techniques.","dc:creator":"Levran O","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Niemann-Pick disease: a frequent missense mutation in the acid sphingomyelinase gene of Ashkenazi Jewish type A and B patients."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ccda7e6a-1cd6-45e2-971f-528a13589e1c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ccda7e6a-1cd6-45e2-971f-528a13589e1c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5a7b7183-402c-4842-9df1-9e46a7d41bf4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6bb36767-49c8-4ba3-9e79-e0e604340c64","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, a major component of membranes, to ceramide and phosphorylcholine.

Enzymatic dysfunction of acid sphingomyelinase results in Niemann-Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized at the cellular level by accumulation of sphingomyelin within the endo-lysosomal compartment. Over the past decade interest in the role of acid sphingomyelinase has moved beyond its \"housekeeping\" function in constitutive turnover of sphingomyelin in the lysosome to include study of regulated ceramide generation. Ceramide functions as a bioactive sphingolipid with pleiotropic signaling properties, and has been implicated in diverse cellular processes of physiologic and pathophysiologic importance. Though many cellular enzymes have the capacity to generate ceramide,there is growing appreciation that \"all ceramides are not created equal.\" Ceramides likely exert distinct effects in different cellular/subcellular compartments by virtue of access to other sphingolipid enzymes (e.g.ceramidases), effector molecules (e.g. ceramide-activated protein phosphatases), and neighboring lipids and proteins (e.g. cholesterol, ion channels). One of the unique features of acid sphingomyelinase is that it has been implicated in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in three different settings--the endo-lysosomal compartment,the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and lipoproteins. How a single gene product has the capacity to function in these diverse settings, and the subsequent impact on downstream ceramide-mediated biology is the subject of this review.","dc:creator":"Jenkins RW","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Roles and regulation of secretory and lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase."},"rdfs:label":"Roles and regulation of ASM"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The score is increased based on the wealth of evidence for the role of ASM in Niemann-Pick Disease types A and B (acid sphnogomelinase deficiency) which has accumulated over the years.

The cDNA inserts had identical sequences with the exception of an internal region; type 1 cDNAs (representing approximately 90% of the ASM cDNAs isolated) had 172 in-frame base pairs (bp), which were replaced in the type 2 cDNAs by a 40-bp in-frame sequence. Northern hybridization and RNase protection studies indicated that both type 1 and 2 transcripts were approximately 2.5 kilobases; therefore, efforts were directed to isolate full-length type 1 and 2 cDNAs by screening human placental, testis, hepatoma, and retinal cDNA libraries. In addition to type 1 and 2 cDNAs, a new type of ASM cDNA (type 3), which did not contain the type 1- or 2-specific regions, was isolated and sequenced. The full-length type 1 and the reconstructed full-length type 2 and 3 cDNAs were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Only the full-length type 1 transcript encoded catalytically active human ASM, demonstrating its functional integrity. The 2347-bp full-length type 1 placental cDNA (pASM-1FL) had an 87-bp 5'-untranslated region, an 1890-bp open reading frame encoding 629 amino acids, and a 370-bp 3'-untranslated sequence. The predicted location of the signal peptide cleavage site was after alanine 46. Two base differences were identified in codons 322 and 506 and shown to be polymorphisms with the common alleles having frequencies of 0.6 and 0.7, respectively. To determine the genomic organization of the type 1, 2, and 3 sequences, a 1665-bp genomic region containing both the unique type 1 (172 bp) and type 2 (40 bp) sequences was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The 172-bp sequence was exonic, flanked by 5'- and 3'-intronic sequences of 1052 and 229 bp, respectively. The 40-bp type 2 sequence was intronic, occurring at the 5' end of the 1052-bp intron due to the use of a cryptic 5' donor splice site, which deleted the entire 172-bp exon and both flanking intronic sequences. The type 3 cDNA resulted from an alternative splicing event, which excised the 172-bp exon. These studies demonstrate the occurrence of alternatively splicing of the ASM transcript, but the existence of only one functional mRNA.","dc:creator":"Schuchman EH","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Human acid sphingomyelinase.

A Type A NPD patient of Asian Indian ancestry (proband 1) was homoallelic for a T to A transversion in exon 2 of the ASM gene which predicted a premature stop at codon 261 of the ASM polypeptide (designated L261X). In contrast, an unrelated Type A patient of European ancestry (proband 2) was heteroallelic for a two-base (TT) deletion in exon 2 which caused a frame-shift mutation at ASM codon 178 (designated fsL178), leading to a premature stop at codon 190, and a G to A transition in exon 3 which caused a methionine to isoleucine substitution at codon 382 (designated M382I). Transient expression of the fsL178, L261X, and M382I mutations in COS-1 cells demonstrated that these lesions did not produce catalytically active ASM, consistent with the severe neuronopathic Type A NPD phenotype. In contrast, an unrelated Type B patient of European descent (proband 3) was heteroallelic for two missense mutations, a G to A transition in exon 2 which predicted a glycine to arginine substitution at ASM codon 242 (designated G242R), and an A to G transition in exon 3 which resulted in an asparagine to serine substitution at codon 383 (designated N383S). Interestingly, the G242R allele produced ASM activity in COS-1 cells at levels about 40% of that expressed by the normal allele, thereby explaining the mild Type B phenotype of proband 3 and the high residual activity (i.e. approximately 15% of normal) in cultured lymphoblasts. In contrast, the N383S allele did not produce catalytically active enzyme. None of these five ASM mutations was detected in over 60 other unrelated NPD patients analyzed, nor were these mutations found in over 100 normal ASM alleles. Thus, small deletions or nonsense mutations which trunctated the ASM polypeptide, or missense mutations that rendered the enzyme noncatalytic, resulted in Type A NPD disease, whereas a missense mutation that produced a defective enzyme with residual catalytic activity caused the milder nonneuronopathic Type B phenotype.

In the present work we studied 18 patients with NPD type B, including five individuals who presented an intermediate phenotype characterised by different levels of neurological involvement. We identified nine novel mutations in the SMPD1 gene including six single base changes c.2T>G, c.96G>A, c.308T>C, c.674T>C, c.732G>C, c.841G>A (p.M1_W32del, p.W32X, p.L103P, p.L225P, p.W244C, p.A281T) and three frameshift mutations c.100delC, c.565dupC, c.575dupC (p.G34fsX42, p.P189fsX1 and p.P192fsX14). The novel c.2T>G (p.M1_W32del) mutation inactivates the first in-frame translation start site of the SMPD1 gene and in the homozygous status causes NPD type B indicating that in'vivo translation of wild type SMPD1 initiates from the first in-frame ATG. Moreover, the new c.96G>A (p.W32X) introduces a premature stop codon before the second in-frame ATG. As a consequence of either c.2T>G (p.M1_W32del) or c.96G>A (p.W32X), impaired translation from the first in-frame ATG results in a mild NPD-B phenotype instead of the severe phenotype expected for a complete deficiency of the enzyme, suggesting that when the first ATG is not functional, the second initiation codon (ATG33) still produces a fairly functional sphingomyelinase. Analysis of the patients'clinical and molecular data demonstrated that all five patients with the intermediate phenotype carried at least one severe mutation. No association between the onset of pulmonary symptoms and genotype was observed. Finally, the presence of c.96G>A (p.W32X), the most frequent allele among Italian NPD type B population, and c.1799G>C (p.R600P) as compound heterozygotes in association with severe mutations suggested a beneficial effect for both mutations.","dc:creator":"Pittis MG","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Acid sphingomyelinase: identification of nine novel mutations among Italian Niemann Pick type B patients and characterization of in vivo functional in-frame start codon."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 7"},{"id":"cggv:b72c22ba-ff9c-4daa-8977-b02e4f695142","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b72c22ba-ff9c-4daa-8977-b02e4f695142_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b72c22ba-ff9c-4daa-8977-b02e4f695142_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When COS-1 cells were transfected with the variant, no immunoreactive protein and no enzyme activity were detected (Fig 1 A and B) (PMID: 16010684)."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5e8d09d7-3875-48d4-90d2-b98b9c18d99e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5e8d09d7-3875-48d4-90d2-b98b9c18d99e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:814d49df-b20f-4e31-a69e-aa753b7d401d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000543.5(SMPD1):c.1493G>T (p.Arg498Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252505"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of SMPD1 from fibroblast cDNA followed by confirmation of the identified variant in genomic DNA.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease (acid sphingomelinase deficiency), no clinical details provided, approximately 1% normal ASM activity in cultured fibroblasts.","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Approximately 1% normal acid sphingomelinase activity in cultured fibroblasts.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:5c7d057e-2b7d-40e0-9e9e-b993886e7c0d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:814d49df-b20f-4e31-a69e-aa753b7d401d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023926"},"rdfs:label":"Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:5c7d057e-2b7d-40e0-9e9e-b993886e7c0d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c7d057e-2b7d-40e0-9e9e-b993886e7c0d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5c7d057e-2b7d-40e0-9e9e-b993886e7c0d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Note: the variant is described as p.Arg496Leu using older nomenclature. \nA human transgenes carrying the variant was constructed under the control of the mouse SMPD1 promoter and microinjected into blastocysts from ASM knock out mice.

These mutations included seven missense mutations: c.631T>C (p.W211R), c.757G>C (p.D253H), c.940G>A (p.V314M), c.1280A>G (p.H427R), c.1564A>G (p.N522S), c.1575G>C (p.Q525H) and c.1729A>G (p.H577R), and a novel frameshift mutation, c.1657delACCGCCT (fsT553). Each missense mutation was expressed in 293T or COS-7 cells; mutant enzymes p.W211R, p.D253H, p.H427R and p.H577R had <1% of expressed wild-type activity, whereas p.V314M, p.N522S and p.Q525H had 21.7%, 10.1% and 64% of expressed wild-type activity, respectively. The c.1564A>G mutation obliterated a known N-glycosylation site and its p.N522S mutant enzyme had ~10% of expressed wild-type activity. Western blot analysis revealed that each mutant protein was expressed at near wild-type amounts, despite their differences in residual activity. The novel seven-base deletion occurred at codon 553, leading to a premature truncation after residue 609. The expression studies predicted the clinical phenotypes of the six patients: two type A patients had genotypes with only type A alleles [c.631T>C (p.W211R), c.757G>C (p.D253H) and c.1729A>G (p.H577R)], and the other four type B disease patients had at least one neuroprotective mutant type B allele [c.940G>A (p.V314M), c.1280A>G (p.H427R), c.1564A>G (p.N522S) and c.1575G>C (p.Q525H)] that expressed >5% residual ASM activity. Thus, these new mutations provide novel genotype/phenotype correlations and further document the genetic heterogeneity in types A and B NPD.","dc:creator":"Desnick JP","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Identification and characterization of eight novel SMPD1 mutations causing types A and B Niemann-Pick disease."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:bd799922-354a-4cce-983d-3077743d17ab","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd799922-354a-4cce-983d-3077743d17ab_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:bd799922-354a-4cce-983d-3077743d17ab_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When expressed in COS-1 or HEK293 cells, the variant resulted in <5% wild type ASM activity."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Reduced because the individual is homozygous and there is no information regarding consanguinity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:212c03e0-1283-4fdf-a498-7e0d9c34c7dc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:212c03e0-1283-4fdf-a498-7e0d9c34c7dc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:eadcc4e5-b524-4eda-88c6-1ce5fdf5c92e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000543.5(SMPD1):c.538_539del (p.Leu180fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA274373"}},{"id":"cggv:c2110d5a-7f44-4864-ae6c-f4bf5f06cb0c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000543.5(SMPD1):c.1152G>A (p.Met384Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252515"}}],"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of the coding region of SMPD1 from genomic DNA.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Severe neurologic degeneration, death at age 4 years.","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"2% normal ASM activity in lymphoblasts (Table II).","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:c8eaa71a-a22f-46f7-b942-2211f953e6e8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c2110d5a-7f44-4864-ae6c-f4bf5f06cb0c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1618760"},{"id":"cggv:7b93bcd1-0257-4622-9d6f-ef5f8f06f703_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:eadcc4e5-b524-4eda-88c6-1ce5fdf5c92e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1618760"}],"rdfs:label":"Proband 2"},{"id":"cggv:c8eaa71a-a22f-46f7-b942-2211f953e6e8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8eaa71a-a22f-46f7-b942-2211f953e6e8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c8eaa71a-a22f-46f7-b942-2211f953e6e8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Note: This variant is desribed as p.M382I in the paper based on older nomenclature.\nWhen expresed in COS-1 cells this variant has <5% wild type activity."}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7b93bcd1-0257-4622-9d6f-ef5f8f06f703","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7b93bcd1-0257-4622-9d6f-ef5f8f06f703_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7b93bcd1-0257-4622-9d6f-ef5f8f06f703_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Note: The variant is described as fsL178 in the paper based on older nomenclature and numbering.\nWhen expressed in COS-1 cells, the variant results in <5% ASM activity."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4769,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e81dee1b-99ec-4d69-aef6-fff650b8ef8c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100464","gene":"hgnc:11120","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The relationship between SMPD1 and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 18, 2022. SMPD1 encodes acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), an enzyme found in lysosomes and in the extracellular space where it catalyzes the conversion of sphingomyelin, a major component of membranes, into ceramide and phosphocholine (Gorelik et al, 2016, PMID: 27435900).\n\nHistorically, biallelic variants in SMPD1 have been associated with Niemann-Pick disease types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease type A, the neurovisceral form, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with rapid neurological deterioration leading to death in the first few years of life. Niemann-Pick disease type B, a later-onset, chronic visceral form, is characterized by progressive visceral organ symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly and pulmonary insufficiency, and survival into adulthood. Some patients present with an intermediate phenotype, Niemann-Pick disease type A/B. Based on this clinical continuum of disease, these conditions are now described as “acid sphingomyelinase deficiency” (ASMD) (Wasserstein and Schuchman, 2021, PMID: 20301544). Indeed, per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern for Niemann-Pick disease types A and B. Therefore, these disease entities have been lumped under one disease entity, acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, for this curation. Of note, variants in SMPD1 have also been reported as risk factors for Parkinson disease (Ysselstein et al, 2019, PMID 30726573; Paciotti et al, 2020, PMID: 32098196). The relationship between SMPD1 and Parkinson disease was not assessed here but may be curated at a later date.\n\nBiallelic variants in SMPD1 were first reported in patients with ASMD in 1991 (Levran et al, PMID: 2023926; Felinz et al, PMID: 1718266). Since then, over 180 disease-associated variants have been reported (Zampieri et al, 2016, PMID: 26499107). In this curation, data on 10 unique variants (5 missense, 2 nonsense, 2 frameshift, 1 inframe deletion) from 8 probands from 5 publications were collected (Levran et al, 1991, PMID: 2023926; Takahashi et al, 1992, PMID: 1618760; Pittis et al, 2004, PMID: 15241805; Desnick et al, 2010, PMID: 20386867; Ordieres-Ortega et al, 2020, PMID: 32375665). The MANE reference sequence, NM_000543.4, was used. This leads to a shift of +2 amino acids for some published variants, particularly for variants in older literature, due to an leucine-alanine dipeptide within the polymorphic signal peptide (Zampieri et al, 2016, PMID: 26499107). ASMD is a pan-ethnic condition, but is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, associated with the founder variants c.996delC, p.Leu304Pro and p.Arg498Leu. The most frequently reported mutation worldwide is p.Arg610del, associated with a milder phenotype (Zampieri et al, 2016, PMID: 26499107; see Table 6 in Wasserstein and Schuchman, 2021, PMID: 20301544) ). The disease mechanism is loss of function. Further genetic evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of the gene product of SMPD1 (acid sphingomyelinase), which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Schuchman et al, 1991, PMID: 1840600; Jenkins et al, 2009, PMID: 19385042), the features of a knock out mouse model and a cat with ASM deficiency (Horinouchi et al, 1995, PMID: 7670466; Takaichi et al, 2020, PMID: 32347185), improvement in the clinical, biochemical and histological features in mice treated with AAV9-hASM gene therapy (Samaranch et al, 2019, PMID: 31434754), and adults with ASM deficiency treated with enzyme replacement therapy (Wasserstein et al, 2022, PMID: 35471153). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, SMPD1 is definitively associated with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ccda7e6a-1cd6-45e2-971f-528a13589e1c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
