A recessive mutation of ESPN is known to cause hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in the jerker mouse.

The abnormal vestibular phenotype associated with ESPN mutations will be a useful clinical marker for refining the differential diagnosis of non-syndromic deafness.","dc:creator":"Naz S","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mutations of ESPN cause autosomal recessive deafness and vestibular dysfunction."},"rdfs:label":"Naz Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9bdbd958-1ad2-447a-9ccd-ed86f308577a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9bdbd958-1ad2-447a-9ccd-ed86f308577a_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aab3710e-b014-4865-9c67-c9c005111e59_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:915e67c6-ea7e-45b4-a746-d4fee7465274","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"DHPLC","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Severe bilateral SNHL at all frequencies.

This association was made using case-level. At least 2 variants, a missense and an in-frame deletion, have been reported in humans. ESPN was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2006 (Donaudy et al.â€‹). Association is seen in at least 2 probands in 1 publication (15930085). This gene-disease association is supported by a relevant expression study (15286153). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association.
