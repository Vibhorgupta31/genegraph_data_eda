Here, we report a mutation screening in a case series of 347 unpublished patients, in which we identified 12 novel KDM6A mutations (KS type 2) and 208 mutations in KMT2D (KS type 1), 132 of them novel. Two of the KDM6A mutations were maternally inherited and nine were shown to be de novo. We give an up-to-date overview of all published mutations for the two KS genes and point out possible mutation hot spots and strategies for molecular genetic testing. We also report the clinical details for 11 patients with KS type 2, summarize the published clinical information, specifically with a focus on the less well-defined X-linked KS type 2, and comment on phenotype-genotype correlations as well as sex-specific phenotypic differences.

We now establish Kabuki syndrome as a neurocristopathy, whereby the majority of clinical features are modeled in mice carrying neural crest (NC) deletion of UTX, including craniofacial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, and postnatal growth retardation. Female UTX NC knockout (FKO) demonstrates enhanced phenotypic severity over males (MKOs), due to partial redundancy with UTY, a Y-chromosome demethylase-dead homolog. Thus, NC cells may require demethylase-independent UTX activity. Consistently, Kabuki causative point mutations upstream of the JmjC domain do not disrupt UTX demethylation. We have isolated primary NC cells at a phenocritical postmigratory timepoint in both FKO and MKO mice, and genome-wide expression and histone profiling have revealed UTX molecular function in establishing appropriate chromatin structure to regulate crucial NC stem-cell signaling pathways. However, the majority of UTX regulated genes do not experience aberrations in H3K27me3 or H3K4me3, implicating alternative roles for UTX in transcriptional control.

FKO (female) mice have more severe growth, craniofacial, and cardiac abnormalities. Thus, UTY performs some demethylase-independent UTX compensation in NC development. UTY only partially compensates for loss of UTX in mouse NC, creating an allelic phenotypic gradient. Heterozygous Utx females having one copy of Utx are asymptomatic for facial phenotypes, MKO having one copy of Uty manifest mild phenotypes, and FKO completely lacking both homologs are more severely affected.

Morphants exhibited severe abnormalities in all tissues examined, presenting with craniofacial phenotypes and defects in heart development. Shpargel KB et al., (2017) demonstrated that mice carrying neural crest deletion of UTX (KDM6A) display craniofacial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, and postnatal growth retardation. Cook KD, et al., (2015) showed UTX-deficient T cells have decreased expression of interleukin-6 receptor-α and identified a critical link between UTX in T cells and immunity to infection.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between the KDM6A gene and X-linked dominant Kabuki syndrome 2, however, the variant spectrum and the phenotype of X-linked Kabuki syndrome type 2 are still not fully understood.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date July 15, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fb0b5b0f-d4c9-4c46-b4cc-2e516be7908d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
