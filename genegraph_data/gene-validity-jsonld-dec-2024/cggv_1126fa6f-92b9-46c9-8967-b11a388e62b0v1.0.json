Here, we report two unrelated patients with a new subtype of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by biallelic, gene-disruptive mutations in GDAP2, a gene previously not implicated in disease. Both patients had onset of ataxia in the fourth decade. Other features included progressive spasticity and dementia. Neuropathological examination showed degenerative changes in the cerebellum, olive inferior, thalamus, substantia nigra, and pyramidal tracts, as well as tau pathology in the hippocampus and amygdala. To provide further evidence for a causative role of GDAP2 mutations in autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia pathophysiology, its orthologous gene was investigated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Ubiquitous knockdown of Drosophila Gdap2 resulted in shortened lifespan and motor behaviour anomalies such as righting defects, reduced and uncoordinated walking behaviour, and compromised flight. Gdap2 expression levels responded to stress treatments in control flies, and Gdap2 knockdown flies showed increased sensitivity to deleterious effects of stressors such as reactive oxygen species and nutrient deprivation. Thus, Gdap2 knockdown in Drosophila and GDAP2 loss-of-function mutations in humans lead to locomotor phenotypes, which may be mediated by altered responses to cellular stress.","dc:creator":"Eidhof I","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"GDAP2 mutations implicate susceptibility to cellular stress in a new form of cerebellar ataxia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1126fa6f-92b9-46c9-8967-b11a388e62b0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1126fa6f-92b9-46c9-8967-b11a388e62b0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0e6743a-2039-455f-b53e-f456a9b2f07c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aef78b76-1f12-4a33-9545-bca9dedc03e3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Gdap2 knockdown Drosophila exhibited motor phenotypes such as righting defects, uncoordinated walking behavior, inability to fly, reduced walking distance and speed.

Variants in this gene have been reported in at least four probands in three publications (PMIDs: 30084953, 32437512, 32428220). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function as the probands affected with cerebellar ataxia all have biallelic nonsense or frameshift variants in *GDAP2*. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model study by Eidhof et al. in which knockdown of the Gdap2 gene in *Drosophila* flies caused abnormal motor behavior, decreased the life span of mutant flies, and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and starvation (PMID: 30084953). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between *GDAP2* and autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the assertion to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted.
