The interaction between ARH and clathrin was mapped to a canonical clathrin box sequence (LLDLE) in ARH and to the N-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain. A highly conserved 20-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of ARH bound the beta(2)-adaptin subunit of AP-2. Mutation of a glutamic acid residue in the appendage domain of beta(2)-adaptin that is required for interaction with the adapter protein beta-arrestin markedly reduced binding to ARH.

To determine the physiological relevance of these interactions, we examined the effect of mutations in the ARH on LDLR location and function in polarized hepatocytes (WIF-B). The integrity of the FDNPVY sequence in the LDLR cytoplasmic tail was required for ARH-associated LDLR clustering into clathrin-coated pits. The phosphotyrosine binding domain of ARH plus either the clathrin box or the AP-2 binding region were required for both clustering and internalization of the LDLR. Parallel studies performed in vivo with the same recombinant forms of ARH in livers of Arh(-/-) mice confirmed the relevance of the cell culture findings.

Inherited mutations that disturb the activity of the receptor lead to elevations in plasma cholesterol levels and early-onset coronary atherosclerosis. Defects in either the LDL receptor or apolipoprotein B, the proteinaceous component of LDL particles that binds the LDL receptor, elevate circulating LDL-cholesterol levels in an autosomal-dominant fashion, with heterozygotes displaying values between homozygous and normal individuals. Rarely, similar clinical phenotypes occur with a recessive pattern of inheritance, and several genetic lesions in the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) gene on chromosome 1 have been mapped in this class of patients. ARH has an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain evolutionarily related to that found in Disabled-2 and numb, two endocytic proteins. PTB domains bind to the consensus sequence FXNPXY, corresponding to the internalization motif of the LDL receptor. We show here that in addition to the FXNPXY sequence, ARH binds directly to soluble clathrin trimers and to clathrin adaptors by a mode involving the independently folded appendage domain of the beta subunit. At steady state, ARH colocalizes with endocytic proteins in HeLa cells, and the LDL receptor fluxes through peripheral ARH-positive sites before delivery to early endosomes. Because ARH also binds directly to phosphoinositides, which regulate clathrin bud assembly at the cell surface, our data suggest that in ARH patients, defective sorting adaptor function in hepatocytes leads to faulty LDL receptor traffic and hypercholesterolemia.","dc:creator":"Mishra SK","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) protein interfaces directly with the clathrin-coat machinery."},"rdfs:label":"Mishra_FA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a385b387-0451-4b04-9871-d258b7d8da83","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:981133ec-3d7f-44a3-8b90-9d49a987f7a8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Mutant cell did not show uptake or degradation of LDL; however, infected cells were able to degrade LDL.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12464675","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder with a gene-dosage effect that is usually caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene that disrupt normal clearance of LDL.

On diet with 1.2% cholesterol, dramatic elevations were observed: KO: 1270 mg/dl and Ldlr-/-: 1442 mg/dl. Liver cholesterol and triglyceride were unchanged. On the cholesterol-enriched diets, most of the cholesterol was in the LDL fraction in KO and in Ldlr–/– mice. On enriched diets, mean LDL-C level was 4.7-fold (0.2%) and 11-fold (1.2%) higher in the KO mice than in littermate controls and 7.3-fold (0.2%) and 42-fold (1.2%) higher than the KO mice on a chow diet.

As a result, Ldlrap1-/- mice have near normal plasma levels of cholesterol on chow diets and are also significantly protected from the hypercholesterolemic effects of a sucrose-rich diet. The authors suggest that the requirements for hepatic LDLR function are ligand specific and that the preservation of VLDL remnant clearance attenuates the phenotype of LDLRAP1-associated hypercholesterolemia and likely contributes to greater responsiveness to statins in patients compared to those with FH.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12746448","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) is a genetic form of hypercholesterolemia that clinically resembles familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

Unlike FH, LDL uptake in cultured fibroblasts from ARH patients is normal or only slightly impaired. The gene defective in ARH encodes a putative adaptor protein that has been implicated in linking the LDLR to the endocytic machinery. To determine the role of ARH in the liver, ARH-deficient mice were developed.

Cholesterol feeding elevated plasma cholesterol levels in both strains. The fractional clearance rate of radiolabeled LDL was reduced to similar levels in the Arh-/- and Ldlr-/- mice, whereas the rate of removal of alpha2-macroglobulin by the LDLR-related protein, which also interacts with ARH, was unchanged. Immunolocalization studies revealed that a much greater proportion of immunodetectable LDLR, but not LDLR-related protein, was present on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes in the Arh-/- mice.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. Familial hypercholesterolemia 4 is characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and large tendon xanthomas. Increased plasma LDL levels occur as a result of defect in interaction with ***LDLR*** (PMID: 25399932). The *LDLRAP1* gene encodes a cytosolic protein which contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, that is essential for interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of *LDLR*. More than 20 variants, mostly frameshift and nosense, have been reported in humans. *LDLRAP1* has been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia 4 as early as 2001 (Garcia et al, 2001; PMID: 11326085).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 8 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 12464675, 11326085). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in additional family members (PMID: 11326085). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): The LDLRAP1 protein has a role in the internalization of LDLR for plasma LDL clearance (PMID: 12451172). It physically interacts with *LDLR* and has a function in cholesterol metabolism similar to *LDLR* and *APOB*, mutations in which also cause familial hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 12221107, 16179341). Mouse models with *LDLRAP1* alterations recapitulate the human hypercholesterolemia phenotype (PMID: 12746448). Rescue of *LDLR* uptake and degradation by wild-type protein expression in patient cells has been demonstrated (PMID: 12464675). \n\nIn summary, the *LDLRAP1*-Familial hypercholesterolemia 4 gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
