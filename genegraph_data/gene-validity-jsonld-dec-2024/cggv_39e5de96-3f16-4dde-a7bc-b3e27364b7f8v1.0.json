By monitoring ciliogenesis in primary airway epithelial cells and MCIDAS-regulated induced pluripotent stem cells, we uncovered two phases of expression of preassembly proteins. An early phase, composed of HEATR2, SPAG1, and DNAAF2, preceded other preassembly proteins and was independent of MCIDAS regulation. The early preassembly proteins colocalized within perinuclear foci that also contained dynein arm proteins. These proteins also interacted based on immunoprecipitation and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies. FRET analysis of HEAT domain deletions and human mutations showed that HEATR2 interacted with itself and SPAG1 at multiple HEAT domains, while DNAAF2 interacted with SPAG1. Human mutations in HEATR2 did not affect this interaction, but triggered the formation of p62/Sequestosome-1-positive aggregates containing the early preassembly proteins, suggesting that degradation of an early preassembly complex is responsible for disease and pointing to key regions required for HEATR2 scaffold stability.

Studies in various ciliated model organisms have shown that axonemal dynein arms are first assembled in the cell cytoplasm and then delivered into axonemes during ciliogenesis. In humans, mutations in genes encoding for factors involved in this process cause structural and functional defects of motile cilia in various organs such as the airways and result in the hereditary disorder primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Despite extensive knowledge about the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms in respiratory cilia, this process is still poorly understood in sperm flagella. To better define its clinical relevance on sperm structure and function, and thus male fertility, further investigations are required. Here we report the fertility status in different axonemal dynein preassembly mutant males (DNAAF2/ KTU, DNAAF4/ DYX1C1, DNAAF6/ PIH1D3, DNAAF7/ZMYND10, CFAP300/C11orf70 and LRRC6). Besides andrological examinations, we functionally and structurally analyzed sperm flagella of affected individuals by high-speed video- and transmission electron microscopy as well as systematically compared the composition of dynein arms in sperm flagella and respiratory cilia by immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, we analyzed the flagellar length in dynein preassembly mutant sperm. We found that the process of axonemal dynein preassembly is also critical in sperm, by identifying defects of ODAs and IDAs in dysmotile sperm of these individuals. Interestingly, these mutant sperm consistently show a complete loss of ODAs, while some respiratory cilia from the same individual can retain ODAs in the proximal ciliary compartment. This agrees with reports of solely one distinct ODA type in sperm, compared to two different ODA types in proximal and distal respiratory ciliary axonemes. Consistent with observations in model organisms, we also determined a significant reduction of sperm flagellar length in these individuals. These findings are relevant to subsequent studies on the function and composition of sperm flagella in PCD patients and non-syndromic infertile males. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the fertility status in PCD-affected males and should help guide genetic and andrological counselling for affected males and their families.","dc:creator":"Aprea I","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Defects in the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms cause morphological abnormalities and dysmotility in sperm cells leading to male infertility."},"rdfs:label":"Aprea et al. 2021"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This was downscored to 0 because there wasn’t an appropriate figure available to cite as evidence."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:39e5de96-3f16-4dde-a7bc-b3e27364b7f8_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac3bb071-29e4-4719-8129-dace1686638f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4644d677-2734-4815-8144-520807cfa3fc","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"DNAAF2 -/- embryos were found to have abnormal formation with certain elements forming on the right as opposed to the typical left lateral side.

Defects in ciliary motility lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), with major symptoms including bronchitis and other chronic respiratory diseases. Recent work suggested that ciliary motility and planar polarity are required in the process of ciliary alignment that produces coordinated beating. However, the extent to which cilia motility is involved in this process in mammals has not yet been fully clarified. Here, to address the role of ciliary motility in the process of coordinated ciliary alignment, we analyzed Kintoun mice mutants (Ktu(-/-)). Ktu(-/-) exhibited typical phenotypes of PCD with complete loss of ciliary motility in trachea and another ciliated tissue, the brain ependyma. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against axonemal dynein confirmed the loss of multiple axonemal dynein components in mutant cilia. Observation of cilia orientation based on basal foot directions revealed that ciliary motility was not required in the alignment of airway cilia, whereas a strong requirement was observed in brain ependymal cells.

The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 10 (MONDO:0012918, OMIM:612518), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: bronchiectasis, recurrent pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, chronic otitis media, situs inversus totalis, male or female infertility, and immotile cilia. Absent or defective outer dynein arms (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs) have been observed in respiratory cilia and spermatozoa. The patients evaluated in this curation have onset as early as at birth.\n\nThis curation includes six variants (three missense, two frameshift and one nonsense) that have been reported in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 32638265,19052621, 34785929). Four of the probands were homozygous, with two confirmed to have consanguineous parents, while one proband was compound heterozygous with confirmation of carrier status in the parents.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence, including the biochemical function of the gene product, its protein interactions and expression pattern, and animal models (PMIDs: 32638265, 31107948, 19052621, 33635866, 23525783, 23715323, 29358401). *DNAAF2* encodes a factor involved in preassembly of dynein arm complexes, and physically interacts with SPAG1 and HEATR2/DNAAF5, two other dynein assembly factors known to harbor variants causing PCD (PMID: 29358401). High levels of expression of *DNAAF2* were found in multiciliated human tissues associated with PCD, particularly the fallopian tubes, lungs, and testes (PMID: 23715323, PMID:31107948). A *Dnaaf2* knockout mouse model showed abnormal development with reversed laterality (e.g. heart looping), demonstrating that DNAAF2 function is necessary for the establishment of correct left–right patterning of abdominal organs during embryo formation (PMID: 31107948). A second mouse model showed situs inversus totalis, abnormal ciliary motility, and absent inner and outer dynein arms, as well as hydrocephalus (PMID: 23525783). A Medaka fish model showed an organ laterality defect, male infertility, abnormal ciliary motility, and absent ODAs and IDAs (PMID: 19052621). A transformation-generated mutant in *pf13*, the *Chlamydomonas* orthologue of *DNAAF2*, showed absent inner and outer dynein arms and static flagella, which could be rescued by wild-type gene.\n\nIn conclusion, *DNAAF2* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 10. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on February 8th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:39e5de96-3f16-4dde-a7bc-b3e27364b7f8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
