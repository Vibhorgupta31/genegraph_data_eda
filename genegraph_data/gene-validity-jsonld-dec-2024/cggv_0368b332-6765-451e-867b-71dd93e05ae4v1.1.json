We have here dissected a network of dynamic interactions between CMG2 and various actin interactors and regulators, describing a different behavior from other extracellular matrix receptors. CMG2 binds talin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, only in its ligand-free state. Extracellular ligand binding leads to src-dependent talin release and recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton regulator RhoA and its effectors. These sequential interactions of CMG2 are necessary for the control of oriented cell division during fish development. Finally, we demonstrate that effective switching between talin and RhoA binding is required for the intracellular degradation of collagen VI in human fibroblasts, which explains why HFS mutations in the cytoskeleton-binding domain lead to dysregulation of extracellular matrix homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Bürgi J","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Ligand Binding to the Collagen VI Receptor Triggers a Talin-to-RhoA Switch that Regulates Receptor Endocytosis."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of Collagen VI degradation function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:d9334d32-6d06-4590-879e-78ff736a078d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:872c4563-edea-456e-b95a-2044ac178047","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"CMG2 protein levels could be restored to approximate control levels as the protein was properly targeted to the plasma membrane and signalling competent (Fig 8A).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21328543","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS) is a human genetic disease caused by mutations in the anthrax toxin receptor 2 (or cmg2) gene, which encodes a membrane protein thought to be involved in the homeostasis of the extracellular matrix.

Both are believed to be allelic disorders; ISH is distinguished from JHF by its more severe phenotype, which includes hyaline deposits in multiple organs, recurrent infections, and death within the first 2 years of life. Using the previously reported chromosome 4q21 JHF disease locus as a guide for candidate-gene identification, we identified and characterized JHF and ISH disease-causing mutations in the capillary morphogenesis factor-2 gene (CMG2). Although CMG2 encodes a protein upregulated in endothelial cells during capillary formation and was recently shown to function as an anthrax-toxin receptor, its physiologic role is unclear. Two ISH family-specific truncating mutations, E220X and the 1-bp insertion P357insC that results in translation of an out-of-frame stop codon, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and were shown to delete the CMG-2 transmembrane and/or cytosolic domains, respectively. An ISH compound mutation, I189T, is predicted to create a novel and destabilizing internal cavity within the protein. The JHF family-specific homoallelic missense mutation G105D destabilizes a von Willebrand factor A extracellular domain alpha-helix, whereas the other mutation, L329R, occurs within the transmembrane domain of the protein. Finally, and possibly providing insight into the pathophysiology of these diseases, analysis of fibroblasts derived from patients with JHF or ISH suggests that CMG2 mutations abrogate normal cell interactions with the extracellular matrix.","dc:creator":"Dowling O","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in capillary morphogenesis gene-2 result in the allelic disorders juvenile hyaline fibromatosis and infantile systemic hyalinosis."}},{"id":"cggv:62781d90-af9e-4635-84e4-ae5d11806c91_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:00f7c5e5-1da7-4c31-b4ba-30cf61cd257c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12973667"}],"rdfs:label":"Family ISH2 - Proband "},{"id":"cggv:62781d90-af9e-4635-84e4-ae5d11806c91","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62781d90-af9e-4635-84e4-ae5d11806c91_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:62781d90-af9e-4635-84e4-ae5d11806c91_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional study done by Deuquet et al., 2009 (PMID 19191226).

ANTXR2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hyaline fibromatosis syndrome in 2003 (Hanks et al., PMID: 14508707; Dowling et al., PMID: 12973667). Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS) is characterized by accumulation of amorphous, unidentified hyaline material in the skin and other organs. Clinical features of HFS include progressive contractures, hyperpigmented skin over bony prominences, subcutaneous nodules, gingival thickening, and failure to thrive secondary to protein-losing enteropathy. HFS is a progressive disease and its manifestations tend to be additive over time. At least 50 variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletions, and splice variants) have been reported in the literature. Nine variants, including 5 missense variants and 4 frameshift variants that have been reported in 7 probands in four publications are included in this curation (PMID: 12973667; Deuquet et al., 2011, PMID: 21328543; Denadai et al., 2012, PMID: 22383261; Mohamed et al., 2017, PMID: 25458638). The gene-disease relationship is supported by markedly reduced protein expression in patient cells (Burgi et al., 2017, PMID: 28604699), homozygous knockout mice (PMID: 28604699), and rescue of protein expression in patient cells (PMID: 21328543; Burgi et al., 2020, PMID: 32428455). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between ANTXR2 and autosomal recessive hyaline fibromatosis syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 11.22.2022 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0368b332-6765-451e-867b-71dd93e05ae4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
