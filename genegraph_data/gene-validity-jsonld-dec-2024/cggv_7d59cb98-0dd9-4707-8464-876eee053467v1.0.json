CoQ10 is an essential component of the electron transport chain (ETC), where it shuttles electrons from complex I or II to complex III. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified five individuals carrying biallelic mutations in COQ4. The precise function of human COQ4 is not known, but it seems to play a structural role in stabilizing a multiheteromeric complex that contains most of the CoQ10 biosynthetic enzymes. The clinical phenotypes of the five subjects varied widely, but four had a prenatal or perinatal onset with early fatal outcome. Two unrelated individuals presented with severe hypotonia, bradycardia, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure; two sisters showed antenatal cerebellar hypoplasia, neonatal respiratory-distress syndrome, and epileptic encephalopathy. The fifth subject had an early-onset but slowly progressive clinical course dominated by neurological deterioration with hardly any involvement of other organs. All available specimens from affected subjects showed reduced amounts of CoQ10 and often displayed a decrease in CoQ10-dependent ETC complex activities. The pathogenic role of all identified mutations was experimentally validated in a recombinant yeast model; oxidative growth, strongly impaired in strains lacking COQ4, was corrected by expression of human wild-type COQ4 cDNA but failed to be corrected by expression of COQ4 cDNAs with any of the mutations identified in affected subjects. COQ4 mutations are responsible for early-onset mitochondrial diseases with heterogeneous clinical presentations and associated with CoQ10 deficiency.

This mutation is exclusively present in the East Asian population (allele frequency of ~0.001). The homozygous mutation caused CoQ10 deficiency-associated Leigh syndrome with an onset at 1-2 months of age, presenting as respiratory distress, lactic acidosis, dystonia, seizures, failure to thrive, and detectable lesions in the midbrain and basal ganglia. No renal impairment was involved. The levels of CoQ10 and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (C) II + III activity were clearly lower in cultured fibroblasts derived from the patient than in those from unaffected carriers; the decreased CII + III activity could be increased by CoQ10 treatment. Follow-up studies suggested that our patient benefitted from the oral supplementation of CoQ10, which allowed her to maintain a relatively stable health status. Based on the genetic testing, preimplantation and prenatal diagnoses were performed, confirming that the next offspring of this family was unaffected.

The *COQ4* gene encodes ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ4, which functions as part of the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthetic pathway. \n\nThe *COQ4* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2015 (PMID: 25658047). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COQ4*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COQ4* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eleven unique variants (eight missense, one stop-gained, one frameshift, and one in-frame deletion variant) identified in seven individuals from four publications (PMIDs: 25658047, 30225196, 28540186, 30659264). Affected individuals have a broad spectrum of features that range from an early onset multisystem encephalopathy with myopathy and cardiac involvement to a less severe, later onset ataxia-spasticity disorder. Reduced levels of CoQ10 and reduced activities of complex I+III and II+III are commonly observed in patient tissues and cells. No segregation data were available for scoring. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, and specifically coenzyme Q10 deficiency; early embryonic lethality in a knockout mouse model; wild-type rescue of growth and COQ synthesis defects in a null yeast model; and wild-type rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction in patient-derived iPSCs and differentiated myocytes (PMIDs: 33340416, 18474229, 29539633, 28472853). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COQ4* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 30, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7d59cb98-0dd9-4707-8464-876eee053467"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
