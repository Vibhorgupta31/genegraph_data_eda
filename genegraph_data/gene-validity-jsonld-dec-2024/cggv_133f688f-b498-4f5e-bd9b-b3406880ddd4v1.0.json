Only seven patients with deficiency of the E(1)β subunit have been described, with mutations in the PDHB gene in six of them. Clinically they presented with a non-specific encephalomyopathy.

The PDHB gene encodes the E1 beta subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, thus is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. PDC deficiency leads to impaired energy metabolism.\n\nThe PDHB gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2009 (PMID: 19924563). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three variants identified in seven cases in two publications (PMIDs: 21914562, 19924563). Of note, those with PDHB deficiency can also have structural brain abnormalities (corpus callosum abnormalities) and microcephaly. In addition, several affected individuals have neonatal lactic acidosis, raising the possibility that some affected individuals die before they would have developed Leigh syndrome spectrum.  No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 25356417, 29501567, 31127358).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:133f688f-b498-4f5e-bd9b-b3406880ddd4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
