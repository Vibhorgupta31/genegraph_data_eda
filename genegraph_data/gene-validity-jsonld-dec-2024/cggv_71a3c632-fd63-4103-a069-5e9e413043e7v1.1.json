Previously, we characterized three pedigrees of individuals with PME and ataxia, where either clinical features or linkage mapping excluded known PME loci. This report identifies a mutation in PRICKLE1 (also known as RILP for REST/NRSF interacting LIM domain protein) in all three of these pedigrees. The identified PRICKLE1 mutation blocks the PRICKLE1 and REST interaction in vitro and disrupts the normal function of PRICKLE1 in an in vivo zebrafish overexpression system.

In overexpression assays in zebrafish, prickle mutations resulted in aberrant prickle function. A seizure phenotype was present in the Prickle1-null mutant mouse, two Prickle1 point mutant (missense and nonsense) mice, and a Prickle2-null mutant mouse.

The evidence summary below reflects this change. The original evidence and conclusion remains the same; therefore, the original date of approval has not been changed. **\n\nPRICKLE1 was reported in relation to autosomal dominant progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) in 2019 by Algahtani et al (PMID: 31035234). However, the phenotype described, presence of unaffected carriers, and allele frequency of the variant identified were not consistent with AD PME. Additional probands in whom a heterozygous PRICKLE1 variant was identified had epileptic phenotypes inconsistent with PME (21276947, 31875159, 29790814). No case-level evidence supports this gene-disease relationship. Of note, one case of a de novo variant in PRICKLE1 causing autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder, including a seizure phenotype, has been reported (29790814). PRICKLE1 has also been assessed for autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epilepsy by the ClinGen Epilepsy Expert Panel and found to have a Limited classification. In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the relationship between PRICKLE1 and autosomal dominant epilepsy. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role PRICKLE1 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Expert Panel on 9/1/2020.\nUpon expert review, there is a lack of convincing genetic evidence to support an association between PRICKLE1 and AD epilepsy.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:71a3c632-fd63-4103-a069-5e9e413043e7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
