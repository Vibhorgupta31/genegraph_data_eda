Such deficiencies can result from inborn errors in the MCM structural gene or from mutations that impair the assimilation of dietary cobalamins into coenzyme B12 (Ado-B12), the required cofactor for MCM. ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR) catalyzes the terminal step in the conversion of cobalamins into Ado-B12. Substantial evidence indicates that inherited defects in this enzyme lead to methylmalonyl aciduria, but the corresponding ATR gene has not been identified. Here we report the identification of the bovine and human ATR cDNAs as well as the corresponding human gene. A bovine liver cDNA expression library was screened for clones that complemented an ATR-deficient bacterial strain for color formation on aldehyde indicator medium, and four positive clones were isolated. The DNA sequences of two clones were determined and found to be identical. Sequence similarity searching was then used to identify a homologous human cDNA (89% identity) and its corresponding gene that is located on chromosome XII. The bovine and human cDNAs were independently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme assays showed that expression strains produced 87 and 98 nmol/min/mg ATR activity, respectively. These specific activities are in line with values reported previously for bacterial ATR enzymes. Subsequent studies showed that the human cDNA clone complemented an ATR-deficient bacterial mutant for Ado-B12-dependent growth on 1,2-propanediol. This demonstrated that the human ATR is active under physiological conditions albeit in a heterologous host. In addition, Western blots were used to show that ATR expression is altered in cell lines derived from cblB methylmalonyl aciduria patients compared with cell lines from normal individuals. We propose that inborn errors in the human ATR gene identified here result in methylmalonyl aciduria. The identification of genes involved in this disorder will allow improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of this serious disease.","dc:creator":"Leal NA","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Identification of the human and bovine ATP:Cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase cDNAs based on complementation of a bacterial mutant."},"rdfs:label":"Human and bovine MMAB cDNA cloning"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score is increased due to the availability of multiple lines of experimental evidence for the function of ATR (encoded by MMAB).

AdoCbl is the cofactor of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), which catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids and cholesterol. The authors propose that the ATR is a dual-function protein: an enzyme for synthesis of the active cofactor and a chaperone for its targeted delivery to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. \nInability to synthesize AdoCbl, due to deficiency of ATR activity, would be expected to result in deficiency of MUT activity which, in turn would result in elevated methylmalonic acid, as is observed in patients with loss of function variants in MMAB (which encodes ATR). Thus, the function of the protein is consistent with the observations in patients with the condition.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15950874","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Many organic cofactors are both rare and reactive.

In humans, the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase uses coenzyme B(12) (adenosylcobalamin) but would be inactive if bound to the cofactor precursor that is delivered to the mitochondrion. Adenosyltransferase converts cob(II)alamin to coenzyme B(12). Based on kinetic evidence for interaction between the two enzymes, the 40-fold greater affinity for coenzyme B(12) and the higher coordination number for cobalt in the mutase, we propose that the adenosyltransferase is a dual-function protein: an enzyme that synthesizes coenzyme B(12) and a chaperone that delivers it.","dc:creator":"Yamanishi M","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Adenosyltransferase: an enzyme and an escort for coenzyme B12?"},"rdfs:label":"ATR function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The score is increased due to the abundance of evidence for the biological function of ATR.

We have cloned the gene for the cblB complementation group caused by deficient activity of a cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. This was accomplished by searching bacterial genomes for genes in close proximity to the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene that might encode a protein with the properties of an adenosyltransferase. A candidate was identified in the Archaeoglobus fulgidus genome and was used to probe the human genome database. It yielded a gene on chromosome 12q24 that encodes a predicted protein of 250 amino acids with 45% similarity to PduO in Salmonella enterica, a characterized cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. A northern blot revealed an RNA species of 1.1 kb predominating in liver and skeletal muscle. The gene was evaluated for deleterious mutations in cblB patient cell lines. Several mutations were identified including a 5 bp deletion (5del572gggcc576), two splice site mutations (IVS2-1G>T, IVS3-1G>A), andt several point mutations (A135T, R186W, R191W and E193K). Two additional amino acid substitutions (R19Q and M239K) were found in several patient cell lines but were found to be common polymorphisms (36% and 46%) in control alleles. The R186W mutation, which we suggest is disease-linked, is present in four of the six patient cell lines examined (homoallelic in two) and in 4 of 240 alleles in control samples. These data confirm that the identified gene, MMAB, corresponds to the cblB complementation group and has the appearance of a cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase, as predicted from biochemical data.","dc:creator":"Dobson CM","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Identification of the gene responsible for the cblB complementation group of vitamin B12-dependent methylmalonic aciduria."}},"rdfs:label":"WG1185"},{"id":"cggv:2b936f42-a119-47e9-8c85-4140e654b119","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b936f42-a119-47e9-8c85-4140e654b119_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2b936f42-a119-47e9-8c85-4140e654b119_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional studies show that the variant results in an unstable protein with no catalytic activity due to disruption of the affinity between MMAB and AdoCbl (PMIDs 16439175, 19625202).

Loss of function of the MMAB gene product, ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR), has been reported to methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) type CblB based on complementation studies. The severe, early-onset form of this condition presents with neonatal ketoacidosis, lethargy, failure to thrive and encephalopathy. Patients with a milder form are usually diagnosed during infancy and have less severe neurological symptoms (Brasil et al, 2015). While patients with MMA due to variants in MMAA (type CblA) are responsive to Vitamin B12, only rare individuals with type CblB are responsive to treatment with Vitamin B12 (Hörster, et al, 2007, PMID 17597648; Manoli et al, 2016, PMID 20301409). \nBiallelic variants in MMAB were first reported in humans with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) in 2002 (Dobson et al, PMID 12471062). Since then, over 30 different variants have been associated with the condition (Brasil et al, 2015, PMID 24813872; https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/MMAB/unique ).\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Ten unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense) from 8 probands from 3 publications were curated (Dobson et al, 2002, PMID 12471062; Lerner-Ellis et al, 2006, PMID 16410054; Brasil et al, 2015, PMID 24813872). Further evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of ATR, which converts reduced cob(I)alamin to adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), the cofactor of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) (Leal et al, 2003, PMID 12514191; Yamanishi et al, 2005, PMID 15950874; Mera and Escalante-Semerena, 2010, PMID 20677021). MUT catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA during the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Lack of AdoCbl is therefore expected to result in reduced MUT activity, and methylmalonic acidemia. Of note, other defects in cobalamin metabolism can affect the activity of methionine synthase in addition to MUT, thus causing both homocystinuria and MMA. The relationship between MMAB and MMA is also supported by functional alteration studies. Mutagenesis of human MMAB and expression of the variants in a bacterial system revealed missense variants that reduce ATR activity and AdoCbl binding (Fan and Bobik, 2008, PMID, 18251506). In summary, MMAB is definitively associated with methylmalonic acidemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a238556a-5b89-413d-83d9-2d443b172c08"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
