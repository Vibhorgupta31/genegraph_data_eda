Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.","dc:creator":"Boczonadi V","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial DNA transcription and translation: clinical syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Review of mitochondrial translation disorders"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10+ genes with mitochondrial disease association implicated in mitochondrial translation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a07aaa07-ad0d-4dac-8751-18242a3f36a9_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:479ef3a5-9c76-4918-9a24-1f995ace4191","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c5535a92-eba0-4224-b2b5-b231a63402cb","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"A severe reduction of the CARS2 protein was observed in\nthe patient when compared to the controls.

Here we demonstrate effective CysSSH synthesis from the substrate L-cysteine, a reaction catalyzed by prokaryotic and mammalian cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases (CARSs). Targeted disruption of the genes encoding mitochondrial CARSs in mice and human cells shows that CARSs have a crucial role in endogenous CysSSH production and suggests that these enzymes serve as the principal cysteine persulfide synthases in vivo. CARSs also catalyze co-translational cysteine polysulfidation and are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics. Investigating CARS-dependent persulfide production may thus clarify aberrant redox signaling in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and suggest therapeutic targets based on oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Akaike T","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase governs cysteine polysulfidation and mitochondrial bioenergetics."},"rdfs:label":"HEK293T cells persulfide production and CARS2 activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:47eb7865-0ad3-4ff2-80e3-ef35071d576f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0783489e-3f2c-44dc-9711-9410ccebb580","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Reduced persulfide production in heterozygote mice (Note heteroyzgote KOs did not show reduced MTCO1 on BNPAGE)\n\nAs expected, CysSSH derived from whole-cell proteins was decreased in Cars2+/– mice, but cysteine (CysSH) did not (Fig. 7).

relationship between *CARS2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 19, 2022. *CARS2* encodes the mitochondrial cysteinyl tRNA aminoacyl synthetase, which plays a role in mitochondrial translation. There is also some evidence to suggest CARS2 also plays a critical role in persulfide biosynthesis (PMID:29079736). \n\n*CARS2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2014 (PMID: 25361775). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *CARS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *CARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants: three missense variants, one in frame deletion, and a variant which results in exon 6 skipping (c.655G>A). There are three probands across three publications from 2014-2018 (PMIDs: 25361775, 25787132, 30139652). The condition was first described in a Turkish man with childhood onset myoclonic seizures, quadriparesis, white matter disease, brain atrophy and hyperammonemia. Subsequent publications have shown the *CARS2* phenotype is predominantly an infantile-childhood onset early refractory epileptic encephalopathy with developmental regression, and hepatopathy and global atrophy on brain MRI, noted to resemble Alpers Huttenlocher Syndrome (PMID: 30139652).  Tissue biopsy evidence was suggestive of a translation defect in some but not all patients. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by functional evidence including known protein interaction with the multitude of other mitochondrial translation proteins, patient cell data showing profound respiratory chain mis-assembly, rescue of assembly in patient cells, as well as an embryonic lethal homozygous mouse knockout, and studies in HEK293T cells showing mitochondrial translation aberration when particular variants were incorporated into the cell line (PMIDs: 25787132, 29980628, 29079736).  Of note, there are interesting data supporting CARS2 function in persulfide biosynthesis with a variety of rescue studies In HEK293T cells that carried different variants, indicating that certain variants impact the tRNA synthetase activity while others impact persulfide biosynthesis (PMID: 29079736). The persulfide studies were reviewed and the expert panel elected to not score these data as more work is required to understand the mechanism of action between impaired persulfide biosynthesis and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in clinical disease. \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 19, 2022 (SOP Version 8). \n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a07aaa07-ad0d-4dac-8751-18242a3f36a9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
