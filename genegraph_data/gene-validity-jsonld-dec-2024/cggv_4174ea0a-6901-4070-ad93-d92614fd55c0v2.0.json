Surprisingly, overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant did not modify any of the functional properties of the cells studied (including insulin secretion, cell growth and viability). By contrast, expression of WT HNF1beta was associated with a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of INS-1 cell proliferation and a marked increase in apoptosis. Induction of WT HNF1beta also inhibited the insulin secretory response to nutrient stimuli, membrane depolarisation or activation of protein kinases A and C and this correlated with a significant decrease in pancrease-duodenum homeobox-1 protein levels. The attenuation of insulin secretion was, however, dissociated from the inhibition of proliferation and loss of viability, since expression of the P328L329del mutant led to a reduced rate of cell proliferation, but failed to induce apoptosis or to alter insulin secretion.

Recently, pancreas atrophies have been reported in several maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 patients, suggesting that TCF2 is required not only for adult pancreas function but also for its normal development. Tcf2-deficient mice die before gastrulation because of defective visceral endoderm formation. To investigate the role of this factor in pancreas development, we rescued this early lethality by tetraploid aggregation. We show that TCF2 has an essential function in the first steps of pancreas development, correlated with its expression domain that demarcates the entire pancreatic buds from the earliest stages. Lack of TCF2 results in pancreas agenesis by embryonic day 13.5. At earlier stages, only a dorsal bud rudiment forms transiently and expresses the transcription factors Ipf1 and Hlxb9 but lacks the key transcription factor involved in the acquisition of a pancreatic fate, Ptf1a, as well as all endocrine precursor cells. Regional specification of the gut also is perturbed in Tcf2-/- embryos as manifested by ectopic expression of Shh and lack of Ihh and Ipf1 in the posterior stomach and duodenum.

To investigate the functional consequences of this HNF1B mutation, we generated a P159L HNF1B construct. The wild-type and mutant HNF1B constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells in the presence of the promoter sequence of human glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2). The luciferase reporter assay revealed that P159L HNF1B had decreased transcriptional activity compared to wild-type (p < 0.05). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed reduced DNA binding activity of P159L HNF1B. In the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line, overexpression of the P159L mutant was significantly associated with decreased mRNA levels of GLUT2 compared to wild-type (p < 0.05). However, INS expression was not different between the wild-type and mutant HNF1B constructs. These findings suggests that the impaired insulin secretion in this family with the P159L HNF1B mutation may be related to altered GLUT2 expression in β-cells rather than decreased insulin gene expression.

They have also been found in patients diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which may highlight the difficulty in diagnosing these forms of diabetes or perhaps indicate a direct role in the development of multiple forms of diabetes. We have screened the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1 beta/MODY5) gene for mutations in a group of 126 unrelated Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and a family history of at least one first degree relative with diabetes. We identified one patient with a nonsense mutation (R276X) and another with a missense mutation (S465R). These mutations were present in the heterozygous state and were not found in 132 nondiabetic subjects (264 normal alleles). We identified a second patient with the S465R mutation on screening a second group of 272 randomly selected type 2 diabetic patients but not in another 122 nondiabetic subjects. Functional studies indicated that R276X-HNF-1 beta was inactive and S465R-HNF-1 beta exhibited a 22% reduction in activity compared with the wild-type protein. The S465R mutation may function in a dominant-negative manner. The subject with the R276X mutation had MODY5 misdiagnosed as common type 2 diabetes. He was diagnosed with diabetes at 13 yr of age and also had small kidneys with multiple bilateral renal cysts and decreased urinary concentrating ability. The two subjects with the S465R mutation had typical late-onset type 2 diabetes and no evidence of kidney disease. We have identified two novel mutations in human HNF-1 beta gene. The prevalence of MODY5 among our population of Japanese diabetes patients with a strong positive family of disease is 0.8%. The S465R mutation was found in 0.5% of our patients with common type 2 diabetes and thus may be a rare genetic risk factor contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes rather than MODY5.","dc:creator":"Furuta H","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Nonsense and missense mutations in the human hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta gene (TCF2) and their relation to type 2 diabetes in Japanese."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12161522","rdfs:label":"Case 1- Group 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantNullVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:4174ea0a-6901-4070-ad93-d92614fd55c0_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41ed6002-9ec7-4275-b0ca-ddbdedb7428c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bb21495-6d21-47cf-9ed1-79fb54e3a729","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"genomic DNA extracted from venous blood or tissue, quantitative mulitplex PCR of short fluorescence fragments to search for gene deletion, HNF1B 9 exons and exon-intron boundaries underwent direct sequencing if gene deletion was not found","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004719","obo:HP_0002594","obo:HP_0000089"],"secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:41ed6002-9ec7-4275-b0ca-ddbdedb7428c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:e715c21c-c793-42bf-a484-f32a41bf12bc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000458.4(HNF1B):c.494G>C (p.Arg165Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA398751241"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20378641","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta (HNF1beta) is a transcription factor that is critical for the development of kidney and pancreas.

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of HNF1B gene mutations in young Indian diabetic patients with various renal abnormalities. Fifty unrelated young diabetic patients, who also had renal abnormalities, were selected from the electronic records of a large diabetes centre in Chennai, in southern India. All patients were sequenced for HNF1B gene mutations. The whole or partial gene deletion was analyzed by MLPA. Functional characterization of the novel variant (Asn321Asp) was also performed using transcriptional activation and subcellular localization assays. We identified six different HNF1B gene mutations which included four previously reported (-67C>T, Arg165His, IVS2nt+2insT, Met1_Trp557del) and two novel variations (Asn321Asp, IVS3nt-4C>G). The functional study revealed that the novel variation Asn321Asp in both the heterozygous and homozygous state showed similar transcriptional activity, expression levels and normal transportation of protein to the nucleus similar to wild type, suggesting that it is not likely to be pathogenic. This is the first major study of HNF1B-MODY from India and shows that about 10% of young diabetic subjects with renal abnormalities seen at a tertiary diabetes centre harbor HNF1B gene mutations.

An alternative description is Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD) – HNF1B. This disease entity consistently includes a primary renal phenotype in which a wide variety of genitourinary developmental malformations may be present, such as renal cysts, interstitial fibrosis, absent or underdeveloped kidney, abnormal nephron development, hypoplastic glomeruli, enlarged renal pelvises, bicornuate uterus, atresia of the vas deferens, rudimentary uterus, vaginal aplasia. Diabetes is typically diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood, but some families will have carriers who may not have been diagnosed with diabetes but will usually have some evidence of renal pathology that is either congenital or progressive. The disorder has also been referred to as maturity onset diabetes of the young 5 (MODY5) or HNF1B-MODY, as well as Renal Cysts and Diabetes (RCAD; MIM:137920). Treatment for diabetes often includes insulin but optimal management has not been established. Other variable features of the syndrome may include hypomagnesemia, hyperuricemia, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction such as cholestasis, and intellectual disability (possibly more often when caused by large deletion of 17q12).\n\nNumerous variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar, especially whole gene deletions. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 18 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 7 publications (PMIDS: 9398836, 12161522, 25705165, 25754277, 25441779, 15068978, 20378641). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, animal models, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, HNF1B is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Renal Cysts and Diabetes Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes \nGene Curation Expert Panel (12/10/2019) in collaboration with the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (1/19/2021) according to SOP Version 8.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4174ea0a-6901-4070-ad93-d92614fd55c0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
