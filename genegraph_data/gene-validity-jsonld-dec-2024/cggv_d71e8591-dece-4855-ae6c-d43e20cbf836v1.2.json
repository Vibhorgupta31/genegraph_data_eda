Heart failure usually results from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM of unknown cause in families has recently been shown to result from genetic disease, highlighting newly discovered disease mechanisms. AD is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease of older Americans. Familial AD is caused most commonly by presenilin 1 (PSEN1) or presenilin 2 (PSEN2) mutations, a discovery that has greatly advanced the field. The presenilins are also expressed in the heart and are critical to cardiac development. We hypothesized that mutations in presenilins may also be associated with DCM and that their discovery could provide new insight into the pathogenesis of DCM and heart failure. A total of 315 index patients with DCM were evaluated for sequence variation in PSEN1 and PSEN2. Families positive for mutations underwent additional clinical, genetic, and functional studies. A novel PSEN1 missense mutation (Asp333Gly) was identified in one family, and a single PSEN2 missense mutation (Ser130Leu) was found in two other families. Both mutations segregated with DCM and heart failure. The PSEN1 mutation was associated with complete penetrance and progressive disease that resulted in the necessity of cardiac transplantation or in death. The PSEN2 mutation showed partial penetrance, milder disease, and a more favorable prognosis. Calcium signaling was altered in cultured skin fibroblasts from PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutation carriers. These data indicate that PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations are associated with DCM and heart failure and implicate novel mechanisms of myocardial disease.","dc:creator":"Li D","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Mutations of presenilin genes in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186461","rdfs:label":"II.4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Allele frequency in African Ancestry GnomAC reference 0.001082 (AA) (>0.0001).

Recently, presenilin mutations have been identified in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a common cause of heart failure and the most prevalent diagnosis in cardiac transplantation patients. However, the molecular mechanisms, by which presenilin mutations lead to either AD or DCM, are not yet understood. We have employed transgenic Drosophila models and optical coherence tomography imaging technology to analyze cardiac function in live adult Drosophila. Silencing of Drosophila ortholog of presenilins (dPsn) led to significantly reduced heart rate and remarkably age-dependent increase in end-diastolic vertical dimensions. In contrast, overexpression of dPsn increased heart rate. Either overexpression or silencing of dPsn resulted in irregular heartbeat rhythms accompanied by cardiomyofibril defects and mitochondrial impairment. The calcium channel receptor activities in cardiac cells were quantitatively determined via real-time RT-PCR. Silencing of dPsn elevated dIP3R expression, and reduced dSERCA expression; overexprerssion of dPsn led to reduced dRyR expression. Moreover, overexpression of dPsn in wing disc resulted in loss of wing phenotype and reduced expression of wingless. Our data provide novel evidence that changes in presenilin level leads to cardiac dysfunction, owing to aberrant calcium channel receptor activities and disrupted Wnt signaling transduction, indicating a pathogenic role for presenilin mutations in DCM pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Li A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Changes in the expression of the Alzheimer’s disease-associated presenilin gene in drosophila heart leads to cardiac dysfunction."},"rdfs:label":"UAS-dPsn or UAS-dPsn-RNAi transgenic flies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The silencing of the fly ortholog of human PSEN1 was associated with a decreased ventricular size."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":1491,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:13b75512-acce-4cdc-b2af-75095ac7acde","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:9508","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"PSEN1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2006 (Li et al., 2006, PMID: 17186461). There is a lack of robust human genetic evidence demonstrating this gene-disease relationship in the literature at the time of curation. All of the variants reported as disease-causing have subsequently been found at a frequency higher than would be expected for a monogenic, pathogenic effect in population reference data sets. Therefore, there is no scorable human genetic evidence. This gene-disease assertion is supported by expression studies (Gianni et al., 2010, PMID: 2019488). In summary, the evidence presented for this gene-disease relationship does not provide convincing human genetic evidence in support of or refuting the role of PSEN1 and DCM. The relationship of PSEN1 with DCM is unclear and therefore classified as disputed.
