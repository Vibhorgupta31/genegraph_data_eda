These null animals appear normal at birth and can breathe, walk, and suckle, but within 4 days, they show a markedly lower body weight than normal littermates and many develop scoliosis. Null mice show a loss of glycogen and reduced brown fat that is consistent with malnutrition leading to death. Newborn skeletal muscles from null mice are similar to those of wild-type mice in size, fiber type, and ultrastructural organization. At birth, both hemizygous and homozygous null animals show an increase in cardiac and vascular actin mRNA in skeletal muscle, with no skeletal actin mRNA present in null mice.

The three mutations we have identified Leucine221Proline, Aspartate292Valine, and Proline332Serine are novel. They have not been found previously in any cases of nemaline, actin, intranuclear rod, or rod-core myopathy caused by mutations in ACTA1. It remains unclear why these mutations cause type 1 fiber hypotrophy but no nemaline bodies. The three mutations all lie on one face of the actin monomer on the surface swept by tropomyosin during muscle activity, which may suggest a common pathological mechanism. All three CFTD cases with ACTA1 mutations had severe congenital weakness and respiratory failure without ophthalmoplegia. There were no clinical features specific to CFTD cases with ACTA1 mutations, but the presence of normal eye movements in a severe CFTD patient may be an important clue for the presence of a mutation in ACTA1.","dc:creator":"Laing NG","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Actin mutations are one cause of congenital fibre type disproportion."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15468086","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The heterozygous missense variant Leu223Pro (reported by authors as Leu221Pro) affects a residue which forms part of the monomeric actin surface and will be exposed in the F‐actin polymer, however no functional evidence is provided."},{"id":"cggv:87fd9f8b-a2e2-4a0c-a057-cb1d658eef23_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:adc89cc0-2053-4bfa-b930-7fae40a4df6a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"PCR amplified all exons for Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"severe nemaline myopathy","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003798","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:87fd9f8b-a2e2-4a0c-a057-cb1d658eef23_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5475a5b9-f10f-45c5-bc82-5c9810a48ac7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001100.3(ACTA1):c.863A>G (p.Asp288Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345145991"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10508519"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10508519","rdfs:label":"Patient 17"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The heterozygous missense variant Asp288Gly (reported by authors as Asp286Gly) occurs at a position that forms a salt bridge with Arg39, binds other actin molecules, and is a profilin binding site.

The presence of nemaline rods and actin-like filaments in addition to small zebra bodies suggested ACTA1 as a candidate gene. This has been confirmed by the identification of a novel c.1043T.p.Leu348Gln mutation, which probably occurred de novo. This case illustrates that the myopathy associated with zebra bodies is part of the spectrum of myopathies associated with the ACTA1 gene. It also highlights that accumulation of actin filaments is not confined to severe neonatal ACTA1 cases and that progression of weakness can occur in congenital myopathies, as the patient is now wheelchair bound and can only stand with the aid of a walking frame.

Muscle biopsy at 5 weeks of age was uninformative. Repeat biopsy at 4.5 years revealed subsarcolemmally located caps that were immunopositive for alpha-actinin, actin and to some extent, desmin.

These variants lead to a variety of overlapping adult onset and congenital myopathies characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, myopathic face, respiratory dysfunction, and rarely cardiac involvement. While nemaline myopathy is the most common presentation, several other myopathies have been reported in association with ACTA1 mutations. \nSpecific skeletal muscle structural lesions visible on muscle biopsy include actin accumulations, nemaline and intranuclear bodies, fiber-type disproportion, cores, caps, dystrophic features and zebra bodies. Disorders associated with ACTA1 pathogenic variants can have autosomal dominant (90%) or recessive (10%) inheritance. Per criteria outlined by the Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the absence of clearly defined and/or distinct differences in molecular mechanism, coupled with noted phenotypic variability (both intra- and inter-familial) for individual variants, indicating that these entities are part of the same clinical spectrum. ACTA1 was first reported in relation to semidominant actinopathy in 1994 (Nowak KJ, et al., 1999, PMID: 10508519). At least 190 unique variants (primarily missense but also nonsense, frameshift, splicing, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25938801, 25747004, 17187373, 15468086, 15520409, 20303757). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 8 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction, its skeletal muscle specific expression, the functional alteration of contractility in patient cells (PMID: 29328520) and both a null mouse (PMID: 12138199) and a knock-in mouse model (PMID: 21303860) that recapitulate human disease. In summary ACTA1 is definitively associated with semidominant inheritance of actinopathy.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9a8d04be-c08f-444b-b9cd-cd7de2e282c2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
