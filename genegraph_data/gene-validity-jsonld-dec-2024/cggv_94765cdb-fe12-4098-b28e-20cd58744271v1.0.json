Subsequent UBE2A screening of a phenotypically similar second family revealed another missense mutation, R11Q, again affecting an evolutionarily conserved amino acid close to the N-terminus of the protein. SIFT and PolyPhen analyses suggest that both mutations are pathogenic, which is supported by their absence in 168 healthy controls.

Similarly, mouse mRad6a (Ube2a) knockout and patient-derived hRad6a (Ube2a) mutant cells show defective mitochondria.

The syndrome is caused by Xq24 deletions encompassing the UBE2A (HR6A) gene or by intragenic UBE2A mutations. UBE2A encodes an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in DNA repair and female fertility. A recent study in Drosophila showed that dUBE2A binds to the E3 ligase Parkin, which is required for mitochondrial function and responsible for juvenile Parkinson's disease. In addition, these studies showed impairments in synaptic transmission in dUBE2A mutant flies. However, a causal role of UBE2A in of cognitive deficits has not yet been established. Here, we show that Ube2a knockout mice have a major deficit in spatial learning tasks, whereas other tested phenotypes, including epilepsy and motor coordination, were normal. Results from electrophysiological measurements in the hippocampus showed no deficits in synaptic transmission nor in the ability to induce long-term synaptic potentiation. However, a small but significant deficit was observed in mGLUR-dependent long-term depression, a pathway previously implied in several other mouse models for neurodevelopmental disorders.

This association was made using Case-level data only.

UBE2A was first associated with this disease ( and a synonymous disease nomenclature of UBE2A deficiency syndrome) in humans as early as 2006 (Nascimento et al., 2006 PMID: 16909393). The syndrome is associated with familial and de novo transmission in humans, and has been observed in at least 10 probands in 7 publications. Furthermore, CNV at this locus on the X-chromosome (Xq24) is also associated with ID with overlapping phenotypes, indicating UBE2A as a causative gene for ID. The mechanism for disease is loss of function (LOF). The gene-disease association is supported by biochemical studies (as it is a ubiquitin proteasome pathway) and animal models.
