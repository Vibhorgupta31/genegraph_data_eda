It is genetically and clinically heterogeneous, occurring in X-linked and autosomal-recessive forms and exhibiting various patterns of principally affected tissues (liver only, muscle only, liver and muscle, liver and kidney, heart only). This heterogeneity is thought to reflect the enzyme's structural complexity [subunit composition, (alpha beta gamma delta)4] and isoform diversity. Two isoforms encoded by separate genes are known for the subunits alpha (muscle [alpha M] and liver [alpha L isoforms) and gamma (muscle [gamma M] and testis [gamma T] isoforms), whereas only one gene appears to exist for the subunit beta. The subunit delta is calmodulin; identical calmodulins are expressed from three different human genes. Additional isoform diversity arises by differential mRNA splicing of the alpha M, alpha L and beta subunits. Mutations responsible for the various forms of Phk deficiency are sought in those subunit/isoform genes with a matching chromosomal location and tissue-specificity of expression. We report here that autosomal liver-specific Phk deficiency is associated with mutations in the gene encoding the testis/liver isoform of the catalytic gamma subunit (PHKG2). We found homozygous PHKG2 mutations in three human patients of consanguineous parentage and in the gsd (glycogen storage disease) rat strain, which is thus identified as an animal model for the human disorder. One human mutation is a single base-pair insertion in codon 89 that causes a frameshift and premature chain termination. The three other mutations result in non-conservative replacements of amino acid residues (V106E, G189E, D215N) that are highly conserved within the catalytic core regions of all protein kinases. These are the first mutations to be reported for an autosomal form of Phk deficiency. The findings suggest that the PHKG2 gene product is the predominant isoform of the catalytic gamma subunit of Phk not only in testis but also in liver, erythrocytes and, possibly, other non-muscle tissues.","dc:creator":"Maichele AJ","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Mutations in the testis/liver isoform of the phosphorylase kinase gamma subunit (PHKG2) cause autosomal liver glycogenosis in the gsd

Presenting symptoms include hepatomegaly, ketotic hypoglycemia, and growth delay. Clinical severity varies widely. Autosomal recessive mutations in the PHKG2 gene, which cause about 10-15% of cases, have been associated with severe symptoms including increased risk of liver cirrhosis in childhood. We have summarized the molecular, biochemical, and clinical findings in five patients, age 5-16 years, diagnosed with liver PhK deficiency caused by PHKG2 gene mutations. We have identified five novel and two previously reported mutations in the PHKG2 gene in these five patients. Clinical severity was variable among these patients. Histopathological studies were performed for four of the patients on liver biopsy samples, all of which showed signs of fibrosis but not cirrhosis.

The autosomal-recessive, liver-specific variant of Phk deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the testis/liver isoform of the catalytic gamma subunit, PHKG2. To facilitate mutation detection and to improve our understanding of the molecular evolution of Phk subunit isoforms, we have determined the structure of the human PHKG2 gene. The gene extends over 9.5 kilonucleotides and is divided into 10 exons; positions of introns are highly conserved between PHKG2 and the gene of the muscle isoform of the gamma subunit, PHKG1. The beginning of intron 2 harbors a highly informative GGT/GT microsatellite repeat, the first polymorphic marker in the PHKG2 gene at human chromosome 16p11.2-p12.1. Employing the gene sequence, we have identified homozygous translation-terminating mutations, 277delC and Arg44ter, in the two published cases of liver Phk deficiency who developed cirrhosis in childhood. As liver Phk deficiency is generally a benign condition and progression to cirrhosis is very rare, this finding suggests that PHKG2 mutations are associated with an increased cirrhosis risk.","dc:creator":"Burwinkel B","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Liver glycogenosis due to phosphorylase kinase deficiency: PHKG2 gene structure and mutations associated with cirrhosis."}},"rdfs:label":"Burwinkel_1998_A"},{"id":"cggv:420c909b-9348-4c20-b878-f9f17cff4096","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:420c909b-9348-4c20-b878-f9f17cff4096_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:420c909b-9348-4c20-b878-f9f17cff4096_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Phk activity 10% of controls"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"homozygosity, consanguinity, testing method"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0c7ccc11-d1c6-405d-9ae0-5e5e184d1826_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c7ccc11-d1c6-405d-9ae0-5e5e184d1826","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:5fd6fa65-eabe-473b-a565-a172fa5be882","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000294.3(PHKG2):c.802_805del (p.Ile268ProfsTer12)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695223528"}},"detectionMethod":"long range PCR","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"decreased a/a + b ratio","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001395","obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0006568"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e2e2ecf3-a9f4-408f-bc18-512674c56605_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5fd6fa65-eabe-473b-a565-a172fa5be882"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21646031","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Glycogen storage disease (GSD) due to a deficient hepatic phosphorylase system defines a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that mainly manifests in children.

We demonstrated the clinical presentation and genetic determinants involved in children with PHKG2- related liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency. Methodology Ten Pakistani children with liver phosphorylase kinase from seven different families, were enrolled over a period of 18 months. All regions of the PHKG2 gene spanning exons and splicing sites were evaluated through targeted exome sequencing. Variants were analyzed using different bioinformatics tools. Novel variants were reconfirmed by direct sequencing. Results Seven different variants were identified in PHKG2 gene including five novel variants: three stop codons (c.226C>T [p.R76*], c.454C>T [p.R152*] and c.958C>T [p.R320*]), one missense variant c.107C>T (p.S36F) and one splice site variant (c.557-3C>G). All five novel variants were predicted to be damaging by in Silico analysis. The variants are being transmitted through recessive pattern of inheritance except one family (two siblings) has compound heterozygotes. Laboratory data revealed elevated transaminases and triglycerides, normal creatinine phosphokinase and uric acid levels but with glycogen loaded hepatocytes on liver histology. Conclusion PHKG2 related liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency can mimic both liver glycogenosis type I (glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency) & III(amylo-1,6 glucosidase) and characterized by early childhood onset of hepatomegaly, growth restriction, elevated liver enzymes and triglycerides. Molecular analysis would be helpful in accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. The symptoms and biochemical abnormalities in liver glycogenosis due phosphorylase kinase deficiency tend to improve with proper dietary restrictions but need to be monitored for long-term complications such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.","dc:creator":"Waheed N","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Variability of clinical and biochemical phenotype in liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency with variants in the phosphorylase kinase (PHKG2) gene."}},{"id":"cggv:2a2358ad-17b3-433a-812a-e4fdee9b3d58_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8f5cbe6a-2bfc-4122-9ccc-2b5c38f606db"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32697758"}],"rdfs:label":"Waheed_2020_1a"},{"id":"cggv:7c567b3c-74c8-4e2d-86f2-ff6d10c6d68d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c567b3c-74c8-4e2d-86f2-ff6d10c6d68d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downscored for consanguinity and sequencing"},{"id":"cggv:2a2358ad-17b3-433a-812a-e4fdee9b3d58","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2a2358ad-17b3-433a-812a-e4fdee9b3d58_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downscored for consanguinity and sequencing method"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4fc2b3f8-3d59-464d-b6ea-b07d440f11ae_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4fc2b3f8-3d59-464d-b6ea-b07d440f11ae","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c674507f-3094-44e7-9d4f-426aac2fded9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000294.3(PHKG2):c.130C>T (p.Arg44Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA123299"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"increased serum lactate, lactic acidosis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0006568","obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0001394","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0002155"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:08f93e54-b7ad-4717-9f93-b9ea1193dd9b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c674507f-3094-44e7-9d4f-426aac2fded9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9384616"},"rdfs:label":"Burwinkel_1998_B"},{"id":"cggv:08f93e54-b7ad-4717-9f93-b9ea1193dd9b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08f93e54-b7ad-4717-9f93-b9ea1193dd9b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:08f93e54-b7ad-4717-9f93-b9ea1193dd9b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Phk activity undetectable"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downscored for homozygosity (0.5), consanguinity (0.5), and testing method (0.5).\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10},{"id":"cggv:c598d3b3-2356-4404-ae5c-fa998c192bc4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c598d3b3-2356-4404-ae5c-fa998c192bc4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2dd8f704-1f8f-4f79-9f5b-811f9846bd75","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04b59a1b-f3bd-47ad-a58e-92ca0ae819f8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Elevated liver glycogen and hypoglycemia are consistent with the understood role of PHKG2 in GSD IXc.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10487978","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Intracellular glycogen stores are used to maintain blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting, are a source of energy for muscle contraction, and are used to support a broad range of cellular activities in most tissues. A diversity of signals accelerate glycogen degradation that are mediated by phosphorylase b kinase (Phk), which phosphorylates and thereby activates glycogen phosphorylase. Phk is among the most complex of the protein kinases so far elucidated. It has one catalytic (gamma) subunit and three different regulatory (alpha, beta, and delta) subunits, a molecular mass of 1.3 X 106 daltons, and each holoenzyme molecule is presumed to contain four molecules of each subunit. The three regulatory subunits inhibit the phosphotransferase activity of the gamma subunit. Ca2+ relieves inhibition via the delta subunit, which is identical to calmodulin but remains an integral component of the holoenzyme even when the [Ca2+] is lowered to nanomolar levels. Phosphorylation of the alpha and beta subunits by the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) also relieves inhibition of the gamma subunit and thereby activates the enzyme. The stimulatory effects of Ca2+ and phosphorylation appear to be structurally coupled and are cooperative. In addition, Phk is activated in vitro by autophosphorylation, limited proteolysis of the regulatory subunits, and various allosteric effectors and these may also be mechanisms of physiological importance.

At least 7 patients were shown to have a variant that leads to significantly reduced or absent PhK activity (PMID: 6962066, 8896567, 9384616, 35549678, 24389071, 25266922, 21646031). This disease does not appear to disproportionately affect any specific population. Patients included in this curation have ancestry in Europe, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. One variant of interest (c.643G>A [p.Asp215Asn]) seen in one patient (PMID: 25266922) is interestingly the same variant observed in the rat model, as discussed below (PMID: 8896567). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical assays and animal models (PMID: 34083142, 10487978, 30659246, 8896567). First, biochemical experiments demonstrating the function of *PHKG2* in glycogen metabolism are consistent with the phenotypes of elevated liver glycogen and hypoglycemia seen in patients (PMID: 10487978). Next, *PHKB* encodes a protein with a similar function to *PHKG2*, as *PHKB* is also a subunit (beta) of phosphorylase b kinase. *PHKB* is implicated in a similar disease, GSD IXb, and was classified as definitive by the General IEM GCEP (PMID: 30659246). GTEx analysis showed *PHKG2* highly expressed in the testis, but not more highly expressed in the liver compared to other tissues. Although this evidence was evaluated for expression evidence A, it was not scored due to lack of increased expression in hepatic tissues (PMID: 23715323). Maichele et al. published a rat model in 1996 with the p.D215N variant. This model organism demonstrated a variety of GSD-related phenotypes also seen in humans including hepatomegaly, elevated liver glycogen, and impaired glycogen mobilization during fasting (PMID: 8896567). Finally, Gibson et al. published a mouse model in 2021 developed through a targeted Phkg2 knockout. Similarly to the rat model from Maichele et al., these mice showed increased liver glycogen in addition to decreased liver PhK enzyme activity, increased liver body weight ratio (hepatomegaly), and early perisinusoidal liver fibrosis (PMID: 34083142).\n\nIn summary, *PHKG2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease IXc. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on the meeting date [03/08/2024] (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c598d3b3-2356-4404-ae5c-fa998c192bc4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
