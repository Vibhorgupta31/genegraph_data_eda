Mutations in UMOD, MUC1, and REN are responsible for many, but not all, cases of ADTKD. We report on two families with ADTKD and congenital anemia accompanied by either intrauterine growth retardation or neutropenia. Ultrasound and kidney biopsy revealed small dysplastic kidneys with cysts and tubular atrophy with secondary glomerular sclerosis, respectively. Exclusion of known ADTKD genes coupled with linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, and targeted re-sequencing identified heterozygous missense variants in SEC61A1-c.553A>G (p.Thr185Ala) and c.200T>G (p.Val67Gly)-both affecting functionally important and conserved residues in SEC61. Both transiently expressed SEC6A1A variants are delocalized to the Golgi, a finding confirmed in a renal biopsy from an affected individual. Suppression or CRISPR-mediated deletions of sec61al2 in zebrafish embryos induced convolution defects of the pronephric tubules but not the pronephric ducts, consistent with the tubular atrophy observed in the affected individuals. Human mRNA encoding either of the two pathogenic alleles failed to rescue this phenotype as opposed to a complete rescue by human wild-type mRNA. Taken together, these findings provide a mechanism by which mutations in SEC61A1 lead to an autosomal-dominant syndromic form of progressive chronic kidney disease. We highlight protein translocation defects across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the principal role of the SEC61 complex, as a contributory pathogenic mechanism for ADTKD.

EBV-transformed cell line from patient showed absence of any truncated protein product, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay. Default score is awarded. Note, the authors report the variant in this patient as c.1325G>T (exon 12), which actually results in a Gly442Val missense change. Considering the amino acid at position 381 is Glu, the appropriate cDNA change is recorded for the proband."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantNullVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":3179,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":10.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:55a28754-d1ea-42fc-b2b1-9573e0c0df83","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100337","gene":"hgnc:18276","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between SEC61A1 and SEC61A1 deficiency, an autosomal dominant disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of June, 2021. SEC61A1 encodes the alpha subunit of the heteromeric SEC61 complex, which also contains beta and gamma subunits. It has a role in the insertion of secretory and membrane polypeptides into the endoplasmic reticulum. SEC61A1 deficiency is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent respiratory infections (Tangye et al; PMID: 31953710). Patients in the literature have been described with different diagnosed entities such as Autosomal dominant tubulointerstital kidney disease, Primary antibody deficiency and severe congenital neutropenia. SEC61A1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant SEC61A1 deficiency in 2016 (Bolar et al, PMID: 27392076). Variants reported in this gene thus far include missense and nonsense variants. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, including segregation data, and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (8.5 points):\nThere have been 6 patients from 4 publications, till date, reported with heterozygous variants in SEC61A1 (PMID: 27392076, 28782633, 32325141, 33185949). The mechanism of disease is reported to be haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect leading to functional haploinsufficiency. \n\nSummary of experimental data (2 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in-vitro functional assays and an animal model. SEC61A1 is localized subcellularly within the endoplasmic reticulum, but mutant SEC61A1 protein is found in clumps and localized in the ER and Golgi (PMID: 27392076). ER stress and increased calcium leak are reported as disease pathomechanism and are demonstrated in patients as well as experimental systems (PMID: 32325141). Knock-down of SEC61A1 using CRISPR/Cas9 or splice morpholino techniques in zebrafish results in pronephric tubular atrophy (PMID: 27392076) and partially recapitulates the human phenotype.  \n  \nIn summary, the level of evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of SEC61A1 and autosomal dominant SEC61A1 deficiency is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. \n\nOMIM entities: Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 5 (MIM: 617056). Additional entities from the literature: familial juvenile hyperurecemic nephropathy (PMID: 31488840), Primary antibody deficiency (PMID: 28782633) and severe congenital neutropenia (PMID: 32325141).\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, while multiple disease assertions are made in the literature with the same autosomal dominant inheritance, there is limited evidence relating to the molecular mechanism(s) AND phenotypic variability in the above mentioned disease entities. PMID: 31953710 suggests the term SEC61A1 deficiency that encompasses all the phenotypes. Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, autosomal dominant SEC61A1 deficiency. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Deficiencies Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date June 15, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1ff61d15-19f9-42a2-8dc4-0a4071b562eb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
