This curation is considered a gene-deficiency curation, due to the lack of evidence supporting this gene being involved in any disease or disorder beyond a prolonged PTT. Evidence supporting this gene-deficiency curation includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.  At least 6 unique variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans.   Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in over 8 publications.  Variants in this gene segregated with kininogen deficiency in 2 additional family members.  The gene-deficiency relationship is supported by an animal model (Merkulov et al, PMID: 18000168) and expression studies (Krijanovski et al, PMID: 12576314). In summary, KNG1 is definitively associated with (high molecular weight) kininogen deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and the clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6dbf4bc1-b04f-4f1d-8c11-2b7998370293"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
