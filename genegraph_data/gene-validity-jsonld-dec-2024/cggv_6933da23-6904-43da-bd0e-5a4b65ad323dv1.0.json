In two siblings, a male and female, we identified an undescribed type of lethal congenital restrictive cardiomyopathy affecting the right ventricle. We hypothesized a novel autosomal recessive condition. To identify the cause, we performed genetic, in vitro and in vivo studies. Genome-wide SNP typing and parametric linkage analysis was done in a recessive model to identify candidate regions. Exome sequencing analysis was done in unaffected and affected siblings. In the linkage regions, we selected candidate genes that harbor two rare variants with predicted functional effects in the patients and for which the unaffected sibling is either heterozygous or homozygous reference. We identified two compound heterozygous variants in KIF20A; a maternal missense variant (c.544C>T: p.R182W) and a paternal frameshift mutation (c.1905delT: p.S635Tfs*15). Functional studies confirmed that the R182W mutation creates an ATPase defective form of KIF20A which is not able to support efficient transport of Aurora B as part of the chromosomal passenger complex. Due to this, Aurora B remains trapped on chromatin in dividing cells and fails to translocate to the spindle midzone during cytokinesis. Translational blocking of KIF20A in a zebrafish model resulted in a cardiomyopathy phenotype. We identified a novel autosomal recessive congenital restrictive cardiomyopathy, caused by a near complete loss-of-function of KIF20A. This finding further illustrates the relationship of cytokinesis and congenital cardiomyopathy.","dc:creator":"Louw JJ","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in KIF20A are associated with a novel lethal congenital cardiomyopathy in two siblings."},"rdfs:label":"KIF20A Zebrafish Rescue Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Although the injection of WT KIF20A cDNA resulted in a statistically significant result, the score was reduced since WT only partially (roughly 20%) rescued the cardiac phenotype in the model.

The autosomal recessive inheritance pattern is supported by the unaffected carrier parents in PMID: 29357359 and by the absence of cardiovascular phenotypes in DECIPHER heterozygous cases. *KIF20A* encodes a microtubule-associated motor protein that has roles in cell division and intracellular transport (PMID: 10806357). One frameshift variant and one missense variant that have been reported in one family from one publication (PMID: 29357359) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a zebrafish model that exhibits a cardiac phenotype which was partially rescued by the injection of wild-type *KIF20A* (PMID: 29357359). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
