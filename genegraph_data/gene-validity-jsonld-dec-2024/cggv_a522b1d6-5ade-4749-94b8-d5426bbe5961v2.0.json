Furthermore, disease mutations in CLN5 abolished interaction with CLN2, while not affecting association with CLN3. The molecular characterization of CLN5 revealed that it was synthesized as four precursor forms, due to usage of alternative initiator methionines in translation. All forms were targeted to lysosomes and the longest form, translated from the first potential methionine, was associated with membranes. Interactions between CLN polypeptides were shown to occur with this longest, membrane-bound form of CLN5. Both intracellular targeting and posttranslational glycosylation of the polypeptides carrying human disease mutations were similar to wild-type CLN5.","dc:creator":"Vesa J","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are connected at molecular level: interaction of CLN5 protein with CLN2 and CLN3."},"rdfs:label":"CLN5 Interaction with TPP1 (CLN2)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a522b1d6-5ade-4749-94b8-d5426bbe5961_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c22485cc-03b7-4266-a552-bc18902cb714","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:09c43f0a-9a6a-4cf6-adb7-de2df9b9ff4c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The presence of visual impairment, seizures, and ataxia is clinically similar, plus the dogs also has similar brain pathology, including accumulation of autofluorescent lysosomal storage material.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27203721","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a fatal neurodegenerative disease, has been diagnosed in young adult Australian Cattle Dogs.","dc:creator":"Kolicheski A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Australian Cattle Dogs with Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis are Homozygous for a CLN5 Nonsense Mutation Previously Identified in Border Collies."},"rdfs:label":"Spontaneous Dog Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:a522b1d6-5ade-4749-94b8-d5426bbe5961_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a522b1d6-5ade-4749-94b8-d5426bbe5961_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:47395688-680a-4330-995a-83dd1a3494af_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47395688-680a-4330-995a-83dd1a3494af","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:78e624be-9c22-4d59-a479-50b4cf4c8556","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006493.4(CLN5):c.78G>A (p.Trp26Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340000"}},"detectionMethod":"Linkage analysys was performed for families with vLINCL and a long-range physical map was constructed.

They are characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments in various tissues. Several forms of NCLs have been identified, based on age at onset, progression of disease, neurophysiological and histopathological findings and separate genetic loci. All types of NCL cause progressive visual and mental decline, motor disturbance, epilepsy and behavioral changes, and lead to premature death. One of the subtypes, Finnish variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (vLINCL; MIM256731) affects children at 4-7 years of age. The first symptom is motor clumsiness, followed by progressive visual failure, mental and motor deterioration and later by myoclonia and seizures. We have previously reported linkage for vLINCL on chromosome 13 (ref. 5) and constructed a long-range physical map over the region. Here, we report the positional cloning of a novel gene, CLN5, underlying this severe neurological disorder. The gene encodes a putative transmembrane protein which shows no homology to previously reported proteins. Sequence analysis of DNA samples from patients with three different haplotypes revealed three mutations; one deletion, one nonsense and one missense mutation, suggesting that mutations in this gene are responsible for vLINCL.","dc:creator":"Savukoski M","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"CLN5, a novel gene encoding a putative transmembrane protein mutated in Finnish variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."}},"rdfs:label":"Fin Minor"},{"id":"cggv:0647a378-0d83-4351-b079-b2135f88435b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0647a378-0d83-4351-b079-b2135f88435b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Homozygous in 2 Finnish individuals with vLINCL; no functional studies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:46214b5c-a17a-4baa-8b64-f9313a176024_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46214b5c-a17a-4baa-8b64-f9313a176024","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d42426ef-2f86-417f-acf8-46e49b3ad34e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006493.4(CLN5):c.772del (p.Arg258GlufsTer29)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA263917"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0033044","obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000572"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Full sequencing of CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, CLN6, CLN8 was negative.

Patients with NCL diagnosed between 1960 and 2005 were ascertained through the provincial genetics and pediatric neurology clinics. Fifty-two patients from 34 families were identified. DNA was obtained from 28/34 (82%) families; 18 families had mutations in the CLN2 gene, comprising five different mutations of which two were novel. One family had a CLN3 mutation, another had a novel mutation in CLN5, and five families shared the same mutation in CLN6. One family was misdiagnosed, and in two, molecular testing was inconclusive. Disease from CLN2 mutations had an earlier presentation (p = 0.003) and seizure onset (p < 0.001) compared with CLN6 mutation. There was a slower clinical course for those with CLN5 mutation compared with CLN2 mutation. NCL in Newfoundland has a high incidence, 1 in 7353 live births, and shows extensive genetic heterogeneity.

Although clinically rather uniform, variant late-infantile onset NCL (vLINCL) is genetically heterogeneous with four major underlying genes identified so far. We evaluated the genetic background underlying vLINCL in 119 patients, and specifically analysed the recently reported CLN7/MFSD8 gene for mutations in 80 patients. Clinical data were collected from the CLN7/MFSD8 mutation positive patients. Eight novel CLN7/MFSD8 mutations and seven novel mutations in the CLN1/PPT1, CLN2/TPP1, CLN5, CLN6 and CLN8 genes were identified in patients of various ethnic origins. A significant group of Roma patients originating from the former Czechoslovakia was shown to bear the c.881C>A (p.Thr294Lys) mutation in CLN7/MFSD8, possibly due to a founder effect. With one exception, the CLN7/MFSD8 mutation positive patients present a phenotype indistinguishable from the other vLINCL forms. In one patient with an in-frame amino acid substitution mutation in CLN7/MFSD8, the disease onset was later and the disease course less aggressive than in variant late-infantile NCL. Our findings raise the total number of CLN7/MFSD8 mutations to 14 with the majority of families having private mutations. Our study confirms that CLN7/MFSD8 defects are not restricted to the Turkish population, as initially anticipated, but are a relatively common cause of NCL in different populations. CLN7/MFSD8 should be considered a diagnostic alternative not only in variant late-infantile but also later onset NCL forms with a more protracted disease course. A significant number of NCL patients in Turkey exist, in which the underlying genetic defect remains to be determined.","dc:creator":"Kousi M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in CLN7/MFSD8 are a common cause of variant late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."}},"rdfs:label":"370Pa"},{"id":"cggv:956319cf-f8bb-4cb6-a2c6-17c3cfba7282","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:956319cf-f8bb-4cb6-a2c6-17c3cfba7282_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant located in last exon so predicted to cause protein truncation but not NMD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3339,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:1b7616d4-dbf9-4ee6-91d6-f599926b944b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016295","gene":"hgnc:2076","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by mental and motor deterioration, epilepsy, visual loss, ataxia, and a reduced life span. The unifying finding in NCL patients is the accumulation, in neurons and many other cell types, of autofluorescent storage material. There are 13 subtypes of NCLs that are categorized based on the particular gene that is mutated.  \n\nCLN5 is associated with autosomal recessive NCL, with typical onset in preschool or early childhood, often described as variant late infantile NCL (vLINCL). CLN5 is an intracellular trafficking protein that is implicated in recruitment of the retromer complex to endosomes.  It is translated into a preprotein with an N-terminal transmembrane domain that is cleaved to form the active soluble protein. The historic nomenclature differs from the current nomenclature used in ClinVar and some more recent publications by 147 nucleotides / 49 amino acids. \n\nCLN5 was first identified as a cause of NCL in 1998 in a study that identified a founder mutation (c.1026_1027AT AKA AKA c.1175_1176delAT) in individuals with vLINCL from 17 familes (Savukoski et al., 1998, PMID: 9662406). Since then, more than 50 variants have been reported, and more than half are protein truncating (Kousi et al., 2012, PMID: 21990111; https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ncl//mutation.shtml). Eight symptomatic probands from unrelated families with homozygous or compound heterozygous CLN5 variants reported by five studies were scored for genetic evidence (PMID: 9662406, 20157158, 19201763, 18684116, 21990111). Four probands had homozygous nonsense or frameshift variants in the last exon that are expected to cause protein truncation and in the absence of functional studies are not proven to be null so were given a modified score. The remaining probands were homozygous or compound heterozygous for two variants in trans that were proven/predicted to be null, and were given scores of 2. Functional studies were used to upgrade the points for two probands with frameshift variants in the last exon. No LOD scores could be calculated from these families because only a single affected individual was reported or detailed family information was not provided. Supporting experimental evidence includes protein interaction with CLN2 (12134079), non-human model organisms (dog: 27203721), and rescue in non-human model organisms  by adeno associated virus-mediated gene transfer (mouse: 17637720; dog: 26560358). In summary, a score of 12 was given to genetic evidence, and 2.5 to experimental evidence, reaching 14.5 in total. The association between CLN5 and NCL has been replicated over time and is therefore considered definitive.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a522b1d6-5ade-4749-94b8-d5426bbe5961"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
