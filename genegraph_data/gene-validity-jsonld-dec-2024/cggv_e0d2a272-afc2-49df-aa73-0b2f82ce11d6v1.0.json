Here, we show that Foxp1 is expressed in the myocardium as well as the endocardium of the developing heart. To further explore the role of Foxp1 in cardiac development, we inactivated Foxp1 through gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Foxp1 mutant embryos have severe defects in cardiac morphogenesis, including outflow tract septation and cushion defects, a thin ventricular myocardial compact zone caused by defects in myocyte maturation and proliferation, and lack of proper ventricular septation. These defects lead to embryonic death at E14.5 and are similar to those observed in other mouse models of congenital heart disease, including Sox4 and Nfatc1 null embryos. Interestingly, expression of Sox4 in the outflow tract and cushions of Foxp1 null embryos is significantly reduced, while remodeling of the cushions is disrupted, as demonstrated by reduced apoptosis and persistent Nfatc1 expression in the cushion mesenchyme. Our results reveal a crucial role for Foxp1 in three aspects of cardiac development: (1) outflow tract development and septation, (2) tissue remodeling events required for cardiac cushion development, and (3) myocardial maturation and proliferation.","dc:creator":"Wang B","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Foxp1 regulates cardiac outflow tract, endocardial cushion morphogenesis and myocyte proliferation and maturation."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e0d2a272-afc2-49df-aa73-0b2f82ce11d6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb2a2cd1-6f93-4071-9988-a55405eb8188","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5748218d-0373-4ac7-963d-e5cda38f2c5c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Foxp1 mutant embryos have severe defects in cardiac morphogenesis, including outflow tract septation and cushion defects, a thin ventricular myocardial compact zone caused by defects in myocyte maturation and proliferation, and lack of proper ventricular septation.

For this curation, variants in FOXP1 have been reported in individuals with the following phenotypes: atrioventricular septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in intellectual developmental disorder with language impairment with or without autistic features (OMIM:613670) and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). These will be assessed separately. At least 3 variants (missense, deep intronic deletion, and a large deletion) have been reported in humans (23766104, 33084842). Evidence disputing this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. Of the three variants reported, one is too frequent to cause disease, another is a deep intronic deletion with unknown functional consequence, and the third is a large deletion that encompasses microRNA hsa-miR-1284 and was inherited from an unaffected parent; therefore, none of the published genetic evidence was scorable. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models and expression studies (15342473). In summary, due to the lack of convincing genetic evidence, the evidence supporting the relationship between *FOXP1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *FOXP1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date December 11, 2023 (SOP Version 10).\nVariants in FOXP1 were identified in four individuals with congenital heart disease. However, none of these variants were suspicious enough or convincing enough to score. Therefore, the GCEP has classified this gene-disease relationship as disputed.
