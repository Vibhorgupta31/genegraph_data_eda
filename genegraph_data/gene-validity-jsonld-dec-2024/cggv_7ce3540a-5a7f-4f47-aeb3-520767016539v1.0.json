PIK3CA is a gene that encodes Î± catalytic subunit of this enzyme. A common polymorphism of PIK3CA, rs7640662 (C/G), was analyzed, and its association to breast cancer cases was determined. In this study, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 278 women suffering from breast cancer and 128 healthy women. Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR) method was performed to genotype rs7640662. P values and ODD ratios were measured using SPSS. P value less than 0.05 and ODD ratios more than 1 were considered as significant. All ODD ratios were less than 1, and P values were more than 0.05 showing that rs7640662 (C/G) and breast cancer are not significantly associated. However, the genotypes observed in the Persian population, as an ancient population living in the Middle East, was significantly different from the genotypes reported by HapMap for Asian populations.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we only focus on hereditary breast cancer in this curation. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point**\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 1 case-control study at the aggregate variant level. In 2021, a large case-control study [BCAC (PMID: 33471991) with more than 48 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *PI3KCA* and breast cancer. \n\n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *PI3KCA* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as no known disease relationship by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 2/8//2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between PI3KCA and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer.
