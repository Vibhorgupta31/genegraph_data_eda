Although the genetic basis is partly understood, only a fraction of cases can receive a genetic diagnosis, and a global view of HSP is lacking. By using whole-exome sequencing in combination with network analysis, we identified 18 previously unknown putative HSP genes and validated nearly all of these genes functionally or genetically. The pathways highlighted by these mutations link HSP to cellular transport, nucleotide metabolism, and synapse and axon development. Network analysis revealed a host of further candidate genes, of which three were mutated in our cohort. Our analysis links HSP to other neurodegenerative disorders and can facilitate gene discovery and mechanistic understanding of disease.

This disease is caused by biallelic variation in the *ARL6IP1* gene. Phenotypes involve the nervous system and the skeletal system including spasticity, scissors gait, spasticity, and polyneuropathy. More variable features may include acropathy, absent achilles tendon reflex and increased patellar reflex. Around 2 unique frameshift variants have been reported in at least 4 probands in various publications (PMID: 24482476,  2847135, 30237576, 31272422). A loss-of-function frameshift variant was also found to segregate with the disorder in additional family members with a LOD score of 3.5 (PMID: 24482476). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by showing that a knockdown of the zebrafish *ARL6IP1* ortholog causes defects in the body axis, motor neuron morphology, and spontaneous swimming behavior (PMID: 24482476).\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship of the *ARL6IP1* gene with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time.
