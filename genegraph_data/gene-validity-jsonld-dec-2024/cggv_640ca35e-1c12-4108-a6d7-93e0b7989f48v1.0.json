In a first patient, a point insertion of a G at position 1022 of the cDNA, produced a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon. In three other patients from two unrelated families we found a missense point mutation leading to glycine to arginine substitution (G232R) in exon 7. This Gly232 appears to be a strictly conserved residue through evolution. In one VP family, we observed the cosegregation of the G232R missense mutation and the deficient PPOX activity.

Two patients were homoallelic for missense mutations (D349A and A433P), while three were heteroallelic. Functional analysis by prokaryotic expression showed that the D349A and A433P and one missense mutation in each of the three heteroallelic patients (G358R in two patients and A219KANA) preserved some PPOX activity (9.5-25% of wild-type). Mutations on the other allele of the heteroallelic patients abolished or markedly decreased activity. There was no relation between genotype assessed by functional analysis and the presence or severity of non-cutaneous manifestations. The mutations were absent from 104 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant VP.

In this study, we identified a mutation in the PPO gene in a patient with VP and two unaffected family members. The mutation consisted of a previously unreported T to C transition in exon 13 of the PPO gene, resulting in the substitution of a polar serine by a non-polar proline (S450P). This serine residue is evolutionarily highly conserved in man, mouse, and Bacillus subtilis, attesting to the importance of this residue. Interestingly, the gene for Gardner's syndrome (FAP) also segregates in this family, independently of the VP mutation. Gardner's syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is also an autosomal dominantly inherited genodermatosis, and typically presents with colorectal cancer in early adult life secondary to extensive adenomatous polyps of the colon. The specific gene on chromosome 5 that is the site of the mutation in this disorder is known as APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), and the gene has been genetically linked to the region of 5q22.","dc:creator":"Frank J","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Molecular basis of variegate porphyria: a missense mutation in the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"19970908_Frank_Proband_1"},{"id":"cggv:f725c9a7-d1a7-4a04-9809-470968bb2381","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f725c9a7-d1a7-4a04-9809-470968bb2381_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f725c9a7-d1a7-4a04-9809-470968bb2381_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"\"Replacing serine with a proline changes the conformation of the neighboring residues and affects the position of residues Gly448 and Ala449, which directly coordinate the pyrophosphate moiety of FAD molecule.

Acute attacks, often precipitated by inappropriate drug therapy, are potentially fatal. While earlier workers thought the distal haem biosynthetic enzyme ferrochelatase may be involved in the genesis of VP, it was shown in the early 1980's, and is now accepted, that VP is associated with decreased protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity (PPO) (E.C.1.3.3.4). VP prevalence is much higher in South Africa than elsewhere; probably due to a founder effect with patients descending from a 17th century Dutch immigrant. PPO cDNAs from Bacillus subtilis, Myxococcus xanthus, human placenta and mouse liver have been cloned, sequenced and expressed. Human and mouse cDNAs consist of open reading frames 1431 nucleotides long, encoding a 477 amino acid protein. The human PPO gene contains thirteen exons, spanning approximately 4.5 kb. We have identified a C to T transition in codon 59 (in exon 3) resulting in an arginine to tryptophan substitution (R59W). A protein expressed from an in vitro-mutagenized PPO construct exhibits substantially less activity than the wild type. The R59W mutation was present in 43 of 45 patients with VP from 26 of 27 South African families investigated, but not in 34 unaffected relatives or 9 unrelated British patients with PPO deficiency.

Mutations in the hPPO gene cause the inherited human disease variegate porphyria (VP). In this study, we report the crystal structure of hPPO in complex with the coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the inhibitor acifluorfen at a resolution of 1.9 Å. The structural and biochemical analyses revealed the molecular details of FAD and acifluorfen binding to hPPO as well as the interactions of the substrate with hPPO. Structural analysis and gel chromatography indicated that hPPO is a monomer rather than a homodimer in vitro. The founder-effect mutation R59W in VP patients is most likely caused by a severe electrostatic hindrance in the hydrophilic binding pocket involving the bulky, hydrophobic indolyl ring of the tryptophan. Forty-seven VP-causing mutations were purified by chromatography and kinetically characterized in vitro. The effect of each mutation was demonstrated in the high-resolution crystal structure.","dc:creator":"Qin X","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Structural insight into human variegate porphyria disease."},"rdfs:label":"Structure of Human PPOX with coenzyme FAD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"I upscored to 2 points because this paper presents a high resolution crystal structure and kinetic analysis of 47 mutants with an explanation for their reduced activity in light of their position on the structure."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Strong","sequence":8339,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":12.8,"subject":{"id":"cggv:cace5343-0925-4fad-a98a-6520ba861e8d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008297","gene":"hgnc:9280","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The gene *PPOX* has been strongly associated with the disease variegate porphyria according to the gene-disease association criteria of the ACMG (SOP version 10).  Previously, variegate porphyria was reported as two disease entities with differing modes of inheritance (autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant) (OMIM). Other papers have discussed the disease as autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance (PMID: 29516370; 10870850). However, based on ACMG lumping and splitting criteria, variegate porphyria has been reclassified as semidominant due to its consistent molecular mechanism of disease and due to the observation that missense mutations that preserve 10–25% of PPOX activity may not cause clinically overt disease (PMID: 9811936).\n\nHomozygous or biallelic pathogenic mutations, which severely reduce enzyme activity (<25% of normal), typically result in symptoms beginning before puberty. The reported symptoms include abnormal blistering of the skin, photosensitivity, brachydactyly, short stature, nystagmus, myopia, sensory neuropathy, intellectual disability, respiratory paralysis, and abnormal circulating porphyrin concentration in plasma, urine, and stool. Individuals who are heterozygous for pathogenic mutations are at risk for an acute attack, usually presenting with abdominal pain, post puberty onset of photosensitivity, or both. The accumulation of neurotoxic porphyrin precursors such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which are linear non-fluorescent molecules, is observed during acute attacks (PMID: 29516370). The accumulation of protoporphyrins, which are circular molecules that emit fluorescence when excited, is responsible for causing cutaneous photosensitivity. Although this disease has been categorized as one of the acute porphyrias, not all affected individuals experience acute attacks. Instead, symptoms are consistent with a spectrum of disease that worsens with lower enzyme activity and for which porphyrogenic agents (e.g. certain drugs, alcohol, low-carb diets, etc.) can induce an attack.\n\nThe gene *PPOX* encodes the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase, which converts protoporphyrinogen-IX to protoporphyrin-IX. This enzyme is localized to the mitochondria and requires the cofactor FAD (vitamin B2). The protein primarily exists in vitro as a monomer but is expected to dimerize in vivo.  Observed variegate porphyria mutations have been mapped to the PPOX structure and separated into the following different categories: affecting FAD binding (R59W, G11D, G11S, L15F, H20P, E34V, G40E, G40A, G232R, G232S, D349A, S350P, G448R, S450P, G453V, G453R), affecting substrate binding (R168H, R168C, G169E, A172V, G330R, G332A, V335G, Y348C, L401F), affecting the hydrophobic core (I12T, V84G, W224G and W224R, L236S, V282D, I283N, and A397D), affecting protein surface interactions (R38P, H106P, R138P, D143V, R152C, and R217C), and affecting protein secondary structure (L295, L444) (PMID: 21048046).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (10.8 points): 12 probands were scored with 14 unique variants (three nonsense and eleven missense variants).\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (2 points): Biochemical characterization of the enzymatic reaction where purified WT and mutant protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity was assayed by measuring the velocity of the formation of protoporphyrin from protoporphyrinogen was scored. The high resolution crystal structure was also scored.\n\nIn summary, *PPOX* has been strongly associated with the semidominant condition, variegate porphyria.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:640ca35e-1c12-4108-a6d7-93e0b7989f48"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
