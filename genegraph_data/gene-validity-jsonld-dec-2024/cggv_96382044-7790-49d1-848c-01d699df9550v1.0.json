RhoA signals through Rock2 to regulate apicobasal polarity, tight junction localization and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The human ArhGEF18 homologue can rescue the mutant phenotype, suggesting a conserved function in vertebrate neuroepithelia. Our analysis identifies ArhGEF18 as a key regulator of tissue architecture and function, controlling apicobasal polarity and proliferation through RhoA activation.

The presence of unsolved families after highly parallel sequencing strategies suggests that further genes remain to be identified. Whole-exome and -genome sequencing studies employed here in large cohorts of affected individuals revealed biallelic mutations in ARHGEF18 in three such individuals. ARHGEF18 encodes ARHGEF18, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates RHOA, a small GTPase protein that is a key component of tight junctions and adherens junctions. This biological pathway is known to be important for retinal development and function, as mutation of CRB1, encoding another component, causes retinal dystrophy. The retinal structure in individuals with ARHGEF18 mutations resembled that seen in subjects with CRB1 mutations. Five mutations were found on six alleles in the three individuals: c.808A>G (p.Thr270Ala), c.1617+5G>A (p.Asp540Glyfs∗63), c.1996C>T (p.Arg666∗), c.2632G>T (p.Glu878∗), and c.2738_2761del (p.Arg913_Glu920del). Functional tests suggest that each disease genotype might retain some ARHGEF18 activity, such that the phenotype described here is not the consequence of nullizygosity. In particular, the p.Thr270Ala missense variant affects a highly conserved residue in the DBL homology domain, which is required for the interaction and activation of RHOA. Previously, knock-out of Arhgef18 in the medaka fish has been shown to cause larval lethality which is preceded by retinal defects that resemble those seen in zebrafish Crumbs complex knock-outs. The findings described here emphasize the peculiar sensitivity of the retina to perturbations of this pathway, which is highlighted as a target for potential therapeutic strategies.","dc:creator":"Arno G","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Biallelic Mutation of ARHGEF18, Involved in the Determination of Epithelial Apicobasal Polarity, Causes Adult-Onset Retinal Degeneration."}},"rdfs:label":"GC17880"},{"id":"cggv:f1282d04-4552-469f-a066-9df7e7db2e7f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1282d04-4552-469f-a066-9df7e7db2e7f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Consanguinity.

The specific disease entity, retinitis pigmentosa 78 (MIM#: 617433), is one of at least 90 reported forms of retinopathy referred to as retinitis pigmentosa. Some of the most common patient phenotypes include; reduced visual acuity, nyctalopia, optic disc pallor, cystoid macular edema, and photopsia, often with diagnosis in adulthood. For the purposes of this gene curation, cases were lumped under the more inclusive disease term \"ARHGEF18-related retinopathy\", to acknowledge the potential for a broader spectrum of disease to emerge in association with variants in this gene.\n\nThis curation includes five variants: (1 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 In-frame multiple-codon deletion, and 1 disrupting splicing) that have collectively been reported in 3 probands in 1 publication (PMID: 28132693). An additional proband harboring two variants in *ARHGEF18* has been considered for inclusion but not scored (PMID: 37217489). Overall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, as shown in the variant types found in the probands.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence including animal models and rescue experiments in medaka fish (PMID: 23698346) and studies characterizing the biochemical function of ARHGEF18. Expression of ARHGEF18 activates RhoA and Rac1 but not cdc42, while ARHGEF18 deletion stops the activation of RhoA and Rac1, indicating a role as a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the pathway establishing apicobasal polarity (PMID: 23698346). Two medaka fish models were generated by chemical mutagenesis screening for defects of retinal epithelial polarity, and were identified with loss-of-function mutations in the *ArhGEF18* gene (PMID: 23698346). The models exhibited aberrant retinal morphologies and retinal pigmentation as well as profound disruption of retinal lamination and retinal polarity. This was recapitulated by morpholino-based silencing of the *ArhGEF18* gene, and could be rescued by injection of mRNA encoding either medaka or human *ARHGEF18* (PMID: 23698346). The concurrence of both rescue models suggests that ARHGEF18 function is conserved throughout vertebrates. These experiments show that ARHGEF18 controls retinal layer organization, which could be related to its role in contributing to cell polarity.\n\nIn conclusion, ARHGEF18 has moderate evidence of association with ARHGEF18-related retinopathy. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. The publication of additional case reports will be critical for this gene-disease relationship to reach a more definitive classification. This classification was approved by the Retina GCEP on November 7th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:96382044-7790-49d1-848c-01d699df9550"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
