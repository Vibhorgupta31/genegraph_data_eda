Individuals with BBS are also at increased risk for diabetes mellitus, hypertension and congenital heart disease. What was once thought to be a homogeneous autosomal recessive disorder is now known to map to at least six loci: 11q13 (BBS1), 16q21 (BBS2), 3p13 p12 (BBS3), 15q22.3 q23 (BBS4), 2q31 (BBS5) and 20p12 (BBS6). There has been considerable interest in identifying the genes that underlie BBS, because some components of the phenotype are common. Cases of BBS mapping ro BBS6 are caused by mutations in MKKS; mutations in this gene also cause McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (hydrometrocolpos, post-axial polydactyly and congenital heart defects). In addition, we recently used positional cloning to identify the genes underlying BBS2 (ref. 16) and BBS4 (ref. 17). The BBS6 protein has similarity to a Thermoplasma acidophilum chaperonin, whereas BBS2 and BBS4 have no significant similarity to chaperonins. It has recently been suggested that three mutated alleles (two at one locus, and a third at a second locus) may be required for manifestation of BBS (triallelic inheritance). Here we report the identification of the gene BBS1 and show that a missense mutation of this gene is a frequent cause of BBS. In addition, we provide data showing that this common mutation is not involved in triallelic inheritance.","dc:creator":"Mykytyn K","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Identification of the gene (BBS1) most commonly involved in Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a complex human obesity syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee6e7562-927a-459b-a0f1-ccd849c7e783_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee6e7562-927a-459b-a0f1-ccd849c7e783_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb1a138c-543a-4f40-b9c3-2470d4983e27","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa5c5e2f-9042-4390-8162-9bd59380cd25","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"An RNA-seq dataset profiling human tissues (PMID: 30239781) shows that BBS1 mRNA is widely expressed but reaches some of its highest levels of expression in ocular tissues such as the lens, retina, and RPE, as well as other cell types such as embryonic stem cells, conjunctiva, and blood.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239781","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The human eye is built from several specialized tissues which direct, capture and pre-process information to provide vision.

This complex, the BBSome, localizes to nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm but also to the membrane of the cilium. Interestingly, the BBSome is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function.

Strikingly, Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane.

The importance of neuronal cilia is underscored by the fact that human diseases caused by primary cilia dysfunction, which are known as ciliopathies, are associated with neuropathologies, including neuropsychiatric disorders and learning and memory deficits. Neuronal cilia are enriched for certain G protein-coupled receptors and their downstream effectors, suggesting they sense and respond to neuromodulators in the extracellular milieu. GPCR ciliary localization is disrupted in neurons from mouse models of the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome, with GPCRs failing to localize to cilia, indicating the Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins are required for trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors into neuronal cilia. Yet, dopamine receptor 1 accumulates in cilia in the absence of Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins, suggesting Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins are required for normal ciliary import and export. To further explore the roles of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins in neuronal cilia, we examined localization of ciliary signaling proteins in a new constitutive Bbs1 knockout mouse model. Interestingly, we find that two additional ciliary G protein-coupled receptors (Gpr161 and Gpr19) abnormally accumulate in cilia on Bardet-Biedl syndrome neurons. In addition, we find that the GPCR signaling protein β-arrestin accumulates in a subset of cilia in the brain, suggesting the presence of additional unidentified ciliary G protein-coupled receptors.

This insertion is extremely rare in the general population (found in 8 alleles of 8 BBS cases but not in >10 800 control individuals from gnomAD-SV) and due to a founder effect. Its 2435 bp sequence contains hallmarks of LINE1 mediated retrotransposition. Functional studies with patient-derived cell lines confirmed that the BBS1 SVA-F is deleterious as evidenced by a significant depletion of both mRNA and protein levels. Such findings highlight the importance of dedicated bioinformatics pipelines to identify all types of variation.","dc:creator":"Delvallée C","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A BBS1 SVA F retrotransposon insertion is a frequent cause of Bardet-Biedl syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:2f44b0e5-745b-4123-baf2-1a545fb440c8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:747d1752-533d-4194-b238-90cd8c6d8880"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33169370"}],"rdfs:label":"Delvallée_2021_Proband_D.II-2"},{"id":"cggv:7e1b51e4-219d-4ff5-9c13-e88e001e3f3c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e1b51e4-219d-4ff5-9c13-e88e001e3f3c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7e1b51e4-219d-4ff5-9c13-e88e001e3f3c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NM_024649.5(BBS1):c.1169T>G (p.Met390Arg) is a missense variant with mouse knock-in evidence of a similar disease-causing effect in the homozygous state (PMID: 18032602)."}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The functional evidence has not been taken into account in scoring, as the mouse model has been scored separately.

The purpose of this study was the identification of the genetic defect in 32 Spanish families with different forms of IRD. With that aim, we implemented a custom NGS panel comprising 64 IRD-associated genes in our population, and three disease-associated intronic regions. A total of 37 pathogenic mutations (14 novels) were found in 73% of IRD patients ranging from 50% for autosomal dominant cases, 75% for syndromic cases, 83% for autosomal recessive cases, and 100% for X-linked cases. Additionally, unexpected phenotype-genotype correlations were found in 6 probands, which led to the refinement of their clinical diagnoses. Furthermore, intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability was observed in two cases. Moreover, two cases unsuccessfully analysed by exome sequencing were resolved by applying this panel. Our results demonstrate that this hypothesis-free approach based on frequently mutated, population-specific loci is highly cost-efficient for the routine diagnosis of this heterogeneous condition and allows the unbiased analysis of a miscellaneous cohort.

Subsequent publications have established that cases diagnosed with Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 exhibit retinal disease as the most penetrant feature, characterized by retinal dystrophy, pigmentary retinopathy, reduced visual acuity, night blindness, peripheral visual field constriction, reduced or absent rod and cone electroretinogram responses, attenuation of retinal blood vessels, optic disc pallor, and/or nystagmus. These phenotypes are generally accompanied by diverse extraocular features such as obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities including cysts, hypoplastic external genitalia in males, and/or intellectual disability. More recent publications have revealed that the spectrum of disease also includes cases diagnosed with juvenile onset retinitis pigmentosa, in which most or all extraocular features are absent (PMID: 23847139, PMID: 27032803). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *BBS1* loss of function) have been found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with either Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (MIM# 209900) or retinitis pigmentosa, while the phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *BBS1* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as BBS1-related ciliopathy.\n\nNine suspected disease-causing variants have been scored as part of this curation (one nonsense, two frameshift, four affecting splicing, one missense, and one large insertion-deletion resulting in a frameshift), which have been collectively reported in twelve probands in five publications (PMID: 12118255, PMID: 23847139, PMID: 33169370, PMID: 19797195, PMID: 27032803). All of the probands scored in this curation harbored biallelic *BBS1* variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of BBS1 function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Only one relatively small family was found in the literature with at least three affected members (PMID: 33169370), and segregation evidence did not contribute to the scoring of this curation.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that *BBS1* encodes a component of the BBSome, a protein complex that functions in ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport (PMID: 22072986). BBS1 co-immunoprecipitates with BBS4 (PMID: 17574030), and the genes encoding other BBSome components have similarly been asserted in connection with various monogenic forms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including *BBS2* (PMID: 11285252), *ARL6* (PMID: 15258860), *BBS4* (PMID: 11381270), *BBS5* (PMID: 15137946), *MKKS* (PMID: 10973238, PMID: 10973251), *BBS7* (PMID: 12567324), and *TTC8* (PMID: 14520415). *Chlamydomonas* with partial deletion of *BBS1* are unable to perform light-responsive movement (PMID: 20038682), while *Zbbs1* knockdown in zebrafish disrupts ciliary beat frequency and triggers cyst formation in the pronephritic kidney (PMID: 24069149). Biallelic disruption of *Bbs1* in mice has been studied in ciliated tissues of the brain, where it causes cilia to aberrantly accumulate or exclude various G-protein-coupled receptors (PMID: 36699005). Homozygous knock-in of a missense variant from human patients into mouse *Bbs1* recapitulates both retinal and syndromic features from the human disease state, including abnormal dark-adapted electroretinogram, photoreceptor layer loss on optical coherence tomography, obesity, and male reproductive abnormalities (PMID: 18032602).\n\nIn summary, *BBS1* is definitively associated with BBS1-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ee6e7562-927a-459b-a0f1-ccd849c7e783"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
