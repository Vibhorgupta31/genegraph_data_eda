Here, we demonstrate that the classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ) proteins Ku80 and Ku70, as well as HELLS, coimmunoprecipitated with CDCA7. The coimmunoprecipitation of the repair proteins was sensitive to nuclease treatment and an ICF3 mutation in CDCA7 that impairs its chromatin binding. The functional importance of these interactions was strongly suggested by the compromised C-NHEJ activity and significant delay in Ku80 accumulation at DNA damage sites in CDCA7- and HELLS-deficient HEK293 cells. Consistent with the repair defect, these cells displayed increased apoptosis, abnormal chromosome segregation, aneuploidy, centrosome amplification, and significant accumulation of γH2AX signals. Although less prominent, cells with mutations in the other ICF genes DNMT3B and ZBTB24 (responsible for ICF types 1 and 2, respectively) showed similar defects. Importantly, lymphoblastoid cells from ICF patients shared the same changes detected in the mutant HEK293 cells to varying degrees. Although the C-NHEJ defect alone did not cause CG hypomethylation, CDCA7 and HELLS are involved in maintaining CG methylation at centromeric and pericentromeric repeats. The defect in C-NHEJ may account for some common features of ICF cells, including centromeric instability, abnormal chromosome segregation, and apoptosis.","dc:creator":"Unoki M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"CDCA7 and HELLS mutations undermine nonhomologous end joining in centromeric instability syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Interaction with HELLS in HEK-293 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4ea9b813-32d9-4c74-9d86-307287922399","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b1332744-e415-47f7-bbfc-a56e946add73","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"association with chromatin and nucleosome remodeling is required for DNA methylation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29339483","rdfs:label":"CDCA7e Is Required HELLS Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:357faf0e-a1db-4240-8268-bc9925a2c0ef_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:49e183b6-49ae-4446-baf5-5e3c5ee79d9f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08876767-251d-436e-94d3-7dd3db91f70c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"While wild-type MBP–CDCA7e supported chromatin recruitment of HELLS in egg extracts depleted of endogenous CDCA7e, MBP–CDCA7e–R232C/H failed to associate with chromatin (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6C), and to recruit HELLS.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29339483","rdfs:label":"Patient ICF Mutations Fail to Recruit HELLS to Chromatin"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:777347a3-191b-4251-9b63-6628fe9834fd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0aafb24b-218c-4292-9edf-6b5e27f62afc","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mutant cells had poor proliferation, abnormal chromosome segregation, increased apoptotic and aneuploid cells, and accumulation of γH2AX.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307408","rdfs:label":"HEK293 cell functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:be46c307-09f5-4094-9bb5-a12de488ade5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e753ee9e-985a-45b8-8c16-710d1fac51e5","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Transient depletion of CDCA7 resulted in decreased CpG methylation at centromeric repeats in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26216346","rdfs:label":"CpG methylation in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1bb1d17e-7237-4970-803a-31f425449b1c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b687955-9404-4e17-bbee-e67a85af074e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mutant cells proliferated poorly and frequently died, showed γH2AX accumulation, and showed imparied C-NHEJ activity","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307408","rdfs:label":"lymphoblastoid cells from ICF patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:357faf0e-a1db-4240-8268-bc9925a2c0ef_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02b98fc6-2637-4ed2-9e88-eeb7e46eda13","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d5ab7fc2-133f-42e1-a984-a4c110489a81","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This study found: \n- expression of Cdca7 is restricted to the hematopoietic clusters of the aorta during embryonic hematopoietic development\n- Cdca7 is strongly up-regulated in the hemogenic population during human embryonic stem cell hematopoietic differentiation in a Notch dependent manner. \n- Down-regulation of Cdca7 mRNA in cultured AGM cells significantly\ninduces hematopoietic differentiation and loss of the progenitor population. \n- CDCA7 contributes to HSC emergence in vivo during embryonic development.\n\nHowever I don't think this contributes to the strength of the association with CDCA7 and ICF3.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25385755","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specification occurs in the embryonic aorta and requires Notch activation; however, most of the Notch-regulated elements controlling de novo HSC generation are still unknown. Here, we identify putative direct Notch targets in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) embryonic tissue by chromatin precipitation using antibodies against the Notch partner RBPj. By ChIP-on-chip analysis of the precipitated DNA, we identified 701 promoter regions that were candidates to be regulated by Notch in the AGM. One of the most enriched regions corresponded to the Cdca7 gene, which was subsequently confirmed to recruit the RBPj factor but also Notch1 in AGM cells. We found that during embryonic hematopoietic development, expression of Cdca7 is restricted to the hematopoietic clusters of the aorta, and it is strongly up-regulated in the hemogenic population during human embryonic stem cell hematopoietic differentiation in a Notch-dependent manner. Down-regulation of Cdca7 mRNA in cultured AGM cells significantly induces hematopoietic differentiation and loss of the progenitor population.

This gene-disease association is also supported by protein interactions, biochemical function, functional alteration in patient and non-patient cells, and  non-human model organism (PMID: 29339483, 30307408, 26216346, 25385755). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:357faf0e-a1db-4240-8268-bc9925a2c0ef"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
