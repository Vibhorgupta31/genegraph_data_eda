All these LZT sequences contain similarities to ZIP transporters, including the consensus sequence in transmembrane domain IV, which is essential for zinc transport. However, the new LZT subfamily can be separated from other ZIP transporters by the presence of a highly conserved potential metalloprotease motif (HEXPHEXGD) in transmembrane domain V. Here we report the location of HKE4 on intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum, and its ability to increase the intracellular free zinc as measured with the zinc-specific fluorescent dye, Newport Green, in a time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent manner. This is in contrast with the zinc influx ability of another LZT protein, LIV-1, which was due to its plasma membrane location. Therefore we have added to the functionality of LZT proteins by reporting their ability to increase intracellular-free zinc, whether they are located on the plasma membrane or on intracellular membranes. This result, in combination with the crucial role that zinc plays in cell growth, emphasizes the importance of this new LZT subfamily, including the KE4 sequences, in the control of intracellular zinc homoeostasis, aberrations of which can lead to diseases such as cancer, immunological disorders and neurological dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Taylor KM","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Structure-function analysis of HKE4, a member of the new LIV-1 subfamily of zinc transporters."},"rdfs:label":"Zinc transporter"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"CHO cells expressing recombinant ZIP7 were investigated for the ability to alter the intracellular free zinc content compared with control cells, as measured with the zinc-specific fluorescent dye, Newport Green.

Hypomorphic mutations in the SLC39A7 gene, encoding ZIP7, cause a human immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by an absence of circulating B cells, agammaglobulinemia and early-onset infections. Seven missense variants have been reported in five probands, and one additional family member, in one publication (PMID: 30718914). This gene-disease association is supported by its function as a zinc transporter (PMID: 14525538) that contributes to proper signal transduction through the (pre-)BCR for the transition from pre-B cell to immature B cell. Functional alteration is found in patient cells in which constitutive phosphatase activity was indeed higher (PMID: 30718914).  Additionally, there is a knock-in mouse model that recapitulates disease (PMID: 30718914). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:69ebdc60-2bdd-4020-9d20-7c0ea0fd3cdd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
