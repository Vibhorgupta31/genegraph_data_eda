However, pathogenic variants in some of these genes can lead to clinical manifestations which overlap with other neuromuscular diseases, which can be caused by pathogenic variants in non-mitochondrial genes as well. Mitochondrial pathogenic variants can be found in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or in any of the 1,500 nuclear genes with a mitochondrial function. We have performed a two-step next-generation sequencing approach in a cohort of 117 patients, mostly children, in whom a mitochondrial disease-cause could likely or possibly explain the phenotype. A total of 86 patients had a mitochondrial disorder, according to established clinical and biochemical criteria. The other 31 patients had neuromuscular symptoms, where in a minority a mitochondrial genetic cause is present, but a non-mitochondrial genetic cause is more likely. All patients were screened for pathogenic variants in the mtDNA and, if excluded, analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). Variants were filtered for being pathogenic and compatible with an autosomal or X-linked recessive mode of inheritance in families with multiple affected siblings and/or consanguineous parents. Non-consanguineous families with a single patient were additionally screened for autosomal and X-linked dominant mutations in a predefined gene-set. We identified causative pathogenic variants in the mtDNA in 20% of the patient-cohort, and in nuclear genes in 49%, implying an overall yield of 68%. We identified pathogenic variants in mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial genes in both groups with, obviously, a higher number of mitochondrial genes affected in mitochondrial disease patients. Furthermore, we show that 31% of the disease-causing genes in the mitochondrial patient group were not included in the MitoCarta database, and therefore would have been missed with MitoCarta based gene-panels. We conclude that WES is preferable to panel-based approaches for both groups of patients, as the mitochondrial gene-list is not complete and mitochondrial symptoms can be secondary. Also, clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders would require sequential use of multiple different gene panels. We conclude that WES is a comprehensive and unbiased approach to establish a genetic diagnosis in these patients, able to resolve multi-genic disease-causes.","dc:creator":"Theunissen TEJ","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Whole Exome Sequencing Is the Preferred Strategy to Identify the Genetic Defect in Patients With a Probable or Possible Mitochondrial Cause."}},"rdfs:label":"Group 2, Consanguineous family, ADD3 proband"},{"id":"cggv:02cd473e-e45e-404c-972e-6073d273d3ee","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02cd473e-e45e-404c-972e-6073d273d3ee_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:02cd473e-e45e-404c-972e-6073d273d3ee_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Kruer et al.

One of the challenges hereby is to dissect the contribution of each gene mutation, for which animal models such as Drosophila can provide a valuable aid. Here, we identified three families with mutations in ADD3, encoding for adducin-Î³, with intellectual disability, microcephaly, cataracts and skeletal defects. In one of the families with additional cardiomyopathy and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), we found a homozygous variant in KAT2B, encoding the lysine acetyltransferase 2B, with impact on KAT2B protein levels in patient fibroblasts, suggesting that this second mutation might contribute to the increased disease spectrum. In order to define the contribution of ADD3 and KAT2B mutations for the patient phenotype, we performed functional experiments in the Drosophila model. We found that both mutations were unable to fully rescue the viability of the respective null mutants of the Drosophila homologs, hts and Gcn5, suggesting that they are indeed pathogenic in flies. While the KAT2B/Gcn5 mutation additionally showed a significantly reduced ability to rescue morphological and functional defects of cardiomyocytes and nephrocytes (podocyte-like cells), this was not the case for the ADD3 mutant rescue. Yet, the simultaneous knockdown of KAT2B and ADD3 synergistically impaired kidney and heart function in flies as well as the adhesion and migration capacity of cultured human podocytes, indicating that mutations in both genes may be required for the full clinical manifestation. Altogether, our studies describe the expansion of the phenotypic spectrum in ADD3 deficiency associated with a homozygous likely pathogenic KAT2B variant and thereby identify KAT2B as a susceptibility gene for kidney and heart disease in ADD3-associated disorders.","dc:creator":"GonÃ§alves S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"A homozygous KAT2B variant modulates the clinical phenotype of ADD3 deficiency in humans and flies."}},{"id":"cggv:051c45f4-e4c6-442b-8bc2-b82343fb34b9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a5e843a9-1630-4133-9d2f-360ea323e531"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768408"}],"rdfs:label":"Sibling II-4"},{"id":"cggv:9faee8cf-f2ee-488e-a943-3143aed9e3ff","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9faee8cf-f2ee-488e-a943-3143aed9e3ff_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The proband is heterozygous for the ADD3 autosomal recessive variant c.995A>6 which is a recurrent variant"},{"id":"cggv:051c45f4-e4c6-442b-8bc2-b82343fb34b9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:051c45f4-e4c6-442b-8bc2-b82343fb34b9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The proband is heterozygous for the ADD3 autosomal recessive variant c.995A>6 which is a recurrent variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:77ea4efc-7119-41e4-990a-5a51dbdaa96a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:77ea4efc-7119-41e4-990a-5a51dbdaa96a","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6c130528-3d9b-4320-a9ec-2b13e571bb78","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016824.5(ADD3):c.995A>G (p.Asn332Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5686514"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"\"Suspected\" Cerebral palsy\nMicrocephaly\nIntellectual disability\nEpilepsy\nFacial dysmorphism\nShort stature\n","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Karyotype, CGH array, and muscle biopsy were normal","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:aa9b9ad8-de2d-44a5-9cb5-2c982a5af18e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6c130528-3d9b-4320-a9ec-2b13e571bb78"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768408"},"rdfs:label":"Sibling II-1"},{"id":"cggv:aa9b9ad8-de2d-44a5-9cb5-2c982a5af18e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa9b9ad8-de2d-44a5-9cb5-2c982a5af18e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"p.
