Here, we used whole-exome sequencing and characterized the molecular defects in 4 patients from 3 unrelated families diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections. We identified 2 different heterozygous splice site mutations that affect the same splice site in PIK3R1, which encodes the p85α subunit of PI3K. The resulting deletion of exon 10 produced a shortened p85α protein that lacks part of the PI3K p110-binding domain. The hypothetical loss of p85α-mediated inhibition of p110 activity was supported by elevated phosphorylation of the known downstream signaling kinase AKT in patient T cell blasts. Analysis of patient blood revealed that naive T and memory B cell counts were low, and T cell blasts displayed enhanced activation-induced cell death, which was corrected by addition of the PI3Kδ inhibitor IC87114. Furthermore, B lymphocytes proliferated weakly in response to activation via the B cell receptor and TLR9, indicating a B cell defect. The phenotype exhibited by patients carrying the PIK3R1 splice site mutation is similar to that of patients carrying gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CD. Our results suggest that PI3K activity is tightly regulated in T and B lymphocytes and that various defects in the PI3K-triggered pathway can cause primary immunodeficiencies.

Remarkably, four unrelated patients were found by next generation sequencing to have the same heterozygous mutation in an essential donor splice site of PIK3R1 (NM_181523.2:c.1425 + 1G > A) found in three prior reports. All four had the Hyper IgM syndrome, lymphadenopathy and short stature, and one also had SHORT syndrome. They were investigated with in vitro immune studies, RT-PCR, and immunoblotting studies of the mutation's effect on mTOR pathway signaling. All patients had very low percentages of memory B cells and class-switched memory B cells and reduced numbers of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of both an abnormal 273 base-pair (bp) size and a normal 399 bp size band in the patient and only the normal band was present in the parents. Following anti-CD40 stimulation, patient's EBV-B cells displayed higher levels of S6 phosphorylation (mTOR complex 1 dependent event), Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (mTOR complex 2 dependent event), and Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 (PI3K/PDK1 dependent event) than controls, suggesting elevated mTOR signaling downstream of CD40. These observations suggest that amino acids 435-474 in PIK3R1 are important for its stability and also its ability to restrain PI3K activity. Deletion of Exon 11 leads to constitutive activation of PI3K signaling.

Also known as activated PI3K-δ syndrome 2 (APDS2), immunodeficieny 36 is a primary immunodeficiency with a highly heterogeneous clinical phenotype. This disease is characterized primarily by recurrent respiratory tract infections, lymphoproliferation, and antibody deficiency. Other features include growth retardation, mild neurodevelopmental delay, and autoimmunity. The major complication is development of B-cell lymphoma (Elkaim et al., 2016). It is important to note that the clinical phenotype of activated PIK3CD delta syndrome (immunodificency 14) can be clinically indistinguishable from patients with PIK3R1 mutations (APDS2). At least 7 unique PIK3R1 variants (splice donor and splice acceptor) have been reported in humans with APDS2. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nPIK3R1 has been associated with the following disease entities: autosomal recessive Agammaglobulinemia 7, autosomal dominant Immunodeficiency 36, and autosomal dominant SHORT syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been Split into multiple disease entities, Agammaglobulinemia 7 (OMIM: 615214), Immunodeficiency 36 (OMIM: 616005), and SHORT syndrome (OMIM: 269880). The split curation for Agammaglobulinemia 7 (OMIM: 615214) and SHORT syndrome (OMIM: 269880) have been curated separately. \n\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 28 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in at least 5 publications (PMID:5133428, PMID: 25488983, PMID: 25939554, PMID: 27076228, PMID: 27221134). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE: This gene-disease association is supported by functional alteration and biochemical studies in patient cells (PMID: 25133428, PMID:25488983,  PMID:29675019). Lucas et al. (2014) found that heterozygous PIK3R1 mutations promote pathological, constitutive hyperactivation of PI3K and AKT, which leads to activation of the mTORC1 complex and phosphoinhibition of GSK3α/β and FOXO1/3. Lucas et al. (2014) also noted that PIK3R1 mutations drive PI3K signaling and expected to see similar cellular derangements as previously observed in PASLI patients with gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CD. Their studies showed PIK3R1-driven disease, as in p110δ PASLI disease, hyperactive PI3K signaling in lymphocytes causing expansion, terminal differentiation, and senescence of CD8 T cells. Deau et al. (2014) confirmed that a shortened protein, p85αΔ434_475, in patient cells was responsible for the hyperactivation of AKT by ectopically expressing mutant and WT form of p85α in NIH3T3 cells. Authors found elevated levels of phosphorylated AKT in the cells expressing p85αΔ434_475 in comparison to controls. These results strongly suggest that the PIK3R1 splice site mutation is a disease-causing mutation that increases PI3K signaling.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PIK3R1 and autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 36. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Deficiencies GCEP on the meeting date May 18, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:40c5f722-d25e-46b1-8a52-c407d1c64e63"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
