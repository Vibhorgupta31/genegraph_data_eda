About 30% of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cases are familial. Mutations are mostly found in the genes encoding lamin A/C, beta-myosin heavy chain and the sarcomeric protein cardiac troponin-T (TNNT2). Mutations in TNNT2 are reported in approximately 3% of DCM patients. The overall phenotype caused by TNNT2 mutations is thought to be a fully penetrant, severe disease. This also seems to be true for a recurrent deletion in the TNNT2 gene; p.K217del (also known as p.K210del). Methods. We compared the phenotype of all Dutch patients identified as carrying the TNNT2 p.K217del mutation with those described in the literature. All index patients underwent cardiological evaluation. Family screening was done in all described families. Results. Six DCM patients carrying the TNNT2 p.K217del mutation were identified from four Dutch families. Mean age of disease manifestation was 33 years. Heart transplantation was required in three of them at ages 12, 18 and 19 years. These outcomes are comparable with those described in the literature. Conclusion. Carriers of the TNNT2 p.K217del mutation in our Dutch families, as well as in families described in the literature before, generally show a severe, early-onset form of DCM.

cardiac troponin T are responsible for 15% of all cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of sudden death in young athletes. Mutant proteins are thought to act through a dominant-negative mode that impairs function of heart muscle. TNNT2 mutations can also lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, a leading cause of heart failure. Despite the importance of cardiac troponin T in human disease, its loss-of-function phenotype has not been described. We show that the zebrafish silent heart (sih) mutation affects the gene tnnt2. We characterize two mutated alleles of sih that severely reduce tnnt2 expression: one affects mRNA splicing, and the other affects gene transcription. Tnnt2, together with alpha-tropomyosin (Tpma) and cardiac troponins C and I (Tnni3), forms a calcium-sensitive regulatory complex within sarcomeres. Unexpectedly, in addition to loss of Tnnt2 expression in sih mutant hearts, we observed a significant reduction in Tpma and Tnni3, and consequently, severe sarcomere defects. This interdependence of thin-filament protein expression led us to postulate that some mutations in tnnt2 may trigger misregulation of thin-filament protein expression, resulting in sarcomere loss and myocyte disarray, the life-threatening hallmarks of TNNT2 mutations in mice and humans.","dc:creator":"Sehnert AJ","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Cardiac troponin T is essential in sarcomere assembly and cardiac contractility."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in Zebrafish Hearts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:40c2f3ba-67e3-4536-9026-cc5e993595c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe9dfde9-86c5-47ef-8f6c-ef1a8063507d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Cloned cDNA for TNNT2 from the adult heart and used this to confirm presence of TNNT2 in the human fetal heart","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8088824","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The troponin complex is located on the thin filament of striated muscle and is composed of three component polypeptides: troponin T, troponin I, and troponin C.

In vitro functional assays show that, in general, the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy mutations decreases the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contractility, whereas HCM mutations increase it. To assess whether this functional phenomenon was a direct result of altered Ca(2+) affinity or was caused by altered troponin-tropomyosin switching, we assessed Ca(2+) binding of the regulatory site of cardiac troponin C in wild-type or mutant troponin complex and thin filaments using a fluorescent probe (2-[4'-{iodoacetamido}aniline]-naphthalene-6-sulfonate) attached to Cys35 of cardiac troponin C. The Ca(2+)-binding affinity (pCa(50)=6.57+/-0.03) of reconstituted troponin complex was unaffected by all of the HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy troponin mutants tested, with the exception of the troponin I Arg145Gly HCM mutation, which caused an increase (DeltapCa(50)=+0.31+/-0.05). However, when incorporated into regulated thin filaments, all but 1 of the 10 troponin and alpha-tropomyosin mutants altered Ca(2+)-binding affinity. Both HCM mutations increased Ca(2+) affinity (DeltapCa(50)=+0.41+/-0.02 and +0.51+/-0.01), whereas the dilated cardiomyopathy mutations decreased affinity (DeltapCa(50)=-0.12+/-0.04 to -0.54+/-0.04), which correlates with our previous functional in vitro assays. The exception was the troponin T Asp270Asn mutant, which caused a significant decrease in cooperativity. Because troponin is the major Ca(2+) buffer in the cardiomyocyte sarcoplasm, we suggest that Ca(2+) affinity changes caused by cardiomyopathy mutant proteins may directly affect the Ca(2+) transient and hence Ca(2+)-sensitive disease state remodeling pathways in vivo. This represents a novel mechanism for this class of mutation.","dc:creator":"Robinson P","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in troponin and alpha-tropomyosin have opposing effects on the calcium affinity of cardiac thin filaments."},"rdfs:label":"Calcium binding affinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:20fbdfad-b2d2-45f1-9658-e2e3e02cb413_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de6d17ac-7a7f-4c79-a2c4-b8740d713627","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e4aefe4-e7e8-48b1-bf76-ed47b2e493cd","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Rescued zebrafish showed heart muscle contraction","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11967535","rdfs:label":"SIH Zebrafish Rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Phenotype rescued was not a perfect correlation to DCM as the fish had not developed cardiomegaly."},{"id":"cggv:6ce085b9-de71-41b4-9eb1-36afc9dd0336","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3a8146a-2217-46f5-bb8f-8984b012c620","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Zebrafish have no contraction of cardiac muscle and subsequently develop heart failure.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11967535","rdfs:label":"Silent Hearts in Zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Zebrafish did not develop cardiomegaly, just no muscle contraction."},{"id":"cggv:8866285d-34fe-483c-961a-733be1f00b55","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2192f2e-9cad-4dff-9ecc-7a73e0b6ad85","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mutant mice developed cardiomegaly, reduced cardiac function, and sudden cardiac death in a dose dependent manner.

Membrane-permeabilized cardiac muscle fibers from mutant mice showed significantly lower Ca(2+) sensitivity in force generation than those from wild-type mice. Peak amplitude of Ca(2+) transient in cardiomyocytes was increased in mutant mice, and maximum isometric force produced by intact cardiac muscle fibers of mutant mice was not significantly different from that of wild-type mice, suggesting that Ca(2+) transient was augmented to compensate for decreased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. Nevertheless, mutant mice developed marked cardiac enlargement, heart failure, and frequent sudden death recapitulating the phenotypes of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, indicating that global functional defect of the heart attributable to decreased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity could not be fully compensated by only increasing the intracellular Ca(2+) transient. We found that a positive inotropic agent, pimobendan, which directly increases myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, had profound effects of preventing cardiac enlargement, heart failure, and sudden death. These results verify the hypothesis that Ca(2+) desensitization of cardiac myofilament is the absolute cause of the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy associated with this mutation and strongly suggest that Ca(2+) sensitizers are beneficial for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy patients affected by sarcomeric regulatory protein mutations.","dc:creator":"Du CK","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Knock-in mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by troponin mutation."},"rdfs:label":"Knock-In p.Lys210del Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1339,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c1e44242-d951-4b80-886f-0f435779311b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:11949","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"TNNT2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2000 (Kamisago et al., 2000, PMID 11106718) Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data. At least 10 variants (including missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans with DCM. Of note, the variant p.Lys210del has been reported in multiple unrelated families and been reported in at least one de novo case (Otten et al., 2002, PMID 20978592; Hershberger et al., 2009, PMID 20031601; Morgensen et al., 2004, PMID 15542288). It is considered a recurrent pathogenic variant. In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. Towsend et al., first showed TNNT2 is expressed in the heart in 1994 (Towsend et al., 1994, PMID 8088824). Animal models include mouse models expressing the variant p.Lys210del which developed DCM and sudden cardiac death (Du et al., 2007, PMID 17556660). Additional evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence has been reached. In summary, TNNT2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on August 13, 2020.
