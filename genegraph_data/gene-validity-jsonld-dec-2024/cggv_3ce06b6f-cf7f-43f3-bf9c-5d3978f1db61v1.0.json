A restricted T-cell repertoire caused by defective thymic T-cell development and selection, lymphopenia with homeostatic proliferation, and lack of regulatory T cells are considered key factors in OS pathogenesis. We report 2 siblings presenting with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Pneumocystis jirovecii infections and recurrent sepsis; one developed all clinical features of OS. Both carried homozygous germline mutations in CARD11 (p.Cys150*), impairing NF-κB signaling and IL-2 production. A somatic second-site mutation reverting the stop codon to a missense mutation (p.Cys150Leu) was detected in tissue-infiltrating T cells of the OS patient. Expression of p.Cys150Leu in CARD11-deficient T cells largely reconstituted NF-κB signaling. The reversion likely occurred in a prethymic T-cell precursor, leading to a chimeric T-cell repertoire. We speculate that in our patient the functional advantage of the revertant T cells in the context of persistent CMV infection, combined with lack of regulatory T cells, may have been sufficient to favor OS. This first observation of OS in a patient with a T-cell activation defect suggests that severely defective T-cell development or homeostatic proliferation in a lymphopenic environment are not required for this severe immunopathology.

Recent studies suggest that CARMA1 regulates regulatory T cell (Treg) development, although the role of NF-kappaB in this event is incompletely understood. We show that CYLD deficiency causes constitutive NF-kappaB activation in thymocytes, which is associated with enhanced frequency of Treg cells. The NF-kappaB activation in CYLD-deficient thymocytes is independent of CARMA1, because the NF-kappaB activation was also detected in CYLD/CARMA1 double knock-out thymocytes. Interestingly, although loss of CYLD causes NF-kappaB activation in the CARMA1-deficient thymocytes, the CYLD deficiency fails to rescue the defect of CARMA1 knock-out mice in Treg development. Furthermore, inhibition of canonical NF-kappaB by an IkappaBalpha transgene only partially inhibits Treg development. We demonstrate that CARMA1 regulates IL-2 receptor signaling and controls the IL-2-stimulated maturation of Treg precursors to mature Tregs. These results suggest that the role of CARMA1 in Treg regulation involves both NF-kappaB activation and IL-2 receptor signaling.","dc:creator":"Lee AJ","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"CARMA1 regulation of regulatory T cell development involves modulation of interleukin-2 receptor signaling."},"rdfs:label":"CARD11-/- Tregs and NFkB"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded to 1 point from 2 points because this study assessed and described phenotypic features reported in patients with CARD11 deficiency, but only a small subset of these features.

This disease is characterized by infant-onset increased susceptibility to infection with diminished specific T- and B-cell populations (despite normal-sized total T- and B-cell populations) and activity, as well as hypogammaglobulinemia. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability for the diseases associated with CARD11. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 11A (i.e., severe combined immunodeficiency due to CARD11 deficiency; OMIM: 615206), autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 11B with atopic dermatitis (OMIM: 617638), and autosomal dominant B-cell expansion with NFkB and T-cell anergy (BENTA; OMIM: 616452). The split curations for immunodeficiency 11B with atopic dermatitis and BENTA have been curated separately. Four variants (three nonsense and one large intragenic deletion) that have been reported as homozygous in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 23374270, 23561803, 26289640, 32815076) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays in cell lines and patient cells (PMIDs: 12356734, 12818158, 20233721, 23374270, 23561803, 26289640). Expression studies indicate CARD11 is highly and specifically expressed in the spleen, blood, and immune cells (PMID: 12818158) and functional studies in a cell line indicate a role for CARD11 in positive regulation of NFkB (PMID: 12356734). Furthermore, mouse models deficient in CARD11 recapitulated aspects of patient disease, particularly defects in lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and function and hypogammaglobulinemia (PMID: 12818158, 20233721). Immune cells isolated from patients carrying CARD11 variants displayed defects in activation, proliferation, cytokine production, and NFkB activity (PMID: 23374270, 23561803, 26289640). In summary, CARD11 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 11A. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3ce06b6f-cf7f-43f3-bf9c-5d3978f1db61"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
