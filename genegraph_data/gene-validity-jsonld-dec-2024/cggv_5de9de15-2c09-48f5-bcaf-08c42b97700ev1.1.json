The PCD phenotype results from structural and/or functional abnormalities of motile cilia and flagella. Ciliary motility is powered by a set of axoneme-specific dynein motor complexes. The cytoplasmic assembly of these large multiprotein complexes before their transport into cilia is assisted by dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs). Mutations in genes encoding DNAAFs result in the improper cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein chains, causing defects in both inner (IDA) and outer dynein arms (ODA) that can result in cilia immotility (PMID: 31624012).\n \nIn 2017 Paff et al. and Olcese et al. (PMIDs: 28041644, 28176794) described an X-linked non-syndromic PCD caused by mutations in *DNAAF6* (*PIH1D3*) in 12 families. Affected individuals in these families shared a classic PCD phenotype with ciliary and sperm immotility. At the ultrastructural level this PCD was characterized by an absence of ODAs and reduced to absent IDAs. The specific disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 36 is an X-linked primarily recessive disorder (with variable and milder female expression, PMID: 38408845) caused by hemizygous mutation in the *DNAAF6*  gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and X-linked recessive mode of inheritance to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *DNAAF6* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 36 (MONDO: 0010517, OMIM # 300991).\n\nEvidence from 14 probands in 7 publications have been included in this curation representing 12 unique variants (2 missense, 4 nonsense, 3 frameshift, 1 splicing, and 2 small deletions (PMIDs: 28041644, 28176794, 32170493, 38051289, 33106461, 38408845, 33635866). Three probands with large multi-gene deletions that include *DNAAF6* were described but not scored (PMID: 28176794). The mechanism of pathogenicity in *DNAAF6* mutations is X-linked loss of function. While most of the reported PCD patients carrying loss of function *DNAAF6* mutations are male, a more recent study has shown that mothers of male patients with *DNAAF6*-related PCD can display PCD airway phenotypes, the severity of which is dependent on their X-inactivation ratio (PMID: 38408845).\n\nThe gene-disease association between *DNAAF6* and PCD 36 is supported by gene expression data.  GTEx RNA-seq expression studies in reference human tissues show strong expression of *DNAAF6* in lung, testis, and Fallopian tube (PMID: 23715323). This pattern is consistent with the role that DNAAF6 is thought to play in the assembly of inner and outer dynein arms in respiratory cilia, sperm flagella, cilia in male efferent ducts, and cilia in Fallopian tubes (PMID: 32943623). \n \nThe cytoplasmic folding and preassembly of dynein arm proteins into larger complexes takes place in a stepwise manner involving interactions with various DNAAFs (PMID: 32943623), chaperones, and co-chaperones (PMID: 31817850). Yeast two-hybrid screens as well as co-immunoprecipitation assays from human cell culture extracts overexpressing DNAAF6 confirm the interaction of DNAAF6 with DNAAF2 and DNAAF4 (PMID: 28041644), proteins that have also been associated with PCD. DNAAF2, DNAAF4, and DNAAF6 interact as parts of cytoplasmic multi-protein complexes that assemble inner and outer dynein arm components.\n\nLoss-of-function hemizygous *DNAAF6* mutations result in structural defects in respiratory cilia of PCD patients. Transmission Electron Microscopy studies show an absence of inner and outer dynein arms in patient respiratory epithelial cells. Immunofluorescent studies of these cells show an absence or reduction in some of the dynein arm structural proteins (Heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9 and intermediate chains DNAI1 and DNAI2 from ODAs and DNALI1 from IDAs) suggesting a defect in the assembly of the dynein arms. Similar results are seen in immunofluorescent studies of patient sperm flagella where DNAI1 and DNAI2 are absent from patient flagellar axonemes (PMID: 28041644). In another study, electron tomography was used to capture different patterns of IDA assembly in the respiratory cells of *DNAAF6*/PCD patients (PMID: 28176794). These analyses show that *DNAAF6* mutations cause a failure of specific dynein components to assemble into IDAs. These data are consistent with DNAAF6 assisting in the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dyneins.\n\nThree non-human experimental models have been used to support the gene-disease relationship between *DNAAF6* and PCD 36. In *Drosophila*, ciliary motility is confined to the sensory cilium of mechanosensory neurons (chordotonal neurons) and the sperm flagellum. Flies with Dnaaf6 knockout or knockdown were viable but deaf, uncoordinated and had immotile sperm, signs consistent with ciliary defects. Authors also performed immunofluorescent studies of differentiating chordotonal neurons in pupal antennae. These studies show loss of ODA markers (Dnah5 and Dnal1) and partial loss of IDA markers (Dnali1) as further evidence that Dnaaf6 is required for assembly of dynein arms (PMID: 35873488). PIH1D3-knockout rats re-capitulate most of the phenotypes seen in human patients with *DNAAF6* related PCD. These phenotypes include male infertility due to defects in the assembly of sperm axonemes and cilia in the efferent ducts. PIH1D3 deficient rats also had accumulation of mucus in the upper respiratory tract (primarily nasal cavity), situs inversus, and perinatal hydrocephalus (PMID: 35873488). Similarities between this rat model and human patients extend to molecular phenotypes such as the loss of inner and outer dynein arms in respiratory cells and dysfunctional preassembly and loading of dynein arms in motile cilia. Zebrafish embryos carrying a homozygous *pih1d3* mutation have immotile cilia, leading to abnormal cardiac looping, a deficiency in pronephric fluid flow, the development of pronephric cysts, and abnormal otolith formation. Zebrafish mutants are missing ODAs and IDAs. These phenotypes are consistent with a role for pih1d3 in the preassembly of dynein arms in zebrafish. These phenotypes can be rescued with wild-type zebrafish *pih1d3* and partially rescued with human *PIH1D3* mRNA.\n\n In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in *DNAAF6* and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 36. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on April 11, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5de9de15-2c09-48f5-bcaf-08c42b97700e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
