Paraplegin assembles with homologous Afg3l2 subunits into hetero-oligomeric complexes which can substitute for yeast m-AAA proteases, demonstrating functional conservation. The function of a third paralogue, Afg3l1 expressed in mouse, is unknown. Here, we analyze the assembly of paraplegin into m-AAA complexes and monitor consequences of paraplegin deficiency in HSP fibroblasts and in a mouse model for HSP. Our findings reveal variability in the assembly of m-AAA proteases in mitochondria in different tissues. Homo-oligomeric Afg3l1 and Afg3l2 complexes and hetero-oligomeric assemblies of both proteins with paraplegin can be formed. Yeast complementation studies demonstrate the proteolytic activity of these assemblies. Paraplegin deficiency in HSP does not result in the loss of m-AAA protease activity in brain mitochondria. Rather, homo-oligomeric Afg3l2 complexes accumulate, and these complexes can substitute for housekeeping functions of paraplegin-containing m-AAA complexes.

The increased severity of the Afg3l2 mutants is explained by two main molecular features that differentiate AFG3L2 from paraplegin: its higher neuronal expression and its versatile ability to support both hetero-oligomerization and homo-oligomerization.

Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.1847G>A; p.Y616C) in AFG3L2, encoding a subunit of an m-AAA protease. m-AAA proteases reside in the mitochondrial inner membrane and are responsible for removal of damaged or misfolded proteins and proteolytic activation of essential mitochondrial proteins. AFG3L2 forms either a homo-oligomeric isoenzyme or a hetero-oligomeric complex with paraplegin, a homologous protein mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7 (SPG7). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in AFG3L2 cause autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28), a disorder whose phenotype is strikingly different from that of our patients. As defined in yeast complementation assays, the AFG3L2(Y616C) gene product is a hypomorphic variant that exhibited oligomerization defects in yeast as well as in patient fibroblasts. Specifically, the formation of AFG3L2(Y616C) complexes was impaired, both with itself and to a greater extent with paraplegin. This produced an early-onset clinical syndrome that combines the severe phenotypes of SPG7 and SCA28, in additional to other \"mitochondrial\" features such as oculomotor apraxia, extrapyramidal dysfunction, and myoclonic epilepsy. These findings expand the phenotype associated with AFG3L2 mutations and suggest that AFG3L2-related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spastic ataxias.","dc:creator":"Pierson TM","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing identifies homozygous AFG3L2 mutations in a spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome linked to mitochondrial m-AAA proteases."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Pierson_2011_Proband_IV-2"},{"id":"cggv:6cbf1a4f-62be-4213-95fa-895cdab42af6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6cbf1a4f-62be-4213-95fa-895cdab42af6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6cbf1a4f-62be-4213-95fa-895cdab42af6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NM_006796.3(AFG3L2):c.1847A>G (p.Tyr616Cys) is a missense variant with yeast complementation / rescue evidence of a disease-causing effect.

Subsequent reports have identified extraocular phenotypes in individuals diagnosed with optic atrophy, including hearing loss, progressive dystonia, and episodes of cerebellar ataxia, and have expanded the diversity of AFG3L2-related cases to include a diagnosis of optic atrophy with autosomal recessive inheritance (PMID: 32219868, PMID: 36974169). Families diagnosed with spastic ataxia 5 are characterized by cerebellar and neuromuscular features, ranging from cerebellar atrophy, myoclonic seizures, basal ganglia involvement, and progressive hearing loss to progressive spastic gait / gait ataxia, hyperkinetic movements, increased blood lactate, dystonia, dysarthria, dysmetria, and abnormalities of eye movement. These often occur in the presence of ocular features including optic atrophy, optic nerve pallor, progressive loss of central visual acuity, color vision defects, and retinal nerve fiber thinning. Abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology have also been identified, including fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (AFG3L2 loss of function) was found to be consistent among patients with optic atrophy 12 (MIM#: 618977) and spastic ataxia 5 (MIM#: 614487). The phenotypic variability between them appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities, with underlying mitochondrial network dysfunction as a shared feature. Therefore, cases caused by inherited loss-of-function variants in *AFG3L2* have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as AFG3L2-related optic atrophy and/or ataxia, with a semidominant mode of inheritance. Heterozygous missense variants in *AFG3L2*, particularly within the region encoding the protease domain, have also been linked to cases of spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (MIM#: 610246) as early as 2006 (PMID: 16251216). These patients can alternatively harbor heterozygous C-terminally truncating variants in *AFG3L2*, and the mechanism may be dominant negative (PMID: 24272953). Spinocerebellar ataxia 28 has neurodevelopmental features such as cerebellar atrophy, ataxia, dysarthria, hyperreflexia, and disordered eye movement, however, other features associated with *AFG3L2* loss-of-function such as optic atrophy and mitochondrial network fragmentation have not yet been reported in affected individuals. Therefore, AFG3L2-related cases of spinocerebellar ataxia 28 have been recommended for a split curation for a separate disease entity.\n\nThirteen suspected disease-causing variants were scored as part of this curation (three nonsense and ten missense), which have been collectively reported in eleven probands in three publications (PMID: 22022284, PMID: 32219868, PMID: 32248051). Six of the probands scored in this curation harbored only one variant allele within the *AFG3L2* locus, while the other five probands harbored biallelic *AFG3L2* variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic or biallelic loss of AFG3L2 function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Interestingly, some of the variants found in biallelic cases do not appear to cause disease in family members who harbor them in the heterozygous state (PMID: 32219868). Families with segregation evidence were not sufficiently large to contribute to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship (PMID: 32219868). The literature included more case-level evidence (PMID: 26539208, PMID: 29181157, PMID: 32600459), but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that *AFG3L2* encodes a subunit of an ATP-dependent metalloprotease complex (PMID: 17101804) that localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (PMID: 10395799) and regulates OPA1 processing. AFG3L2 physically interacts with paraplegin, another component of this complex encoded by the SPG7 gene, which is associated with spastic paraplegia cases that can include the optic atrophy phenotype (PMID: 35243150). *AFG3L2* expression is ubiquitous but especially high in muscle, heart, cornea, and retinal pigment epithelial tissues (PMID: 30239781). Deletion of the budding yeast ortholog of *AFG3L2* results in mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency (PMID: 7926051). Naturally occurring and genetically engineered mouse models of Afg3l2 loss exhibit reduced motor function in limbs, postural instability, limb dysmetria, and complete paralysis leading to early death, as well as reduced activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (PMID: 18337413).\n \nIn summary, *AFG3L2* is definitively associated with AFG3L2-related optic atrophy and/or ataxia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel and the ClinGen Mitochondrial Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 16th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:837efbf5-6fac-4b1c-9f72-59527b5dd6fd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
