Genetically, three distinct subtypes of ARCND (ARCND1, ARCND2, and ARCND3) have been identified. ARCND2 is linked to pathogenic variants in the PLCB4 gene (phospholipase C β4). PLCB4 is a key effector of the EDN1-EDNRA pathway involved in craniofacial development via the induction, migration, and maintenance of neural crest cells. ARCND2 is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with recessive inheritance pattern being rare. In this study, we report the first homozygous missense variant (NM_000933.4: c.2050G>A: p.(Gly684Arg)) in the PLCB4 gene causing ARCND in a 3-year-old patient with a severe clinical phenotype of the syndrome. The patient presented with typical craniofacial ARCND features, in addition to intestinal transit defect, macropenis, and hearing loss. These findings further delineate the phenotypic spectrum of ARCND associated with autosomal recessive PLCB4 loss of function variants.

Recently, phospholipase C, β 4 (PLCB4) mutations were identified as the major cause of autosomal dominant ACS, with mutations of the PLCB4 catalytic domain predicted to have a dominant negative effect. In addition, one ACS patient born to related parents harbored a homozygous partial deletion of PLCB4, and presented with ACS plus central apnea and macropenis; these features had not been previously reported in association with ACS. His parents, each with a heterozygous partial PLCB4 deletion, were phenotypically normal, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance of ACS, with complete loss of function of PLCB4 predicted in the patient. We herein describe two brothers with ACS caused by compound heterozygous splice site mutations in PLCB4. The patients were born to the same unrelated and healthy parents, with each parent harboring one of the mutations, indicating autosomal recessive ACS. Both patients reported here had mixed apneas, gastrointestinal transit defects and macropenis, in addition to typical craniofacial features of ACS.

One such syndrome is auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS), in which patients present with defects in ear and mandible development. Affected structures arise from cranial neural crest cells, a population of cells in the embryo that reside in the pharyngeal arches and give rise to most of the bone, cartilage and connective tissue of the face. Recent studies have found that most cases of ACS arise from defects in signaling molecules associated with the endothelin signaling pathway. Disruption of this signaling pathway in both mouse and zebrafish results in loss of identity of neural crest cells of the mandibular portion of the first pharyngeal arch and the subsequent repatterning of these cells, leading to homeosis of lower jaw structures into more maxillary-like structures. These findings illustrate the importance of endothelin signaling in normal human craniofacial development and illustrate how clinical and basic science approaches can coalesce to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of human birth defect syndromes. Further, understanding the genetic basis for ACS that lies outside of known endothelin signaling components may help elucidate unknown aspects critical to the establishment of neural crest cell patterning during facial morphogenesis.","dc:creator":"Clouthier DE","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Understanding the basis of auriculocondylar syndrome: Insights from human, mouse and zebrafish genetic studies."},"rdfs:label":"EDNRA signaling"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Shared function with other genes associated with the phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ddf3bbb2-762c-4a36-90d1-b53ea6585070_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f092a522-e4e9-4978-9525-c80b692c1894","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:809a1866-0859-492a-90ba-08611ed57334","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Multiple papers characterizing homozygous PLCB4 KO mice:\nPMID 8962098: Jiang et al.

EDNRA signaling plays a critical role in establishing the identity of neural crest cells that form the lower jaw and middle ear structures. \n\nThe PLCB4 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS) (MIM 620458) in 2013 (Gordon et al., PMID: 23315542). PLCB4 has also been associated with an autosomal dominant form of ACS (MIM 614669). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group, we found differences in inheritance pattern, phenotype, and molecular mechanism. Therefore, the relationships between PLCB4 and autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive ACS were curated separately. \n\nAutosomal recessive ACS shares the same craniofacial malformations (distinctive question mark outer ear deformity, temporomandibular joint ankylosis, full cheeks, micrognathia, and microstomia) as the dominant form, with additional extra-cranial features that commonly include swallowing problems, GERD, laryngomalacia, central sleep apnea, and genital hypertrophy. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unrelated patients from four publications (PMID: 23315542; Kido et al., 2013, PMID: 23913798; Leoni et al., 2016, PMID: 27007857; Vegas et al., 2022, PMID: 35170830). The variants reported in these individuals included a homozygous multi-exon deletion, compound heterozygous splice variants, and two unique homozygous frameshift variants, suggesting biallelic loss of function as the mechanism of disease. Heterozygous carriers of these variants were unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the gene’s biochemical function in EDNRA signaling that is shared with two other genes also associated with ACS (GNAI3 and EDN1) (Clouthier et al., 2014, PMID: 24123988). In addition, while craniofacial malformation has not been reported in knock-out mouse models, the knock-out mice do recapitulate other features that have been described in association with autosomal recessive ACS, including impaired visual processing, movement disorders, and sleep disruption (Jiang et al., 1996, PMID: 8962098; Kim et al., 1997, PMID: 9305844; Cheong et al., 2009, PMID: 19955421; Ikeda et al., 2009, PMID: 19898623). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between PLCB4 and autosomal recessive ACS. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
