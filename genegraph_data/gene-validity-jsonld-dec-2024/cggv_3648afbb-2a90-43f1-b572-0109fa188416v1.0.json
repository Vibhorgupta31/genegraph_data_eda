Molecular analysis has been the mainstay of detection method when confirmation is required. Previously a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction enzyme analysis was used for this purpose. A simple bidirectional allele-specific amplification, recently described by Waterfall in 2001 was used to detect the GAG --> GTG mutation on codon 6 of the beta globin gene. Two sets of primers for the mutant and the wild type alleles were used in a single PCR reaction to amplify the regions of interest. The resultant PCR products will produce two fragments at 517 and 267 base pair (bp) respectively. This report highlights the investigations for SCD in the family of a 16-year old girl with recurrent painful crisis affecting the lower limbs whereby the family members are asymptomatic for the disease. Her haemoglobin electrophoresis at an alkaline pH showed dense bands at the HbS and HbF regions, while her father and two sisters had bands at HbS, HbF and HbA. The PCR analysis showed that she was homozygous for the mutation by the presence of only one band at 267 bp fragment, while the father and her sisters were heterozygotes, with the presence of two bands at 267 as well as 517 bp fragments. DNA sequencing of the sample confirmed the mutation. In conclusion, this case report highlighted the simple and cheap yet practical method for molecular confirmation of the presence of HbS gene in subjects with homozygous or heterozygous state of the condition.","dc:creator":"Hafiza A","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A family study of HbS in a Malay family by molecular analysis."}},"rdfs:label":"Hafiza_Proband"},{"id":"cggv:4eff41ad-f4cc-4966-a44a-3c2c6d4b131a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4eff41ad-f4cc-4966-a44a-3c2c6d4b131a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4eff41ad-f4cc-4966-a44a-3c2c6d4b131a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant is extensively studied in patients as well as in mouse models that recapitulate the human disease with varying severities.

More importantly, the packing of COHb S molecules does not show the typical pathological interaction between βVal6 and the βAla70, βPhe85 and βLeu88 hydrophobic acceptor pocket observed in DeoxyHb S crystal.

This mutant protein is  produced from the mutant beta-globin, due to the Glu7Val missense variant, binding to the alpha chains. HbS has low oxygen affinity and polymerizes within the RBCs, which initiates the pathophysiological event in SCD. The glutamic acid at position 7 is involved in electrostatic interactions with asparagine at amino acid 74, which prevents HbS polymerization (PMID: 18422994). The valine at this position enhances binding to HbS partner strands in the deoxygenated state (T conformation). HbS polymerization correlates exponentially with the concentration of HbS within the erythrocyte. The lipid bilayer and proteins of the erythrocyte membrane are directly or indirectly altered by HbS polymerization, which leads to reduced cellular hydration, increases haemolysis, abnormal interactions with other blood cells and contributes to early erythrocyte apoptosis. Sickle cells are highly unstable and are prone to hemolysis. Hemolysis is both a cause and effect of oxidative stress, which can further lead to membrane damage. HbS polymerization also contributes to the rigidity of the RBCs, which leads to them assuming the characteristic sickle shape. This next leads to vaso-occlusion, which is also exacerbated by the abnormal adhesive properties of the sickle cell which binds PBMCs, and platelets ad well as directly to the endothelium. The sickle cells also become dehydrated due to abnormalities in the Gardos channel, which further contributes to hemolysis (PMID: 33072979).

Haemoglobin molecules that include mutant sickle β-globin subunits can polymerize; erythrocytes that contain mostly haemoglobin polymers assume a sickled form and are prone to haemolysis.

Using a gene-targeting plasmid containing a loxP-flanked drug-resistant gene cassette to assist selection of rare targeted clones and zinc finger nucleases engineered to specifically stimulate homologous recombination at the β(s) locus, we achieved precise conversion of 1 mutated β(s) to the wild-type β(A) in SCD iPSCs.

Although self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors with or without insulator elements should provide a safe and effective treatment in humans, some concerns about insertional mutagenesis persist. An ideal correction would involve replacement of the sickle globin gene (beta(S)) with a normal copy of the gene (beta(A)). We recently derived embryonic stem (ES) cells from a novel knock-in mouse model of SCD and tested a protocol for correcting the sickle mutation by homologous recombination. In this paper, we demonstrate the replacement of the human beta(S)-globin gene with a human beta(A)-globin gene and the derivation of mice from these cells. The animals produce high levels of normal human hemoglobin (HbA) and the pathology associated with SCD is corrected. Hematologic values are restored to normal levels and organ pathology is ameliorated. These experiments provide a foundation for similar studies in human ES cells derived from sickle cell patients. Although efficient methods for production of human ES cells by somatic nuclear transfer must be developed, the data in this paper demonstrate that sickle cell disease can be corrected without the risk of insertional mutagenesis.","dc:creator":"Wu LC","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Correction of sickle cell disease by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells."},"rdfs:label":"Wu_Rescue in mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1e5047ce-e5e5-4581-95f3-5b0ca1a8a4fa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d78856e2-b404-476e-95ba-28560d956357","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"HbA-T87Q levels increased steadily and red-cell transfusions were discontinued, with the last transfusion on day 88.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. *HBB* encodes the hemoglobin beta subunit, which forms the functional hemoglobin protein complex upon interaction with the alpha subunit. Sickle cell disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia vaso-occlusive disease, painful crises, which lead to multi-organ damage including acute chest syndrome, functional splenomegaly, increased susceptibility to infections. A majority of SCD is caused by a single variant in the HBB gene, p.Glu7Val, often referred to as Glu6Val when numbered within the mature processed protein. The p.Glu7Val variant leads to exposure of a hydrophobic patch that causes the abnormal hemoglobin to polymerize and thus initiate the pathological process associated with SCD. Homozygosity for p.Glu7Val results in the classic, severe SCD. SCD also results from compound heterozygosity for Glu7Val and an additional variant in *HBB* in trans. Severity varies, but is influenced by the effect of the additional variant on the polymerization ability of p.Glu7Val. Individuals heterozygous for the p.Glu7Val variant have the sickle cell trait but do not show clinical symptoms related to SCD. Rare cases of SCD have been reported in the literature with a proposed autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with the p.Glu7Val variant in cis with another variant in *HBB*; these cases have not been included in this curation. The first clinical report of sickle cell disease dates to 1910 by Herrick (PMID: 11501714). The amino acid change in *HBB* resulting in SCD, p.Glu7Val, was first identified in 1957 using tryptic digests by Ingram (PMID: 13464827). The nucleotide change was identified from the cDNA sequence in 1977 and reported by Marotta et al (PMID: 68958).\n \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in many individuals with 7 probands in 7 publications curated for this assessment (PMID: 21329186, 18473247, 8112743, 8438884, 24814631, 17038017, 37113902). The p.Glu7Val variant and other common pathogenic variants are seen at a high frequency in population databases due to asymptomatic carriers being present in sequenced cohorts. The p.Glu7Val variant is reported in gnomAD v2.1.1 at the highest MAF of 0.0449 (4.5%; 1121/24964 African/African American alleles). According to the CDC data and statistics, the prevalence of sickle cell disease in the African/African American population is 0.27% and the carrier frequency is 7.7%. The allele is maintained at a high level in the African populations because, in the heterozygous state, it affords some protection against the malarial parasite, which replicates in red blood cells (PMID: 24396149). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nFive different haplotypes based on the presence or absence of certain restriction sites have been described and thought to represent independent origins of the p.Glu7Val variant. Haplotype analysis and statistical modeling in PMID: 29526279 inferred a single origin of the p.Glu7Val allele approximately 7300 years ago, in the Green Sahara or west-central Africa, during the Holocene Wet phase. Malaria preexisted in this environment that favored selection of the allele, and this predated the population split in Africa represented by the different haplotypes. \n \nThe mechanism for disease is gain of function.\n \nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): The p.Glu7Val variant in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity in *HBB* results in an abnormal hemoglobin protein, HbS. The normal function of Hb is to transport oxygen from the lung to various tissues. HbS has low oxygen affinity and in deoxygenated state polymerizes within erythrocytes. Polymerization leads to rigidity and sickling of erythrocytes.\nThis also causes altered erythrocyte membrane properties, leading to cellular dehydration, abnormal adhesion to PBMCs and platelets and the endothelium, resulting in vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, anemia, and organ damage (PMID: 21131035). *HBB* is expressed exclusively in blood (PMID: 23715323). The beta hemoglobin encoded by *HBB* interacts with the alpha subunit encoded by *HBA1* and *HBA2* (PMID: 14634627, 27085422). Several mouse models that are generated from introducing the human SCD variant, p.Glu7Val, are reported in the literature. Mice solely expressing the human alpha and beta (with the p.Glu7Val variant) chains, with the murine hemoglobin chains knocked out, recapitulate the human phenotype. They show irreversibly sickled cells in-vitro and in-vivo as well as extensive organ damage (PMIDs: 9346488, 9346487, 2296310). Rescue of the SCD phenotype has been accomplished in patient iPSCs, mouse models and human patients via clinical trials, wherein the introduction of wild-type human adult hemoglobin results in correction of the disease (PMIDs: 21881051, 16638928, 21881051).\n \nIn summary, the *HBB*-sickle cell disease gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on August 23, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3648afbb-2a90-43f1-b572-0109fa188416"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
