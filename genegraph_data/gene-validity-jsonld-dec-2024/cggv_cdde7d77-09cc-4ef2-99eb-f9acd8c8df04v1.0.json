In order to identify the genetic basis of PHID and study its relationship with glucose metabolism, we performed homozygosity mapping in five unrelated families followed by candidate gene sequencing. Five loss-of-function mutations were identified in the SLC29A3 gene which encodes a member of a highly conserved protein family that transports nucleosides, nucleobases and nucleoside analogue drugs, hENT3. We show that PHID is allelic with a related syndrome without diabetes mellitus, H syndrome. The interaction of SLC29A3 with insulin signaling pathways was then studied using an established model in Drosophila melanogaster. Ubiquitous knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog of hENT3, dENT1 is lethal under stringent conditions; whereas milder knockdown induced scutellar bristle phenotypes similar to those previously reported in the knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog of the Islet gene. A cellular growth assay showed a reduction of cell size/number which could be rescued or enhanced by manipulation of the Drosophila insulin receptor and its downstream signaling effectors, dPI3K and dAkt. In summary, inactivating mutations in SLC29A3 cause a syndromic form of insulin-dependent diabetes in humans and in Drosophila profoundly affect cell size/number through interactions with the insulin signaling pathway. These data suggest that further investigation of the role of SLC29A3 in glucose metabolism is a priority for diabetes research.","dc:creator":"Cliffe ST","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"SLC29A3 gene is mutated in pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus syndrome and interacts with the insulin signaling pathway."},"rdfs:label":"hENT3 RNA and Protein Studies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:60ccdeae-8b40-40e9-b4e0-e8b963b1c04d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96ace541-23c4-46e2-8839-fe1f48ea9305","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"SLC29A3 encodes an equilibrative nucleoside transporter that mediates the facilitative transport of nucleoside across lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes.

ENT3 deficiency alters hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell fates; the former leads to stem cell exhaustion, and the latter leads to breaches of mesodermal tissue integrity. The molecular pathogenesis stems from the loss of lysosomal adenosine transport, which impedes autophagy-regulated stem cell differentiation programs via misregulation of the AMPK-mTOR-ULK axis. Furthermore, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and bioenergetics studies identify defects in fatty acid utilization, and alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics can additionally propel stem cell deficits. Genetic, pharmacologic and stem cell interventions ameliorate ENT3-disease pathologies and extend the lifespan of ENT3-deficient mice.

In most cases the pathophysiology is unclear and treatment is nonspecific. Faisalabad histiocytosis (FHC) (MIM 602782) has been classed as an autosomal recessively inherited form of histiocytosis with similarities to Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) (also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML)). To elucidate the molecular basis of FHC, we performed autozygosity mapping studies in a large consanguineous family and identified a novel locus at chromosome 10q22.1. Mutation analysis of candidate genes within the target interval identified biallelic germline mutations in SLC29A3 in the FHC kindred and in two families reported to have familial RDD. Analysis of SLC29A3 expression during mouse embryogenesis revealed widespread expression by e14.5 with prominent expression in the central nervous system, eye, inner ear, and epithelial tissues including the gastrointestinal tract. SLC29A3 encodes an intracellular equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT3) with affinity for adenosine. Recently germline mutations in SLC29A3 were also described in two rare autosomal recessive disorders with overlapping phenotypes: (a) H syndrome (MIM 612391) that is characterised by cutaneous hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis, hepatomegaly, heart anomalies, hearing loss, and hypogonadism; and (b) PHID (pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) syndrome. Our findings suggest that a variety of clinical diagnoses (H and PHID syndromes, FHC, and familial RDD) can be included in a new diagnostic category of SLC29A3 spectrum disorder.","dc:creator":"Morgan NV","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in SLC29A3, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT3, cause a familial histiocytosis syndrome (Faisalabad histiocytosis) and familial Rosai-Dorfman disease."}},{"id":"cggv:a74706f9-bf86-478a-b05c-4bbda31f4b8a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:00feebd9-7dae-4dd8-b338-847a082a2520"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20140240"}],"rdfs:label":"Family 2 Kismet Proband"},{"id":"cggv:23ffbcd3-c49b-4cea-84c8-4fef0f222942","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23ffbcd3-c49b-4cea-84c8-4fef0f222942_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:23ffbcd3-c49b-4cea-84c8-4fef0f222942_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional characterization of G437R in Xenopus oocytes showed that transport activity was approximately half of WT SLC29A3.

Genome-wide linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous frameshift deletion in SLC29A3, which encodes human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-3 (hENT3). Germline mutations in SLC29A3 have been reported in rare patients with a wide range of overlapping clinical features and inherited disorders including H syndrome, pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin-dependent diabetes, and Faisalabad histiocytosis. With the exception of insulin-dependent diabetes and mild finger and toe contractures in one sibling, the two patients with nasal granulomatous histiocytosis studied here displayed none of the many SLC29A3-associated phenotypes. This mild clinical phenotype probably results from a remarkable genetic mechanism. The SLC29A3 frameshift deletion prevents the expression of the normally coding transcripts. It instead leads to the translation, expression, and function of an otherwise noncoding, out-of-frame mRNA splice variant lacking exon 3 that is eliminated by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in healthy individuals. The mutated isoform differs from the wild-type hENT3 by the modification of 20 residues in exon 2 and the removal of another 28 amino acids in exon 3, which include the second transmembrane domain. As a result, this new isoform displays some functional activity. This mechanism probably accounts for the narrow and mild clinical phenotype of the patients. This study highlights the 'rescue' role played by a normally noncoding mRNA splice variant of SLC29A3, uncovering a new mechanism by which frameshift mutations can be hypomorphic.","dc:creator":"Bolze A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A mild form of SLC29A3 disorder: a frameshift deletion leads to the paradoxical translation of an otherwise noncoding mRNA splice variant."}},"rdfs:label":"de Pontual Family VII Patient 7/Bolze P1"},{"id":"cggv:461e4c21-f4cf-4cf7-b371-353043f34057","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:461e4c21-f4cf-4cf7-b371-353043f34057_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:461e4c21-f4cf-4cf7-b371-353043f34057_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"This mutation decreases the levels of transcript variant 1 through NMD and results in an absence of the WT protein, but allows the expression of a mutated mRNA transcript variant 3, which would ordinarily be subject to NMD.

Among patients with H syndrome, deficient *SLC29A3* function results in impaired nucleoside export from lysosomes and lysosomal accumulation of nucleosides (PMID: 22174130), which leads to histiocytic infiltration of numerous organs. This accumulation causes disease manifestations including cutaneous hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, hearing loss, heart anomalies, hypogonadism, hyperglycemia, low height, and hallux valgus (as reviewed in PMID: 29527032). \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: H syndrome, pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus syndrome (PHID), Faisalabad histiocytosis (FHC), familial sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (FSHML), and dysosteosclerosis. \n\nFifteen variants (8 missense, 3 frameshift, 2 nonsense, canonical 2 splice site) that have been reported in 22 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 18940313, 20140240, 19336477, 19889517, 22875837, 22653152, 22238637) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of the gene product being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified in individuals with H syndrome (PMID: 22174130), functional alteration in patient cells showing accumulation of *SLC29A3* protein (PMID: 19336477), expression in patient cells was significantly decreased compared to healthy controls (PMID: 19336477), and animal models that recapitulate the human phenotype (PMIDs: 31270333, 19336477). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SLC29A3* and autosomal recessive H syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on May 7, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cdde7d77-09cc-4ef2-99eb-f9acd8c8df04"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
