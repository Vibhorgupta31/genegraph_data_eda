Heterozygous animals developed normally, whereas mice homozygous for the disrupted gene were born dead and lacked the lung parenchyma. Instead, they had a rudimentary bronchial tree associated with an abnormal epithelium in their pleural cavities. Furthermore, the homozygous mice had no thyroid gland but had a normal parathyroid. In addition, extensive defects were found in the brain of the homozygous mice, especially in the ventral region of the forebrain. The entire pituitary, including the anterior, intermediate, and posterior pituitary, was also missing. In situ hybridization showed that the T/ebp gene is expressed in the normal thyroid, lung bronchial epithelium, and specific areas of the forebrain during early embryogenesis.

","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11854318","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Three genes, TTF1, TTF2, and PAX8, involved in thyroid gland development and migration have been identified. Yet systematic screening for defects in these genes in thyroid dysgenesis gave essentially negative results. In particular, no TTF1 gene defects were found in 76 individuals with thyroid dysgenesis even though a deletion of this gene in the mouse results in thyroid and lung agenesis and defective diencephalon. We report a 6-year-old boy with predominant dyskinesia, neonatal respiratory distress, and mild hyperthyrotropinemia. One allele of his TTF1 gene had a guanidine inserted into codon 86 producing a nonsense protein of 407, rather than 371, amino acids. The mutant TTF1 did not bind to its canonical cis-element or transactivate a reporter gene driven by the thyroglobulin promoter, a natural target of TTF1. Failure of the mutant TTF1 to interfere with binding and transactivation functions of the wild-type TTF1 suggested that the syndrome was caused by haploinsufficiency. This was confirmed in mice heterozygous for Ttf1 gene deletion, heretofore considered to be normal. Compared with wild-type littermates, Ttf1(+/-) mice had poor coordination and a significant elevation of serum thyrotropin. Therefore, haploinsufficiency of the TTF1 gene results in a predominantly neurological phenotype and secondary hyperthyrotropinemia.","dc:creator":"Pohlenz J","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Partial deficiency of thyroid transcription factor 1 produces predominantly neurological defects in humans and mice."},"rdfs:label":"heterozygous mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:7a251827-6f0d-4fc3-bb08-73c1048d0726","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17d88821-4308-492d-a335-286d0206c145","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"lethal homozygous mouse model with involvement in the tissues/organs that are affected in human disease.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8557195","rdfs:label":"homozygous mouse model "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduced for homozygous model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5},{"id":"cggv:c584f6b9-ce28-4020-b34f-5d63a70a249b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9245,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:86b3300e-1684-4be9-b842-3c7d09696dd6","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100520","gene":"hgnc:11825","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The NKX2-1 gene is located on chromosome 14 at 14q13.3 and encodes the NK2 homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor that binds and activates thyroid specific genes. NKX2-1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant NKX2-1 related choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism with or without pulmonary dysfunction in 1998 (Devriendt et al., 1998, PMID: 9565498). Variants in NKX2-1 have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Thyroid cancer, nonmedullary, 1 (MIM:\t188550), Chorea, hereditary benign (MIM:118700), Choreoathetosis, hypothyroidism, and neonatal respiratory distress (MIM:610978). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, NKX2-1 related choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism with or without pulmonary dysfunction. At least 9 variants including missense and loss-of-function variants have been reported in a heterozygous state. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship include case level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least nine probands from three publications (Gras et al., 2012, PMID: 22832740; Iodice et al., 2019, PMID: 30352709; Parnes et al., 2019, PMID: 30746413) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by mouse models that partially recapitulate the human disease phenotype (Kimura et al., 1996, PMID: 8557195; Pohlenz et al., 2002, PMID: 11854318). In situ hybridization shows the gene is expressed primarily in thyroid, lung epithelium, and areas of the forebrain during embryogenesis, providing more support for the relationship of the gene and disease. In summary, the NKX2-1 gene is definitively associated with autosomal dominant NKX2-1 related choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism with or without pulmonary dysfunction. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 07.26.2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c584f6b9-ce28-4020-b34f-5d63a70a249b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
