All three patients fulfilled Task Force criteria and did not carry mutations in any other ARVC-related gene. Immunostaining with TMEM43 antibody showed intense staining of the sarcolemma. The signal level was reduced in all the three TMEM43-positive patients. Immunostaining with plakoglobin-specific antibody also showed reduced signal levels in the three carriers.

A heterozygous missense mutation in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, p.S358L, has been genetically identified to cause autosomal dominant ARVC type 5 in a founder population from the island of Newfoundland, Canada. Little is known about the function of the TMEM43 protein or how it leads to the pathogenesis of ARVC. We sought to determine the distribution of TMEM43 and the effect of the p.S358L mutation on the expression and distribution of various intercalated (IC) disc proteins as well as functional effects on IC disc gap junction dye transfer and conduction velocity in cell culture. Through Western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence (IF), and electrophysiological analysis, our results showed that the stable expression of p.S358L mutation in the HL-1 cardiac cell line resulted in decreased Zonula Occludens (ZO-1) expression and the loss of ZO-1 localization to cell-cell junctions. Junctional Plakoglobin (JUP) and α-catenin proteins were redistributed to the cytoplasm with decreased localization to cell-cell junctions. Connexin-43 (Cx43) phosphorylation was altered, and there was reduced gap junction dye transfer and conduction velocity in mutant TMEM43-transfected cells. These observations suggest that expression of the p.S358L mutant of TMEM43 found in ARVC type 5 may affect localization of proteins involved in conduction, alter gap junction function and reduce conduction velocity in cardiac tissue.

Here, we generated TMEM43 S358L mouse to explore the underlying mechanism. This mouse strain showed the classic pathologies of ARVD patients, including structural abnormalities and cardiac fibrofatty. TMEM43 S358L mutation led to hyper-activated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in heart tissues and primary cardiomyocyte cells. Importantly, this hyper activation of NF-κB directly drove the expression of pro-fibrotic gene, transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ1), and enhanced downstream signal, indicating that TMEM43 S358L mutation up-regulates NF-κB-TGFβ signal cascade during ARVD cardiac fibrosis.

Variants in TMEM43 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2008 (Merner et al., PMID 18313022). At least 9 variants (mostly missense) have been reported in humans. However, the pathogenicity of most of the variants is unknown.  The majority of genetic evidence comes from case-level data and segregation data for one founder variant, p.Ser358Leu, which has been reported in more than 20 families with ARVC and occurred de novo in one individual (Merner et al., 2008, PMID 18313022; Christensen et al. 2011, PMID 21214875; Baskin et al., 2013, PMID 23812740; Hodgkinson et al., 2013, PMID 22725725; Milting et al., 2014, PMID 24598986). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model, expression stuies, and in vitro assays. In summary, TMEM43 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia . This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
