Whole-exome sequencing allowed us to identify a CDC14A biallelic nonsense mutation, c.1126C>T (p.Arg376(∗)), which was present in the eight clinically affected individuals still alive. Subsequent screening of 115 unrelated individuals affected by severe or profound congenital deafness of unknown genetic cause led us to identify another CDC14A biallelic nonsense mutation, c.1015C>T (p.Arg339(∗)), in an individual originating from Mauritania. CDC14A encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Immunofluorescence analysis of the protein distribution in the mouse inner ear showed a strong labeling of the hair cells' kinocilia. By using a morpholino strategy to knockdown cdc14a in zebrafish larvae, we found that the length of the kinocilia was reduced in inner-ear hair cells. Therefore, deafness caused by loss-of-function mutations in CDC14A probably arises from a morphogenetic defect of the auditory sensory cells' hair bundles, whose differentiation critically depends on the proper growth of their kinocilium.","dc:creator":"Delmaghani S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in CDC14A, Encoding a Protein Phosphatase Involved in Hair Cell Ciliogenesis, Cause Autosomal-Recessive Severe to Profound Deafness."},"rdfs:label":"Delmaghani Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4edd78a1-e24b-43da-930b-b12915a8c78a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:090053bc-d575-488a-8b38-18f14e340aa6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Replicated localization findings above, also in zebrafish kinocilia of neuromast hair cells.

Numerous disparate roles of vertebrate Cell Division-Cycle-14 (CDC14A) have been proposed largely based on studies of cultured cancer cells in vitro. The in vivo functions of vertebrate CDC14A are largely unknown. We generated and analyzed mutations of zebrafish and mouse CDC14A, developed a computational structural model of human CDC14A protein and report four novel truncating and three missense alleles of CDC14A in human families segregating progressive, moderate-to-profound deafness. In five of these families segregating pathogenic variants of CDC14A, deaf males are infertile, while deaf females are fertile. Several recessive mutations of mouse Cdc14a, including a CRISPR/Cas9-edited phosphatase-dead p.C278S substitution, result in substantial perinatal lethality, but survivors recapitulate the human phenotype of deafness and male infertility. CDC14A protein localizes to inner ear hair cell kinocilia, basal bodies and sound-transducing stereocilia. Auditory hair cells of postnatal Cdc14a mutants develop normally, but subsequently degenerate causing deafness. Kinocilia of germ-line mutants of mouse and zebrafish have normal lengths, which does not recapitulate the published cdc14aa knockdown morphant phenotype of short kinocilia. In mutant male mice, degeneration of seminiferous tubules and spermiation defects result in low sperm count, and abnormal sperm motility and morphology. These findings for the first time define a new monogenic syndrome of deafness and male infertility revealing an absolute requirement in vivo of vertebrate CDC14A phosphatase activity for hearing and male fertility.","dc:creator":"Imtiaz A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"CDC14A phosphatase is essential for hearing and male fertility in mouse and human."},"rdfs:label":"Imtiaz Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Gtex shows low expression in all tissues except testis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:144089d2-83ec-4c6c-8b43-9a4cae801d51_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f0127c4-287b-4829-90c2-d58efda7cead","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06f38543-ce29-4b9f-be1a-945b8cb4a9ba","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Three different mouse alleles were generated with floxed or deleted exon 3.

*CDC14A* gene was first associated with autosomal recessive hearing impairment and infertile male syndrome (HIIMS) in 2017 (Imtiaz et al., PMID: 29293958). In five families reported with HIIMS, females homozygous for *CDC14A* variants had prelingual sensorineural hearing loss, and homozygous males had hearing loss and infertility (PMID: 29293958). Three families segregated truncating variants predicted to affect all isoforms of the gene. Two families had two different missense variants in the dual-specificity phosphatase domain of *CDC14A*. One additional family had a third missense variant in this domain, but the fertility status of the affected males could not be determined. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and animal models (PMIDs: 27259055, 29293958). There are four mouse models for this syndrome, including one with a predicted deleterious missense variant in the phosphatase domain generated by CRISPR/Cas9 (PMID: 29293958). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss which has been​ assessed separately. In summary, there is strong evidence to support the association between *CDC14A* and autosomal recessive hearing impairment and infertile male syndrome. Additional reports in humans are needed to reach a definitive classification. This gene-disease pair was originally classified as Strong by the ClinGen Hearing Loss​ Working Group on 2/26/2018 as per SOP v5. It was reevaluated on 6/1/2023. As of June 2023, this record underwent an update in scoring to be consistent with SOP v9. No new evidence has been reviewed or added. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:144089d2-83ec-4c6c-8b43-9a4cae801d51"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
