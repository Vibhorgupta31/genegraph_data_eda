Disease-associated point mutations of conserved residues in either the Rab3GAP1 (T18P and E24V) or Rab3GAP2 (R426C) subunits result in loss of the Rab18 GEF and membrane-targeting activities. Supporting the view that Rab18 activity is important for ER structure, in the absence of either Rab3GAP subunit or Rab18 function, ER tubular networks marked by reticulon 4 were disrupted, and ER sheets defined by CLIMP-63 spread out into the cell periphery.

Brain imaging showed in the majority of cases polymicrogyria, thin corpus callosum, cortical atrophy, and white matter dysmyelination. Unusual additional findings were pectus excavatum (four patients), pectus carinatum (three patients), congenital heart disease (three patients) and bilateral calcification in basal ganglia (one patient). Mutational analysis of RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2 revealed 21 mutations, including 14 novel variants. RAB3GAP1 mutations were identified in 22 patients with Micro, including a deletion of the entire gene in one patient. On the other hand, RAB3GAP2 mutations were identified in two patients with Micro and all Martsolf patients. Moreover, exome sequencing unraveled a TBC1D20 mutation in an additional family with Micro syndrome.

Causative biallelic germline mutations have been identified in RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2, or RAB18, each of which encode proteins involved in membrane trafficking. This report provides an up to date overview of all known disease variants identified in 29 previously published families and 52 new families. One-hundred and forty-four Micro and nine Martsolf families were investigated, identifying mutations in RAB3GAP1 in 41% of cases, mutations in RAB3GAP2 in 7% of cases, and mutations in RAB18 in 5% of cases. These are listed in Leiden Open source Variation Databases, which was created by us for all three genes. Genotype-phenotype correlations for these genes have now established that the clinical phenotypes in Micro syndrome and MS represent a phenotypic continuum related to the nature and severity of the mutations present in the disease genes, with more deleterious mutations causing Micro syndrome and milder mutations causing MS. RAB18 has not yet been linked to the RAB3 pathways, but mutations in all three genes cause an indistinguishable phenotype, making it likely that there is some overlap. There is considerable genetic heterogeneity for these disorders and further gene identification will help delineate these pathways.","dc:creator":"Handley MT","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutation spectrum in RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2, and RAB18 and genotype-phenotype correlations in warburg micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"48"},{"id":"cggv:baea5885-9dc2-4e72-99e8-d94ef65d8395","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:baea5885-9dc2-4e72-99e8-d94ef65d8395_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"homozygous variant from consanguineous family"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:bf6d465b-a807-45d7-9f1b-f7a7e0d14555_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf6d465b-a807-45d7-9f1b-f7a7e0d14555","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a347e839-e52d-4d23-81a5-b012c940d3b4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012414.4(RAB3GAP2):c.1276C>T (p.Arg426Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA150652"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000568","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002342","obo:HP_0000519","obo:HP_0000252"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:20d0d1bd-99a7-4899-8f5a-23b0b2947604_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a347e839-e52d-4d23-81a5-b012c940d3b4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23420520"},"rdfs:label":"K43"},{"id":"cggv:20d0d1bd-99a7-4899-8f5a-23b0b2947604","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20d0d1bd-99a7-4899-8f5a-23b0b2947604_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"homozygous variant; parents from genetic isolate"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a597c534-fc73-47f5-b80b-2f21c542a274_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a597c534-fc73-47f5-b80b-2f21c542a274","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:f6e50b44-09fb-4954-876f-afa4440a3cd7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012414.4(RAB3GAP2):c.3154G>T (p.Gly1052Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115207"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001256","obo:HP_0000568","obo:HP_0001264","obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0000519"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:7dcecb63-2cb1-47ce-86da-de94fe1418c2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f6e50b44-09fb-4954-876f-afa4440a3cd7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16532399","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We identified a homozygous missense mutation in the noncatalytic subunit (RAB3GAP2) of RAB3GAP that results in abnormal splicing in a family with congenital cataracts, hypogonadism, and mild mental retardation (Martsolf syndrome). Recently, mutations in the catalytic subunit of RAB3GAP (RAB3GAP1), a key regulator of calcium-mediated hormone and neurotransmitter exocytosis, were reported in Warburg micro syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental condition with overlapping clinical features. RAB3GAP is a heterodimeric protein that consists of a catalytic subunit and a noncatalytic subunit encoded by RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2, respectively. We performed messenger RNA-expression studies of RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2 orthologues in Danio rerio embryos and demonstrated that, whereas developmental expression of rab3gap1 was generalized (similar to that reported elsewhere in mice), rab3gap2 expression was restricted to the central nervous system. These findings are consistent with RAB3GAP2 having a key role in neurodevelopment and may indicate that Warburg micro and Martsolf syndromes represent a spectrum of disorders. However, we did not detect RAB3GAP2 mutations in patients with Warburg micro syndrome.

The neurodevelopmental and ophthalmological phenotype is more severe in Warburg Micro syndrome in which cerebral malformations and severe motor and mental retardation are common. While biallelic loss-of-function mutations in RAB3GAP1 are present in the majority of patients with Warburg Micro syndrome; a hypomorphic homozygous splicing mutation of RAB3GAP2 has been reported in a single family with Martsolf syndrome. Here, we report a novel homozygous RAB3GAP2 small in-frame deletion, c.499_507delTTCTACACT (p.Phe167_Thr169del) that causes Warburg Micro syndrome in a girl from a consanguineous Turkish family presenting with congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, absent visually evoked potentials, microcephaly, polymicrogyria, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and severe developmental delay.

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Martsolf Syndrome in 2006 (Aligianis et al. PMID 16532399) and autosomal recessive Warburg Micro syndrome in 2011 (Borck et al. PMID 20967465). Martsolf syndrome and Warburg Micro syndrome are clinically overlapping autosomal recessive conditions characterized by congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypotonia and neurodevelopmental delay, in which Martsolf syndrome presents with a milder and Warburg Micro syndrome presents with a more severe clinical phenotype. \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern between these conditions. Therefore, the following disease entities: Martsolf syndrome 1 (OMIM: 212720) and Warburg micro syndrome 2 (OMIM: 614225) have been lumped into one disease entity in this curation. \nEighteen variants (4 missense, 1 in-frame indel, 10 nonsense, 2 frameshift, 1 splice site) that have been reported in 8 Martsolf and 10 Warburg Micro probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 16532399, 20967465, 23420520, 32740904, 32376645) are included in this curation; the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function assays (PMIDs 24891604). \nIn summary, RAB3GAP2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Warburg micro spectrum, a disease entity that includes both Martsolf syndrome (OMIM: 212720) and Warburg micro syndrome (OMIM: 614225). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Brain Malformations GCEP on November 28, 2023.\n\nRepeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a322fa3e-2985-4f60-9b4b-87f333cf9431"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
