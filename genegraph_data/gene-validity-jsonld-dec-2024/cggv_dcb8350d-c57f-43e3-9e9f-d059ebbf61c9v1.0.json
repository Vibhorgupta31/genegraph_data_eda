This autosomal recessive condition is usually recognized at birth or during the first months of life in an infant with total blindness or greatly impaired vision, normal fundus and extinguished electroretinogram (ERG). Nystagmus (pendular type) and characteristic eye poking are frequently observed in the first months of life (digito-ocular sign of Franceschetti). Hypermetropia and keratoconus frequently develop in the course of the disease. The observation by Waardenburg of normal children born to affected parents supports the genetic heterogeneity of LCA. Until now, however, little was known about the pathophysiology of the disease, but LCA is usually regarded as the consequence of either impaired development of photoreceptors or extremely early degeneration of cells that have developed normally. We have recently mapped a gene for LCA to chromosome 17p13.1 (LCA1) by homozygosity mapping in consanguineous families of North African origin and provided evidence of genetic heterogeneity in our sample, as LCA1 accounted for 8/15 LCA families in our series. Here, we report two missense mutations (F589S) and two frameshift mutations (nt 460 del C, nt 693 del C) of the retinal guanylate cyclase (RETGC, GDB symbol GUC2D) gene in four unrelated LCA1 probands of North African ancestry and ascribe LCA1 to an impaired production of cGMP in the retina, with permanent closure of cGMP-gated cation channels.","dc:creator":"Perrault I","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Retinal-specific guanylate cyclase gene mutations in Leber's congenital amaurosis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dcb8350d-c57f-43e3-9e9f-d059ebbf61c9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a998f954-0559-4471-a22f-c23c66ef075a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a998f954-0559-4471-a22f-c23c66ef075a","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2ae2f86e-7a76-48d6-8120-5cca52c7ae19","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000180.4(GUCY2D):c.1694T>C (p.Phe565Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA226054"}},"detectionMethod":"The individual was included in multi-family homozygosity mapping, establishing linkage to chromosome 17p13.1 and particularly between the D17S1353 and D17S1854 markers (PMID: 7581387, PMID: 8641699).

Genetic heterogeneity of LCA has been suspected since the report by Waardenburg of normal children born to affected parents. In 1995 we localised the first disease causing gene, LCA1, to chromosome 17p13 and confirmed the genetic heterogeneity. In 1996 we ascribed LCA1 to mutations in the photoreceptor-specific guanylate cyclase gene (retGC1). Here, we report on the screening of the whole coding sequence of the retGC1 gene in 118 patients affected with LCA. We found 22 different mutations in 24 unrelated families originating from various countries of the world. It is worth noting that all retGC1 mutations consistently caused congenital cone-rod dystrophy in our series, confirming the previous genotype-phenotype correlations we were able to establish. RetGC1 is an essential protein implicated in the phototransduction cascade, especially in the recovery of the dark state after the excitation process of photoreceptor cells by light stimulation. We postulate that the retGC1 mutations hinder the restoration of the basal level of cGMP of cone and rod photoreceptor cells, leading to a situation equivalent to consistent light exposure during photoreceptor development, explaining the severity of the visual disorder at birth.","dc:creator":"Perrault I","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Spectrum of retGC1 mutations in Leber's congenital amaurosis."}},"rdfs:label":"Perrault_1996_Family_9_Proband"},{"id":"cggv:76d12b78-0dc6-49d4-a13c-5d48e3d7d854","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:76d12b78-0dc6-49d4-a13c-5d48e3d7d854_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:76d12b78-0dc6-49d4-a13c-5d48e3d7d854_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 9888789 provides evidence supporting the pathogenicity of the NM_000180.4(GUCY2D):c.1694T>C (p.Phe565Ser) variant by showing that the orthologous bovine F514S point mutation severely decreases the intrinsic cyclase activity of the protein and inactivates one of its calcium-responsive activating switches, CRM1."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The variant has been moderately up-scored to reflect its predicted deleterious effect on catalytic activity and its recurrent detection in a homozygous state in affected individuals from multiple families.

Mutations in GC1 are known to cause Leber congenital amaurosis type 1 (LCA1), a childhood disease associated with severe vision loss. Although the enzymatic and regulatory properties of guanylate cyclases have been studied extensively, the molecular determinants responsible for their trafficking in photoreceptors remain unknown. Here we show that RD3, a protein of unknown function encoded by a gene associated with photoreceptor degeneration in humans with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12 (LCA12), the rd3 mouse, and rcd2 collie, colocalizes and interacts with GC1 and GC2 in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of normal mice. GC1 and GC2 are undetectable in photoreceptors of the rd3 mouse deficient in RD3 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cell expression studies show that RD3 mediates the export of GC1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomal vesicles, and that the C terminus of GC1 is required for RD3 binding. Our results indicate that photoreceptor degeneration in the rd3 mouse, rcd2 dog, and LCA12 patients is caused by impaired RD3-mediated guanylate cyclase expression and trafficking.

Affected individuals have since been identified in a number of other publications (PMID: 16505055, PMID: 29559409, PMID: 23035049), with causal biallelic variants in *GUCY2D* specifically diagnostic for either Leber congenital amaurosis 1 (more severe) or congenital stationary night blindness type 1I (milder and later onset). Both disease entities are completely penetrant, however, patients diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis 1 present with severe visual impairment before the age of 5 (usually during the first year of life) while their counterparts with congenital stationary night blindness type 1I are diagnosed between the ages of 9 and 45, presenting with night blindness since childhood and gradual progression to mild retinal dystrophy (PMID: 29559409). Patients with Leber congenital amaurosis 1 also exhibit other eye-specific features, including nystagmus, photophobia, strabismus, eye poking, keratoconus, attenuation of retinal blood vessels, optic disc pallor, and mild retinal pigment epithelium mottling, often with a relatively normal appearance to the fundus. Patients with congenital stationary night blindness type 1I exhibit only a subset of these features, including attenuation of retinal blood vessels and progressive visual field constriction. Electroretinogram (ERG) response is nondetectable in Leber congenital amaurosis 1 patients, however, those with congenital stationary night blindness type 1I initially exhibit nondetectable responses only in rod-based ERG, while cone-based ERG responses may remain normal until the third decade of life or later. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the GUCY2D gene product) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients diagnosed with either Leber congenital amaurosis 1 or congenital stationary night blindness type 1I, while the phenotypic variability between them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases of Leber congenital amaurosis 1 or congenital stationary night blindness type 1I have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *GUCY2D*-related recessive retinopathy (MONDO:0100453). Two additional disease entities, cone-rod dystrophy 6 and central areolar choroidal dystrophy 1, were asserted in relation to monoallelic variants in *GUCY2D*, particularly those located in the dimerization domain (PMID: 11115851, PMID: 11709018, PMID: 29061346). While these disease entities are characterized by similar phenotypes, their different mode of inheritance and unique variants suggested a different mechanism of pathogenesis. Thus, *GUCY2D* was separately curated for its relationship to this disease entity, referred to as *GUCY2D*-related dominant retinopathy (MONDO:0100441).\n\nEight suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (two nonsense, one frameshift, and five missense), which have been collectively reported in twelve probands in three publications (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 16505055, PMID: 29559409). Eight probands were homozygous for their respective variants (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 16505055), and five were reported to have consanguineous parents (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 16505055). The four other probands were compound heterozygotes within the *GUCY2D* locus (PMID: 16505055, PMID: 29559409). Two families with segregation evidence were available in these publications (PMID: 8944027), and contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. More case-level data was available (PMID: 23035049, PMID: 29559409), but was not scored as part of this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has not been studied in case-control studies at the single variant level or aggregate variant level.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by frameshift or nonsense variants predicted to trigger a decrease in the amount of the gene product (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 29559409). All probands found for this curation harbored two variant alleles within the *GUCY2D* locus.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *GUCY2D* expression is dramatically higher in the retina relative to control tissues (PMID: 30239781), particularly along the retinal outer nuclear layer (PMID: 1356371). Proper subcellular localization of GUCY2D protein requires its C-terminus to physically interact with the RD3 protein, which is encoded by a gene that harbors causal variants for Leber congenital amaurosis 12 (PMID: 21078983). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that *GUCY2D* encodes a receptor guanylyl cyclase that catalyzes cGMP production as part of the recovery of the dark state following visual excitation (PMID: 1356371). This helps explain why chickens homozygous for a null variant of the *GUCY2D* ortholog exhibit dramatically reduced cGMP levels within the retina, nondetectable ERG responses from rod and cone photoreceptors, early onset blindness, and optokinetic reflex abnormalities analogous to nystagmus (PMID: 9448321). Similarly, mice with homozygous knockout of *Gucy2e* (the murine *GUCY2D* ortholog) exhibit degeneration and loss of cone photoreceptor cells in the outer nuclear layer, nondetectable cone-based ERG responses, reduced amplitude of rod-based ERG responses, and loss of visual acuity (PMID: 10407028, PMID: 17255100, PMID: 21671801). Rod photoreceptor function has been shown to be relatively preserved in these mice due to their dependence on a gene paralog (PMID: 17255100). These mouse phenotypes can be partially rescued by injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivering wild-type human *GUCY2D* or mouse *Gucy2e*.\n\nIn summary, *GUCY2D* is definitively associated with *GUCY2D*-related recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dcb8350d-c57f-43e3-9e9f-d059ebbf61c9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
