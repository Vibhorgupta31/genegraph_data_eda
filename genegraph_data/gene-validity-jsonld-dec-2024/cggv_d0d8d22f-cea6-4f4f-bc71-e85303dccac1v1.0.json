Individuals with Joubert syndrome have motor and behavioral abnormalities, including an inability to walk due to severe clumsiness and 'mirror' movements, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Here we identified a locus associated with Joubert syndrome, JBTS3, on chromosome 6q23.2-q23.3 and found three deleterious mutations in AHI1, the first gene to be associated with Joubert syndrome. AHI1 is most highly expressed in brain, particularly in neurons that give rise to the crossing axons of the corticospinal tract and superior cerebellar peduncles. Comparative genetic analysis of AHI1 indicates that it has undergone positive evolutionary selection along the human lineage. Therefore, changes in AHI1 may have been important in the evolution of human-specific motor behaviors.","dc:creator":"Ferland RJ","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Abnormal cerebellar development and axonal decussation due to mutations in AHI1 in Joubert syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d0d8d22f-cea6-4f4f-bc71-e85303dccac1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e92cef74-8f2b-4d9d-a68c-a4e32ffe705e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e92cef74-8f2b-4d9d-a68c-a4e32ffe705e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:1a9ce5d4-ac34-4e69-8961-1045324699d3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001134831.2(AHI1):c.1328T>A (p.Val443Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA249938"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e65fc531-31cd-462a-ac54-e708dd51c5e0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1a9ce5d4-ac34-4e69-8961-1045324699d3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15322546"},"rdfs:label":"Wash Pedigree 5"},{"id":"cggv:e65fc531-31cd-462a-ac54-e708dd51c5e0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e65fc531-31cd-462a-ac54-e708dd51c5e0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:595aac36-09f4-4eff-a592-08b168196708_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:595aac36-09f4-4eff-a592-08b168196708","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:b052f5e4-c6dc-4271-8195-04e838ea71e1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001134831.2(AHI1):c.2168G>A (p.Arg723Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252048"}},"detectionMethod":"In this screening, we adopted a three-step strategy for mutation analysis of the AHI1 gene.

of variant pathogenicity represents a major challenge in the era of high-throughput sequencing. Erroneous categorization may result if variants affect genes that are in fact dispensable. We demonstrate that this also applies to rare, apparently unambiguous truncating mutations of an established disease gene. By whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a consanguineous family with congenital non-syndromic deafness, we unexpectedly identified a homozygous nonsense variant, p.Arg1066*, in AHI1, a gene associated with Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a severe recessive ciliopathy. None of four homozygotes expressed any signs of JBTS, and one of them had normal hearing, which also ruled out p.Arg1066* as the cause of deafness. Homozygosity mapping and WES in the only other reported JBTS family with a homozygous C-terminal truncation (p.Trp1088Leufs*16) confirmed AHI1 as disease gene, but based on a more N-terminal missense mutation impairing WD40-repeat formation. Morpholinos against N-terminal zebrafish Ahi1, orthologous to where human mutations cluster, produced a ciliopathy, but targeting near human p.Arg1066 and p.Trp1088 did not. Most AHI1 mutations in JBTS patients result in truncated protein lacking WD40-repeats and the SH3 domain; disease was hitherto attributed to loss of these protein interaction modules. Our findings indicate that normal development does not require the C-terminal SH3 domain. This has far-reaching implications, considering that variants like p.Glu984* identified by preconception screening ('Kingsmore panel') do not necessarily indicate JBTS carriership. Genomes of individuals with consanguineous background are enriched for homozygous variants that may unmask dispensable regions of disease genes and unrecognized false positives in diagnostic large-scale sequencing and preconception carrier screening.

To investigate Joubert syndrome pathogenesis, we have examined mice with mutated Ahi1, the first identified Joubert syndrome-associated gene. These mice show cerebellar hypoplasia with a vermis-midline fusion defect early in development. This defect is concomitant with expansion of the roof plate and is also evident in a mouse mutant for another Joubert syndrome-associated gene, Cep290. Furthermore, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of human subjects with Joubert syndrome reveals a similar midline cleft, suggesting parallel pathogenic mechanisms. Previous evidence has suggested a role for Jouberin (Jbn), the protein encoded by Ahi1, in canonical Wnt signaling. Consistent with this, we found decreased Wnt reporter activity at the site of hemisphere fusion in the developing cerebellum of Ahi1-mutant mice. This decrease was accompanied by reduced proliferation at the site of fusion. Finally, treatment with lithium, a Wnt pathway agonist, partially rescued this phenotype.

Additional features associated with AHI1 include polymicrogyria and a higher incidence of ocular disease (e.g. retinitis pigmentosa) compared to other genes associated with Joubert Syndrome. Liver disease and polydactyly are uncommon in AHI1 associated conditions. Six variants (missense, in-frame indel, frameshift) reported in six unique probands in three publications (PMID: 25616960, 15322546, 16453322) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but there is sufficient evidence to classify this gene-disease pair as definitive. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence from a zebrafish model (PMID: 25616960), a knockout mouse model (PMID: 21623382), and biochemical functional data (PMID: 23532844). In summary, AHI1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Joubert Syndrome.
