SMAC/DIABLO is highly expressed in human embryonic ears and is enriched in the developing mouse inner-ear hair cells, suggesting it has a role in the development and homeostasis of hair cells. We used a functional study to demonstrate that the SMAC/DIABLO(S71L) mutant, while retaining the proapoptotic function, triggers significant degradation of both wild-type and mutant SMAC/DIABLO and renders host mitochondria susceptible to calcium-induced loss of the membrane potential. Our work identifies DFNA64 as the human genetic disorder associated with SMAC/DIABLO malfunction and suggests that mutant SMAC/DIABLO(S71L) might cause mitochondrial dysfunction.","dc:creator":"Cheng J","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Functional mutation of SMAC/DIABLO, encoding a mitochondrial proapoptotic protein, causes human progressive hearing loss DFNA64."},"rdfs:label":"Cheng Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b34fe332-355e-4a60-879a-31ebd1bd7bd9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:606c624a-843e-4e03-ae0f-a2f9ed252beb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Could explain progressive hearing loss phenotype","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10929711","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report here the identification of a novel protein, Smac, which promotes caspase activation in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 3 missense variants have been reported in humans. DIABLO was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2011 (Cheng et al. 2011; PMID: 21722859). Association is seen in at least 2 probands in  publications (PMIDs: 21722859, 26969326). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 17 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 12/19/2017. It was reevaluated on 9/21/2021 (SOP v8). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. Although new literature was published (PMID: 26969326), the scoring still corresponded to a limited gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f5903c3b-b2d7-4c14-b196-37533187d807"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
