The complexity and heterogeneity of the disease make diagnosis difficult. Although the genetic origin of PCD is clear, mutations in only five genes have been associated with the disease, and, to date, no disease-causing gene has been identified. Recently, low levels of AK7 gene expression have been linked to PCD. This study was designed to determine the mutational status of the AK7 gene in 31 PCD (17 PCD and 14 Kartagener syndrome diagnosed) patients compared with 40 healthy volunteers. We also determined the AK7 sequence in two families with members with PCD and investigated ciliary activity and ciliogenesis in one patient with a mutation in AK7.","dc:creator":"Mata

cilia and sperm flagella share an extremely conserved microtubule-based cytoskeleton, called the axoneme, which sustains beating and motility of both organelles. Ultra-structural and/or functional defects of this axoneme are well-known to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, chronic otitis media, situs inversus, male infertility and in most severe cases, hydrocephalus. Only recently, mutations in genes encoding axonemal proteins with preferential expression in the testis were identified in isolated male infertility; in those cases, individuals displayed severe asthenozoospermia due to Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the sperm Flagella (MMAF) but not PCD features. In this study, we performed genetic investigation of two siblings presenting MMAF without any respiratory PCD features, and we report the identification of the c.2018T > G (p.Leu673Pro) transversion in AK7, encoding an adenylate kinase, expressed in ciliated tissues and testis. By performing transcript and protein analyses of biological samples from individual carrying the transversion, we demonstrate that this mutation leads to the loss of AK7 protein in sperm cells but not in respiratory ciliated cells, although both cell types carry the mutated transcript and no tissue-specific isoforms were detected. This work therefore, supports the notion that proteins shared by both cilia and sperm flagella may have specific properties and/or function in each organelle, in line with the differences in their mode of assembly and organization. Overall, this work identifies a novel genetic cause of asthenozoospermia due to MMAF and suggests that in humans, more deleterious mutations of AK7 might induce PCD.","dc:creator":"Lorès P","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Homozygous missense mutation L673P in adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) leads to primary male infertility and multiple morphological anomalies of the flagella but not to primary ciliary dyskinesia."}},"rdfs:label":"Individual II-1"},{"id":"cggv:8e559675-f41b-4aa4-b87d-e6db08066dd4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8e559675-f41b-4aa4-b87d-e6db08066dd4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Mild rhinosinusitis are the only respiratory sign observed in this patient.

Mutations in PCD patients have been identified in a heterogeneous group of genes normally expressed in cilia and/or sperm flagella (PMID: 33279404).\n \nThe *AK7* (Adenylate kinase 7) gene was first reported in PCD patients in 2012 (PMID: 22801010), and in association with Spermatogenic failure 27 (MONDO:0054731, OMIM: 617965), in 2018 (PMID: 29365104).\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group and due to the differences in molecular mechanism and the phenotypic variability, the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP working group estimated that PCD (MONDO: 0016575) and Spermatogenic failure 27 (MONDO:0054731) represent distinct diseases and decided to split the entities.\nEvidence from four probands (PMID: 22801010 and PMID: 29365104) is included in this curation. However, in three patients, only a heterozygous mutation was detected (PMID: 22801010), and in the fourth patient mild respiratory signs, normal ciliary beating and normal ultrastructure were observed.  Therefore, the score of the genetic evidence is downgraded to zero.\n\nAK7 is phosphotransferase that catalyzes the interconversion of nucleoside phosphates. This reaction provides energy for cellular processes requiring a stable supply of ATP, such as ciliary beating. The AK7 protein has a WcaG motif near the N terminus, followed by an AK domain and a C-terminal DPY30 motif. The WcaG motif is a signature of some prokaryotic nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerases, and the DPY30 is a protein oligomerization motif.\n  \nThe expression pattern of *AK7* is similar to PCD-related genes which are particularly expressed in ciliated epithelia and sperm flagella (PMID: 25613900).\n\nIn human nasal epithelial cell culture, Knockdown of* AK7* using siRNA caused a reduced *AK7* mRNA and protein levels and a decreased ciliary beat frequency (PMID: 20537283).\n*Ak7* knockout mice (Ak7 -/-) were generated by the insertion of a 4.5 kb transgene in the intron 5 of the AK7 gene (PMID: 18776131). No* Ak7* expression was detected in homozygous transgenic mice.\n\n(Ak7 -/-) mice showed growth retardation, hydrocephalus, and PCD signs, including airway dilatation and thickening of airway walls, and excess of mucus in the paranasal sinuses.\nMale Ak7 -/- mice were infertile. They lacked mature spermatids and spermatozoa, and electron microscopy showed abnormal sperm heads and absence of tail structures.\n\nElectron microscopy analysis of airway epithelial cells revealed reduced number of motile cilia, and cilia showed axonemes with central complex defect and microtubules disorganization. Using video microscopy, cilia of the airway epithelial cells showed a significantly reduced ciliary beat frequency (PMID: 18776131).\nSimilar results were reported in (PMID: 21746835).\n\nIn the patient reported in (PMID: 29365104), the expression of *AK7* was only altered in sperm. Compared to control, a normal expression pattern of *AK7* was observed in the patient’s airway epithelial cells. This experimental evidence **contradicts** the association of *AK7* with PCD.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *AK7* and autosomal recessive PCD has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *AK7* plays in this disease.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on March 9, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\nVariants in AK7 were reported in three heterozygous patients and only one homozygous patient with clinical features of PCD. However, there is no functional data supporting the association of AK7 variants to PCD. No valid experimental evidence remains to support this curation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8d34669e-fef4-49fb-97af-be7b5c6bea2d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
