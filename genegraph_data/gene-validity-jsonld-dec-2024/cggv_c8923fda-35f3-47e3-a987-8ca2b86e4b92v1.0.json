specification and differentiation of neurons often continue to be expressed in the adult brain, but remarkably little is known about their late functions. Nurr1, one such transcription factor, is essential for early differentiation of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons but continues to be expressed into adulthood. In Parkinson's disease, Nurr1 expression is diminished and mutations in the Nurr1 gene have been identified in rare cases of disease; however, the significance of these observations remains unclear. Here, a mouse strain for conditional targeting of the Nurr1 gene was generated, and Nurr1 was ablated either at late stages of mDA neuron development by crossing with mice carrying Cre under control of the dopamine transporter locus or in the adult brain by transduction of adeno-associated virus Cre-encoding vectors. Nurr1 deficiency in maturing mDA neurons resulted in rapid loss of striatal DA, loss of mDA neuron markers, and neuron degeneration. In contrast, a more slowly progressing loss of striatal DA and mDA neuron markers was observed after ablation in the adult brain. As in Parkinson's disease, neurons of the substantia nigra compacta were more vulnerable than cells in the ventral tegmental area when Nurr1 was ablated at late embryogenesis. The results show that developmental pathways play key roles for the maintenance of terminally differentiated neurons and suggest that disrupted function of Nurr1 and other developmental transcription factors may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.","dc:creator":"Kadkhodaei B","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Nurr1 is required for maintenance of maturing and adult midbrain dopamine neurons."},"rdfs:label":"NR4A2 KO: Conditional Gene Targeting of Dopamine Neurons"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded to 1 point because the mouse model only has loss of NR4A2 in dopamine neurons, and therefore only models with the dystonia parkinsonism phenotype associated with variants in NR4A2."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3297,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d103e785-563c-4f02-90f8-16ef42f8bf06","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100038","gene":"hgnc:7981","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Genomic loss of NR4A2 was first reported in relation to complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2013 (PMID: 23554088). Affected individuals present with developmental delays, language impairment, intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and ataxia, with dystonia. Parkinsonism is also reported in early adulthood in some individuals (PMID: 31922365). To date, 8 unique de novo variants predicted to cause loss of function of the protein have been reported. Multiple de novo missense variants in the DNA binding domain of the protein have also been described in affected individuals in the literature (PMIDs: 30504930, 32366965). In addition to SNVs and indels, whole-gene deletions involving only NR4A2 have also been identified (PMIDs: 28544326, 29770430). This gene is intolerant to loss-of- function variants, as indicated by its pLI score of 1 in gnomAD (v2.1.1). This gene-disease relationship is supported by mouse models with conditional gene targeting showing loss of striatal dopamine neurons, neuron degeneration, and impaired motor function (PMID: 20016108).
