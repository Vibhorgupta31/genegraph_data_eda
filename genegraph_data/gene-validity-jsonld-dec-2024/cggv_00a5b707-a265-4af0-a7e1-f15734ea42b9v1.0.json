The sl and ls phenotypes are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the Endothelin-B receptor (Ednrb) and Endothelin 3 (Edn3), respectively. The identification of Sox10 as the gene mutated in Dom mice (B.H. et al., manuscript submitted) prompted us to analyse the role of its human homologue SOX10 in neural crest defects. Here we show that patients from four families with WS4 have mutations in SOX10, whereas no mutation could be detected in patients with HSCR alone. These mutations are likely to result in haploinsufficiency of the SOX10 product.

Three disease-causing genes have been identified so far for WS4: EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10. SOX10 mutations, found in 45-55% of WS4 patients, are inherited in autosomal dominant way. In addition, mutations in SOX10 are also responsible for an extended syndrome involving peripheral and central neurological phenotypes, referred to as PCWH (peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central dysmyelinating leucodystrophy, Waardenburg syndrome, Hirschsprung disease). Such mutations are mostly private, and a high intra- and inter-familial variability exists. In this report, we present a patient with WS4 and a second with PCWH due to SOX10 mutations supporting again the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of these syndromes. Interestingly, the WS4 family carries an insertion of 19 nucleotides in exon 5 of SOX10, which results in distinct phenotypes along three different generations: hypopigmentation in the maternal grandmother, hearing loss in the mother, and WS4 in the proband. Since mosaicism cannot explain the three different related-WS features observed in this family, we propose as the most plausible explanation the existence of additional molecular events, acting in an additive or multiplicative fashion, in genes or regulatory regions unidentified so far. On the other hand, the PCWH case was due to a de novo deletion in exon 5 of the gene. Efforts should be devoted to unravel the mechanisms underlying the intrafamilial phenotypic variability observed in the families affected, and to identify new genes responsible for the still unsolved WS4 cases.","dc:creator":"Fernández RM","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Waardenburg syndrome type 4: report of two new cases caused by SOX10 mutations in Spain."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24311220","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD."},{"id":"cggv:5ab26000-7daa-4998-9ad5-dd0510c1445c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c2eed18-01fb-4352-b7b6-a91c75e5a44b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"PCR sequencing for SOX10, EDN3 and EDNRB","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002251","obo:HP_0001100","obo:HP_0008625"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:5ab26000-7daa-4998-9ad5-dd0510c1445c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4e072bc6-e9b2-4c24-a545-6dd1625e30d8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006941.3(SOX10):c.470C>T (p.Ala157Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7408"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18348274","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"","dc:creator":"Morín M","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"A de novo missense mutation in the gene encoding the SOX10 transcription factor in a Spanish sporadic case of Waardenburg syndrome type IV."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18348274","rdfs:label":"Morin Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Absent from gnomAD, confirmed absent from parents"},{"id":"cggv:3dbd0830-cab1-448a-b719-dd8aec342d75_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34030af2-406d-46fe-9459-fc28ba7b5718","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Tested for SOX10, PAX3, EDN3, EDNRB and MITF","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"chronic bowel problems, reduced number of ganglia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000635","obo:HP_0008619","obo:HP_0011476","obo:HP_0002286"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3dbd0830-cab1-448a-b719-dd8aec342d75_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:01932fdb-a1a0-4d7b-a8d6-daf13c940d04","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006941.3(SOX10):c.249C>G (p.Tyr83Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7394"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9462749"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9462749","rdfs:label":"Proband 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"absent from gnomAD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:00a5b707-a265-4af0-a7e1-f15734ea42b9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00a5b707-a265-4af0-a7e1-f15734ea42b9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b475dac-57fb-4268-bc16-b63e0d0c73b7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:32542fa1-c6dc-4c74-a9d1-45cff2817edf","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Sox10 expression was detected in the cochlear lateral wall of young adult mice and in the human cochlea, including the lateral wall, organ of Corti, and auditory nerve.

Previous studies have shown that presbyacusis is associated with a loss of non-sensory cells in the cochlear lateral wall. Sox10 is a transcription factor crucial to the development and maintenance of neural crest-derived cells including some non-sensory cell types in the cochlea. Mutations of the Sox10 gene are known to cause various combinations of hearing loss and pigmentation defects in humans. This study investigated the potential relationship between Sox10 gene expression and pathological changes in the cochlear lateral wall of aged CBA/CaJ mice and human temporal bones from older donors. Cochlear tissues prepared from young adult (1-3 month-old) and aged (2-2.5 year-old) mice, and human temporal bone donors were examined using quantitative immunohistochemical analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Cells expressing Sox10 were present in the stria vascularis, outer sulcus and spiral prominence in mouse and human cochleas. The Sox10(+) cell types included marginal and intermediate cells and outer sulcus cells, including those that border the scala media and those extending into root processes (root cells) in the spiral ligament. Quantitative analysis of immunostaining revealed a significant decrease in the number of Sox10(+) marginal cells and outer sulcus cells in aged mice. Electron microscopic evaluation revealed degenerative alterations in the surviving Sox10(+) cells in aged mice. Strial marginal cells in human cochleas from donors aged 87 and older showed only weak immunostaining for Sox10. Decreases in Sox10 expression levels and a loss of Sox10(+) cells in both mouse and human aged ears suggests an important role of Sox10 in the maintenance of structural and functional integrity of the lateral wall. A loss of Sox10(+) cells may also be associated with a decline in the repair capabilities of non-sensory cells in the aged ear.","dc:creator":"Hao X","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Sox10 expressing cells in the lateral wall of the aged mouse and human cochlea."},"rdfs:label":"Hao Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded for human expression information"},{"id":"cggv:93351100-bbd1-4341-8d17-e4feae2b2815","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:502f706e-841e-4725-8d01-28211b8115a7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Sox10 and Pax3 physically interacted in immunoprecipitation experiments.

Neural crest cells are pluripotent progenitors and the mechanisms by which specific cell-fate decisions are regulated have emerged as an important field of study. Many neurocristopathies are characterized by defects in melanocyte differentiation that can result in pigmentation abnormalities and deafness. One example is Waardenburg syndrome that can be caused by mutations in the PAX3, SOX10 or MITF genes. Other neural crest-related disorders are associated with enteric ganglia defects, such as those caused by mutations in the SOX10 or c-RET genes. The Pax3 and Sox10 transcription factors can directly regulate both MITF and c-RET. Here, we show that Pax3 and Sox10 can physically interact and we map the interaction domains. We show that this interaction contributes to Pax3 and Sox10 synergistic activation of a conserved c-RET enhancer and it explains why Sox10 mutants that cannot bind to DNA retain the ability to activate this enhancer in the presence of Pax3. However, in the context of the MITF gene, Pax3 and Sox10 must each bind independently to DNA in order to achieve synergy. This difference is consistent with the different structures of the c-RET and MITF enhancers, and the different mechanisms by which Pax3 binds to these enhancers. These observations explain the phenotype in the mild form of Yemenite deaf-blind syndrome caused by specific SOX10 mutations in the HMG box that abrogate DNA binding without disrupting association with Pax3.","dc:creator":"Lang D","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Sox10 and Pax3 physically interact to mediate activation of a conserved c-RET enhancer."},"rdfs:label":"Lang Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:676cd0c0-3379-4663-9dac-6715ad473f7f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54200bd8-c759-4189-9024-5dd87cfc703c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Strong biochemical explanation of Waardenburg phenotype","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10982026","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is associated with neural crest-derived melanocyte deficiency caused by mutations in either one of three transcription factors: MITF, PAX3, and SOX10.

Subsets of HSCR individuals also present with neural crest-derived melanocyte deficiencies (Hirschsprung-Waardenburg, HSCR-WS, MIM #277580). Murine models have been instrumental in the identification and analysis of HSCR disease genes. These include mice with deficiencies of endothelin B receptor (Ednrb(s-l); refs 1,2) endothelin 3 (Edn3(ls): refs 1,3) the tyrosine kinase receptor cRet and glial-derived neurotrophic factor. Another mouse model of HSCR disease, Dom, arose spontaneously at the Jackson Laboratory. While Dom/+ heterozygous mice display regional deficiencies of neural crest-derived enteric ganglia in the distal colon, Dom/Dom homozygous animals are embryonic lethal. We have determined that premature termination of Sox10, a member of the SRY-like HMG box family of transcription factors, is responsible for absence of the neural crest derivatives in Dom mice. We demonstrate expression of Sox10 in normal neural crest cells, disrupted expression of both Sox10 and the HSCR disease gene Ednrb in Dom mutant embryos, and loss of neural crest derivatives due to apoptosis. Our studies suggest that Sox10 is essential for proper peripheral nervous system development. We propose SOX10 as a candidate disease gene for individuals with HSCR whose disease does not have an identified genetic origin.","dc:creator":"Southard-Smith EM","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Sox10 mutation disrupts neural crest development in Dom Hirschsprung mouse model."},"rdfs:label":"Southard-Smith Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded because phenotyping was limited to Hirschprung phenotype.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 8 variants (missense, nonsense, insertions, deletions) have been reported in humans. SOX10 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1998 (Pingault et al.). Association is seen in at least 9 probands, 8 of which are de novo, in 6 publications (9462749, 18348274, 27863645, 24735604, 27240497, 24311220). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by relevant experimental evidence including animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and protein interactions. In summary, SOX10 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Waardenburg syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/19/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:00a5b707-a265-4af0-a7e1-f15734ea42b9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
