The substitution disrupts the TfR1 internalization motif, resulting in defective receptor endocytosis and markedly increased TfR1 expression on the cell surface. Iron citrate rescued the lymphocyte defects, and expression of wild-type but not mutant TfR1 rescued impaired transferrin uptake in patient-derived fibroblasts. Tfrc(Y20H/Y20H) mice recapitulated the immunological defects of patients. Despite the critical role of TfR1 in erythrocyte development and function, patients had only mild anemia and only slightly increased TfR1 expression in erythroid precursors. We show that STEAP3, a metalloreductase expressed in erythroblasts, associates with TfR1 and partially rescues transferrin uptake in patient-derived fibroblasts, suggesting that STEAP3 may provide an accessory TfR1 endocytosis signal that spares patients from severe anemia. These findings demonstrate the importance of TfR1 in adaptive immunity.

Diferric Trf interacts with cell-surface Trf receptor (Trfr) to undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis into specialized endosomes. Endosomal acidification leads to iron release, and iron is transported out of the endosome through the activity of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, formerly Nramp2), a transmembrane iron transporter that functions only at low pH. Trf and Trfr then return to the cell surface for reuse, completing a highly efficient cycle. Although the Trf cycle is assumed to be the general mechanism for cellular iron uptake, this has not been validated experimentally. Mice with hypotransferrinaemia (hpx) have little or no plasma Trf. They have severe anaemia, indicating that the Trf cycle is essential for iron uptake by erythroid cells. Other hpx tissues, however, are generally normal, and there is a paradoxical increase in intestinal iron absorption and iron storage. To test the hypothesis that the Trf cycle has unique importance for erythropoiesis, we disrupted the Trfr gene in mice. This results in elimination of the Trf cycle, but leaves other Trf functions intact. Mice lacking Trfr have a more severe phenotype than hpx mice, affecting both erythropoiesis and neurologic development. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency for Trfr results in impaired erythroid development and abnormal iron homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Levy JE","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Transferrin receptor is necessary for development of erythrocytes and the nervous system."},"rdfs:label":"Null Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:87fd01ab-b451-48e7-a32b-ecca2a0a40ec","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c03c721-78c3-4ac0-9aad-f18e775f1e28","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"I don't think this mouse model phenotype is similar enough to humans to score.

Iron deficiency anemia results in an array of pathologies, including reduced systemic iron bioavailability and abnormal erythrocyte physiology; however, the mechanisms by which these pathologies influence malaria infection are not well defined. In the present study, the response to malaria infection was examined in a mutant mouse line, Tfrc(MRI24910), identified during an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) screen. This line carries a missense mutation in the gene for transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). Heterozygous mice exhibited reduced erythrocyte volume and density, a phenotype consistent with dietary iron deficiency anemia. However, unlike the case in dietary deficiency, the erythrocyte half-life, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and intraerythrocytic ferritin content were unchanged. Systemic iron bioavailability was also unchanged, indicating that this mutation results in erythrocytic iron deficiency without significantly altering overall iron homeostasis. When infected with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi adami, mice displayed increased parasitemia and succumbed to infection more quickly than their wild-type littermates. Transfusion of fluorescently labeled erythrocytes into malaria parasite-infected mice demonstrated an erythrocyte-autonomous enhanced survival of parasites within mutant erythrocytes. Together, these results indicate that TFR1 deficiency alters erythrocyte physiology in a way that is similar to dietary iron deficiency anemia, albeit to a lesser degree, and that this promotes intraerythrocytic parasite survival and an increased susceptibility to malaria in mice. These findings may have implications for the management of iron deficiency in the context of malaria.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data,  and experimental data. One missense variant has been reported in 7 probands, in two publications (PMID 26642240, 32851577). This variant segregated with disease in 7 additional family members. All reported affected individuals were of Arab descent and two were shown to share a haplotype. Symptoms include recurrent sinopulomany infections, chronic diarrhea, recurrent epistaxis secondary to thrombocytopenia, mild anemia, and immunodeficiency. Heterozygous carriers were reported to be unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by murine models, functional alteration and rescue experiments in patient cells, in vitro assays showing the gene product performs a biochemical function consistent with the phenotype, and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMID: 3568132, 6265934, 10192390, 26642240). Patient cells homozygous for the Y20H variant showed defective transferrin uptake and transduction of wild type TfR1 corrected defective transferrin uptake (PMID 26642240). TFRC null mice are embryonic lethal while Tfrc Y20H/Y20H mice had significantly decreased serum IgG, hemoglobin, and MCV compared to controls, as well as impaired receptor internalization on T and B cells (PMID: 26642240, 10192390). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\nWorking group agreed to keep as moderate since only one variant has been reported to cause disease.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5d4f6437-081d-41e9-992a-afb73b72ef3b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
