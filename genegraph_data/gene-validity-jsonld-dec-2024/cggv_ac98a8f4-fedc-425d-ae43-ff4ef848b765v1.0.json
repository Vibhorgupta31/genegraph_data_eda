Additionally, we studied two patients from Algerian and Pakistani ancestry and the parents of the first Jewish patients reported.(1) Using a homozygosity mapping strategy, we located a candidate region on chromosome 1q23 spanning 2.4 Mb. The position of the Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2) gene within the candidate region and the similarity of the ddr2 knockout mouse to the SMED patients' phenotype prompted us to study this gene(6). We identified three missense mutations c.2254 C > T [R752C], c. 2177 T > G [I726R], c.2138C > T [T713I] and one splice site mutation [IVS17+1g > a] in the conserved sequence encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the DDR2 gene.

Recently, three missense mutations and one splice-site mutation in the DDR2 gene were identified as causative genetic defects for SMED-SL, but the underlying cellular and biochemical mechanisms were not explored. Here we report a novel DDR2 missense mutation, c.337G>A (p.E113K), that causes SMED-SL in two siblings in the United Arab Emirates. Another DDR2 missense mutation, c.2254C>T (p.R752C), matching one of the previously reported SMED-SL mutations, was found in a second affected family. DDR2 is a plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinase that functions as a collagen receptor. We expressed DDR2 constructs with the identified point mutations in human cell lines and evaluated their localization and functional properties. We found that all SMED-SL missense mutants were defective in collagen-induced receptor activation and that the three previously reported mutants (p.T713I, p.I726R and p.R752C) were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The novel mutant (p.E113K), in contrast, trafficked normally, like wild-type DDR2, but failed to bind collagen. This finding is in agreement with our recent structural data identifying Glu113 as an important amino acid in the DDR2 ligand-binding site. Our data thus demonstrate that SMED-SL can result from at least two different loss-of-function mechanisms: namely defects in DDR2 targeting to the plasma membrane or the loss of its ligand-binding activity.","dc:creator":"Ali BR","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Trafficking defects and loss of ligand binding are the underlying causes of all reported DDR2 missense mutations found in SMED-SL

The peptide sequence that bound DDR2 with highest affinity interestingly contained the sequence for the high affinity binding site for von Willebrand factor in collagen III. Focusing on this sequence, we used a set of truncated and alanine-substituted peptides to characterize the sequence GVMGFO (O is hydroxyproline) as the minimal collagen sequence required for DDR2 binding. Based on a recent NMR analysis of the DDR2 collagen binding domain, we generated a model of the DDR2-collagen interaction that explains why a triple-helical conformation is required for binding. Triple-helical peptides comprising the DDR2 binding motif not only inhibited DDR2 binding to collagen II but also activated DDR2 transmembrane signaling.

The protein is involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling. Variants in DDR2 have been associated with multiple disorders: spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia-short limb-abnormal calcification syndrome (MONDO:0010077) and Warburg-Cinotti syndrome (MONDO:0032579). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found sufficient differences in heritability and phenotype to support splitting these disorders into two distinct disease entities. The role of DDR2 in autosomal dominant Warburg-Cinotti syndrome (MONDO:0032579) has been curated separately.\nDDR2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia-short limb-abnormal calcification syndrome (SMED-SL/AC) in 2009 after homozygosity mapping of three unrelated individuals with a clinical diagnosis of SMED-SL/AC (Bargal et al., PMID: 19110212). Since then several families have been identified with homozygous DDR2 mutations (missense, truncating, and splice site variants) and a clinical diagnosis of SMED-SL/AC. This curation includes 10 variants across 16 families and seven publications (PMID: 19110212, Ali et al., 2010, PMID: 20223752, Al-Kindi et al., 2014, PMID 24725993, Gupta et al., 2019, PMID 31406622, Heidari et al., 2021, PMID 33953858, Urel-Demir et al., 2018, PMID 29884795, Gulec et al., 2022, PMID 35221872). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function with supporting functional evidence of 5 patient variants (4 missense and 1 frameshift) showing defective kinase phosphorylation. Included in the modeled patient variants is a p.Arg752Cys founder variant, which was the originally identified variant by homozygosity mapping and ultimately found in all affected individuals across more than six families. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by several mouse models (Labrador et al., 2001, PMID: 11375938), expression studies, and protein interaction studies (Konitsiotis et al., 2008, PMID: 18201965) demonstrating an essential role for DDR2 in skeletal growth and chondrocyte function.\nIn summary, DDR2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia-short limb-abnormal calcification syndrome (SMED-SL/AC). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 10/21/2022 (SOP Version 9.0).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ac98a8f4-fedc-425d-ae43-ff4ef848b765"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
