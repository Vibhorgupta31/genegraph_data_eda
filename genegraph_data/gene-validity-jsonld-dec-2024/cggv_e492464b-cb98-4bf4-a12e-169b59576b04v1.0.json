This destruction proceeds in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in cells with significantly increased rates of oxygen consumption and ATP production. The delivery of R.XmaI to mitochondria is accompanied by improvement in the ability to utilize galactose as the sole carbon source, which is a surrogate indicator of the proficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. Concurrently, the rate of lactic acid production by these cells, which is a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction, decreases. We further demonstrate that levels of phosphorylated P53 and gammaH2ax proteins, markers of nuclear DNA damage, do not change in response to infection with recombinant adenovirus indicating the absence of nuclear DNA damage and the relative safety of the technique.

We found that an equivalent of the T9185C mutation partially impaired the functioning of yeast ATP synthase, with only a 30% deficit in mitochondrial ATP production. An equivalent of the mutation T9191C had much more severe effects, with a nearly complete block in yeast Atp6p assembly and an >95% drop in the rate of ATP synthesis.

We have introduced this mutation at the corresponding position (183) of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrially encoded Atp6p. The \"yeast NARP mutant\" grew very slowly on respiratory substrates, possibly because mitochondrial ATP synthesis was only 10% of the wild type level. The mutated ATP synthase was found to be correctly assembled and present at nearly normal levels (80% of the wild type). Contrary to what has been reported for human NARP cells, the reverse functioning of the ATP synthase, i.e. ATP hydrolysis in the F(1) coupled to F(0)-mediated proton translocation out of the mitochondrial matrix, was significantly compromised in the yeast NARP mutant. Interestingly, the oxygen consumption rate in the yeast NARP mutant was decreased by about 80% compared with the wild type, due to a selective lowering in cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) content.

However, there are three major concerns: (i) that there is variation in mutant loads among tissues; (ii) that the mutant load in a tissue may change over time; and (iii) that the genotype-phenotype correlation is not clearly understood. We have used the 13 pedigrees to determine specifically the extent of tissue- and age-related variation of the two mutations at nucleotide 8993 in the mitochondrial DNA. The tissue variation was investigated by analysing two or more different tissues from a total of 18 individuals. The age-related variation of the mutation was investigated by comparing the amount of both mutations in blood taken at birth and at a later age. No substantial tissue variation was found, nor was there any substantial change in the proportion of either mutation over periods of 8-23 years in the four individuals studied. In addition, we noted that two features were remarkably common in families with nucleotide 8993 mutations, namely (i) unexplained infant death (8 cases in 13 pedigrees); and (ii) de novo mutations (5 of the 10 8993T > G pedigrees).","dc:creator":"White SL","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mitochondrial DNA mutations at nucleotide 8993 show a lack of tissue- or age-related variation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10604142","rdfs:label":"Family 4; Individual IV:1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 for known pathogenic variant; 0.5 for segregation"},{"id":"cggv:df174616-d725-4a04-8a7d-b8ede57ba446_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5e8000ea-f734-4e0d-b169-2ffdfd85e23d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"phenotypeFreeText":"LS on CT scan and autopsy; onset 6 months\nCSF lactate: 3.1; 5.4\nPlasma lactate: 2.0 to 5.6\n\nm.8993T>G: 99% in proband (in 3+ tissues)\nmother: 0% in blood\nAlthough appears de novo, maternal family history of several individuals with unexplained infant death\n\n","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:df174616-d725-4a04-8a7d-b8ede57ba446_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:236f3381-67d7-473a-a84c-fc1d5bd294e5"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10604142"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10604142","rdfs:label":"Family 3; Individual IV:2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 for known pathogenic variant; 0.5 for segregation"},{"id":"cggv:a019b0f3-f41f-4363-814f-869fa1125b30_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64f8a0fb-07d8-4f12-bdce-12cca2f2eb48","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"phenotypeFreeText":"Generally healthy boy until 3 years old:\nURI - became ataxic then recovered; normal brain CT and EEG\n\n4 years old:\nFebrile illness, became progressively lethargic, developed metabolic acidosis and recurrent apnea; neuro exam revealed lethargic/motionless, diffuse hypotonia, areflexia, bilateral Babinski sign\n\nDeteriorated, ventilator-dependent, lost brainstem reflex activities; had repeated episodes of apnea, and died 1 month after admission.\n\nMildly elevated blood and CSF lactate. \n\nBrain CT: symmetrical hypodensities iin basal ganglia and, later, also the periventricular and periaqueductal areas, the internal capsule, and the brain peduncles. \n\nBrain MRI: bilateral T1 and T2 signal increases involving the basal ganglia, thalamus, periaqueductal and periventricular regions, and posterior cords of medulla. \n\nMuscle biopsy: mild nonspecific atrophy of both type I and type II fibers, no RRF, normla SDH and COX stain; normal RC activities\n\nAutopsy: characteristic findings of LS - bilateral cystic lesions in basal ganglia, thalamus,  periventricular region, substantia nigra, and tectal and tegmental brainstem.

The MT-ATP6 gene encodes the ATP synthase (complex V) subunit 6. Defects of this protein lead to complex V deficiency.\n\nThe MT-ATP6 gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1992 (PMID: 1550128). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 6 variants in 18 cases (2 with m.8851T>C, 1 with m.8993T>C, 9 with m.8993T>G, 4 with m.9176T>C, 1 with m.9185T>C, and 1 with m.9191T>C) from 12 publications (PMIDs: 9270604, 11245730, 17352390, 8554662, 9501263, 23206802, 7603783, 16217706, 1456751, 1550128, 7668837, 10604142). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants. Variants in the MT-ATP6 gene are associated with other mitochondrial phenotypes, including Neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and spinocerebellar ataxia (PMID: 30763462). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, expression, functional alterations in patient cells, rescue in human cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 19160410, 18256697, 24316278, 17855363). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e492464b-cb98-4bf4-a12e-169b59576b04"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
