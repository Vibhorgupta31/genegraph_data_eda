Interactions between C3b–FH and FI contribute, either directly or indirectly, to stabilization of the catalytic SP domain of FI and hence induce proteolytic activity to the enzyme.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671664","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The complement system labels microbes and host debris for clearance. Degradation of surface-bound C3b is pivotal to direct immune responses and protect host cells. How the serine protease factor I (FI), assisted by regulators, cleaves either two or three distant peptide bonds in the CUB domain of C3b remains unclear. We present a crystal structure of C3b in complex with FI and regulator factor H (FH; domains 1-4 with 19-20). FI binds C3b-FH between FH domains 2 and 3 and a reoriented C3b C-terminal domain and docks onto the first scissile bond, while stabilizing its catalytic domain for proteolytic activity. One cleavage in C3b does not affect its overall structure, whereas two cleavages unfold CUB and dislodge the thioester-containing domain (TED), affecting binding of regulators and thereby determining the number of cleavages. These data explain how FI generates late-stage opsonins iC3b or C3dg in a context-dependent manner, to react to foreign, danger or healthy self signals.","dc:creator":"Xue X","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Regulator-dependent mechanisms of C3b processing by factor I allow differentiation of immune responses."},"rdfs:label":"Interaction with FH"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:33c9bb4d-a60d-408c-be1f-c6581a3167c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:125b9ae4-71e0-4487-8ec9-28cfc50c0fd3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The inability to drive opsonization directly contributes to aHUS.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671664","rdfs:label":"FI-mediated cleavage"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3a5fcd7c-0da5-4ba3-b0c6-2d40f985c418_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6577,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f1ebfc76-3a5d-40f0-8dbe-37cfecc338c6","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016244","gene":"hgnc:5394","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CFI was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in 2004 (Fremeaux-Bacchi et al., PMID: 15173250). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following diseases have been split into separate entities, aHUS (OMIM: 612923) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) (OMIM: 610984). The split curation for autosomal dominant C3G will be conducted separately. Thirteen variants (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in thirteen probands in four publications (PMIDs: 15173250, 15917334, 17597211, 20016463) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function, causing dysregulation of the complement mediated immune pathway. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical functions indicating the role of CFI in the complement pathway and protein interaction with CFH (PMID: 28671664). Of note, enrichment of CFI rare genetic variants has been demonstrated in aHUS in two studies using burden type testing (PMIDs: 29500241, 30377230). It should also be noted that a recent analysis of the genotyping data from UK biobank aimed to identify CFI variants that are known to result in low levels of factor I and identified no cases of aHUS with any of the 1,671 type 1 variants, demonstrating very low penetrance for CFI. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CFI and autosomal dominant aHUS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement Mediated Kidney Diseases GCEP on the meeting date June 1, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3a5fcd7c-0da5-4ba3-b0c6-2d40f985c418"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
