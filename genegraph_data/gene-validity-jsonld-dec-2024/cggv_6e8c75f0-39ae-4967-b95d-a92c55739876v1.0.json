Although research into the genetic causes of ID has recently gained momentum, identification of pathogenic mutations that cause autosomal recessive ID (ARID) has lagged behind, predominantly due to non-availability of sizeable families. Here we present the results of exome sequencing in 121 large consanguineous Pakistani ID families. In 60 families, we identified homozygous or compound heterozygous DNA variants in a single gene, 30 affecting reported ID genes and 30 affecting novel candidate ID genes. Potential pathogenicity of these alleles was supported by co-segregation with the phenotype, low frequency in control populations and the application of stringent bioinformatics analyses. In another eight families segregation of multiple pathogenic variants was observed, affecting 19 genes that were either known or are novel candidates for ID. Transcriptome profiles of normal human brain tissues showed that the novel candidate ID genes formed a network significantly enriched for transcriptional co-expression (P<0.0001) in the frontal cortex during fetal development and in the temporal-parietal and sub-cortex during infancy through adulthood. In addition, proteins encoded by 12 novel ID genes directly interact with previously reported ID proteins in six known pathways essential for cognitive function (P<0.0001). These results suggest that disruptions of temporal parietal and sub-cortical neurogenesis during infancy are critical to the pathophysiology of ID. These findings further expand the existing repertoire of genes involved in ARID, and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms and the transcriptome map of ID.","dc:creator":"Riazuddin S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Exome sequencing of Pakistani consanguineous families identifies 30 novel candidate genes for recessive intellectual disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27457812","rdfs:label":"Riazuddin_2018 family PKMR85_ed"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Functional evidence supporting variant pathogenicity is not provided.

An analysis of cost and impact on treatment was also performed. A molecular diagnoses (pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants) was achieved in 59/180 patients (33%). Clinical management changed following WES findings in 23 of 59 diagnosed patients (39%) or 13% of all patients.

PMID 21868677). Though MED23 was initially associated with non-syndromic intellectual disability, as the number of probands reported in the literature has increased, a consistent phenotypic profile has been appreciated among reported probands, including early onset epilepsy, spasticity, microcephaly and, less frequently, delayed myelination and thin corpus callosum. For this reason, syndromic intellectual disability was selected as the disease entity for MED23 curation. The gene disease relationship is supported by case-level, segregation and experimental data. Variants in MED23 have been reported in 11 affected individuals from 6 unrelated families, 4 with homozygous missense variants and 2 with compound heterozygous variants in trans (a total of 1 nonsense and 7 missense variants) in 6 publications (PMIDs 21868677, 25845469, 27311965, 27457812, 30847200, 31164858). Variants in this gene segregate with disease in at least one family (PMID 21868677). It has been shown that loss of function variants in MED23 and other mediator complex subunits are linked to neurological disorders specifically through transcriptional dysregulation of target genes (PMID 21868677). Missense variants that are shown to result in protein loss of function through dysregulation of specific target genes expression in an assay using patient cells were scored equal to the number of points awarded to putative null variants. The gene-disease relationship is supported by a number of functional studies including non-human model organism (PMID 19417216), biochemical (PMID 11934987), and rescue experiments (PMID 21868677). In summary, the available evidence of gene-disease relationship is convincing due to phenotypic similarities observed in 4 of the families and in particular mutations in other genes encoding subunits of the Mediator kinase module (MED12, MED13, MED13L and CDK8: PMIDs 6711603, 17369503, 29740699, 24781760, 30905399) have been shown to be involved in ID/ASD, however, additional genetic and/or experimental data is needed to reach a score sufficient for classification of “Definitive”. Currently, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between MED23 with autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 4/1/20 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6e8c75f0-39ae-4967-b95d-a92c55739876"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
