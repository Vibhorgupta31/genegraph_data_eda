The predominance of autosomal-recessive causes allowed us to make several key observations. We highlight 155 genes that we propose to be recessive, disease-related candidates. We report additional mutational events in 64 previously reported candidates (40 recessive), and these events support their candidacy. We report recessive forms of genes that were previously associated only with dominant disorders and that have phenotypes ranging from consistent with to conspicuously distinct from the known dominant phenotypes. We also report homozygous loss-of-function events that can inform the genetics of complex diseases. We were also able to deduce the likely causal variant in most couples who presented after the loss of one or more children, but we lack samples from those children. Although a similar pattern of mostly recessive causes was observed in the prenatal setting, the higher proportion of loss-of-function events in these cases was notable. The allelic series presented by the wealth of recessive variants greatly expanded the phenotypic expression of the respective genes. We also make important observations about dominant disorders; these observations include the pattern of de novo variants, the identification of 74 candidate dominant, disease-related genes, and the potential confirmation of 21 previously reported candidates. Finally, we describe the influence of a predominantly autosomal-recessive landscape on the clinical utility of rapid sequencing (Flash Exome). Our cohort's genotypic and phenotypic data represent a unique resource that can contribute to improved variant interpretation through data sharing.","dc:creator":"Monies D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Lessons Learned from Large-Scale, First-Tier Clinical Exome Sequencing in a Highly Consanguineous Population."}},"rdfs:label":"17-3320"},{"id":"cggv:c9068e8e-9bab-4499-bf60-61f0caf0f5ae","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c9068e8e-9bab-4499-bf60-61f0caf0f5ae_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fe8021ab-13fc-43be-9141-9118ff324056","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c135a19-dcc3-444b-a104-87a956b5310f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Table 1 lists the pathogenic variants in the above genes involved in complex II deficiency.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33162331","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the smallest complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system, a tetramer of just 140Â kDa.

The *SDHAF1* gene encodes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) assembly factor 1. Defects of this protein have been associated with autosomal recessive complex II deficiency.\n\nThe *SDHAF1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2009 (PMID: 19465911), in one family with features consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) and in another family with leukoencephalopathy. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SDHAF1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SDHAF1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *SDHAF1* was previously curated by this GCEP on January 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7) as having a limited association with LSS. The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.  \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants (three missense, three stop-gained variants) from four publications (PMIDs: 19465911, 22995659, 31130284, 26642834). In addition to LSS and leukoencephalopathy, affected individuals also had spastic paraplegia, dystonia, failure to thrive, and sensorineural hearing loss. Muscle biopsies showed complex II deficiency.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, yeast knockdown showing complex II deficiency, and rescue of complex II activity in patient cells by wild-type protein (PMIDs: 19465911, 26749241, 33162331).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
