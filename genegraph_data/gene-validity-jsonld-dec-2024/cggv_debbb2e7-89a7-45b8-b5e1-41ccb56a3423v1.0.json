CD40 is the receptor for CD40 ligand (CD40L), a molecule predominantly expressed by activated CD4(+) T cells. CD40/CD40L interaction induces the formation of memory B lymphocytes and promotes Ig isotype switching, as demonstrated in mice knocked-out for either CD40L or CD40 gene, and in patients with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome, a disease caused by CD40L/TNFSF5 gene mutations. In the present study, we have identified three patients with an autosomal recessive form of hyper IgM who fail to express CD40 on the cell surface. Sequence analysis of CD40 genomic DNA showed that one patient carried a homozygous silent mutation at the fifth base pair position of exon 5, involving an exonic splicing enhancer and leading to exon skipping and premature termination; the other two patients showed a homozygous point mutation in exon 3, resulting in a cysteine to arginine substitution. These findings show that mutations of the CD40 gene cause an autosomal recessive form of hyper IgM, which is immunologically and clinically undistinguishable from the X-linked form.","dc:creator":"Ferrari S","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations of CD40 gene cause an autosomal recessive form of immunodeficiency with hyper IgM."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:debbb2e7-89a7-45b8-b5e1-41ccb56a3423_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:debbb2e7-89a7-45b8-b5e1-41ccb56a3423_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:82a37176-9966-4f2b-a088-72319a2033d2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:700b1a26-61a8-48ad-80c9-d2da9f8914cf","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"CD40 is absent on cell surface of patient cells ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22443339","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations of the CD40 gene have been found in patients with autosomal recessive hyper-immunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndrome type 3.

Clinical and immunological profile of these patients is similar to the already reported HIGM3 patients except normal CD40 expression on B lymphocytes.

We previously reported on a few patients with homozygous CD40 mutations resulting in lack or severe reduction of CD40 cell surface expression. Here we characterize the 3 CD40 mutants due to missense mutations or small in-frame deletions, and show that the mutated proteins are synthesized but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), likely due to protein misfolding. Interestingly, the intracellular behavior and fate differ significantly among the mutants: progressive accumulation of the P2 mutant causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of an unfolded protein response; the mutant P4 is rather efficiently disposed by the ER-associated degradation pathway, while the P5 mutant partially negotiates transport to the plasma membrane, and is competent for CD40L binding. Interestingly, this latter mutant activates downstream signaling elements when overexpressed in transfected cells.

Most reported cases are due to X-linked CD40L deficiency. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deficiency is the most frequent autosomal recessive form, whereas CD40 deficiency is more rare. Herein, we present the first North African study on hyper IgM (HIGM) syndrome including 16 Tunisian patients. Phenotypic and genetic studies allowed us to determine their molecular basis. Three CD40LG mutations have been identified including two novels (c.348_351dup and c.782_*2del) and one already reported mutation (g.6182G>A). No mutation has been found in another patient despite the lack of CD40L expression. Interestingly, three AICDA mutations have been identified in 11 patients. Two mutations were novel (c.91T>C and c.389A>C found in one and five patients respectively), and one previously reported splicing mutation (c.156+1T>G) was found in five patients. Only one CD40-deficient patient, bearing a novel mutation (c.109T>G), has been identified. Thus, unlike previous reports, AID deficiency is the most frequent underlying molecular basis (68%) of Ig-CSR-D in Tunisian patients. This finding and the presence of specific recurrent mutations are probably due to the critical role played by inbreeding in North African populations.","dc:creator":"Ouadani H","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Novel and recurrent AID mutations underlie prevalent autosomal recessive form of HIGM in consanguineous patients."}},"rdfs:label":"patient 16"},{"id":"cggv:3453db79-9704-4c24-bd3d-9d30b948445b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3453db79-9704-4c24-bd3d-9d30b948445b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:debbb2e7-89a7-45b8-b5e1-41ccb56a3423_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7.6},{"id":"cggv:1e4aee29-7bef-4cea-8370-417044f49a83_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1e4aee29-7bef-4cea-8370-417044f49a83","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"cggv:62d99c56-3d2f-4d74-8805-9ced2209cf56","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001250.6(CD40):c.257-2A>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA409204462"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequencing all exons and flanking splice sites.

CD40 is a cell surface receptor that is expressed on the surface of all mature B cells, the encoded protein is a receptor on antigen-presenting cells of the immune system and is essential for mediating a broad variety of immune and inflammatory responses including T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching, memory B cell development, and germinal center formation. Adaptor protein TNFR2 interacts with this receptor and serves as a mediator of the signal transduction. Deleterious biallelic variation in this gene thus disrupt immature B cells from receiving signal 2 from helper T cells, which is necessary to mature into mature B cells. These patients are characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia with normal or elevated levels of IgM. This gene-disease relationship is supported by both genetic and experimental evidence. At least sixteen variants (missense, splice site, and in frame indels) have been reported in eight probands from seven publications (PMIDs: 24122029, 12584544, 26545377, 25511220, 11675497, 17502893, 22443339) and seven additional affected family members. A role in disease is supported by the function of *CD40* in generating or maintaining human CD21low B cells in vivo (PMID: 34623902), which can be observed as patient B cells defective in isotype switching and IgG/IgA/IgM production (PMID: 11675497). Additionally, a knock out mouse model which mounted IgM responses but no IgG, IgA, and IgE responses to thymus dependent (TD) antigens and *CD40* was shown to be essential for T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching and germinal center formation, but not for in vivo T cell-dependent IgM responses and T cell-independent antibody responses (PMID: 7534202). In summary *CD40* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive autosomal recessive hyper-IgM syndrome type 3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:debbb2e7-89a7-45b8-b5e1-41ccb56a3423"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
