These mice faithfully replicate the cardiac disease of the patients with this mutant allele. They provide the opportunity to study the stretch-activation response before the hearts are distorted by the hypertrophic process. Studies disclose a mismatch between the physiologic heart rate and resonant frequency of the cardiac papillary muscles expressing the mutant essential light chain. This discordance reduces oscillatory power at frequencies that correspond to physiologic heart-rates and is followed by subsequent hypertrophy.

The MYL3 gene has been associated with autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in at least 20 probands in 13 publications. More than 8 unique variants (mostly missense, 1 splice acceptor variant) have been reported in humans, and variants in this gene segregated with disease in 24 additional family members. MYL3 was first associated with HCM in humans in 1996 (Poetter et al, PMID 8673105). The MYL3 gene was significantly enriched for missense variants in Walsh et al. 2016 (PMID 27532257), with an Odds Ratio of 5.00 (3.43-7.27) for HCM. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies (Fujimoto et al, 1993, PMD 8417110), a mouse model (Vemuri et al, 1991, PMID 9927691), and evidence of interaction with MYH7 (Petzhold et al, 2011, PMID 21262909) as well as ACTC1 (Haase et al, 2006, PMID 16675844).  In summary, MYL3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant HCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
