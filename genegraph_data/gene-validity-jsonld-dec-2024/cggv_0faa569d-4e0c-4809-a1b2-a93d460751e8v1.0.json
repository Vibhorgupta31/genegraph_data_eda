Other features were left atrial and ventricular enlargement and patent foramen ovale. Total X-ray skeleton showed hypoplasia of the twelfth rib bilaterally and of the coccyx, slender long bones with thick cortex, and narrow medullary channels. The genetic investigation did not confirm Silver-Russel syndrome. At the age of 5 the patient developed an additional sign: hepatomegaly. Array CGH revealed a 147 kb deletion (involving TRIM 37 and SKA2 genes) on one allele of chromosome 17, inherited from his mother. These results suggested Mulibrey nanism. The clinical features were found to fit this hypothesis. Sequencing of the TRIM 37 gene showed a single base change at a splicing locus, inherited from his father that provoked a truncated protein. The combined use of Array CGH and DNA sequencing confirmed diagnosis of Mulibrey nanism. The large deletion involving the SKA2 gene, along with the increased frequency of malignant tumours in mulibrey patients, suggests closed monitoring for cancer of our patient and his mother. Array CGH should be performed as first tier test in all infants with multiple anomalies. The clinician should reconsider the clinical features when the genetics suggests this. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","dc:creator":"Mozzillo E","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mulibrey nanism: Two novel mutations in a child identified by Array CGH and DNA sequencing."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27256967","rdfs:label":"Mozzillo_Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"he proband was compound heterozygous for a 143kb deletion (NC_000017.10:g.57086110_57229241del) encompassing the entire TRIM37 gene along with the SKA2 (noted as cancer predisposing) gene, which was inherited from his mother, and an intronic substitution, c.1949-12A>G, inherited from the father. mRNA studies from patient and his father show the insertion of 11 nucleotides in exon 19 due to the formation of a new splice acceptor site.

TRIM37 encodes a member of the tripartite motif family. Mulibrey nanism is a multi-organ defect affecting the muscles, liver, brain, eye (Braverman et al, 2012, Gene Reviews) and characterized by severe growth failure of prenatal onset, characteristic dysmorphic features, perimyocardial heart disease, metabolic syndrome and hepatomegaly (Kallijarvi et al, 2006; PMID: 16514549). \n\nTRIM37 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mulibrey nanism in 2000. (Avela et al, PMID: 10888877). At least 20 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans in the ClinVar database. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 27256967, 17100991, 15108285, 10888877). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score (12 points) for genetic evidence is reached. Two founder mutations in the Finnish population have been described: c.493-2A>G, referred to as the Finnish major mutation is most frequently seen, and Glu738fs, referred to as the Finnish minor mutation. \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (2 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. TRIM37 is shown to partially localize with the proxisome and interact with PEX5 to ubiquitylate it. Depletion of TRIM37 is shown to result in peroxisomal matrix protein import defect (PMID: 28724525). Mouse models of TRIM37 recapitulate the human disease; however no overt peroxisome pathology is noted (PMID: 27044324).  \n  \nIn summary, TRIM37 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive mulibrey nanism. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on May 1, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
