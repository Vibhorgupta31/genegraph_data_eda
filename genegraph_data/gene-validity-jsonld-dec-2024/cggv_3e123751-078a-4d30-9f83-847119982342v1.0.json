Methods and Results Clinical investigations were routinely performed in DCM index-patients and their relatives. In addition, ≥76 recognized and likely DCM-genes were investigated. DNA-sequence-variants within RBM20 were considered suitable for genetic testing when they fulfilled the criteria of (1) being pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-classification, (2) appeared with an allele frequency of <1:10.000, and (3) segregated with DCM in ≥7 affected individuals. A total of 80 individuals from 15 families carried 5 different pathogenic RBM20-variants considered suitable for genetic testing. The penetrance was 66% (53/80) and age-dependent. Males were both significantly younger and had lower ejection fraction at diagnosis than females (age, 29±11 versus 48±12 years; P<0.01; ejection fraction, 29±13% versus 38±9%; P<0.01). Furthermore, 11 of 31 affected males needed a cardiac transplant while none of 22 affected females required this treatment ( P<0.001). Thirty percent of RBM20-carriers with DCM died suddenly or experienced severe ventricular arrhythmias although no adverse events were identified among healthy RBM20-carriers with a normal cardiac investigation. The event-free survival of male RBM20-carriers was significantly shorter compared with female carriers ( P<0.001). Conclusions The disease expression associated with pathogenic RBM20-variants was severe especially in males. The findings of the current study suggested that close clinical follow-up of RBM20-carriers is important which may ensure early detection of disease development and thereby improve management.","dc:creator":"Hey TM","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Pathogenic RBM20-Variants Are Associated With a Severe Disease Expression in Male Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871348","rdfs:label":"DIV.2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6e96bd3a-9795-4cd4-8e7f-ec21242c7db2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d19e3441-19d9-4392-acb8-e23fbdcd27a9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"High resolution melting","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6e96bd3a-9795-4cd4-8e7f-ec21242c7db2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8dc519c9-e5b8-4fa7-adb8-2d28be67bdef","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001134363.3(RBM20):c.1909A>G (p.Ser637Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/272"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846512","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of heart failure with high morbidity and mortality. More than 30 genes have been reported to cause DCM. To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, a mutational screening on 4 DCM-causing genes (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3 and LMNA) was performed in a cohort of 105 unrelated DCM (64 familial cases and 41 sporadic cases) using a High Resolution Melting (HRM)/sequencing strategy. Screening of a highly conserved arginine/serine (RS)-rich region in exon 9 of RBM20 was also performed. Nineteen different mutations were identified in 20 index patients (19%), including 10 novels. These included 8 LMNA variants in 9 (8.6%) probands, 5 TNNT2 variants in 5 probands (4.8%), 4 MYH7 variants in 3 probands (3.8%), 1 TNNI3 variant in 1 proband (0.9%), and 1 RBM20 variant in 1 proband (0.9%). One proband was double-heterozygous. LMNA mutations represent the most prevalent genetic DCM cause. Most patients carrying LMNA mutations exhibit conduction system defects and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Our study also showed than prevalence of mutations affecting TNNI3 or the (RS)-rich region of RBM20 is lower than 1%. The discovery of novel DCM mutations is crucial for clinical management of patients and their families because pre-symptomatic diagnosis is possible and precocious intervention could prevent or ameliorate the prognosis.","dc:creator":"Millat G","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Clinical and mutational spectrum in a cohort of 105 unrelated patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846512","rdfs:label":"Case 19"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:891a10f5-3590-4aed-885c-93b0230dcf77_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8e1070df-4cdb-4ed9-8d89-e61c0b828edc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":40,"detectionMethod":"WES followed by sanger sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"19 DCM genes","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:891a10f5-3590-4aed-885c-93b0230dcf77_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:3db43c18-da3d-4fca-bb9a-fab64e581db9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015401.5(HDAC7):c.497G>A (p.Arg166His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6533527"}},{"id":"cggv:58084e09-cdc0-4125-9e0f-1ebc54b10a8f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001134363.3(RBM20):c.1907G>A (p.Arg636His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/271"}}],"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23861363","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Whole exome sequencing is a powerful technique for Mendelian disease gene discovery.

A recent study indicated that mutations in a highly localized five amino acid hotspot in exon 9 of RBM20, a gene encoding a ribonucleic acid-binding protein, caused aggressive DCM. We undertook this study to confi rm and extend the nature of RBM20 mutations in another DCM cohort. Clinical cardiovascular data, family histories, and blood samples were collected from patients with idiopathic DCM. DNA from 312 DCM probands was sequenced for nucleotide alterations in exons 6 through 9 of RBM20, and additional family members as possible. We found six unique RBM20 rare variants in six unrelated probands (1.9%). Four mutations, two of which were novel (R634W and R636C) and two previously identified (R634Q and R636H), were identified in a five amino acid hotspot in exon 6.

Age of onset and severity of heart failure were variable, as were arrhythmias and conduction system defects, but many subjects suffered severe heart failure resulting in early death or cardiac transplantation.

By positional cloning using a previously characterized rat strain with altered titin mRNA splicing, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding RNA binding motif protein 20 (Rbm20) as the underlying cause of pathological titin isoform expression. The phenotype of Rbm20-deficient rats resembled the pathology seen in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by RBM20 mutations. Deep sequencing of the human and rat cardiac transcriptome revealed an RBM20-dependent regulation of alternative splicing. In addition to titin (TTN), we identified a set of 30 genes with conserved splicing regulation between humans and rats. This network is enriched for genes that have previously been linked to cardiomyopathy, ion homeostasis and sarcomere biology. Our studies emphasize the key role of post-transcriptional regulation in cardiac function and provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of human heart failure.","dc:creator":"Guo W","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"RBM20, a gene for hereditary cardiomyopathy, regulates titin splicing."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466703","rdfs:label":"Proband S635A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1ee651c3-75b5-47dd-a065-e7340205093f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:302912a6-192f-4cbf-acd8-1a0dca3a3ce2","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"NGS gene panel followed by Sanger seq","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Sequencing of 76 cardiomyopathy genes","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:1ee651c3-75b5-47dd-a065-e7340205093f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:51d18c9c-471e-4560-9a75-58bfdc0f3ae1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001134363.3(RBM20):c.2737G>A (p.Glu913Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/43998"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871348"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871348","rdfs:label":"HII.3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2df8b7b0-7ae0-47fb-be85-477b0ebd3bbc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0695ad6-6e0b-4276-b45d-5592c281de32","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"detectionMethod":"NGS followed by Sanger sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2df8b7b0-7ae0-47fb-be85-477b0ebd3bbc_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:3162493d-c205-4565-bc8e-3e9fea3aa155","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001134363.3(RBM20):c.680G>T (p.Gly227Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA181426"}},{"id":"cggv:5a6f0b80-eecf-44e0-b53d-9ac3ebb5576a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004387.4(NKX2-5):c.809G>A (p.Cys270Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/156161"}}],"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611920","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Here we report the identification of two novel mutations in a previously asymptomatic young man who suffered an out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest.

In the present study, we identified an R634W missense mutation within the stretch and a G1031X nonsense mutation in cohorts of DCM patients. We demonstrate that the two serine residues in the RSRSP stretch are constitutively phosphorylated and mutations in the stretch disturb nuclear localization of RBM20. Rbm20 S637A knock-in mouse mimicking an S635A mutation reported in a familial case showed a remarkable effect on titin isoform expression like in a patient carrying the mutation.

Genetic mutations have long been considered to be associated with this disease. At present, mutations in over 50 genes related to DCM have been documented. This study was carried out to elucidate the characteristics of gene mutations in patients with DCM. The candidate genes that may cause DCM include MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, LMNA, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYPN, MYL3, TPM1, SCN5A, DES, ACTC1 and RBM20. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subsequent mutation confirmation with traditional capillary Sanger sequencing analysis, possible causative non-synonymous mutations were identified in ~57% (12/21) of patients with DCM. As a result, 7 novel mutations (MYPN, p.E630K; TNNT2, p.G180A; MYH6, p.R1047C; TNNC1, p.D3V; DES, p.R386H; MYBPC3, p.C1124F; and MYL3, p.D126G), 3 variants of uncertain significance (RBM20, p.R1182H; MYH6, p.T1253M; and VCL, p.M209L), and 2 known mutations (MYH7, p.A26V and MYBPC3, p.R160W) were revealed to be associated with DCM. The mutations were most frequently found in the sarcomere (MYH6, MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNC1, TNNT2 and MYL3) and cytoskeletal (MYPN, DES and VCL) genes. As genetic testing is a useful tool in the clinical management of disease, testing for pathogenic mutations is beneficial to the treatment of patients with DCM and may assist in predicting disease risk for their family members before the onset of symptoms.","dc:creator":"Zhao Y","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing of candidate genes reveals novel mutations in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26458567","rdfs:label":"DCM-45"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4f04fc3f-1abf-481f-8a34-d2229308f78c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd8ec1a9-a623-44a0-be96-f3057800d940","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":43,"detectionMethod":"Birectional direct sequencing of RBM20","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Sequencing of 14 genes associated with familial DCM","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:4f04fc3f-1abf-481f-8a34-d2229308f78c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:53ccba59-81c9-451d-9100-bca4ebb1e7ac"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20590677"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20590677","rdfs:label":"DII.2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7},{"id":"cggv:3e123751-078a-4d30-9f83-847119982342_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:22de3f02-f1e6-4694-b641-0d13c88c92c9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f8ab293-86f4-4e41-9968-d0e4726b6252","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":47,"detectionMethod":"WES","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Sequencing arrays","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:22de3f02-f1e6-4694-b641-0d13c88c92c9_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:7f4009c1-40ec-4c94-808d-1ddff697b9a2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001134363.3(RBM20):c.2062C>T (p.Arg688Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA335555"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25979592","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"With the implementation of high-throughput sequencing protocols, the exhaustive scanning of known and candidate disease genes has become a feasible approach to genetic testing of patients with cardiomyopathy. A primary objective of the present study was to assess the performance characteristics of a 46-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that targets well-established cardiomyopathy genes. A total of 25 samples were analyzed. Twelve of those had previously been sequenced using resequencing arrays and served as reference samples for the assessment of the assay's performance characteristics. The remaining 13 samples were derived from consecutive patients. Both the analytical sensitivity and the specificity of the assay were 100% and the percentage of low-coverage bases was 0.4%, at an average read depth of 210×. In order to assess the diagnostic yield of the test, 13 consecutive samples representing cases of Dilated (n = 7), Hypertrophic (n = 4) and Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy (n = 2), were subjected to the 46-gene NGS assay. Including predicted pathogenic variants in the gene TTN, a total of 22 variants (11 novel) were detected in 10 patients, with a clear preponderance of variants of unknown pathogenicity (class 3 variants, 21/22, 95%). Of the seven DCM cases, two were digenic, involving variants in the genes MYH7 and RBM20 in one case and in DSP and TTN in the other case. Three other patients carried single TTN variants predicted to be pathogenic. Of the four HCM patients, one was trigenic (LAMA4, PKP2 and TTN) and three were digenic (DSP and TTN, MYH7 and NEXN, NEXN and TTN, respectively). As to LVNC, one of the two patients had one variant in the gene ABCC9 and two predicted pathogenic variants in the gene TTN. Strikingly, out of the thirteen investigated cases, only a single case exhibited a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant justifying a positive test report. The percentage of inconclusive cases thus amounted to 69%. Three cases were devoid of any relevant variant. Two of these \"negative\" cases were subsequently taken to initially evaluate the use of an alternative NGS assay addressing 4813 genes previously implicated in genetic diseases (the so-called clinical exome). Although showing similar sensitivity and specificity values, the coverage of the 46 established cardiomyopathy genes was less efficient (low-coverage bases: 5%). In a case of DCM, the assay revealed a disruptive variant in the gene encoding the adrenoreceptor beta 2 (ADRB2), a protein implicated in signal transduction and energy metabolism in the heart. In conclusion, the 46 gene assay is applicable to routine genetic diagnostics of cardiomyopathy. The test detects many variants of unknown pathogenicity which need to be followed-up in order to gain benefit for the patients and their families. Samples devoid of any relevant variant may be subjected to a clinical exome assay, in order to identify interesting novel candidate genes.","dc:creator":"Waldmüller S","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted 46-gene and clinical exome sequencing for mutations causing cardiomyopathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25979592","rdfs:label":"CM007"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantNullVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.5},{"id":"cggv:3e123751-078a-4d30-9f83-847119982342_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3e123751-078a-4d30-9f83-847119982342_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e60605b-f234-401c-924c-1c9bf6222802","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:062b5463-109d-481b-ac04-b10a0dc9778b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Reduced RBM20 protein levels in patients","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27496873","rdfs:label":"Western blot analysis - RBM20 protein levels"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e6ea1beb-e7fa-4893-9ee2-7fbe36c9d681","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02631853-d3aa-4642-b61c-e4df56ac1067","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"identified S635A mutation renders RBM20 inactive in splice reporter assays","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466703","rdfs:label":"Splice reporter assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0d695dfc-214d-4ace-adad-4542742f024a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cfe84bd9-c45d-4387-adcd-0c8309904a00","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"RBM20 regulates TTN expression","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466703","rdfs:label":"Aberrant splicing of titin in a DCM patient with RBM20 S635A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3e123751-078a-4d30-9f83-847119982342_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4bc9852-46f8-41eb-9558-ab0b4ca47c21","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30742b77-2bf0-43d0-9610-beb8fc080b2e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"R636W substitution (equivalent to R634W in human) diminished splicing regulation activity of RBM20.

Here, we investigated the extent to which RBM20 mutation carriers have an increased risk of arrhythmias and explore the underlying molecular mechanism.","dc:creator":"van den Hoogenhof MMG","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"RBM20 Mutations Induce an Arrhythmogenic Dilated Cardiomyopathy Related to Disturbed Calcium Handling."},"rdfs:label":"RBM20 knock out mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":674,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d4b9482e-ede0-4318-b48b-e5328c35901a","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:27424","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"RBM20 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2009 (Brauch et al, 2009, PMID: 19712804). To date, a large number of studies have reported over 25 RBM20 variants in DCM patients (Key papers include 26084686, Hey et al, 2019, PMID: 30871348; Li et al, 2010, PMID: 20590677; Millat et al, 2011, PMID: 21846512). Human evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data, including 55 index cases with DCM carrying RBM20 variants. Brauch et al (2009, PMID: 19712804) performed linkage analysis on two large DCM families to identify RBM20 as the disease locus and subsequent screening of 8 DCM families identified a total of 5 RBM20 variants (p.Pro638Leu, p.Arg636His, p.Arg636Ser, p.Ser637Gly, p.Arg634Gln). In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence reported in several studies. In particular, Beqqali et al (2016, PMID: 27496873) performed functional studies on the p.E913K variant. They investigated human cardiac tissue with p.E913K and U-2 OS transfected cells and observed down-regulation of the RBM20 protein by Western blot. They also showed by RNA-seq analysis that p.E913K affects titin splicing. In RBM20 deficient rats, the observed phenotype resembled human DCM with arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (Guo et al, 2012, PMID: 22466703). The same study also identified the p.S635A variant which in splice reporter assays rendered RBM20 inactive. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) carrying the p.S636A variant showed abnormal distribution of alpha-actinin and defective calcium handling (Streckfuss-Bömekeet al, 2017, PMID: 28941705). Gene expression analysis in iPSCs carrying the p.S636A variant showed dysregulated sarcomeric (TTN and LDB3) and calcium handling (CAMK2D and CACNA1C) genes (Oishi et al, 2016, PMID: 26604126). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between RBM20 and autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Therefore, the classification has been revised to definitive. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on October 11, 2019 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3e123751-078a-4d30-9f83-847119982342"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
