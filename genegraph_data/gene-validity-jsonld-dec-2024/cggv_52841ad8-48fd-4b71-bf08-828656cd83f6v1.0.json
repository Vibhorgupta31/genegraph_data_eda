Seven autosomal loci have been genetically mapped, and the underlying causal genes have been identified for MCPH1, MCPH3, MCPH5, MCPH6, and MCPH7 but not for MCPH2 or MCPH4. The known genes play roles in mitosis and cell division. We ascertained three families from an Eastern Canadian subpopulation, each with one microcephalic child. Homozygosity analysis in two families using genome-wide dense SNP genotyping supported linkage to the published MCPH4 locus on chromosome 15q21.1. Sequencing of coding exons of candidate genes in the interval identified a nonconservative amino acid change in a highly conserved residue of the centrosomal protein CEP152. The affected children in these two families were both homozygous for this missense variant. The third affected child was compound heterozygous for the missense mutation plus a second, premature-termination mutation truncating a third of the protein and preventing its localization to centrosomes in transfected cells. CEP152 is the putative mammalian ortholog of Drosphila asterless, mutations in which affect mitosis in the fly. Published data from zebrafish are also consistent with a role of CEP152 in centrosome function. By RT-PCR, CEP152 is expressed in the embryonic mouse brain, similar to other MCPH genes. Like some other MCPH genes, CEP152 shows signatures of positive selection in the human lineage. CEP152 is a strong candidate for the causal gene underlying MCPH4 and may be an important gene in the evolution of human brain size.","dc:creator":"Guernsey DL","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in centrosomal protein CEP152 in primary microcephaly families linked to MCPH4."}},"rdfs:label":"Guernsey_Proband_1669"},{"id":"cggv:27e9c8b2-9d35-439e-8733-b95a4d3d05a0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:27e9c8b2-9d35-439e-8733-b95a4d3d05a0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:27e9c8b2-9d35-439e-8733-b95a4d3d05a0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transfecting human U2OS osteosarcoma-derived cells with mutant hCEP152 fused to GFP revealed that p.Q265P-GFP variant was detected in centrosomes"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:65b52fb9-2c73-4d54-ba07-fa4a42de3025_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:65b52fb9-2c73-4d54-ba07-fa4a42de3025","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:435f5bfe-5cc9-4ed2-828a-63171da05804","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001194998.2(CEP152):c.2034T>G (p.Tyr678Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA211025"}},{"id":"cggv:b424dcfe-4e8e-4b64-bd24-2a3d9541986b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001194998.2(CEP152):c.2694+1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA392344671"}}],"detectionMethod":"RT-PCR analysis and sequencing of all 27 exons of CEP152 cDNA.

Western blotting analyses revealed that Cep152 with a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa was expressed strongly at embryonic day (E)13 and then gradually decreased during the brain development process. Instead, protein bands of ∼80 kDa and ∼60 kDa came to be recognized after postnatal day (P)15 and P30, respectively. In immunohistochemical analyses, Cep152 was enriched in the centrosome of neuronal progenitors in the ventricular zone at E14, whereas it was diffusely distributed mainly in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons at P18. In developing cerebellum at P7, Cep152 was localized at the centrosome in the external granular layer, where neurogenesis takes place. Notably, biochemical analysis revealed that Cep152 was also present in the postsynaptic density fraction. Subsequent immunofluorescent analyses showed co-localization of Cep152 with excitatory synaptic markers, PSD95 and synaptophysin, but not with an inhibitory synaptic marker gephyrin in differentiated primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The obtained results suggest that Cep152 takes part not only in neurogenesis during corticogenesis but also in the regulation of synaptic function in differentiated neurons.","dc:creator":"Hamada N","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Expression Analyses of Cep152, a Responsible Gene Product for Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly, during Mouse Brain Development."},"rdfs:label":"Hamada_Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:52841ad8-48fd-4b71-bf08-828656cd83f6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:084cf77f-c9ef-4b62-b26d-2902b56c9583","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a93ca8b-5663-4e00-8142-b70e3bc076af","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblasts contained multiple, differently sized nuclei and centrosomes, micronuclei and fragmented centrosomes during interphase.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no differences in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one, Microcephaly 9, primary (OMIM: 614852), and Seckel syndrome 5 (OMIM: 613823). Microcephaly with or without short stature is a disorder of fetal brain growth. Individuals have reduced head circumference at birth and variable degrees of intellectual impairment. Clinical features can also include a typical 'bird-head' facial appearance of Seckel syndrome and may include short stature. 7 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site) that have been reported in 11 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 21131937, 20598275) and are included in this curation. \nOf note, one reported case was identified to carry two cis homozygous variants in the CEP152 gene. This proband was is included in the curation but not scored. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies and a functional alteration study (PMIDs: 21131937, 20598275, 35259752). Cep152 was found to be expressed in developing mice brains and additionally has altered morphology and mitotic function. In summary, CEP152 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Microcephaly with or without short stature. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 06/28/22 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:52841ad8-48fd-4b71-bf08-828656cd83f6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
