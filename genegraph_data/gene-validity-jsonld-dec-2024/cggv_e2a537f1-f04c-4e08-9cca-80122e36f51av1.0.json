Here, we report on 12 patients, from 11 unrelated families, with ectodermal dysplasia caused by five previously undescribed WNT10A mutations. In this study, we show that (1) WNT10A mutations cause not only OODD but also other forms of ectodermal dysplasia, reaching from apparently monosymptomatic severe oligodontia to SchÃ¶pf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome, which is so far considered a unique entity by the findings of numerous cysts along eyelid margins and the increased risk of benign and malignant skin tumors; (2) WNT10A mutations are a frequent cause of ectodermal dysplasia and were found in about 9% of an unselected patient cohort; (3) about half of the heterozygotes (53.8%) show a phenotype manifestation, including mainly tooth and nail anomalies, which was not reported before in OODD; and (4) heterozygotes show a sex-biased manifestation pattern, with a significantly higher proportion of tooth anomalies in males than in females, which may implicate gender-specific differences of WNT10A expression.","dc:creator":"Bohring A","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"WNT10A mutations are a frequent cause of a broad spectrum of ectodermal dysplasias with sex-biased manifestation pattern in heterozygotes."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e2a537f1-f04c-4e08-9cca-80122e36f51a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e2a537f1-f04c-4e08-9cca-80122e36f51a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1b466a91-6099-4eee-b5a9-635fe727d627","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a07e6f0-d5fd-471e-beef-6b7350d5d375","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"To evaluate the effects of wnt10a loss of function on tooth development, on-cell stage fish were injected with either a translation blocking (tbMO) or splice-blocking (sbMO) morpholino (Fig 3) and observed for up to 8 days.

We characterized Wnt10a null mice generated by the knockout mouse project (KOMP) and six families with WNT10A mutations, including a novel p.Arg104Cys defect, in the absence of EDA,EDAR, or EDARADD variations. Wnt10a null mice exhibited supernumerary mandibular fourth molars, and smaller molars with abnormal cusp patterning and root taurodontism. Wnt10a (-/-) incisors showed distinctive apical-lingual wedge-shaped defects. These findings spurred us to closely examine the dental phenotypes of our WNT10A families. WNT10A heterozygotes exhibited molar root taurodontism and mild tooth agenesis (with incomplete penetrance) in their permanent dentitions. Individuals with two defective WNT10A alleles showed severe tooth agenesis and had fewer cusps on their molars. The misshapened molar crowns and roots were consistent with the Wnt10a null phenotype and were not previously associated with WNT10A defects. The missing teeth contrasted with the presence of supplemental teeth in the Wnt10a null mice and demonstrated mammalian species differences in the roles of Wnt signaling in early tooth development. We conclude that molar crown and root dysmorphologies are caused by WNT10A defects and that the severity of the tooth agenesis correlates with the number of defective WNT10A alleles.

Three disease-causing genes have been hitherto identified, namely, (1) EDA1 accounting for X-linked forms, (2) EDAR, and (3) EDARADD, causing both autosomal dominant and recessive forms. Recently, WNT10A gene was identified as responsible for various autosomal recessive forms of ectodermal dysplasias, including onycho-odonto-dermal dysplasia (OODD) and SchÃ¶pf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome. We systematically studied EDA1, EDAR, EDARADD, and WNT10A genes in a large cohort of 65 unrelated patients, of which 61 presented with HED/EDA. A total of 50 mutations (including 32 novel mutations) accounted for 60/65 cases in our series. These four genes accounted for 92% (56/61 patients) of HED/EDA cases: (1) the EDA1 gene was the most common disease-causing gene (58% of cases), (2)WNT10A and EDAR were each responsible for 16% of cases. Moreover, a novel disease locus for dominant HED/EDA mapped to chromosome 14q12-q13.1. Although no clinical differences between patients carrying EDA1, EDAR, or EDARADD mutations could be identified, patients harboring WNT10A mutations displayed distinctive clinical features (marked dental phenotype, no facial dysmorphism), helping to decide which gene should be first investigated in HED/EDA.","dc:creator":"Cluzeau C","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Only four genes (EDA1, EDAR, EDARADD, and WNT10A) account for 90% of hypohidrotic/anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia cases."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"WNT10A-S05"},{"id":"cggv:0cfd11c2-93e2-4214-a970-b62357e62455","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0cfd11c2-93e2-4214-a970-b62357e62455_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e2a537f1-f04c-4e08-9cca-80122e36f51a_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.5},{"id":"cggv:1ce990cf-f0b5-41d1-aaef-083664e8246a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ce990cf-f0b5-41d1-aaef-083664e8246a","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:bfd5e55b-0590-45b0-8cd1-10f5291f9220","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025216.3(WNT10A):c.682T>A (p.Phe228Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116867"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Tooth agenesis, sparse hair, thin and fragile hair, leukonychia, koilonychia; thin nail, slow growth, dry skin.","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:b31e2f97-ab6a-4ce2-8012-155d404495fc_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bfd5e55b-0590-45b0-8cd1-10f5291f9220"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23401279","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Ectodermal dysplasias (ED) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders that have in common abnormal development of ectodermal derivatives. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is characterized by abnormal development of eccrine sweat glands, hair, and teeth. The X-linked form of the disease, caused by mutations in the EDA gene, represents the majority of patients with the hypohidrotic form. Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms are occasionally seen, and result from mutations in at least three genes (WNT10A, EDAR, or more rarely EDARADD). We have screened for mutations in EDAR (commonly involved in the hypohidrotic form) and WNT10A (involved in a wide spectrum of ED and in isolated hypodontia) in a cohort of 36 patients referred for EDA molecular screening, which failed to identify any mutation. We identified eight EDAR mutations in five patients (two with homozygous mutations, one with compound heterozygous mutations, and two with heterozygous mutation), four of which were novel variants. We identified 28 WNT10A mutations in 16 patients (5 with homozygous mutations, 7 with compound heterozygous mutations, and 4 with heterozygous mutations), seven of which were novel variants. Our study allows a more precise definition of the phenotypic spectrum associated with EDAR and WNT10A mutations and underlines the importance of the implication of WNT10A among patients with ED.","dc:creator":"PlaisanciÃ© J","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in WNT10A are frequently involved in oligodontia associated with minor signs of ectodermal dysplasia."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 10"},{"id":"cggv:b31e2f97-ab6a-4ce2-8012-155d404495fc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b31e2f97-ab6a-4ce2-8012-155d404495fc_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Assigning 0.5 points based on at least 0.1 for a missense variant with 5 unrelated cases reported."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4423,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:4709b92d-11cf-455a-ab77-4a6666bcffe3","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100358","gene":"hgnc:13829","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The WNT10A gene is located on chromosome 2 at 2q35 and encodes the Wnt Family Member 10A protein, a secreted signaling protein that binds the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors. WNT10A was first reported in relation to semi-dominant ectodermal dysplasia WNT10A-related in 2009 (Bohring et al., PMID: 19559398). This form of ectodermal dysplasia exhibits alterations in ectoderm-derived features including hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Common features include hypodontia, anodontia, hyperkeratosis, hypohidrosis, anhidrosis, and hypotrichosis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the disease entities odontoonychodermal dysplasia (OMIM: 257980), Schopf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome (OMIM: 224750), and Tooth agenesis, selective, 4 (OMIM: 150400) have been lumped into one disease entity, Ectodermal dysplasia WNT10A related (MONDO: 0100358) . At least 7 variants (including 3 missense, 1 frameshift, and 3 nonsense variants) have been reported in 9 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 19559398;  Cluzeau et al., 2011, PMID: 20979233; PlaisanciÃ© et al., 2013, PMID: 23401279; Van den Boogaard et al., 2012, PMID: 22581971; KrÃ¸igÃ¥rd et al., 2016, PMID: 26964878; MartÃ­nez-Romero et al., 2019, PMID: 31796081; Ismail et al., 2019, PMID: 31468502) and are included in this curation. Several recurrent variants were identified including c.321C>A (p.Cys107Ter) and c.682T>A (p.Phe228Ile), which were both found in a heterozygous and homozygous state in individuals exhibiting the spectrum of associated phenotype (PMIDs: 19559398; Vink et al., 2014, PMID: 24398796; PlaisanciÃ© et al., 2013, PMID: 23401279). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by zebrafish and mouse models (Yang et al., 2015, PMID: 25629078; Yuan et al., 2017, PMID: 29178643). In summary, WNT10A is definitively associated with semi-dominant ectodermal dysplasia WNT10A related. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 08.20.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e2a537f1-f04c-4e08-9cca-80122e36f51a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
