Respiratory epithelial cells showed a marked reduction in the number of multiple motile cilia (MMC) covering the cell surface. The few residual cilia that correctly expressed axonemal motor proteins were motile and did not exhibit obvious beating defects. Careful subcellular analyses as well as in vitro ciliogenesis experiments in CCNO-mutant cells showed defective mother centriole generation and placement. Morpholino-based knockdown of the Xenopus ortholog of CCNO also resulted in reduced MMC and centriole numbers in embryonic epidermal cells. CCNO is expressed in the apical cytoplasm of multiciliated cells and acts downstream of multicilin, which governs the generation of multiciliated cells. To our knowledge, CCNO is the first reported gene linking an inherited human disease to reduced MMC generation due to a defect in centriole amplification and migration.","dc:creator":"Wallmeier J","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mutations in CCNO result in congenital mucociliary clearance disorder with reduced generation of multiple motile cilia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20a78ac7-91a7-44a6-b42e-22611de2d170_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20a78ac7-91a7-44a6-b42e-22611de2d170_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89e4592d-25d4-4ce8-95dd-5767eaee0e5c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81b32f0f-799b-430a-81ca-76f5857fddb4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"GTEx shows human tissues exhibiting the highest levels of CCNO expression include tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the lung, fallopian tube, brain, and testis.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715323","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci for common diseases, but, for the majority of these, the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility remain unknown.

As previously characterized disorders in the Irish Traveller population are caused by common homozygous mutations, we hypothesised that all three PCD families shared the same recessive mutation. However, exome sequencing showed that there was no pathogenic homozygous mutation common to all families. This finding was supported by histology, which showed that each family has a different type of ciliary defect; transposition defect (family A), nude epithelium (family B) and absence of inner and outer dynein arms (family C). Therefore, each family was analysed independently using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The affected siblings in family A share a novel 1 bp duplication in RSPH4A (NM_001161664.1:c.166dup; p.Arg56Profs*11), a radial-spoke head protein involved in ciliary movement. In family B, we identified three candidate genes (CCNO, KCNN3 and CDKN1C), with a 5-bp duplication in CCNO (NM_021147.3:c.258_262dup; p.Gln88Argfs*8) being the most likely cause of ciliary aplasia. This is the first study to implicate CCNO, a DNA repair gene reported to be involved in multiciliogenesis, in PCD. In family C, we identified a ∼3.5-kb deletion in DYX1C1, a neuronal migration gene previously associated with PCD. This is the first report of a disorder in the relatively small Irish Traveller population to be caused by >1 disease gene. Our study identified at least three different PCD genes in the Irish Traveller population, highlighting that one cannot always assume genetic homogeneity, even in small consanguineous populations.

CCNO mutations are associated with chronic destructive lung disease and were first described in 2014. Early reports suggest that CCNO is mutated more frequently than expected, however, these are considered rare. We report on three eleven-year-old children with PCD due to CCNO mutations. All children presented early-onset respiratory symptoms, no cardiac or situs anomalies and moderate to severe clinical courses. Patients 1 and 3 were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory distress. Patients 1 and 2 had atelectasis and lobar collapse, for which lobectomy was performed for patient 1. Patient 3 also presented otitis media with effusion with conductive hearing loss, requiring tympanostomy tube insertion twice. Diagnosis of PCD for all three required repeated nasal brushings, delaying diagnostic confirmation. Microscopy analysis revealed severely decreased numbers of cilia, but normal ultrastructure and uncoordinated beat pattern in the residual cilia. Surprisingly, the prevalence of pathogenic CCNO variants in our centre is higher than expected (three out of sixteen patients). Pathogenic variants in PCD-causing genes lead to specific ultrastructural defects, and there is a suggestion for genotype-phenotype association. However, there are little longitudinal data evaluating the impact of specific defects on disease progression, but a recent study showed a worse lung disease and poorer nutritional status. Concluding, this report underlies the importance of patient-oriented diagnosis and management in highly experienced PCD centres.","dc:creator":"Henriques AR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Primary

Mutations in two genes, CCNO and MCIDAS, have been identified as a cause of this disease, both leading to a greatly reduced number of cilia and causing impaired mucociliary clearance. This study was designed to identify the prevalence of CCNO mutations in Israel and further delineate the clinical characteristics of RGMC. We analyzed 170 families with mucociliary clearance disorders originating from Israel for mutations in CCNO and identified two novel mutations (c.165delC, p.Gly56Alafs*38; c.638T>C, p.Leu213Pro) and two known mutations in 15 individuals from 10 families (6% prevalence). Pathogenicity of the missense mutation (c.638T>C, p.Leu213Pro) was demonstrated by functional analyses in Xenopus. Combining these 15 patients with the previously reported CCNO case reports revealed rapid deterioration in lung function, an increased prevalence of hydrocephalus (10%) as well as increased female infertility (22%). Consistent with these findings, we demonstrate that CCNO expression is present in murine ependyma and fallopian tubes. CCNO is mutated more frequently than expected from the rare previous clinical case reports, leads to severe clinical manifestations, and should therefore be considered an important differential diagnosis of mucociliary clearance disorders.

The specific disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 29, is one of at least 50 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a specific monogenetic cause. Affected patients frequently present as neonates or in early childhood with recurrent respiratory infections including sinusitis, as well as decreased nasal nitric oxide, otitis media, and/or bronchiectasis. The reported cases presented with a severe clinical phenotype, including severe lung disease, and rarely hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly. Laterality defects were not observed for any of the reported patients. Biopsies of upper and bronchial respiratory epithelial cells showed a complete absence or markedly reduced numbers of cilia, and in vitro ciliogenesis culture experiments demonstrated a severe defect in multiple motile cilia (MMC) generation, associated with insufficient centriole numbers and decreased basal bodies. Ciliary ultrastructure in the few expressed cilia was normal but beating was uncoordinated (PMID: 24747639, PMID: 24824133, PMID: 34102041). Due to this, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia caused by pathogenic variants in *CCNO* belong to a group of disorders known as “reduced generation of multiple motile cilia” or RGMMC, associated with hydrocephalus in humans. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *CCNO* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 29 (MONDO:0014378, OMIM #615872). Nine suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (six frameshift, one nonsense and two missense), which have been collectively reported in fifteen probands (as well as affected family members) in four publications (PMID: 24747639, PMID: 24824133, PMID: 34102041, PMID: 26777464). More case-level evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 26139845) but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points). This gene-disease relationship has not been studied in case-control studies at the single variant level or aggregate variant level. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by the absence of a gene product (PMID: 24747639). All probands scored in this curation harbored two variant alleles within the *CCNO* locus.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that human tissues exhibiting the highest levels of *CCNO* expression include tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the lung, fallopian tube, brain, and testis (PMID: 23715323). More experimental evidence includes that *CCNO* normally localizes to the apical cytoplasm and is an essential component for generation of MMC, functional alterations in patient cells consistent with a critical role in MMC generation, and mislocalization in the cytoplasm and altered expression in PCD patient tissue. Model organisms (mouse and frog) show reduced numbers of MMC and characteristic phenotypes of MMC dysfunction, similar to those observed in patients (PMID: 25712475, PMID: 24747639, PIMD: 29245899). In summary, *CCNO* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 29. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on August 19, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:20a78ac7-91a7-44a6-b42e-22611de2d170"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
