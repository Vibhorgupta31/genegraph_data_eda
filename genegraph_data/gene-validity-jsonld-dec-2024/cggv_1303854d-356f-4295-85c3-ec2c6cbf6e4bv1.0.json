Here we report autozygosity mapping and show that the locus FS1 at chromosome 4q21 is associated with Fraser syndrome, although the condition is genetically heterogeneous. Mutation analysis identified five frameshift mutations in FRAS1, which encodes one member of a family of novel proteins related to an extracellular matrix (ECM) blastocoelar protein found in sea urchin. The FRAS1 protein contains a series of N-terminal cysteine-rich repeat motifs previously implicated in BMP metabolism, suggesting that it has a role in both structure and signal propagation in the ECM. It has been speculated that Fraser syndrome is a human equivalent of the blebbed phenotype in the mouse, which has been associated with mutations in at least five loci including bl. As mapping data were consistent with homology of FRAS1 and bl, we screened DNA from bl/bl mice and identified a premature termination of mouse Fras1. Thus, the bl mouse is a model for Fraser syndrome in humans, a disorder caused by disrupted epithelial integrity in utero.","dc:creator":"McGregor L","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Fraser syndrome and mouse blebbed phenotype caused by mutations in FRAS1/Fras1 encoding a putative extracellular matrix protein."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c01c8082-214f-484a-8ac4-b3d193a9681c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94ff6894-0979-4a88-a05f-91abb8dde73a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Demonstrated that FRAS1 is expressed in multiple adult tissues.

While recent research has led to the identification of the genes FRAS1 and FREM2 as the cause of FS, the genetic basis of AMS continues to be enigmatic. We report on the concurrence of AMS-like and Fraser phenotypes in a Brazilian family. Both affected sibs were homozygous for a novel splice site mutation in the FRAS1 gene. Extensive studies on mRNA expression indicated that this mutation most likely leads to loss of function as most previously reported FRAS1 mutations associated with FS. We conclude that a phenotype resembling AMS is a rare clinical expression of FS with no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation. However, the molecular basis of \"true\" AMS which has been reported as a sporadic disorder in all cases but one, and so far with no relation to FS, is probably different and still needs to be further investigated.","dc:creator":"Cavalcanti DP","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Fraser and Ablepharon macrostomia phenotypes: concurrence in one family and association with mutated FRAS1."}},"rdfs:label":"Cavalcanti_Proband"},{"id":"cggv:b97c4e3a-c29c-488c-bdec-c40d57eea10b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b97c4e3a-c29c-488c-bdec-c40d57eea10b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for conservative scoring of homozygous variants "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4ebe083e-c6cb-42cf-93d6-76a7c39d35aa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4ebe083e-c6cb-42cf-93d6-76a7c39d35aa","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:f00c5e3c-e031-4c70-9710-627ee399e863","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025074.7(FRAS1):c.5419_5424del (p.Phe1807_Ser1808del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212802"}},{"id":"cggv:05313597-9a4a-40f5-9f36-7f824d5451f0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025074.7(FRAS1):c.6963_6964dup (p.Val2322GlyfsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212804"}}],"detectionMethod":"The 75 exons of FRAS1 were sequenced using 71 amplicons in all probands.\n","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":" minor webbing of the vocal cords, tongue of hair extending from the anterior scalp hairline to the eyebrow ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000813","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0000126","obo:HP_0001126","obo:HP_0009930"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:81c645bf-6810-4fd6-b557-ac2c6da18370_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:05313597-9a4a-40f5-9f36-7f824d5451f0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16894541","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Fraser syndrome (OMIM 219000) is a rare, autosomal recessive condition with classical features of cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, ambiguous genitalia, laryngeal, and genitourinary malformations, oral clefting and mental retardation.

Fraser Syndrome is a rare congenital malformation\ntypically characterized by eye anomalies (unilateral or bilateral cryptophthalmos, microphthalmos/anophthalmos), renal agenesis, bladder atresia/hypoplasia, genital anomalies \n(ambiguous genitalia, cryptorchidism, underdevelopment of male genitalia), and syndactyly. Fraser Syndrome can also cause multisystem anomalies, including craniofacial, cardiac, digestive, skeletal, and respiratory system abnormalities. At the time of this curation, there were no other single-gene disorders associated with this gene. There was some evidence supporting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern for Fraser Syndrome, which has been curated separately.8 variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site) that have been reported in 7 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 12766769, 16894541, 17163535) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (if applicable). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and expression studies (PMID: 12766769). In summary, FRAS1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Fraser Syndrome 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen CAKUT GCEP on the meeting date 10/11/22 (SOP Version 9).  \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
