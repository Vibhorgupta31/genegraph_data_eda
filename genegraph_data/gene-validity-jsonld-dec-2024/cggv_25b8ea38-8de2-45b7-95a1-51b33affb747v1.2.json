This is associated with a variety of ultrastructural defects of the cilia and sperm axoneme that affect movement, leading to clinical consequences on respiratory-tract mucociliary clearance and lung function, fertility, and left-right body-axis determination. We performed whole-genome SNP-based linkage analysis in seven consanguineous families with PCD and central-microtubular-pair abnormalities. This identified two loci, in two families with intermittent absence of the central-pair structure (chromosome 6p21.1, Zmax 6.7) and in five families with complete absence of the central pair (chromosome 6q22.1, Zmax 7.0). Mutations were subsequently identified in two positional candidate genes, RSPH9 on chromosome 6p21.1 and RSPH4A on chromosome 6q22.1. Haplotype analysis identified a common ancestral founder effect RSPH4A mutation present in UK-Pakistani pedigrees. Both RSPH9 and RSPH4A encode protein components of the axonemal radial spoke head. In situ hybridization of murine Rsph9 shows gene expression restricted to regions containing motile cilia. Investigation of the effect of knockdown or mutations of RSPH9 orthologs in zebrafish and Chlamydomonas indicate that radial spoke head proteins are important in maintaining normal movement in motile, \"9+2\"-structure cilia and flagella. This effect is rescued by reintroduction of gene expression for restoration of a normal beat pattern in zebrafish. Disturbance in function of these genes was not associated with defects in left-right axis determination in humans or zebrafish.","dc:creator":"Castleman VH","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in radial spoke head protein genes RSPH9 and RSPH4A cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with central-microtubular-pair abnormalities."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:25b8ea38-8de2-45b7-95a1-51b33affb747_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:25b8ea38-8de2-45b7-95a1-51b33affb747_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8dc43e1f-69cd-467d-821a-979938b00383","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:99ce09d2-aaec-4a08-8b85-97fe0cf214a1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"\"Rsph9 was highly expressed in mouse tissues containing the ‘9+2’ motile cilia, including the testis, lung and oviduct but was undetectable in tissues with primary cilia (Figure 1B)\".

Individuals with PCD caused by defective radial spoke (RS) heads are difficult to diagnose owing to lack of gross ultrastructural defects and absence of situs inversus. Thus far, most mutations identified in human radial spoke genes (RSPH) are loss-of-function mutations, and missense variants have been rarely described. We studied the consequences of different RSPH9, RSPH4A, and RSPH1 mutations on the assembly of the RS complex to improve diagnostics in PCD. We report 21 individuals with PCD (16 families) with biallelic mutations in RSPH9, RSPH4A, and RSPH1, including seven novel mutations comprising missense variants, and performed high-resolution immunofluorescence analysis of human respiratory cilia. Missense variants are frequent genetic defects in PCD with RS defects. Absence of RSPH4A due to mutations in RSPH4A results in deficient axonemal assembly of the RS head components RSPH1 and RSPH9. RSPH1 mutant cilia, lacking RSPH1, fail to assemble RSPH9, whereas RSPH9 mutations result in axonemal absence of RSPH9, but do not affect the assembly of the other head proteins, RSPH1 and RSPH4A.

Her respiratory distress improved with respiratory support. She needed oxygen for a total period of 14 days, and then she was observed for two days without supplemental oxygen before being discharged. The genetic testing was requested based on unexplained respiratory distress with normal chest X-ray and normal echocardiography.\n\nFour months later, the patient was admitted to another hospital with fever and respiratory symptoms for two days. After a month, she presented to the emergency department with fever and increased work of breathing; pneumonia was confirmed and treated with HFNC 14 L/min with FiO2 of 25%. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for ten days, bronchodilators and a 3% normal saline nebulizer with chest physiotherapy were provided. Chest X-ray showed that the right upper lobe had collapsed (Figure ​(Figure2).2). The respiratory culture isolated Streptococcus pneumonia, and the respiratory multiplex was positive for rhino/enterovirus. After completing the antibiotic course, the baby was discharged home. Since then, the baby has done well; she only had to continue chest physiotherapy and hypertonic nebulizer 3%.\n\nAt 12 hours of age, the patient developed tachypnea with desaturation in room air, she had continuous thick whitish oral secretion.

Dysfunction of motile respiratory and nodal cilia results in sinopulmonary symptoms associated with laterality defects (LD) found in half of the patients. The molecular basis of the disease is insufficiently investigated in patients originating from the Arabian Peninsula. In a group of 16 unrelated Saudi patients clinically suspected of PCD and among whom only 5 (31%) had LD, we first screened by PCR-RFLP two founder mutations, RSPH9 c.804_806del and CCDC39 c.2190del previously identified in patients from the Arabian Peninsula and Tunisia, respectively. When negative, targeted panel or whole-exome sequencing was performed. Three patients were homozygous for the mutation in RSPH9, which encodes an axonemal protein that is absent from nodal cilia. None of the patients carried the CCDC39 founder mutation frequent in Tunisia. NGS analysis showed that nine patients had homozygous mutations in PCD genes. In total, sequential RFLP and NGS analysis solved 75% (12/16) of cases and identified ten distinct mutations, among which six are novel, in nine different genes. These results, which highlight the genetic heterogeneity of PCD in Saudi Arabia, show that the RSPH9 c.804_806del mutation is a prevalent mutation among Saudi patients, whereas the CCDC39 c.2190del ancestral allele is most likely related to the Berber population. This study shows that RSPH9 founder mutation first-line screening and NGS analysis is efficient for the genetic exploration of PCD in Saudi patients. The RSPH9 founder mutation accounts for the low rate of LD among Saudi patients.","dc:creator":"Mabrouk I","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Combining RSPH9 founder mutation screening and next-generation sequencing analysis is efficient for primary ciliary dyskinesia diagnosis in Saudi patients."}},"rdfs:label":"P17"},{"id":"cggv:b3e73780-65bd-4db5-8eec-9e204fde93d9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b3e73780-65bd-4db5-8eec-9e204fde93d9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This variant has been upscored due to replication in a geographic region.

Some of the most common phenotypes observed among patients in this curation are neonatal respiratory distress, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, rhinorrhea, recurrent wet cough, otitis media and rotational ciliary movement rather than planar whiplash ciliary movement. Male and female infertility have been reported, while nasal nitric oxide levels could be either low or near the low end of the normal range. All of the probands found had normal abdominal situs. Electron microscopy findings sometimes included central complex defects but rarely showed inner or outer dynein arm abnormalities.\n\nThis curation has included eight variants (3 missense, 1 splice site, 2 nonsense, 1 start-loss and 1 in-frame deletion) that have been reported in 12 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 35046476, 33577779, 31285900, 36873931, 36059358, 19200523, 25789548). The in-frame deletion was a potential founder variant observed among a number of probands of Middle Eastern or Mediterranean origin (PMID: 35046476, PMID: 20070851). *RSPH9* variants co-segregated with PCD in at least two affected families (PMID:36059358, PMID: 19200523). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function as shown by the presence of null variants and the absence of RSPH9 staining in the cells of some of the probands (PMID: 36873931).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence. High levels of expression of *RSPH9* were observed in human tissues associated with PCD (fallopian tube, testis and lung, PMID:23715323) and has been confirmed in mouse tissues (PMID:30383886). *RSPH9* encodes a component of the ‘head’ structure of ciliary radial spoke complexes (PMID: 36873931), a role shared by the *RSPH1* gene that has previously been linked to PCD 24. RSPH9 localizes to the kinocilia in zebrafish, indicating that the protein may affect ciliary formation and function in this organism (PMID: 27687975). Depleting *Rsph9* from multiciliated mouse ependymal cells (mEPCs) by RNAi found that the ciliary beat pattern became rotational, similar to the PCD patients (PMID: 19200523). Two different mouse knockouts of *Rsph9* both resulted in hydrocephalus and sinusitis (PMID: 27626380, PMID: 32709945).\n\nIn conclusion, *RSPH9* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 12. This classification has been clearly demonstrated through both experimental and genetic evidence in a combination of clinical and laboratory settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on October 12th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:25b8ea38-8de2-45b7-95a1-51b33affb747"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
