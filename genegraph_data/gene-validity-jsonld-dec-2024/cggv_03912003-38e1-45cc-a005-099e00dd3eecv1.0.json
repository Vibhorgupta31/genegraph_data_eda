Patients have consistently low serum alkaline phosphatase (AP), so that this parameter is a good hallmark of the disease. Adult HPP is heterogeneous, and some patients present only mild nonpathognomonic symptoms which are also common in the general population such as joint pain, osteomalacia and osteopenia, chondrocalcinosis, arthropathy and musculoskeletal pain. Adult HPP may be recessively or dominantly inherited; the latter case is assumed to be due to the dominant negative effect (DNE) of missense mutations derived from the functional homodimeric structure of TNSALP. However, there is no biological argument excluding the possibility of other causes of dominant HPP. Rheumatologists and endocrinologists are increasingly solicited for patients with low AP and nonpathognomonic symptoms of HPP. Many of these patients are heterozygous for an ALPL mutation and a challenging question is to determine if these symptoms, which are also common in the general population, are attributable to their heterozygous ALPL mutation or not. In an attempt to address this question, we reviewed a cohort of 61 adult patients heterozygous for an ALPL mutation. Mutations were distinguished according to their statistical likelihood to show a DNE. One-half of the patients carried mutations predicted with no DNE and were slightly less severely affected by the age of onset, serum AP activity and history of fractures. We hypothesized that these mutations result in another mechanism of dominance or are recessive alleles. To identify other genetic factors that could trigger the disease phenotype in heterozygotes for potential recessive mutations, we examined the next-generation sequencing results of 32 of these patients for a panel of 12 genes involved in the differential diagnosis of HPP or candidate modifier genes of HPP. The heterozygous genotype G/C of the COL1A2 coding SNP rs42524 c.1645C > G (p.Pro549Ala) was associated with the severity of the phenotype in patients carrying mutations with a DNE whereas the homozygous genotype G/G was over-represented in patients carrying mutations without a DNE, suggesting a possible role of this variant in the disease phenotype. These preliminary results support COL1A2 as a modifier gene of HPP and suggest that a significant proportion of adult heterozygotes for ALPL mutations may have unspecific symptoms not attributable to their heterozygosity.","dc:creator":"Taillandier A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Genetic analysis of adults heterozygous for ALPL mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29236161","rdfs:label":"Patient 17"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Dominant negative effect ruled out -

As the onset and severity of HPP are heterogenous, it can be challenging to determine the pathogenicity of detected rare ALPL variants in symptomatic patients. We aimed to characterize patients with rare ALPL variants to propose which patients can be diagnosed with adult HPP. We included 72 patients with (1) clinical symptoms of adult HPP or positive family history and (2) low TNSALP activity and/or high pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) levels, who underwent ALPL gene sequencing. The patients were analyzed and divided into three groups depending on ALPL variant pathogenicity according to the classification of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Reported pathogenic (n = 34 patients), rare (n = 17) and common (n = 21) ALPL variants only were found. Muscular complaints were the most frequent symptoms (> 80%), followed by bone affection (> 50%). Tooth involvement was significantly more common in patients with pathogenic or rare ALPL variants. Seven rare variants could be classified as likely pathogenic (ACMG class 4) of which five have not yet been described. Inconclusive genetic findings and less specific symptoms make diagnosis difficult in cases where adult HPP is not obvious. As not every pathogenic or rare ALPL variant leads to a manifestation of HPP, only patients with bone complications and at least one additional complication concerning teeth, muscle, central nervous and mental system, repeated low TNSALP activity and high PLP levels should be diagnosed as adult HPP if rare ALPL gene variants of ACMG class 4 or higher support the diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Jandl NM","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in 72 Adults with Suspected ALPL-Associated Hypophosphatasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33191482","rdfs:label":"Patient 12"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"6.02% activity compared to WT \n(Del Angel 2020)"},{"id":"cggv:e0fa51e5-3cea-4200-b64f-16f81882953a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:745980de-c085-4790-afa2-fd54598e6076","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":57,"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"tendinosis calcarea, reduced grip force\n\nDecreased ALP levels: 23 U/L, BAP (bone specific ALP): 4.2 U/L, Elevated PLP (Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate): 39.6 μg/L \n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003326","obo:HP_0004349"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:e0fa51e5-3cea-4200-b64f-16f81882953a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:626285f6-b0fc-4a8d-b18f-655994b6cb74","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.1023T>A (p.His341Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338881022"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33191482"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33191482","rdfs:label":"Patient 13"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"4.9% activity compared to WT\n(Del Angel 2020)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:03912003-38e1-45cc-a005-099e00dd3eec_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:343ebd86-f775-4c3b-a2e6-d99773920507_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:18681ade-8c96-4355-84e2-89c730cfc5ee","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":55,"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"ALPL levels 82% of lower limit of normal range","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0002757","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:343ebd86-f775-4c3b-a2e6-d99773920507_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f9873913-5494-475d-b267-bb61ee344696","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.187_205del (p.Gly63LeufsTer53)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139771350"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29236161"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29236161","rdfs:label":"Patient 54"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:9dd709db-44b1-4da1-9224-544d8ec6c499_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c0788b0a-68de-4831-add5-4340b00c2046","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":41,"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Denied history of fractures, teeth loss, cavities, muscle pain, ID, or vitamin supplementation\nFamily history of premenopausal osteoporosis with poor response to bisphosphonates and fractures\nOn physical exam, slight lack of enamel seen in teeth\nDecreased ALP levels for last 2 years seen and high vitamin B6 levels seen\nNo radiographic abnormalities reported","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:9dd709db-44b1-4da1-9224-544d8ec6c499_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b2374966-cf2d-46d1-a3ab-331529e8384f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.1474del (p.Ala492fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/632630"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30864637","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hypophosphatasia is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity due to loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP).

has been described in association with autosomal dominant mild hypophosphatasia (Taillandier et al., 2018; PMID:29236161). Mild hypophosphatasia is the most common form of hypophosphatasia characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase, nonspecific clinical signs, and typically presents in individuals in adulthood. This condition can and has been reported to progress to more severe forms in patients. Based upon the severity and mode of inheritance of the hypophosphatasia clinical subtypes, the curations for autosomal recessive severe hypophosphatasia, autosomal recessive moderate hypophosphatasia, and autosomal dominant moderate hypophosphatasia have been split and curated separately (PMID: 32973344). Twelve variants (missense, frameshift, splice, nonsense) that have been reported in twelve probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 29236161, 30864637, 33191482) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by an mRNA expression study (GTEx, Illumina, BioGPS, and SAGE; https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ALPL&keywords=alpl#expression). In summary, ALPL is definitively associated with autosomal dominant mild hypophosphatasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 5/19/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:03912003-38e1-45cc-a005-099e00dd3eec"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
