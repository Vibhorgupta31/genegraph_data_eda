Early neurological signs were nystagmus, hypertonus and optic atrophy. Severe seizures and mental retardation developed subsequently. Major findings on neuroradiological investigation were from the brainstem, thalami and white matter compatible with LS. Spectrophotometric analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondria showed a profound COX deficiency and a marked complex I deficiency. Enzyme-histochemical analysis showed reduced COX activity in the majority of the muscle fibres. There were no ragged red fibres.

The MT-TW gene encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) for tryptophan. Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V and thus impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities.\n\nThe MT-TW gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome in 1997 (PMID: 9266739). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 2 variants in 3 cases (1 with m.5559A>G, 2 with m.5537_5538insT) from 3 publications (PMIDs: 9266739, 26524491, 12776230). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function (PMID: 27977873). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 17, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3dc54202-27f3-4bf4-883f-5273a49dcb70"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
