We previously mapped the DMS-MFH tumor-suppressing-gene locus to chromosomal region 9p21-22 but failed to identify mutations in known genes in this region. We now demonstrate that DMS-MFH results from mutations in the most proximal of three previously uncharacterized terminal exons of the gene encoding methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, MTAP. Intriguingly, two of these MTAP exons arose from early and independent retroviral-integration events in primate genomes at least 40 million years ago, and since then, their genomic integration has gained a functional role. MTAP is a ubiquitously expressed homotrimeric-subunit enzyme critical to polyamine metabolism and adenine and methionine salvage pathways and was believed to be encoded as a single transcript from the eight previously described exons. Six distinct retroviral-sequence-containing MTAP isoforms, each of which can physically interact with archetype MTAP, have been identified. The disease-causing mutations occur within one of these retroviral-derived exons and result in exon skipping and dysregulated alternative splicing of all MTAP isoforms. Our results identify a gene involved in the development of bone sarcoma, provide evidence of the primate-specific evolution of certain parts of an existing gene, and demonstrate that mutations in parts of this gene can result in human disease despite its relatively recent origin.","dc:creator":"Camacho-Vanegas O","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Primate genome gain and loss: a bone dysplasia, muscular dystrophy, and bone cancer syndrome resulting from mutated retroviral-derived MTAP transcripts."},"rdfs:label":"MTAP Isoform Expression in Probands "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4a4d38f3-6c24-4bc2-9dfd-0429e21b3508","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54ae19a0-5191-4208-b553-e37d0c8fcf96","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"MTA is present in the serum due to damaging mutation in MTAP and inability to metabolize MTA.

MTAP encodes the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway. To determine if loss of MTAP plays a functional role in tumorigenesis, we have created an MTAP-knockout mouse. Mice homozygous for a MTAP null allele (Mtap(lacZ)) have an embryonic lethal phenotype dying around day 8 postconception. Mtap/Mtap(lacZ) heterozygotes are born at Mendelian frequencies and appear indistinguishable from wild-type mice during the first year of life, but they tend to die prematurely with a median survival of 585 days. Autopsies on these animals reveal that they have greatly enlarged spleens, altered thymic histology, and lymphocytic infiltration of their livers, consistent with lymphoma. Immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicate that these lymphomas are primarily T-cell in origin. Lymphoma-infiltrated tissues tend to have reduced levels of Mtap mRNA and MTAP protein in addition to unaltered levels of methyldeoxycytidine.

(MethylThioAdenosine Phosphorylase) was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant diaphyseal medullary stenosis with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (DMS-MFH [MIM 112250]) in 2012 (Camacho-Vanegas et al.,  PMID: 22464254). However, prior to this the critical locus was identified through linkage (Martignetti et al 1999) and reports of the condition had been circulating since its early identification (Arnold, 1973). DMS-MFH presents with unique bone dysplasia phenotypes that result in fractures and poor healing, as well as progressive wasting, cataracts and muscular dystrophy. Approximately 35% of affected individuals develop bone sarcoma. The reported variants are synonymous (predicted silent) variants that affect splicing of the MTAP gene and result in numerous isoforms with negative consequences on MTAP functions. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation and experimental data. Variants in MTAP have been reported in at least 5 probands in 1 publication (PMID:22464254) summarizing multiple prior publications. MTAP variants display a clear autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The mechanism for disease is altered function and is still being investigated. 5.5 points (2.5 points case level data and 3 points segregation) were received in the genetic evidence section. Experimental evidence is limited to 2.75 points including expression studies including RNA analysis from patients, in vitro functional assays and has some support from a mouse model (PMIDs:19567676;22464254;11895909). In addition, around 1/3 of osteosarcomas (35%) display loss of MTAP. While heterozygous knockout of MTAP in mice does not cause osteosarcoma, these mice display T-cell lymphoma and the homozygous knockout is embryonic lethal, which indicates the essential nature of the MTAP gene. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between MTAP and diaphyseal medullary stenosis with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (DMS-MFH).
