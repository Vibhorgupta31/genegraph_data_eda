The main symptoms are hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia and mental retardation; visceromegaly and coarse features are also present in infantile cases. Progressive cerebellar atrophy and dysmyelination have been documented by magnetic resonance imaging (ref. 4). Enlarged lysosomes are seen on electron microscopic studies and patients excrete large amounts of free sialic acid in urine. A H+/anionic sugar symporter mechanism for sialic acid and glucuronic acid is impaired in lysosomal membranes from Salla and ISSD patients. The locus for Salla disease was assigned to a region of approximately 200 kb on chromosome 6q14-q15 in a linkage study using Finnish families. Salla disease and ISSD were further shown to be allelic disorders. A physical map with P1 and PAC clones was constructed to cover the 200-kb area flanked by the loci D6S280 and D6S1622, providing the basis for precise physical positioning of the gene. Here we describe a new gene, SLC17A5 (also known as AST), encoding a protein (sialin) with a predicted transport function that belongs to a family of anion/cation symporters (ACS). We found a homozygous SLC17A5 mutation (R39C) in five Finnish patients with Salla disease and six different SLC17A5 mutations in six ISSD patients of different ethnic origins. Our observations suggest that mutations in SLC17A5 are the primary cause of lysosomal sialic acid storage diseases.","dc:creator":"Verheijen FW","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"A new gene, encoding an anion transporter, is mutated in sialic acid storage diseases."}},{"id":"cggv:75d834ea-0ad0-4d10-8d73-353e70ff307c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:65c5ee90-9902-49f2-8968-589cbd6ca02f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10581036"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient AZ"},{"id":"cggv:9a17718a-0db3-45be-9d3b-e072b3fccde3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a17718a-0db3-45be-9d3b-e072b3fccde3_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9a17718a-0db3-45be-9d3b-e072b3fccde3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 15510212: shown to result in undetectable SLC17A5 sialic acid transport activity in HEK293T cells"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:75d834ea-0ad0-4d10-8d73-353e70ff307c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:75d834ea-0ad0-4d10-8d73-353e70ff307c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:75d834ea-0ad0-4d10-8d73-353e70ff307c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 15510212: shown to result in undetectable SLC17A5 sialic acid transport activity in HEK293T cells"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2118d1bf-f441-4dab-adbe-9bed77b279b0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2118d1bf-f441-4dab-adbe-9bed77b279b0","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:04b01057-35ba-4551-9607-e7a839e1b314","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012434.5(SLC17A5):c.526-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/555734"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e6438646-fa56-482c-a9cd-7e4ba1bd4e4d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:04b01057-35ba-4551-9607-e7a839e1b314"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23900835","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by accumulation of covalently unlinked (free) sialic acid in multiple tissues. ISSD and Salla disease (a predominantly neurological disorder) are allelic disorders caused by recessive mutations of a lysosomal anionic monosaccharide transporter, SLC17A5. While Salla disease is common in Finland due to a founder-effect mutation (p.Arg39Cys), ISSD is comparatively rare in all populations studied.Here, we describe the clinical and molecular features of two unrelated Canadian Inuit neonates with a virtually identical presentation of ISSD. Both individuals presented antenatally with fetal hydrops, dying shortly following delivery. Urinary free sialic acid excretion was markedly increased in the one case in which urine could be obtained for testing; postmortem examination showed a picture of widespread lysosomal storage in both. Both children were homozygous for a novel splice site mutation (NM_012434:c.526-2A>G) resulting in skipping of exon 4 and an ensuing frameshift. Analysis of a further 129 pan-Arctic Inuit controls demonstrated a heterozygous carrier rate of 1/129 (~0.4 %) in our sample. Interestingly, lysosomal enzyme studies showed an unexplained ninefold increase in neuraminidase activity, with lesser elevations in the activities of several other lysosomal enzymes. Our results raise the possibility of a common founder mutation presenting as hydrops in this population. Furthermore, if confirmed in subsequent cases, the marked induction of neuraminidase activity seen here may prove useful in the clinical diagnosis of ISSD.

","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2010546","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"A defective efflux of free sialic acid from the lysosomal compartment has been found in the clinically heterogeneous group of sialic acid storage disorders. Using radiolabeled sialic acid (NeuAc) as a substrate, we have recently detected and characterized a proton-driven carrier for sialic acid in the lysosomal membrane from rat liver. This carrier also recognizes and transports other acidic monosaccharides, among which are uronic acids. If no alternative routes of glucuronic acid transport exist, the disposal of uronic acids can be affected in the sialic acid storage disorders. In this study we excluded the existence of more than one acidic monosaccharide carrier by measuring uptake kinetics of labeled glucuronic acid [( 3H]GlcAc) in rat lysosomal membrane vesicles. [3H]GlcAc uptake was carrier-mediated with an affinity constant of transport (Kt) of 0.3 mM and the transport could be cis-inhibited or trans-stimulated to the same extent by sialic acid or glucuronic acid. Human lysosomal membrane vesicles isolated from cultured fibroblasts showed the existence of a similar proton-driven transporter with the same properties as the rat liver system (Kt of [3H]GlcAc uptake 0.28 mM). Uptake studies with [3H]NeuAc and [3H]GlcAc in resealed lysosome membrane vesicles from cultured fibroblasts of patients with different clinical presentation of sialic acid storage showed defective carrier-mediated transport for both sugars. Further evidence that the defective transport of acidic sugars represents the primary genetic defect in sialic acid storage diseases was provided by the observation of reduced, half-normal transport rates in lymphoblast-derived lysosomal membrane vesicles from five unrelated obligate heterozygotes. This study reports the first observation of a human lysosomal transport defect for multiple physiological compounds.","dc:creator":"Mancini GM","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Sialic acid storage diseases.

SLC17A5 encodes solute carrier family 17 member 5 (also known as sialin), a lysosomal membrane transporter protein that exports sialic acid (the majority of which is N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) and other acidic hexoses from lysosomes (PMID: 2010546). Among patients with free sialic acid storage disease, deficient SLC17A5 function results in impaired sialic acid export from lysosomes and lysosomal accumulation of sialic acid (PMID: 15557321), leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations including urinary excretion of free sialic acid, neurological and developmental symptoms with severity ranging from the milder phenotype, Salla disease (SD), to the most severe phenotype, infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) (as reviewed in PMID: 20301643, 33862140).\n\nLumping and splitting: Variants in *SLC17A5* have been reported in individuals with Salla disease (MIM# 604369) and Sialic acid storage disorder, infantile (MIM# 269920). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern for these conditions. Salla disease and Sialic acis storage disorder, infantile represent a clinical continuum (PMIDs: 20301643, 33862140). Therefore, the two entities have been lumped as free sialic acid storage disease.\n\nThe disease mechanism for free SASD is loss of function. ISSD was first reported by Tondeur et al. in 1982 (PMID: 7151835); first report of biallelic variants in SLC17A5 among ISSD patients by Verheijen in 1999 (PMID: 10581036). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between SLC17A5 and ISSD. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 15172005, PMID: 23900835, PMID: 15805149, PMID: 10581036). In total, ten variants from seven probands in four publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence (4 points total) for the relationship between SLC17A5 and free SASD includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (solute carrier family 17 member 5) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified in individuals with ISSD (PMID: 2010546, PMID: 15557321, PMID: 33862140; PMID: 10581036) and the biochemical and clinical features of *SLC17A5* knockout mice (PMID: 28189729). \n\nIn sum, *SLC17A5* is definitively associated with free SASD. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time.
