Affected family members were homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in IDH3B, encoding the beta-subunit of NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH, or IDH3), which is believed to catalyze the oxidation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. Cells from affected individuals had a substantial reduction of NAD-IDH activity, with about a 300-fold increase in the K(m) for NAD. NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-IDH, or IDH2), an enzyme that catalyzes the same reaction, was normal in affected individuals, and they had no health problems associated with the enzyme deficiency except for retinitis pigmentosa. These findings support the hypothesis that mitochondrial NADP-IDH, rather than NAD-IDH, serves as the main catalyst for this reaction in the citric acid cycle outside the retina, and that the retina has a particular requirement for NAD-IDH.","dc:creator":"Hartong DT","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Insights from retinitis pigmentosa into the roles of isocitrate dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5617e337-aa89-44a0-afe0-e142ced68619_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91ff04ce-9621-4d0b-b9b2-48875c2ccc3e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91ff04ce-9621-4d0b-b9b2-48875c2ccc3e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":47,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a38defcb-fecb-48e8-81b1-dfc69d9f317a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006899.5(IDH3B):c.589del (p.Ile197fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/5505"}},"detectionMethod":"subsequently sequenced all 12 exons of IDH3B ","firstTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:853f6ca9-de17-4f04-bf48-55c2a9ee4b6e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a38defcb-fecb-48e8-81b1-dfc69d9f317a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18806796"},"rdfs:label":"003-053"},{"id":"cggv:853f6ca9-de17-4f04-bf48-55c2a9ee4b6e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:853f6ca9-de17-4f04-bf48-55c2a9ee4b6e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:853f6ca9-de17-4f04-bf48-55c2a9ee4b6e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Lymphoblast cell lines were created from peripheral blood lymphocytes from the index patients as well as from their available affected siblings and some unaffected relatives.

IRD covers a set of genetically highly heterogeneous disorders with more than 150 genes associated with one or more clinical forms of IRD. Molecular genetic diagnosis has become increasingly important especially due to expanding number of gene therapy strategies under development. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of gene panels has proven a valuable diagnostic tool in IRD. We present the molecular findings of 677 individuals, residing in Denmark, with IRD and report 806 variants of which 187 are novel. We found that deletions and duplications spanning one or more exons can explain 3% of the cases, and thus copy number variation (CNV) analysis is important in molecular genetic diagnostics of IRD. Seven percent of the individuals have variants classified as pathogenic or likely-pathogenic in more than one gene. Possible Danish founder variants in EYS and RP1 are reported. A significant number of variants were classified as variants with unknown significance; reporting of these will hopefully contribute to the elucidation of the actual clinical consequence making the classification less troublesome in the future. In conclusion, this study underlines the relevance of performing targeted sequencing of IRD including CNV analysis as well as the importance of interaction with clinical diagnoses.","dc:creator":"Jespersgaard C","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Molecular genetic analysis using targeted NGS analysis of 677 individuals with retinal dystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"145"},{"id":"cggv:8823bad7-a6cd-43cd-9bf5-d41c6e3933a4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8823bad7-a6cd-43cd-9bf5-d41c6e3933a4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5617e337-aa89-44a0-afe0-e142ced68619_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7.2},{"id":"cggv:41583c62-79a6-4262-b6bb-964ee5a53f4f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41583c62-79a6-4262-b6bb-964ee5a53f4f","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:7afdfe36-52e2-4f72-982d-556a6a3ed17f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006899.5(IDH3B):c.857G>A (p.Gly286Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9735163"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:2f135e09-6ef1-4153-971b-3483b6ef114e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7afdfe36-52e2-4f72-982d-556a6a3ed17f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31736247","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Retinal dystrophies (RDs) are one of the most genetically heterogeneous monogenic disorders with ~270 associated loci identified by early 2019.

This discovery was made through the evaluation of microarray results from 7 families with retinal disease patients and the identification of 2 novel loss-of-function variants. In these two families with homozygous variants in *IDH3B*, patients exhibited non-syndromic retinal degeneration and none of them showed other symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction (neurological, neuromuscular etc) (Hartong et al., 2008). Cases caused by variants in the *IDH3B* gene are diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 46 (MIM#612572), an autosomal recessive form of Inherited retinal diseases (IRD) characterized by night blindness, loss of peripheral vision, and reduced visual acuity. Dysfunction of IDH3B has been previously correlated with retinal degeneration and male infertility in humans, but tissue-specific effects of IDH3 dysfunction are unclear. To account for a spectrum of retinal phenotypes that may be caused by variants in this gene, and in accordance with the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, the disease entity used for this curation is *IDH3B*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800393).\n\nA total of 4 *IDH3B* variants have already been identified underlying retinitis pigmentosa. The mutation spectrum in *IDH3B* includes 2 missense and 2 frameshift variants (PMID: 18806796, 31736247, 30718709). Case-level evidence is not sufficient to draw any specific conclusions on phenotype/genotype correlations in a yet limited number of patients. In this curation, data from 2 consanguineous families and 2 isolated individuals with 4 unique variants (frameshift, missense), were collected from 3 publications (Hartong et al., 2008, PMID: 18806796, Zenteno, J. C., et al., 2019, PMID: 31736247, Jespersgaard, C., et al., 2019, PMID: 30718709).\n\n*IDH3B* encodes the 385-amino-acid β subunit of isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3), a key enzyme in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle). IDH3 catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate and concurrently converts NAD+ into NADH, which feeds into oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. IDH3 is a heterotetramer composed of the αβ and αγ heterodimers. The α subunit is critical for catalytic activity, but it requires the β and γ subunits for structural assembly and allosteric regulation. Without the β or γ subunit, the α subunit alone has almost no activity. \nLike the *IDH3A* and *IDH3G* genes encoding other subunits, *IDH3B* expresses abundantly in mitochondria-rich tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. Another mitochondrial enzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)-IDH (IDH2), also converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate but uses the cofactor NADP+ instead of NAD+. NADP-IDH may actually be the principal catalyst of the isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate reaction in the citric acid cycle in all tissues, and IDH3 serves as an accessory enzyme that augments or regulates the reaction, with the retina being particularly sensitive to the loss of this accessory activity (Hartong et al., 2008).\n\nAs human patients with apparent loss-of-function variants in *IDH3B* seem to present only with retinal degeneration, Findlay et al., 2018 produced a CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutation in the mouse *Idh3b* gene. *Idh3b−/−* mutant mice are fully viable and show no signs of retinal degeneration within 6 months of age. Although histology and ERG analysis show no significant loss of retinal structure or function, the *Idh3b* mouse retina was confirmed to exhibit a TCA cycle defect. Since the human patients with clear null mutations in IDH3B develop RP in adulthood; the mutant mice might not live long enough to develop retinal degeneration, or this might simply reflect species differences (Findlay et al., 2018).\n\nIn summary, *IDH3B* is moderately associated with *IDH3B*-related retinopathy. This has been demonstrated over time in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings. A Moderate classification has been reached due to the need for further evidence at both the genetic and experimental levels, and additional studies will be required to reach a more definitive classification. This finding was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 1st, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5617e337-aa89-44a0-afe0-e142ced68619"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
