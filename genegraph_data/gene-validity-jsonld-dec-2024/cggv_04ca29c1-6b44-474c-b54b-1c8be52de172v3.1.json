These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.

At least 4 unique missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Four variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28289718, 31173466, 31108500, 34080768). This gene-disease association is supported by the interaction of MRAS with the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the Noonan Syndrome phenotype (PMID: 23875798), as well as interaction with SHOC2 and PPP1CB in the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex (PMID: 35831509). The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has assessed MRAS for associations with Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Costello syndrome, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, however no evidence was reported. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel on 8/27/20. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel on 8/27/20. It was reevaluated on 12/14/22. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:04ca29c1-6b44-474c-b54b-1c8be52de172"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
