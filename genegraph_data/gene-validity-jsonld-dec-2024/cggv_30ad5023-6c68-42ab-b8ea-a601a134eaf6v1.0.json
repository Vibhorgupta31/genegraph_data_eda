Missense mutations and whole gene deletions in RAD21 have been identified in children with growth retardation, minor skeletal anomalies and facial features that overlap findings in individuals with CdLS. We report the first intragenic deletion and frameshift mutations identified in RAD21 in two patients presenting with atypical CdLS. One patient had an in-frame deletion of exon 13, while the second patient had a c.592_593dup frameshift mutation. The first patient presented with developmental delay, hypospadias, inguinal hernia and dysmorphic features while, the second patient presented with developmental delay, characteristic facial features, hirsutism, and hand and feet anomalies, with the first patient being milder than the second. The in-frame deletion mutation was found to be inherited from the mother who had a history of melanoma and other unspecified medical problems. This study expands the spectrum of RAD21 mutations and emphasizes the clinical utility of performing RAD21 mutation analysis in patients presenting with atypical forms of CdLS.

Cohesin and its regulatory proteins have been implicated in several human developmental disorders, including Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) and Roberts syndromes. Here we show that human mutations in the integral cohesin structural protein RAD21 result in a congenital phenotype consistent with a \"cohesinopathy.\" Children with RAD21 mutations display growth retardation, minor skeletal anomalies, and facial features that overlap findings in individuals with CdLS. Notably, unlike children with mutations in NIPBL, SMC1A, or SMC3, these individuals have much milder cognitive impairment than those with classical CdLS. Mechanistically, these mutations act at the RAD21 interface with the other cohesin proteins STAG2 and SMC1A, impair cellular DNA damage response, and disrupt transcription in a zebrafish model. Our data suggest that, compared to loss-of-function mutations, dominant missense mutations result in more severe functional defects and cause worse structural and cognitive clinical findings.

Maintaining balanced levels of Runx proteins is crucial, as deregulated expression leads to cancers and developmental disorders. We conducted a forward genetic screen in zebrafish for positive regulators of runx1 that yielded the cohesin subunit rad21. Zebrafish embryos lacking Rad21, or cohesin subunit Smc3, fail to express runx3 and lose hematopoietic runx1 expression in early embryonic development. Failure to develop differentiated blood cells in rad21 mutants is partially rescued by microinjection of runx1 mRNA. Significantly, monoallelic loss of rad21 caused a reduction in the transcription of runx1 and of the proneural genes ascl1a and ascl1b, indicating that downstream genes are sensitive to Rad21 dose. Changes in gene expression were observed in a reduced cohesin background in which cell division was able to proceed, indicating that cohesin might have a function in transcription that is separable from its mitotic role. Cohesin is a protein complex essential for sister chromatid cohesion and DNA repair that also appears to be essential for normal development through as yet unknown mechanisms. Our findings provide evidence for a novel role for cohesin in development, and indicate potential for monoallelic loss of cohesin subunits to alter gene expression.","dc:creator":"Horsfield JA","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Cohesin-dependent regulation of Runx genes."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of nz171 mutant zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for zebrafish model."},{"id":"cggv:67ea5a95-3420-477e-88bb-573f57dcb2c1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ff9f087-d68c-4b4a-a50f-bd06b5740fcb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Poor growth, congenital heart disease, and small head size are features of CdLs.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25378554","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cohesinopathies are human genetic disorders that include Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) and Roberts syndrome (RBS) and are characterized by defects in limb and craniofacial development as well as mental retardation. The developmental phenotypes of CdLS and other cohesinopathies suggest that mutations in the structure and regulation of the cohesin complex during embryogenesis interfere with gene regulation. In a previous project, we showed that RBS was associated with highly fragmented nucleoli and defects in both ribosome biogenesis and protein translation. l-leucine stimulation of the mTOR pathway partially rescued translation in human RBS cells and development in zebrafish models of RBS. In this study, we investigate protein translation in zebrafish models of CdLS. Our results show that phosphorylation of RPS6 as well as 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) was reduced in nipbla/b, rad21 and smc3-morphant embryos, a pattern indicating reduced translation. Moreover, protein biosynthesis and rRNA production were decreased in the cohesin morphant embryo cells. l-leucine partly rescued protein synthesis and rRNA production in the cohesin morphants and partially restored phosphorylation of RPS6 and 4EBP1. Concomitantly, l-leucine treatment partially improved cohesinopathy embryo development including the formation of craniofacial cartilage. Interestingly, we observed that alpha-ketoisocaproate (α-KIC), which is a keto derivative of leucine, also partially rescued the development of rad21 and nipbla/b morphants by boosting mTOR-dependent translation. In summary, our results suggest that cohesinopathies are caused in part by defective protein synthesis, and stimulation of the mTOR pathway through l-leucine or its metabolite α-KIC can partially rescue development in zebrafish models for CdLS.

CdLS is characterized by phenotypes including intellectual disability, autism, developmental delay, characteristic facial dysmorphisms, short stature, and other skeletal anomalies. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Seven probands harboring missense and truncating variants as well as an in-frame deletion are documented here, although additional cases have been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 22633399, 24378232, 27882533, 27620904, 30716475, 30125677). While the majority of cases occurred de novo, variants in RAD21 segregated with CdLS-like features in 3 additional individuals in 1 family, although their phenotypes were considered too mild by the authors to be diagnosed with classical CdLS (PMID: 27882533). Of note, RAD21 has been associated with a milder form of CdLS compared to other genes such as NIPBL, HDAC8, and SMC1A. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and a rescue experiment (PMIDs: 17567667, 25378554). In summary, RAD21 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Cornelia de Lange syndrome.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:30ad5023-6c68-42ab-b8ea-a601a134eaf6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
