Heterozygous deletions of ZIC1 and its nearby paralog ZIC4 on chromosome 3q25.1 are associated with Dandy-Walker malformation of the cerebellum, and loss of the orthologous Zic1 gene in the mouse causes cerebellar hypoplasia and vertebral defects. We describe individuals from five families with heterozygous mutations located in the final (third) exon of ZIC1 (encoding four nonsense and one missense change) who have a distinct phenotype in which severe craniosynostosis, specifically involving the coronal sutures, and variable learning disability are the most characteristic features. The location of the nonsense mutations predicts escape of mutant ZIC1 transcripts from nonsense-mediated decay, which was confirmed in a cell line from an affected individual. Both nonsense and missense mutations are associated with altered and/or enhanced expression of a target gene, engrailed-2, in a Xenopus embryo assay. Analysis of mouse embryos revealed a localized domain of Zic1 expression at embryonic days 11.5-12.5 in a region overlapping the supraorbital regulatory center, which patterns the coronal suture. We conclude that the human mutations uncover a previously unsuspected role for Zic1 in early cranial suture development, potentially by regulating engrailed 1, which was previously shown to be critical for positioning of the murine coronal suture. The diagnosis of a ZIC1 mutation has significant implications for prognosis and we recommend genetic testing when common causes of coronal synostosis have been excluded.","dc:creator":"Twigg SR","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Gain-of-Function Mutations in ZIC1 Are Associated with Coronal Craniosynostosis and Learning Disability."},"rdfs:label":"GTEX Expression data"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e70d90a2-6365-49ac-a21f-599ff5906d88_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4cce9ae3-1507-4040-b1f8-ee0bbd9ab178","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23264f59-ba97-4c9c-9222-e9da9c546a65","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The mutant embryos had significantly enhanced Wnt expression and more disrupted embyros than the wildtype.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities craniosynostosis 6 (OMIM: 616602) and structural brain anomalies without craniosynostosis (no OMIM term). The split curation for autosomal recessive structural brain anomalies without craniosynostosis will be curated separately. Ten variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense) that have been reported in at least 17 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 26340333, 27884935, 30391508, 32975022, 33288889, 35591945, 36118902, 37086723) are included in this curation. The variants associated with this disease are all in the C-terminal region, the disruption of which enhances en-2 expression. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be gain-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (GTEx expression data, Xenopus oocyte functional evidence; PMID: 26340333). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between ZIC1 and autosomal dominant craniosynostosis 6. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP on the meeting date 1/18/2024 (SOP Version 10).
