Together with other proteins involved in DNA repair processes and cell division, the FA proteins maintain genome homeostasis, and germline mutation of any one of the genes that encode FA proteins causes FA. Monoallelic inactivation of some FA genes, such as FA complementation group D1 (FANCD1; also known as the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2), leads to adult-onset cancer predisposition but does not cause FA, and somatic mutations in FA genes occur in cancers in the general population. Carcinogenesis resulting from a dysregulated FA pathway is multifaceted, as FA proteins monitor multiple complementary genome-surveillance checkpoints throughout interphase, where monoubiquitylation of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer by the FA core complex promotes recruitment of DNA repair effectors to chromatin lesions to resolve DNA damage and mitosis. In this Review, we discuss how the FA pathway safeguards genome integrity throughout the cell cycle and show how studies of FA have revealed opportunities to develop rational therapeutics for this genetic disease and for malignancies that acquire somatic mutations within the FA pathway.","dc:creator":"Nalepa G","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Fanconi anaemia and cancer: an intricate relationship."},"rdfs:label":"BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51C have been established as FA gene"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"0.5 point for each genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1 and RAD51C)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:3ebabbf1-1a43-4a57-b0b8-2b29bb57ade1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2cd3b7a0-189d-4641-9d24-b10d9d46db24","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:baa3ca36-2d4a-4981-884c-3ac94a3d8d39","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"BRCA2 protein was mislocalized, being grossly depleted from the nuclear pellet (P100) fraction (Fig. 1d).

The similarity in the phenotypes between Palb2, Brca1 and Brca2 knockout mice further supports the functional relationship shown in vitro for these three proteins.

No full length PALB2 protein was detected in patient (EUFA1341)'s lymphoblasts and fibroblasts. The patients cells also show hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents and lacked BRCA2. Palb2-/-mouse model have been established to show consistent phenotypes with FA patients and Brca1 and Brca2 knockout mice including mesoderm differentiation defect and early embryonic lethality. Introduction of wild-type PALB2 into EUFA1341 fibroblasts cells normalized the association of BRCA2 with the chromatin/nuclear matrix fraction, the ability to form Rad51 foci and the sensitivity to MMC. PALB2 ∆ChAM did not rescue the sensitivity phenotype. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the PALB2 gene and Fanconi anemia complementation group N.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3ebabbf1-1a43-4a57-b0b8-2b29bb57ade1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
