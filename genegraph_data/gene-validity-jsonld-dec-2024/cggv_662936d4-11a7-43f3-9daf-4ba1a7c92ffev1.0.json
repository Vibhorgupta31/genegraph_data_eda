The secretion-defective LGI1(E383A) protein was recognized by the ER quality-control machinery and prematurely degraded, whereas the secretable LGI1(S473L) protein abnormally dimerized and was selectively defective in binding to one of its receptors, ADAM22. Both mutations caused a loss of function, compromising intracellular trafficking or ligand activity of LGI1 and converging on reduced synaptic LGI1-ADAM22 interaction. A chemical corrector, 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), restored LGI1(E383A) folding and binding to ADAM22 and ameliorated the increased seizure susceptibility of the LGI1(E383A) model mice.

Almost all LGI1−/− mice died suddenly during the postnatal third week (p.3799).  Heterozygotes had no overt abnormalities.  Authors investigated if heterozygotes had lower threshold for seizure induction by PTZ.   Generalized clonic or tonic seizures (seizure score 4 or 5) were observed in 8 LGI1+/− mice (42.1%) compared with only one wild-type mouse (8.3%) (Fig. 1E).   The lethal phenotype in LGI1 -/- mice was rescued by crossbreeding with transgenic mice expressing LGI1 under the neuron specific Thy1 promoter.  Authors found that LGI1 bound to ADAM22 and ADAM23 using tandem affinity purification.  Large scale purification with shotgun proteomic analysis found the global LGI1 complex contained ADAM22, ADAM23, ADAM11, PSD95, PSD93, SAP97, CASK, Lin7 and Kv1.  Targeted disruption of ADAM22, ADAM23 , and Kv1 channel, causes a similar epileptic phenotype (generalized tonic–clonic seizures beginning around the postnatal second or third week) and premature death in mice, suggesting that LGI1, ADAM22, ADAM23, and Kv1 channel are genetically associated and functionally related.  With cell surface binding assay, found LGI1 directly binds to ADAM22 and ADAM23 on cell surface.  Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LGI1 predominantly occurs in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. . Specific strong staining was observed in the neuropil of the hippocampus.

Mutations in a secreted neuronal protein, leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1), were reported in patients with an inherited form of human epilepsy, autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF). Here, we report an essential role of LGI1 as an antiepileptogenic ligand. We find that loss of LGI1 in mice (LGI1(-/-)) causes lethal epilepsy, which is specifically rescued by the neuronal expression of LGI1 transgene, but not LGI3. Moreover, heterozygous mice for the LGI1 mutation (LGI1(+/-)) show lowered seizure thresholds. Extracellularly secreted LGI1 links two epilepsy-related receptors, ADAM22 and ADAM23, in the brain and organizes a transsynaptic protein complex that includes presynaptic potassium channels and postsynaptic AMPA receptor scaffolds. A lack of LGI1 disrupts this synaptic protein connection and selectively reduces AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, LGI1 may serve as a major determinant of brain excitation, and the LGI1 gene-targeted mouse provides a good model for human epilepsy.","dc:creator":"Fukata Y","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Disruption of LGI1-linked synaptic complex causes abnormal synaptic transmission and epilepsy."},"rdfs:label":"Knock out Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5c720590-778a-4ab1-a726-aef77bb84502","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6344f777-402d-47f2-bacb-796641a380f2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Created KO mice with deletion exons 6-7 and confirmed by Western blot.

The LGI1 gene encodes a protein secreted by neurons, one of the only non-ion channel genes implicated in idiopathic familial epilepsy. While mutations probably result in a loss of function, the role of LGI1 in the pathophysiology of epilepsy remains unclear. Here we generated a germline knockout mouse for LGI1 and examined spontaneous seizure characteristics, changes in threshold for induced seizures and hippocampal pathology. Frequent spontaneous seizures emerged in homozygous LGI1(-/-) mice during the second postnatal week. Properties of these spontaneous events were examined in a simultaneous video and intracranial electroencephalographic recording. Their mean duration was 120 +/- 12 s, and behavioural correlates consisted of an initial immobility, automatisms, sometimes followed by wild running and tonic and/or clonic movements. Electroencephalographic monitoring indicated that seizures originated earlier in the hippocampus than in the cortex. LGI1(-/-) mice did not survive beyond postnatal day 20, probably due to seizures and failure to feed. While no major developmental abnormalities were observed, after recurrent seizures we detected neuronal loss, mossy fibre sprouting, astrocyte reactivity and granule cell dispersion in the hippocampus of LGI1(-/-) mice. In contrast, heterozygous LGI1(+/-) littermates displayed no spontaneous behavioural epileptic seizures, but auditory stimuli induced seizures at a lower threshold, reflecting the human pathology of sound-triggered seizures in some patients. We conclude that LGI1(+/-) and LGI1(-/-) mice may provide useful models for lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, and more generally idiopathic focal epilepsy.","dc:creator":"Chabrol E","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Electroclinical characterization of epileptic seizures in leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Knock out Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":963,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7fedb1f5-b08b-4e23-a355-96f9bd6d845e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010898","gene":"hgnc:6572","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Autosomal Dominant Epilepsy with Auditory Features (ADEAF), also known as familial temporal lobe epilepsy, is characterized by seizures originating in the temporal lobe associated with auditory symptoms (ringing, buzzing, and distortion of sounds) and receptive aphasia.  The condition can also be associated with non-auditory seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures.  Onset can occur from early childhood through the 5th decade, typically during adolescence or early adulthood, and seizures tend to be well-controlled.  ADEAF is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance, estimated at approximately 60%.  Rare de novo mutations have been reported and ADEAF is associated with intrafamilial variability.  LGI1 is the primary gene implicated in ADEAF and was initially described in 2002 (Kalichov et al, PMID 11810107). Since that time, numerous families have been reported in the literature, with over 40 disease-causing mutations reported, typically unique to individual families.  The mutation spectrum includes nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense and large deletions with loss of function as the mechanism of disease (Kalichov et al, PMID 11810107;  Morante-Redolat et al, PMID 11978770;  Chabrol et al, PMID 17296837; Sadleir et al, PMID: 24206907;  Hedera et al, PubMed 15009222;  Michelucci et al, PMID 14510822;  Fanciulli et al, PMID 22496201;  Kesim et al, PMID 26773249).  Supporting experimental evidence includes functional alteration in non-patient cells (Yokoi et al, PMID 25485908),  expression (Fukata et al, PMID 16990550;  Fukata et al, 20133599),  non-human model organism (Yu et al, 20130004;  Baulac et al, 22589250;  Teng et al, 20819949;  Chabrol et al, 20659958;  Fukata et al, 20133599), and rescue in non-human model organism (Fukata et al, 20133599).   A genetic evidence score of 12 and experimental evidence score of 6 results in a total score of 18.  Evidence supporting an association between LGI1 and ADEAF has been replicated over time; therefore, the gene-disease validity has been classified as DEFINITIVE.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:662936d4-11a7-43f3-9daf-4ba1a7c92ffe"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
