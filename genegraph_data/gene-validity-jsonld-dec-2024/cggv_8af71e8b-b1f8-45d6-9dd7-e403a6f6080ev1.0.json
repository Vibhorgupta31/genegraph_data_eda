Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Å resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Complex I structural model "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"MT-ND3 is one of at least 19 complex I subunits associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum (Rahman et al. 2017)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:8af71e8b-b1f8-45d6-9dd7-e403a6f6080e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb06083d-1765-486d-ae59-42be2bbac5de","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c427f4a-5e32-462a-bfa4-896c036bc3b3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblast cells derived from patients 1, 2, 4, see case data) and heteroplasmic  for m.10158T>C(p.Ser34Pro) (P1, P2) or m.10191T>C (P4).

Respiratory chain complex I deficiency is the most common energy generation disorder and a frequent cause of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies such as Leigh's disease and lethal infantile mitochondrial disease. Most such cases have been assumed to be caused by nuclear gene defects, but recently an increasing number have been shown to be caused by mutations in the mitochondrially encoded complex I subunit genes ND4, ND5, and ND6. We report the first four cases of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies caused by mutations in the ND3 subunit gene. Three unrelated children have the same novel heteroplasmic mutation (T10158C), only the second mutation reported in ND3, and one has the previously identified T10191C mutation. Both mutations cause disproportionately greater reductions in enzyme activity than in the amount of fully assembled complex I, suggesting the ND3 subunit plays an unknown but important role in electron transport, proton pumping, or ubiquinone binding. Three cases appear to have a de novo mutation, with no mutation detected in maternal relatives. Mitochondrial DNA disease may be considerably more prevalent in the pediatric population than currently predicted and should be considered in patients with infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies and complex I deficiency.","dc:creator":"McFarland R","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"De novo mutations in the mitochondrial ND3 gene as a cause of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathy and complex I deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Reduced levels of assembled Complex I"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduction in complex I assembly.

The *MT-ND3* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND3. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *MT-ND3* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2003 (PMID: 14684687). Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-ND3* and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 5 variants in 14 cases (1 with m.10134C>A, 5 with m.10158T>C, 3 with m.10191T>C, 4 with m.10197G>A, 1 with m.10254G>A) from 7 publications (PMIDs: 14684687, 14705112, 14764913, 17152068, 20202874, 25118196, 25384404). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants (the total score for genetic level evidence in this curation was 19.5). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 27509854, 14705112). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8af71e8b-b1f8-45d6-9dd7-e403a6f6080e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
