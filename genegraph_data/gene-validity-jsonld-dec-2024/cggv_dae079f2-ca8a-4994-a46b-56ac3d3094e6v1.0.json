Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"CV subunit"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This gene is a known CV subunit."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:dae079f2-ca8a-4994-a46b-56ac3d3094e6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e7bba60-6de8-478b-8633-57ac91e40369","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:187c43aa-d878-46bc-854f-a81571803ea3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"100% mutant cybrids (generated from patient with m.8424T>C; control was cybrids with benign variant - m.8648G>A)​","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32858252","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To address the frequency of complex V defects, we systematically sequenced MT-ATP6/8 genes in 512 consecutive patients.

However, animal models for mtDNA-associated diseases are rare, making it challenging to explore mechanisms underlying the contribution of mitochondria. Here, we identify a polymorphism in the mitochondrial genome, G-to-T at position 7778, which results in an aspartic acid-to-tyrosine (D-Y) substitution in the fifth amino acid of the highly conserved N-terminus of ATP synthase 8 (ATP8). Using a series of conplastic strains we show that this polymorphism increases susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases, including collagen-induced arthritis, autoimmune diabetes, nephritis and autoimmune pancreatitis. In addition, it impairs reproductive performance in females, but only in the MRL/MpJ strain. We also demonstrate that the mtAtp8 polymorphism alters mitochondrial performance, increasing H(2)O(2) production and affecting mitochondrial structure. Functional analysis reveals that the polymorphism increase the CD4 T cell adaptive potential to an oxidative phosphorylation impaired condition. Our findings provide direct experimental evidence for the role of mitochondria in autoimmunity and reproduction.","dc:creator":"Yu X","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"The mtDNA nt7778 G/T polymorphism affects autoimmune diseases and reproductive performance in the mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Yu_mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This Expert Panel agreed to award 0.5 point for biochemistry and 0.5 point for phenotype."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5},{"id":"cggv:dae079f2-ca8a-4994-a46b-56ac3d3094e6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.2}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6189,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":4.7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6e9abdb2-6ec1-4fbc-8cd8-c706eda982a9","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:7415","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001427"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-ATP8* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 28, 2022. The *MT-ATP8* gene encodes the ATP synthase (complex V) subunit 8. Defects of this protein lead to complex V deficiency.\n\nThe *MT-ATP8* gene was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 2010 (PMID: 20207608). There have been several additional reports linking variants in this gene to various phenotypes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, including before 2010, but there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the features seen in reported individuals were caused by the identified variants (PMIDs: 15452396, 11062027, 28027978, 23735083, 32858252). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ATP8*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-ATP8* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three variants (m.8403T>C, m.8411A>G, m.8424T>C) identified in three probands from three publications (PMIDs: 24153443, 20207608, 32858252). Age of onset varied from birth to the 30s. Features in affected individuals included muscle weakness, wasting, and cramping; dysarthria, headache, periodic paralysis, seizures, mood disorder, neuropathy, pancreatitis, diarrhea, and weight loss. Brain imaging revealed cerebellar atrophy and labs showed elevated lactate. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (complex V subunit) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and model organisms (PMIDs: 33340416, 32858252, 19759059, 22919063).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 28, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
