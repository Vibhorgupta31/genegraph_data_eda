We have now investigated six newly acquired families of Australian and Canadian (Province of Quebec) origin and resequenced the entire coding region of SLC6A19 in families with only a single disease allele identified. We also studied one American family in whom no mutations had been identified in a previous study (Kleta et al., Nat Genet 2004;36:999-1002). We have identified seven novel mutations in SLC6A19 that show functional obliteration of the protein in vitro, explaining Hartnup disorder in all reported families so far. We demonstrate that Hartnup disorder is allelically heterogeneous with two mutated SLC6A19 alleles, whether identical or not, necessary for manifestation of the characteristic aminoaciduria in affected individuals.

Using homozygosity mapping in the original family in whom Hartnup disorder was discovered, we confirmed that the critical region for one causative gene was located on chromosome 5p15 (ref. 3). This region is homologous to the area of mouse chromosome 13 that encodes the sodium-dependent amino acid transporter B(0)AT1 (ref. 4). We isolated the human homolog of B(0)AT1, called SLC6A19, and determined its size and molecular organization. We then identified mutations in SLC6A19 in members of the original family in whom Hartnup disorder was discovered and of three Japanese families.

It is generally assumed that most neutral amino acids are transported across the apical membrane of epithelial cells by system B(0). Here we have characterized a novel member of the Na(+)-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (B(0)AT1) isolated from mouse kidney, which shows all properties of system B(0). Flux experiments showed that the transporter is Na(+)-dependent, electrogenic, and actively transports most neutral amino acids but not anionic or cationic amino acids. Superfusion of mB(0)AT1-expressing oocytes with neutral amino acids generated inward currents, which were proportional to the fluxes observed with labeled amino acids. In situ hybridization showed strong expression in intestinal microvilli and in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Expression of mouse B(0)AT1 was restricted to kidney, intestine, and skin. It is generally assumed that mutations of the system B(0) transporter underlie autosomal recessive Hartnup disorder. In support of this notion mB(0)AT1 is located on mouse chromosome 13 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 5p15, the locus of Hartnup disorder. Thus, the human homologue of this transporter is an excellent functional and positional candidate for Hartnup disorder.","dc:creator":"Bröer A","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Molecular cloning of mouse amino acid transport system B0, a neutral amino acid transporter related to Hartnup disorder."},"rdfs:label":"Molecular Cloning of Mouse Amino Acid Transport System B0"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Counted separately"},{"id":"cggv:f87c0e85-d0ac-45d8-80dc-065e0a5e2157","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:faa45ab5-fdac-4913-aadc-a8b511893ff0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Collectrin in the the kidneys, ACE2 in the small intestine","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19472175","rdfs:label":"The role of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1(SLC6A1)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Genes have not been associated with Hartnup specifically."},{"id":"cggv:2930540e-7fea-4752-aa23-5c4e7a7c8503","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:474d668d-da6e-45c0-8e9b-31c1be085853","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Although many early reported cases of Hartnup disease display phenotypes such as intellectual disability, cutaneous photosensitivity, and rashes, the only consistent phenotype among all cases is neutral hyperaminoaciduria due to defective neutral amino acid transport in the digestive tract.

No histological difference was detected between the two lines of mice in these organ systems. The hallmark of Hartnup disease, increased urinary excretion of neutral amino acids, was specifically present in the mutant mouse line compared to the wild-type. Specifically, large amounts of neutral amino acids, such as alanine, asparagine, glycine, glutamine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine were observed (Fig 3). Transport experiments determined that Na+-dependent leucine uptake was absent in mutant and present in wild-type. Glutamine and histidine showed residual transport ativity but inhibited the other when overexpressed. Intestinal vesicles also displayed an absence of Na+-dependent transport and a further decrease in glucose uptake. Consistent with the absence of viable amino acid absorption, nullizygous mice were smaller in development by ∼17 and 14% less for male and female mice respectively.

To understand the role of epithelial neutral amino acid uptake in whole body homeostasis, we analyzed mice lacking the apical broad-spectrum neutral (0) amino acid transporter B(0)AT1 (Slc6a19). A general neutral aminoaciduria was observed similar to human Hartnup disorder which is caused by mutations in SLC6A19. Na(+)-dependent uptake of neutral amino acids into the intestine and renal brush-border membrane vesicles was abolished. No compensatory increase of peptide transport or other neutral amino acid transporters was detected. Mice lacking B(0)AT1 showed a reduced body weight. When adapted to a standard 20% protein diet, B(0)AT1-deficient mice lost body weight rapidly on diets containing 6 or 40% protein. Secretion of insulin in response to food ingestion after fasting was blunted. In the intestine, amino acid signaling to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was reduced, whereas the GCN2/ATF4 stress response pathway was activated, indicating amino acid deprivation in epithelial cells.

At least 19 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel,\nnonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in\nhumans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nThe first proband with this disorder was reported by Baron et al in 1956 (PMID: 13358233). This case report established neutral hyperaminoaciduria as the primary phenotype observed, with others such as skin rash, developmental delay, difficulty walking, and muscle atrophy also arising in some with null B0AT1 transport activity. Since that publication and genetic characterization in Kleta et al, variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 more probands mostly of European or Asian ancestry (PMIDs: 15286787, 15286788, 18484095). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in about 10 additional family members, yielding a total combined LOD score of 6. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with defective amino acid transport causing the characteristic neutral hyperaminoaciduria and limiting the absorption within the kidney and/or small intestine. Of note, this gene has also been potentially implicated in iminoglycinuria and hyperglycinuria in combination with other transporters such as SLC36A2 and SLC6A20. These assertions will be assessed separately.\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function data, RNA and protein expression, and a knockout mouse model. SLC6A19's neutral amino acid transport function combined with the near-exclusive expression in the kidney and small intestine provides significant evidence towards the pathogenicity. The knockout mouse model also showed the characteristic neutral hyperaminoaciduria and defective transport, as well as short stature. \nIn summary, SLC6A19 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hartnup disease.This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:44c34762-450b-4abd-8fe4-3f17ff700630"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
