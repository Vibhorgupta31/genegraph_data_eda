A genetic etiology is likely in most cases yet only few genes have been formally correlated with male infertility. Homozygosity mapping was carried out on a cohort of 20 North African individuals, including 18 index cases, presenting with primary infertility resulting from impaired sperm motility caused by a mosaic of multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) including absent, short, coiled, bent, and irregular flagella. Five unrelated subjects out of 18 (28%) carried a homozygous variant in DNAH1, which encodes an inner dynein heavy chain and is expressed in testis. RT-PCR, immunostaining, and electronic microscopy were carried out on samples from one of the subjects with a mutation located on a donor splice site. Neither the transcript nor the protein was observed in this individual, confirming the pathogenicity of this variant. A general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization of the microtubule doublets and loss of the inner dynein arms was observed. Although DNAH1 is also expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility was the only symptom of primary ciliary dyskinesia observed in affected subjects, suggesting that DNAH1 function in cilium is not as critical as in sperm flagellum.

Here, we describe and examine the genetic requirements for missing minor mitochondria (mmm), sterile affecting ciliogenesis (sac), and testes of unusual size (tous), three previously uncharacterized genes in Drosophila that are predicted to be components of the flagellar axoneme. Using Drosophila, we demonstrate that these genes are essential for male fertility and that loss of mmm, sac, or tous results in complete immotility of the sperm flagellum. Cytological examination uncovered additional roles for sac and tous during cytokinesis and transmission electron microscopy of developing spermatids in mmm, sac, and tous mutant animals revealed defects associated with mitochondria and the accessory microtubules required for the proper elongation of the mitochondria and flagella during ciliogenesis. This study highlights the complex interactions of cilia-related proteins within the cell body and advances our understanding of male infertility by uncovering novel mitochondrial defects during spermatogenesis.","dc:creator":"Bauerly E","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Impact of cilia-related genes on mitochondrial dynamics during Drosophila spermatogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of CG14651 mutants "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"CG14651 in Drosophila is not exclusively similar to DNAH1.

In most cases, axonemal defects are present, i.e. PCD patients often lack inner and/or outer dynein arms in their sperm tails and cilia, supporting the hypothesis that mutations in dynein genes may cause PCD. However, to date it is unclear whether mutations in dynein heavy chain genes are responsible for impaired flagellar and ciliary motility in mammals. To elucidate the role of the mouse dynein heavy chain 7 (MDHC7) gene, which encodes a component of the inner dynein arm, we have generated mice lacking this dynein heavy chain isoform. Both MDHC7(+/-) and MDHC7(-/-) mice are viable and show no malformations; however, homozygous males produce no offspring. In comparison to MDHC7(+/-) and wild-type mice the spermatozoa of MDHC7(-/-) mice revealed a dramatic reduced straight line velocity and progressive movement, resulting in the inability of MDHC7-deficient sperm to move from the uterus into the oviduct. Additionally, we measured the beat frequency of tracheal cilia and observed a decrease in the beat frequency of approximately 50% in MDHC7(-/-) mice. The reduction in both ciliary and flagellar motility is not correlated with any gross defects in the axonemal structure. The phenotype of MDHC7(-/-) mice is similar to that observed in some patients suffering from PCD, and our data strongly suggest that in some patients this disease could be due to mutations in the homologous human gene DNAH1 (HDHC7).","dc:creator":"Neesen J","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Disruption of an inner arm dynein heavy chain gene results in asthenozoospermia and reduced ciliary beat frequency."},"rdfs:label":"Analysis of the sperm motility of MDHC7–/– mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:4a5dff5a-ff66-4e80-9eca-cb5f924edb73_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4a5dff5a-ff66-4e80-9eca-cb5f924edb73_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:31ac1c75-6c47-4585-a117-1318ead3e18b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31ac1c75-6c47-4585-a117-1318ead3e18b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:aeed7303-b8b5-4568-8e54-15de625072e1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015512.5(DNAH1):c.11788-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353081369"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003251","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:97f7d8e2-3e6d-4d23-9e22-336fb0ff8e57_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:aeed7303-b8b5-4568-8e54-15de625072e1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24360805"},"rdfs:label":"P3"},{"id":"cggv:97f7d8e2-3e6d-4d23-9e22-336fb0ff8e57","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97f7d8e2-3e6d-4d23-9e22-336fb0ff8e57_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:97f7d8e2-3e6d-4d23-9e22-336fb0ff8e57_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR analyses of subject P3 and control individuals from the general population.

DNAH1 belongs to the axonemal inner dynein arm DHC group and is expressed in lungs and sperm flagella (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014, PMID: 24360805 and Neesen, 2001, PMID: 11371505).\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group and due to balanced evidence and phenotypic variability, the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP working group estimated that SPGF18 (OMIM: 617576, MONDO:0054615) and Primary Ciliary dyskinesia 37 (PCD37) (OMIM: 617577, MONDO: 0033204) represent distinct diseases and decided to split the entities.\nEvidence from 10 probands in 4 publications were included in this curation (PMID: 24360805, PMID: 27798045, PMID: 29449551 and PMID: 34867808) representing 10 unique variants (3 missense, 3 splice site, 3 frameshift and 1 stop-loss). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. The DNAH1 mRNA and protein are proved to be expressed in testis (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014, PMID: 24360805, Sironen et al., 2020, PMID: 31781811 and Uhlen et al., 2015, PMID: 25613900). Also, by immunostaining, DNAH1 is observed in sperm flagella (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014, PMID: 24360805 and Amiri-Yekta et al., 2016, PMID: 27798045). \nMoreover, patients' sperm cells have shown flagellar morphological abnormalities and impaired motility (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014, PMID: 24360805 and Amiri-Yekta et al., 2016, PMID:27798045). This highlights the altered flagellar function caused by mutations in DNAH1. \nMice lacking the dynein heavy chain-7 (Mdhc7) gene; a component of the inner dynein arm and the ortholog of DNAH1 in Humans, were generated (Neesen, 2001, PMID: 11371505). Homozygous males produced no offspring. Sperm cells from Mdhc7 -/- mice revealed a dramatically reduced straight line velocity and progressive movement, resulting in the inability of Mdhc7-deficient sperm to move from the uterus into the oviduct. The reduction in flagellar motility was not correlated with any clear defects in the axonemal structure. Similar results were obtained in a recent study (Khan et al., 2021, PMID: 34867808). The phenotype of DNAH1 deficient mice is similar to that observed in patients with SPGF18. Additionally, the sequence of the CG14651 gene in Drosophila is 45% similar to DNAH1 in Humans. CG14651 deficient male flies have shown immotile sperms (Bauerly et al., 2022, PMID: 34822845). Authors of this study have been able to rescue the fertility of n=9/10 male flies.\nIn summary, DNAH1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Spermatogenic failure-18. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on May 26, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4a5dff5a-ff66-4e80-9eca-cb5f924edb73"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
