Although mutations in three genes (LRP5, FZD4, and NDP) are known to cause FEVR, these account for only a fraction of FEVR cases. The proteins encoded by these FEVR genes form part of a signaling complex that activates the Norrin-beta-catenin signaling pathway. Recently, through a large-scale reverse genetic screen in mice, Junge and colleagues identified an additional member of this signaling complex, Tspan12. Here, we report that mutations in TSPAN12 also cause autosomal-dominant FEVR. We describe seven mutations identified in a cohort of 70 FEVR patients in whom we had already excluded the known FEVR genes.

To date, mutations in three genes (FZD4, LRP5, and NDP) have been shown to be causative for FEVR. In two large Dutch pedigrees segregating autosomal-dominant FEVR, genome-wide SNP analysis identified an FEVR locus of approximately 40 Mb on chromosome 7. Microsatellite marker analysis suggested similar at risk haplotypes in patients of both families. To identify the causative gene, we applied next-generation sequencing in the proband of one of the families, by analyzing all exons and intron-exon boundaries of 338 genes, in addition to microRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and other highly conserved genomic regions in the 40 Mb linkage interval. After detailed bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data, prioritization of all detected sequence variants led to three candidates to be considered as the causative genetic defect in this family. One of these variants was an alanine-to-proline substitution in the transmembrane 4 superfamily member 12 protein, encoded by TSPAN12. This protein has very recently been implicated in regulating the development of retinal vasculature, together with the proteins encoded by FZD4, LRP5, and NDP. Sequence analysis of TSPAN12 revealed two mutations segregating in five of 11 FEVR families, indicating that mutations in TSPAN12 are a relatively frequent cause of FEVR. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of targeted next-generation sequencing technology to identify disease genes in linkage intervals.","dc:creator":"Nikopoulos K","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Next-generation sequencing of a 40 Mb linkage interval reveals TSPAN12 mutations in patients with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"III:7"},{"id":"cggv:f2b57339-0e79-44ba-bb19-7b3e94968421","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2b57339-0e79-44ba-bb19-7b3e94968421_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"not found in gnomAD.

Blood-retina barrier (BRB) formation and retinal angiogenesis require β-catenin signaling induced by the ligand norrin (NDP [Norrie disease protein]), the receptor FZD4 (frizzled 4), coreceptor LRP5 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-like protein 5), and the tetraspanin TSPAN12 (tetraspanin 12). Impaired NDP/FZD4 signaling causes familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, which may lead to blindness. This study seeked to define cell type-specific functions of TSPAN12 in the retina. Approach and Results- A loxP-flanked Tspan12 allele was generated and recombined in endothelial cells using a tamoxifen-inducible Cdh5-CreERT2 driver. Resulting phenotypes were documented using confocal microscopy. RNA-Seq, histopathologic analysis, and electroretinogram were performed on retinas of aged mice. We show that TSPAN12 functions in endothelial cells to promote vascular morphogenesis and BRB formation in developing mice and BRB maintenance in adult mice. Early loss of TSPAN12 in endothelial cells causes lack of intraretinal capillaries and increased VE-cadherin (CDH5 [cadherin5 aka VE-cadherin]) expression, consistent with premature vascular quiescence. Late loss of TSPAN12 strongly impairs BRB maintenance without affecting vascular morphogenesis, pericyte coverage, or perfusion. Long-term BRB defects are associated with immunoglobulin extravasation, complement deposition, cystoid edema, and impaired b-wave in electroretinograms. RNA-sequencing reveals transcriptional responses to the perturbation of the BRB, including genes involved in vascular basement membrane alterations in diabetic retinopathy. Conclusions- This study establishes mice with late endothelial cell-specific loss of Tspan12 as a model to study pathological consequences of BRB impairment in an otherwise intact vasculature.","dc:creator":"Zhang C","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Endothelial Cell-Specific Inactivation of TSPAN12 (Tetraspanin 12) Reveals Pathological Consequences of Barrier Defects in an Otherwise Intact Vasculature."},"rdfs:label":"conditional mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Not scored because a previous mouse model has been scored."},{"id":"cggv:e4c81332-cc29-48d9-aeb2-a9923e7a37f4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5f94c5f-f504-41ee-9537-c2ffa3b38d59","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The  centrifugal outgrowth of  the NFL vasculature was  moderately delayed  in Tspan12-/- retinas (Figures 1C and 1D and data not shown) between P5 and P12.

TSPAN12-related exudative vitreoretinopathy is an inherited blinding disorder caused by defects in the development of retinal vasculature. There is extensive variation in disease severity among patients, even between members of the same family. *TSPAN12* was further reported be associated with exudative vitreoretinopathy in a semidominant manner in 4 families in 2012 (Poulter et al., PMID: 22427576).\n\nSeven variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splicing) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and TSPAN12 protein being a part of the Norrin-LRP5-FZD4 signaling complex.\n\nIn summary, *TSPAN12* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant or more appropriately semidominant TSPAN12-related exudative vitreoretinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Retina GCEP on January 6th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9c7915a6-c4eb-47c7-9c51-a81279b6e6a4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
