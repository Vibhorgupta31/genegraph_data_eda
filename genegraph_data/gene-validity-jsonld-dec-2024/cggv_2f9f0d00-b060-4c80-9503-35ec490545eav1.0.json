They are found as secondary features in several muscle disorders, including alcohol- and drug-induced myopathies, exercise-induced cramps, and inherited myasthenia, but also exist as a pure genetic form characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness. We identified dominant STIM1 mutations as a genetic cause of tubular-aggregate myopathy (TAM). Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is the main Ca(2+) sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, and all mutations were found in the highly conserved intraluminal Ca(2+)-binding EF hands. Ca(2+) stores are refilled through a process called store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Upon Ca(2+)-store depletion, wild-type STIM1 oligomerizes and thereby triggers extracellular Ca(2+) entry. In contrast, the missense mutations found in our four TAM-affected families induced constitutive STIM1 clustering, indicating that Ca(2+) sensing was impaired. By monitoring the calcium response of TAM myoblasts to SOCE, we found a significantly higher basal Ca(2+) level in TAM cells and a dysregulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Because recessive STIM1 loss-of-function mutations were associated with immunodeficiency, we conclude that the tissue-specific impact of STIM1 loss or constitutive activation is different and that a tight regulation of STIM1-dependent SOCE is fundamental for normal skeletal-muscle structure and function.","dc:creator":"BÃ¶hm J","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Constitutive activation of the calcium sensor STIM1 causes tubular-aggregate myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Localization and function of mutant STIM1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"These results are supported with results obtained by studying myoblasts from one patient (p.Asp84Gly variant) in the same study and by results obtained in non patient cells in other papers (PMID 25326555, 31448844, 27876257, 27066587)."},{"id":"cggv:23b9348f-4474-4458-b58e-917e5e2664d2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43122a3d-1580-4d68-a2ea-f6f7ce4f6592","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"With confocal microscopy and calcium imaging the authors demonstrate that STIM1 R304W is in the active state.

Previous reports have suggested a genotype-phenotype correlation with mutations in the N-terminal EF-hand domain associated with tubular aggregate myopathy, and a common mutation at p.R304W in a coiled coil domain associated with Stormorken syndrome. In this study individuals with STIM1 variants were identified by exome sequencing or STIM1 direct sequencing, and assessed for neuromuscular, haematological and biochemical evidence of the allelic disorders of STIM1. STIM1 mutations were investigated by fibroblast calcium imaging and 3D modelling. Six individuals with STIM1 mutations, including two novel mutations (c.262A>G (p.S88G) and c.911G>A (p.R304Q)), were identified. Extra-neuromuscular symptoms including thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, hypocalcaemia or hyposplenism were present in 5/6 patients with mutations in both the EF-hand and CC domains. 3/6 patients had psychiatric disorders, not previously reported in STIM1 disease.

Upon sensing Ca(2+) depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, STIM1 undergoes a conformational change enabling it to interact with and open ORAI1, a Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel located in the plasma membrane. The STIM1 mutation found in Stormorken syndrome patients is located in the coiled-coil 1 domain, which might play a role in keeping STIM1 inactive. In agreement with a possible gain-of-function mutation in STIM1, blood platelets from patients were in a preactivated state with high exposure of aminophospholipids on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Resting Ca(2+) levels were elevated in platelets from the patients compared with controls, and store-operated Ca(2+) entry was markedly attenuated, further supporting constitutive activity of STIM1 and ORAI1. Thus, our data are compatible with a near-maximal activation of STIM1 in Stormorken syndrome patients.

OMIM: 185070; MONDO:0008497\nMyopathy, tubular aggregate 1.  OMIM: 160565; MONDO:0008051\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between these two phenotypes.\nVariants in the STIM1 gene have been observed in individuals with Stormorken Syndrome (SS) and tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM). The inheritance of SS and TAM is autosomal dominant. SS and TAM form a clinical continuum with heterogeneous disease severity and age of onset, characterized by muscle weakness, myalgia and additional multi-systemic signs such as miosis, thrombocytopenia, defective platelet function (impaired secretion of platelet granules, impaired aggregation, increased annexin V binding to platelet phosphatidylserine), hypocalcemia, asplenia, ichthyosis, short stature that can occur with variable degree. All patients show elevated serum creatine kinase. The full penetrance of the phenotype is referred as SS. \nTherefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Stormorken Syndrome.\n\nOn the contrary, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability with Immunodeficiency type 10, OMIM:612783, MONDO:0014260. Immunodeficiency type 10 is autosomal recessive and the molecular mechanism is homozygous loss of function. Moreover, patients show myopathy and muscular hypotonia together with an immunodeficiency phenotype that is related only to Immunodeficiency type 10. Therefore, we have split curation of Stormorken syndrome from curation of Immunodeficiency type 10. \nSTIM1 is a Ca2+ sensor and senses the luminal Ca2+ concentration.  Upon Ca2+ store depletion, STIM1 unfolds, oligomerizes, and activates Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels such as ORAI1 at the plasma membrane, thus stimulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE).\n\nSTIM1 was first reported in relation to SS in 2013 (Bohm et al., PMID 23332920) in patients with a typical TAM phenotype and in 2014 by two groups independently (Misceo et al., PMID 24619930; Nesin et al., PMID 24591628) in patients with the full SS phenotype. Another phenotype, called the York platelet syndrome (YPS) and described in 2003 (White JG, PMID 12745453), has been recognized later to be actually the SS (Markello et al., PMID 25577287). \n\nAt least 17 unique variants (16 missense and 1 frameshift) have been reported in humans. The most common variant is p.Arg304Trp. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (functional evidence of biochemical functions, functional alteration in non-patient cells and patient cells, non-human model organisms that replicate the disease).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands in 13 publications (PMIDs: 28624464, 27876257, 23332920, 25326555, 31448844, 25953320, 29356264, 24591628, 27066587, 24619930, 25577287, 24570283, 31448844). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 5 POINTS \nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and mouse models.\nZhang et al. showed that STIM1 migrates from endoplasmic-reticulum like sites to the plasma membrane upon depletion of the Ca2+ store. Thus they propose that STIM1 is a Ca2+ sensor that translocates upon store depletion to the plasma membrane to activate CRAC channels (PMID: 16208375). \nNon-patient cells (murine myoblasts or cell lines) transfected with plasmids coding for different mutant STIM1 proteins show STIM1 clustering and impairment of Ca2+ sensing with a significantly higher basal cytoplasmic Ca2+ level and higher cytoplasmic Ca2+ influx (PMID: 23332920, supported by PMIDs 25326555, 31448844, 27876257, 27066587). Similar results were obtained by culturing fibroblasts from SS patients (PMID: 31448844).\nA mouse model expressing mutant (R304W) STIM1 recapitulates the characteristics of SS patients with muscle weakness, thrombocytopenia, prolonged bleeding time, growth delay, splenomegaly, abnormality of eye movement, skin irritations, hypocalcemia, increased serum creatine kinase and impaired Ca2+ homeostasis (PMID 30576443, supported by PMID 30390422).\n\nIn summary, STIM1 is definitively associated with Stormorken syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on 04/22/2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2f9f0d00-b060-4c80-9503-35ec490545ea"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
