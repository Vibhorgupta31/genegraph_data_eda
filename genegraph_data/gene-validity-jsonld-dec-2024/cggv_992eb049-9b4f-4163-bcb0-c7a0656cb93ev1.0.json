A recent study of a family with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria showed that the enzyme defect resulted from rapid degradation of the protein in vivo. Cloning and sequencing of a complementary DNA for the mutated gene revealed that the mutation was due to the replacement of a glycine residue by a glutamic acid residue at position 281. This base change leads to a protein that is very rapidly degraded in the presence of cell lysate. Characterization of the mutation will allow comparison of this defect in a homozygous patient with defects in other patients with familial porphyria cutanea tarda.","dc:creator":"de Verneuil H","dc:date":"1986","dc:title":"Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase structural mutant (Gly281----Glu) in a case of porphyria."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:992eb049-9b4f-4163-bcb0-c7a0656cb93e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:549cd3d3-e2bb-4abb-92ec-ff777bc9c6dd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:549cd3d3-e2bb-4abb-92ec-ff777bc9c6dd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":61,"allele":{"id":"cggv:68c7989c-4774-4354-8710-7e977a87044c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000374.5(UROD):c.616C>T (p.Gln206Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA825288"}},"detectionMethod":"The proband was initially subjected to partial sequencing of the HFE locus, ruling out two known variants.

Both genetic and environmental factors interplay in the precipitation of clinically overt PCT, but these factors may vary between different geographic areas. Decreased activity of UROD in erythrocytes was used to identify patients with UROD mutations among a group of 130 Spanish PCT patients. Nineteen patients (14.6%) were found to harbor a mutation in the UROD gene. Eight mutations were novel: M1I, 5del10, A22V, D79N, F84I, Q116X, T141I and Y182C. Five others were previously described: F46L, V134Q, R142Q, P150L and E218G. The new missense mutations and P150L were expressed in Escherichia coli. D79N and P150L resulted in proteins that were localized to inclusion bodies. The other mutations produced recombinant proteins that were purified and showed reduced activity (range: 2.3-73.2% of wild type). These single amino acid changes were predicted to produce complex structural alterations and/or reduced stability of the enzyme. Screening of relatives of the probands showed that 37.5% of mutation carriers demonstrated increased urinary porphyrins.

Subnormal UROD activity is due to mutations of the UROD gene in both f-PCT and HEP, but no mutations have been found in s-PCT. Genetic analysis has determined that f-PCT is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In contrast, HEP, a severe form of cutaneous porphyria, is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. HEP is characterized by a profound deficiency of UROD activity, and the disease is usually manifest in childhood. In this study, a strategy was designed to identify alleles responsible for the HEP phenotype in three unrelated families. Mutations of UROD were identified by direct sequencing of four amplified fragments that contained the entire coding sequence of the UROD gene. Two new missense mutations were observed at the homoallelic state: P62L (proline-to-leucine substitution at codon 62) in a Portuguese family and Y311C (tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 311) in an Italian family. A third mutation, G281E, was observed in a Spanish family. This mutation has been previously described in three families from Spain and one from Tunisia. In the Spanish family described in this report, a paternal uncle of the proband developed clinically overt PCT as an adult and proved to be heterozygous for the G281E mutation. Mutant cDNAs corresponding to the P62L and Y311C changes detected in these families were created by site-directed mutagenesis.

PCT associated with URO-D mutations is designated familial PCT. The phenotype is characterized by a photosensitive dermatosis with hepatic accumulation and urinary excretion of uroporphyrin and hepta-carboxylic porphyrins. Most heterozygotes for URO-D mutations do not express a porphyric phenotype unless hepatic siderosis is present. Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations are frequently found when the phenotype is expressed. We used homologous recombination to disrupt one allele of murine URO-D. URO-D(+/-) mice had half-wild type (wt) URO-D protein and enzymatic activity in all tissues but did not accumulate hepatic porphyrins, indicating that half-normal URO-D activity is not rate limiting. When URO-D(+/-) mice were injected with iron-dextran and given drinking water containing delta-aminolevulinic acid for 21 days, hepatic porphyrins accumulated, and hepatic URO-D activity was reduced to 20% of wt. We bred mice homozygous for an HFE gene disruption (HFE(-/-)) to URO-D(+/-) mice, generating mice with the URO-D(+/-)/HFE(-/-) genotype. These animals developed a porphyric phenotype by 14 weeks of age without ALA supplementation, and URO-D activity was reduced to 14% of wt. These data indicate that iron overload alone is sufficient to reduce URO-D activity to rate-limiting levels in URO-D(+/-) mice. The URO-D(+/-) mouse serves as an excellent model of familial PCT and affords the opportunity to define the mechanism by which iron influences URO-D activity.","dc:creator":"Phillips JD","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A mouse model of familial porphyria cutanea tarda."},"rdfs:label":"Urod null mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This model recapitulates the underlying metabolic features, mode of inheritance, incomplete penetrance, and iron-related triggers of the human disease state, but not the cutaneous features.

Affected individuals harboring biallelic variants are typically diagnosed with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and generally present in infancy or childhood with cutaneous photosensitivity, blistering and hyperpigmentation of sun-exposed skin, severe uroporphyrinuria, erythrocyte deficiency of UROD enzymatic activity, and sometimes liver damage. Inherited porphyria has been reported in association with *UROD* variants in the heterozygous state as well, starting with the 1989 publication of a patient with familial porphyria cutanea tarda (PMID: 2920211). Cases with this diagnosis generally exhibit similar but less severe presentation, incomplete penetrance, and adult onset induced by triggers such as iron overload, use of alcohol or estrogens, or viral infections such as hepatitis C. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (UROD loss-of-function) has been found to be consistent between the hepatoerythropoietic porphyria cases with biallelic variants and the familial porphyria cutanea tarda cases with monoallelic variants. In addition, the phenotypic differences between the biallelic and monoallelic cases appear to represent a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *UROD* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity referred to as *UROD*-related inherited porphyria (MONDO:0100498, MIM #176100), with a semidominant mode of inheritance. \n\nEleven suspected pathogenic variants have been scored as part of this curation (six missense, two nonsense, one frameshift, one disrupting the start codon, and one triggering splicing defects), which have been collectively reported in eleven probands in six publications (PMID: 2243121, PMID: 2920211, PMID: 3775362, PMID: 8644733, PMID: 19419417, PMID: 34367815). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic or biallelic loss of UROD function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Monoallelic cases have approximately 50% of normal UROD enzymatic function at the cellular level (PMID: 7062951) but exhibit less than 10% penetrance due to the requirement for a trigger to further depress UROD enzymatic levels to approximately 20% of normal. Iron overload appears act as a trigger by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species that react with the uroporphyrinogen substrates to generate UROD inhibitors (PMID: 9763408). Biallelic cases appear to retain between 5% and 14% of normal UROD enzymatic function, depending on the tissue examined (PMID: 8644733). Nine out of eleven probands included in this curation were heterozygous for their respective variants, while two probands were homozygous. Segregation evidence was available in one of these publications (PMID: 2243121) and has contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. Additional case-level evidence is available in the literature but has not been included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence has already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported experimental evidence demonstrating that *UROD* encodes the human enzyme responsible for catalyzing coproporphyrinogen III synthesis from uroporphyrinogen III (PMID: 6370830). This represents a critical step in the heme biosynthesis pathway and is consistent with the very high levels of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxylporphyrin in the urine of affected patients. Genetically engineered mouse and naturally occurring zebrafish models have shown that either monoallelic (PMID: 11134514) or biallelic (PMID: 9806541) *UROD* loss-of-function can recapitulate many of the molecular and systemic phenotypes observed in human patients, including urinary accumulation of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxylporphyrin, hepatic accumulation of iron, photosensitivity, and hematological defects, which in some cases can be rescued by expression of a wild-type transgene (PMID: 9806541).\n\nIn summary, *UROD* is definitively associated with *UROD*-related inherited porphyria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 12th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:992eb049-9b4f-4163-bcb0-c7a0656cb93e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
