The classic and most common form is progressive liver cirrhosis and failure leading to either liver transplantation or death by 5 yr of age. However, the liver disease is not always progressive. In addition, a neuromuscular type of the disease has been reported. The molecular basis of GSD-IV is not known, nor is there a known reason for the clinical variability. We studied the GBE gene in patients with various presentations of GSD-IV. Three point mutations in the GBE gene were found in two patients with the classical presentation: R515C, F257L, and R524X. Transient expression experiments showed that these mutations inactivated GBE activity. Two point mutations, L224P and Y329S, were detected in two separate alleles of a patient with the nonprogressive hepatic form. The L224P resulted in complete loss of GBE activity, whereas the Y329S resulted in loss of approximately 50% of GBE activity. The Y329S allele was also detected in another patient with the nonprogressive form of GSD-IV but not in 35 unrelated controls or in patients with the more severe forms of GSD-IV. A 210-bp deletion from nucleotide 873 to 1082 of the GBE cDNA was detected in a patient with the fatal neonatal neuromuscular presentation. This deletion, representing the loss of one full exon, was caused by a 3' acceptor splicing site mutation (ag to aa). The deletion abolished GBE activity. Our studies indicate that the three different forms of GSD-IV were caused by mutations in the same GBE gene. The data also suggest that the significant retention of GBE activity in the Y329S allele may be a reason for the mild disease. Further study of genotype/phenotype correlations may yield useful information in predicting the clinical outcomes.","dc:creator":"Bao Y","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Hepatic and neuromuscular forms of glycogen storage disease type IV caused by mutations in the same glycogen-branching enzyme gene."}},{"id":"cggv:0020fbaa-33d2-478e-84d8-976ed0b46173_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e8c1f340-c4f5-4b0f-9914-e6b0b35e7a12"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8613547"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 4"},{"id":"cggv:31b5f3ae-48c2-4c2b-b77b-920604b963e8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31b5f3ae-48c2-4c2b-b77b-920604b963e8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:31b5f3ae-48c2-4c2b-b77b-920604b963e8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Approximately 25% GBE activity when transfected into COS-7 cells "}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"We are not using functional data to upgrade the variant because we are counting functional data in experimental evidence."},{"id":"cggv:0020fbaa-33d2-478e-84d8-976ed0b46173","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0020fbaa-33d2-478e-84d8-976ed0b46173_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0020fbaa-33d2-478e-84d8-976ed0b46173_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Abolished GBE activity when transfected into COS-7 cells "}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"We are not using functional data to upgrade the variant because we are counting functional data in experimental evidence.

Typically, glycogen storage disease type IV presents with rapidly progressive liver cirrhosis and death in childhood. Variants include a cardiopathic form of childhood, a relatively benign myopathic form of young adults, and a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder (adult polyglucosan body disease). A severe neuromuscular variant resembling Werdnig-Hoffmann disease has also been described in two patients. The objective was to describe two additional infants with the neuromuscular variant and novel mutations in the GBE1 gene. Branching enzyme assay, Western blot, RT-PCR and sequencing were performed in muscle biopsies from both patients. The cDNA of patient 1 was subcloned and sequenced to define the mutations. Muscle biopsies showed accumulation of periodic acid Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant storage material in both patients and increased lysosomal enzyme activity in patient 1. Branching enzyme activity in muscle was negligible in both patients, and Western blot showed decreased branching enzyme protein. Patient 1 had two single base pair deletions, one in exon 10 (1238delT) and the other in exon 12 (1467delC), and each parent was heterozygous for one of the deletions. Patient 2 had a large homozygous deletion that spanned 627 bp and included exons 8-12. Patient 1, who died at 41 days, had neurophysiological and neuropathological features of Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Patient 2, who died at 5(1/2) weeks, had a predominantly myopathic process.

In all cases, cervical cystic hygroma was observed on the 12-week-ultrasound examination. During the second trimester, fetal hydrops developed in the first pregnancy whereas fetal akinesia appeared in the second pregnancy. The diagnosis was suggested by microscopic examination of fetal tissues showing characteristic inclusions exclusively in striated fibers, then confirmed by enzymatic studies on frozen muscle. Antenatal diagnosis was performed on the third and fourth pregnancies: cervical cystic hygroma and low glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) activity on chorionic villi sample (CVS) were detected in the third pregnancy whereas ultrasound findings were normal and GBE activity within normal range on CVS in the fourth pregnancy. Molecular analysis showed that the mother was heterozygous for a c.1471G > C mutation in exon 12, leading to the replacement of an alanine by a tyrosine at codon 491 (p.A491T); the father was heterozygous for a c.895G > T mutation in exon 7, leading to the creation of a stop codon at position 299 (p.G299X). GSD IV has to be considered in a context of cervical cystic hygroma with normal karyotype, particularly when second trimester hydrops or akinesia develop. Enzymatic analysis of GBE must be performed on CVS or amniotic cells to confirm the diagnosis. Characteristic intracellular inclusions are specific to the disease and should be recognized, even in macerated tissues after fetal death. Genetic analysis of the GBE gene may help to shed some light on the puzzling diversity of GSD IV phenotypes.","dc:creator":"L'herminé-Coulomb A","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Fetal type IV glycogen

Recently, the GBE cDNA was cloned and several mutations were characterized in different clinical forms of GSD IV. To examine whether mutations in the GBE gene account for APBD, we studied 7 patients from five Jewish families of Ashkenazi ancestry.

In this study, mice carrying a stop codon mutation (E609X) in the Gbe1 gene were generated using a gene-driven mutagenesis approach.

Glycogen accumulation was reduced in developing hearts of Gbe(-/-)embryos, and abnormal cardiac development, including hypertrabeculation and noncompaction of the ventricular wall, was observed. Further, Gbe1 ablation led to poor ventricular function in late gestation and ultimately caused heart failure, fetal hydrops and embryonic lethality. We also found that the cell-cycle regulators cyclin D1 and c-Myc were highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and likely contributed to cardiomyocyte proliferation and trabeculation/compaction of the ventricular wall.

To better understand this essential enzyme, we crystallized human GBE1 in the apo form, and in complex with a tetra- or hepta-saccharide. The GBE1 structure reveals a conserved amylase core that houses the active centre for the branching reaction and harbours almost all GSDIV and APBD mutations. A non-catalytic binding cleft, proximal to the site of the common APBD mutation p.Y329S, was found to bind the tetra- and hepta-saccharides and may represent a higher-affinity site employed to anchor the complex glycogen substrate for the branching reaction. Expression of recombinant GBE1-p.Y329S resulted in drastically reduced protein yield and solubility compared with wild type, suggesting this disease allele causes protein misfolding and may be amenable to small molecule stabilization. To explore this, we generated a structural model of GBE1-p.Y329S and designed peptides ab initio to stabilize the mutation. As proof-of-principle, we evaluated treatment of one tetra-peptide, Leu-Thr-Lys-Glu, in APBD patient cells. We demonstrate intracellular transport of this peptide, its binding and stabilization of GBE1-p.Y329S, and 2-fold increased mutant enzymatic activity compared with untreated patient cells.

Neonates have profound hypotonia, respiratory distress, and dilated cardiomyopathy, with death typically in early infancy. A historical subtype system used to classify patients along the GSD IV spectrum based on severity and age of onset is no longer favored, as all individuals with GBE deficiency have homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the GBE1 gene.  OMIM currently lists two separate disease entities for GBE1: #232500 for GSD IV and #263570 for adult polyglucosan body disease. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, glycogen storage disease due to glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (MONDO: 0009292)\n\nWe have curated 26 variants in GBE1 (missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion) reported in 17 probands across 7 publications (PMIDs: 8613547, 15452297, 15019703, 17662246, 15520786, 16278887, 12913206). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. The gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence showing reduced GBE expression and activity in patient cells, reduced GBE activity in COS-7 cells transfected with specific GBE1 variants, multiple animal models including three separate mouse models that mimic varying disease severities with GBE1 gene alterations, and finally partial rescue of activity using a peptide designed to increase protein stability  (PMIDs: 8613547, 9851430, 15452297, 11817063, 17257876, 21075835, 21856731, 26385640, 26199317). \n\nIn summary, the GBE1 gene is definitively associated with autosomal recessive GBE IV.  This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Prenatal GCEP on the meeting date August 23, 2023 (SOP Version 9). \n\nThe GBE1 gene is definitively associated with autosomal recessive GBE IV.
