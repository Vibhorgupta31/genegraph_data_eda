Mutations in five genes, encoding subunits of the cohesin complex (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21) and its regulators (NIPBL, HDAC8), account for at least 70% of patients with CdLS or CdLS-like phenotypes. To date, only the clinical features from a single CdLS patient with SMC3 mutation has been published. Here, we report the efforts of an international research and clinical collaboration to provide clinical comparison of 16 patients with CdLS-like features caused by mutations in SMC3. Modeling of the mutation effects on protein structure suggests a dominant-negative effect on the multimeric cohesin complex. When compared with typical CdLS, many SMC3-associated phenotypes are also characterized by postnatal microcephaly but with a less distinctive craniofacial appearance, a milder prenatal growth retardation that worsens in childhood, few congenital heart defects, and an absence of limb deficiencies. While most mutations are unique, two unrelated affected individuals shared the same mutation but presented with different phenotypes. This work confirms that de novo SMC3 mutations account for ∼ 1%-2% of CdLS-like phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Gil-Rodríguez MC","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"De novo heterozygous mutations in SMC3 cause a range of Cornelia de Lange syndrome-overlapping phenotypes."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25655089","rdfs:label":"Gil-Rodriguez patient 13"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.6},{"id":"cggv:9467eaad-a86a-4b24-8cd4-98ebb57121c1_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a6b97e31-f4e1-4a06-b759-ea29d0725b4e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd8e6755-539e-499c-b9a6-e6da3e4038a7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"NGS Panel: NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8, RAD21, ESPL1.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"ID, DD, learning disabilities, ADHD, autism.

About 65% of patients harbor mutations in genes that encode subunits or regulators of the cohesin complex, including NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8. Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS), which shares CdLS phenotypic features, is caused by mutations in lysine-specific methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A). Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 2 male siblings clinically diagnosed with WDSTS; this revealed a hemizygous, missense mutation in SMC1A that was predicted to be deleterious. Extensive clinical evaluation and WES of 32 Turkish patients clinically diagnosed with CdLS revealed the presence of a de novo heterozygous nonsense KMT2A mutation in 1 patient without characteristic WDSTS features. We also identified de novo heterozygous mutations in SMC3 or SMC1A that affected RNA splicing in 2 independent patients with combined CdLS and WDSTS features. Furthermore, in families from 2 separate world populations segregating an autosomal-recessive disorder with CdLS-like features, we identified homozygous mutations in TAF6, which encodes a core transcriptional regulatory pathway component. Together, our data, along with recent transcriptome studies, suggest that CdLS and related phenotypes may be \"transcriptomopathies\" rather than cohesinopathies.

Dysregulated protein expression was found in CdLS probands compared to controls. The proteomics analysis was able to discriminate between probands harboring mutations in the different domains of the SMC proteins. In particular, proteins involved in the response to oxidative stress were specifically down-regulated in hinge mutated probands. In addition, the finding that CdLS cell lines show an increase in global oxidative stress argues that it could contribute to some CdLS phenotypic features such as premature physiological aging and genome instability. Finally, the c-MYC gene represents a convergent hub lying at the center of dysregulated pathways, and is down-regulated in CdLS.

We generated conditional Smc3-knockout mice and observed greater dendritic complexity and larger numbers of immature synapses in the cerebral cortex of Smc3+/- mice. Smc3+/- mice also exhibited more anxiety-related behavior, which is a symptom of CdLS. Further, a gene ontology analysis after RNA-sequencing suggested the enrichment of immune processes, particularly the response to interferons, in the Smc3+/- mice. Indeed, fewer synapses formed in their cortical neurons, and this phenotype was rescued by STAT1 knockdown.
