It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous.The identification of the causal mutation is important for early diagnosis, clinical follow-up, and genetic counseling. HL due to mutations in COL11A2, encoding collagen type XI alpha-2, can be non-syndromic autosomal-dominant or autosomal-recessive, and also syndromic as in Otospondylomegaepiphyseal Dysplasia, Stickler syndrome type III, and Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome. However, thus far only one mutation co-segregating with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in a single family has been reported. In this study, whole exome sequencing of two consanguineous families with ARNSHL from Tunisia and Turkey revealed two novel causative COL11A2 mutations, c.109G > T (p.Ala37Ser) and c.2662C > A (p.Pro888Thr). The variants identified co-segregated with deafness in both families. All homozygous individuals in those families had early onset profound hearing loss across all frequencies without syndromic findings. The variants are predicted to be damaging the protein function. The p.Pro888Thr mutation affects a -Gly-X-Y- triplet repeat motif. The novel p.Ala37Ser is the first missense mutation located in the NC4 domain of the COL11A2 protein. Structural model suggests that this mutation will likely obliterate, or at least partially compromise, the ability of NC4 domain to interact with its cognate ligands. In conclusion, we confirm that COL11A2 mutations cause ARNSHL and broaden the mutation spectrum that may shed new light on genotype-phenotype correlation for the associated phenotypes and clinical follow-up.","dc:creator":"Chakchouk I","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Novel mutations confirm that COL11A2 is responsible for autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss DFNB53."}},"rdfs:label":"Family 2 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:9220b32e-4f52-4475-bf98-f40c9b8964bd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9220b32e-4f52-4475-bf98-f40c9b8964bd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Consanguineous, 0.1 deducted, should be 0.1 total for this proband, not 0.2."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b24c1027-f197-4c33-8c23-e1e9b62c9239_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b24c1027-f197-4c33-8c23-e1e9b62c9239","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:75f3c8e3-2151-4f2b-ab3c-1439a0fc0148","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_080680.3(COL11A2):c.1861C>A (p.Pro621Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17129"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000399","obo:HP_0011476"],"secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:f6bed549-132b-4e8f-b846-e3e52afbc856_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:75f3c8e3-2151-4f2b-ab3c-1439a0fc0148"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16033917","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Allele variants of COL11A2, encoding collagen type XI alpha2, cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) at the DFNA13 locus (MIM 601868) and various syndromes that include a deafness phenotype.","dc:creator":"Chen W","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Mutation of COL11A2 causes autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss at the DFNB53 locus."}},"rdfs:label":"L-622 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:f6bed549-132b-4e8f-b846-e3e52afbc856","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6bed549-132b-4e8f-b846-e3e52afbc856_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Consanguineous, 0.1 deducted off of proband total.

To determine the molecular basis of this anisotropy, we measured material properties of TMs from mice with a targeted deletion of Col11a2, which encodes for collagen XI. In light micrographs, the density of TM radial collagen fibers was lower in Col11a2 -/- mice than wild-types. Tone-evoked distortion product otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem response measurements in Col11a2 -/- mice were reduced by 30-50 dB independent of frequency as compared with wild-types, showing that the sensitivity loss is cochlear in origin. Stress-strain measurements made using osmotic pressure revealed no significant dependence of TM bulk compressibility on the presence of collagen XI. Charge measurements made by placing the TM as an electrical conduit between two baths revealed no change in the density of charge affixed to the TM matrix in Col11a2 -/- mice. Measurements of mechanical shear impedance revealed a 5.5 +/- 0.8 dB decrease in radial shear impedance and a 3.3 +/- 0.3 dB decrease in longitudinal shear impedance resulting from the Col11a2 deletion. The ratio of radial to longitudinal shear impedance fell from 1.8 +/- 0.7 for TMs from wild-type mice to 1.0 +/- 0.1 for those from Col11a2 -/- mice. These results show that the organization of collagen into radial fibrils is responsible for the mechanical anisotropy of the TM. This anisotropy can be attributed to increased mechanical coupling provided by the collagen fibrils. Mechanisms by which changes in TM material properties may contribute to the threshold elevation in Col11a2 -/- mice are discussed.","dc:creator":"Masaki K","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Col11a2 deletion reveals the molecular basis for tectorial membrane mechanical anisotropy."},"rdfs:label":"Masaki Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ed850083-1719-4d96-ad92-dc3c0e64fb69","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:387c2a66-b064-407f-9e15-65dbad91f5d4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The radial fibrillar structure of the tectorial membrane is disorganized and the collagen fibrils are more widely spaced than in wild-type mice.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10581026","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report that mutation of COL11A2 causes deafness previously mapped to the DFNA13 locus on chromosome 6p.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in variant type, inheritance pattern, and phenotype within reported COL11A2 cases. Therefore we have split curations by inheritance pattern and again by nonsyndromic hearing loss and Stickler syndrome and assessed separately. This assessment focuses on its relationship to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. The COL11A2 gene was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2005 (Chen et al.). At least 4 missense variants and 2 null variants in 5 probands have been reported in humans (PMIDs: 25633957, 16033917, MORL unpublished data). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by relevant expression and functional studies.
