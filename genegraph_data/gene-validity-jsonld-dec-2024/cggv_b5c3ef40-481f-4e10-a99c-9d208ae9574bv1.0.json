The semidominant phenotype was mapped to Chromosome 4 and narrowed further to a critical interval of approximately 650 kb. A novel large (> 10 kb) transcript in the critical interval was found to have fourfold increased steady-state expression at the RNA level in Szt2 homozygous mutant brain. The corresponding 72 exon gene encodes a 378-kD protein with no significant or suggestive sequence similarities to any other protein. The mutant allele of Szt2 contains a splice donor mutation after exon 32, predicting transcriptional read-through, translational frameshift and premature stop. A second Szt2 allele, containing a gene-trap mutation in exon 21, also conferred a low seizure threshold and increased RNA expression, but unlike the original allele, some gene-trap homozygotes died embryonically. Szt2 is transcribed in many tissues, with the highest expression in brain, and it is also expressed during embryonic development. Szt2 is highly conserved in evolution, with a clear, single orthologue found in all land vertebrates and in many invertebrates. Interestingly, in mammals the Szt2 gene resides in a highly conserved head-to-head configuration with Med8 (which encodes a Mediator complex subunit), separated by only 91 nt. While the biological function of Szt2 remains unknown, its high conservation, unique structure and effect on seizure threshold suggest that it serves an important role in the central nervous system.","dc:creator":"Frankel WN","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Szt2, a novel gene for seizure threshold in mice."},"rdfs:label":"SZT2 for seizure threshold in mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This experimental evidence has been downgraded to 1 point because no spontaneous seizures were determined, only reduced seizure threshold was identified."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:b5c3ef40-481f-4e10-a99c-9d208ae9574b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31c00725-0788-4dea-a1ae-c4bed74e7a74_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31c00725-0788-4dea-a1ae-c4bed74e7a74","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:f76cdc88-1348-48cd-93dd-acc62b8ea827","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001365999.1(SZT2):c.3680_3683del (p.Thr1227ArgfsTer22)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573050533"}},{"id":"cggv:33b375e7-27d4-4426-bced-cc5b7cc615d5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001365999.1(SZT2):c.9874C>T (p.Arg3292Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340045869"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002536","obo:HP_0007359","obo:HP_0007074","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0000256"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:fbb56f57-a5b9-4318-b85e-93148abe264d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f76cdc88-1348-48cd-93dd-acc62b8ea827"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27248490","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Advances in genetic testing have led to the identification of increasing numbers of novel gene mutations that underlie infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathies.

Our patient had similar facial dysmorphisms (macrocephaly, high forehead, and down-slanted palpebral fissures) to a previous case with truncating mutation.

We studied two unrelated children presenting with a distinctive early-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by refractory epilepsy and absent developmental milestones, as well as thick and short corpus callosum and persistent cavum septum pellucidum on brain MRI. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified biallelic mutations in seizure threshold 2 (SZT2) in both affected children. The causative mutations include a homozygous nonsense mutation and a nonsense mutation together with an exonic splice-site mutation in a compound-heterozygous state. The latter mutation leads to exon skipping and premature termination of translation, as shown by RT-PCR in blood RNA of the affected boy. Thus, all three mutations are predicted to result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and/or premature protein truncation and thereby loss of SZT2 function. Although the molecular role of the peroxisomal protein SZT2 in neuronal excitability and brain development remains to be defined, Szt2 has been shown to influence seizure threshold and epileptogenesis in mice, consistent with our findings in humans. We conclude that mutations in SZT2 cause a severe type of autosomal-recessive infantile encephalopathy with intractable seizures and distinct neuroradiological anomalies.

In this study, we identified by whole-exome sequencing compound heterozygous SZT2 mutations in 3 patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathies. Six novel SZT2 mutations were found, including 3 truncating, 1 splice site and 2 missense mutations. The splice-site mutation resulted in skipping of exon 20 and was associated with a premature stop codon. All individuals presented with seizures, severe developmental delay and intellectual disabilities with high variability. Brain MRIs revealed a characteristic thick and short corpus callosum or a persistent cavum septum pellucidum in each of the 2 cases. Interestingly, in the third case, born to consanguineous parents, had unexpected compound heterozygous missense mutations. She showed microcephaly despite the other case and previous ones presenting with macrocephaly, suggesting that SZT2 mutations might affect head size.","dc:creator":"Tsuchida N","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Novel biallelic SZT2 mutations in 3 cases of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy."}},{"id":"cggv:7285bba3-9e25-4bcc-87a2-14d71bbd03b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7b720c3d-896d-415b-8c27-d89f7e4108d7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556953"}],"rdfs:label":"Tsuchida 2"},{"id":"cggv:7285bba3-9e25-4bcc-87a2-14d71bbd03b4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7285bba3-9e25-4bcc-87a2-14d71bbd03b4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:adace7dc-d512-400a-9038-ae4b7b28cd89","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:adace7dc-d512-400a-9038-ae4b7b28cd89_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:56849f61-22a4-4dec-8b04-ef93436b85ec_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56849f61-22a4-4dec-8b04-ef93436b85ec","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:cf2eb520-6b82-43cd-8599-47453263a984","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001365999.1(SZT2):c.3871_3887del (p.Asn1291fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1165614004"}},{"id":"cggv:c627339a-43c1-4ff3-92a8-1d31f6c408d4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001365999.1(SZT2):c.5653del (p.Gly1886fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1165605654"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007074","obo:HP_0007334","obo:HP_0012758"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:f2b6e4db-7641-4c57-bad4-166058b8fedf_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cf2eb520-6b82-43cd-8599-47453263a984"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556953"},{"id":"cggv:7cd5eb55-cef2-4ffe-9670-26c42e8310f4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c627339a-43c1-4ff3-92a8-1d31f6c408d4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556953"}],"rdfs:label":"Tsuchida 1"},{"id":"cggv:f2b6e4db-7641-4c57-bad4-166058b8fedf","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2b6e4db-7641-4c57-bad4-166058b8fedf_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:7cd5eb55-cef2-4ffe-9670-26c42e8310f4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7cd5eb55-cef2-4ffe-9670-26c42e8310f4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a7a5f32f-0a88-46d0-b91b-0a104d06e016_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a7a5f32f-0a88-46d0-b91b-0a104d06e016","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:8768026d-7234-4959-a410-72bff2b4dc9f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001365999.1(SZT2):c.73C>T (p.Arg25Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144914"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007074","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0007334"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:65db76f8-02b1-4eb7-86e0-8e4f323c93d8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8768026d-7234-4959-a410-72bff2b4dc9f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23932106"},"rdfs:label":"Family 1;

Later, in 2013, Basel-Vanagaite et al reported biallelic variants in patients with infantile encephalopathy with epilepsy and dysmorphic corpus callosum (PMID:23932106). More recently, *SZT2* was revealed to play an important role in a novel protein complex called KICSTOR, a negative regulator of the mTOR pathway. Variants in SZT2 may lead to elevated mTorc1 signaling (PMIDs:28199306, 28199315).\n\nClinical features in individuals with biallelic variants in *SZT2*  include infantile- to early-onset epilepsy (onset within 1 day to 10 years), intellectual disability, developmental delay, macrocephaly with dysmorphic facial features, dysmorphic corpus callosum and dysregulated cortical migration. At least 13 unique variants reported in 7 probands were included in this curation (PMIDs: 23932106, 27248490, 28556953, 29696782, 30818181). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a mouse model (PMID:19624305).\n\nIn summary, *SZT2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This classification was approved by the Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 02/02/2021 (SOP version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b5c3ef40-481f-4e10-a99c-9d208ae9574b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
