The role of RAD51C in the FA pathway of DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair and as a tumor suppressor is obscure. Here, we report that RAD51C deficiency leads to ICL sensitivity, chromatid-type errors, and G(2)/M accumulation, which are hallmarks of the FA phenotype. We find that RAD51C is dispensable for ICL unhooking and FANCD2 monoubiquitination but is essential for HR, confirming the downstream role of RAD51C in ICL repair. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAD51C plays a vital role in the HR-mediated repair of DNA lesions associated with replication. Finally, we show that RAD51C participates in ICL and double strand break-induced DNA damage signaling and controls intra-S-phase checkpoint through CHK2 activation. Our analyses with pathological mutants of RAD51C that were identified in FA and breast and ovarian cancers reveal that RAD51C regulates HR and DNA damage signaling distinctly. Together, these results unravel the critical role of RAD51C in the FA pathway of ICL repair and as a tumor suppressor.","dc:creator":"Somyajit K","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Distinct roles of FANCO/RAD51C protein in DNA damage signaling and repair: implications for Fanconi anemia and breast cancer susceptibility."},"rdfs:label":"Somyajit Biochemical Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8929,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:058a65d0-b7ba-4426-89f9-43ad335f1895","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0700273","gene":"hgnc:9820","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"3.0","dc:description":"RAD51C is a member of the RAD51 gene family. The proteins of RAD51 family members are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and DNA repair. RAD51C protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be involved in Holliday junction resolution. RAD51C has also been linked to autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia complementation group O.  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split the autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia complementation group O into separate curations due to phenotypic variability and/or different inheritance patterns. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant RAD51C-related cancer predisposition including familial ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ER negative breast cancers. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least eight case-control studies at the aggregate variant level . These case-control studies suggested significant increased risk for ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ER negative breast cancers in monoallelic RAD51C variant carriers compared to controls (12 points) (PMIDs: 26261251, 26720728, 30099541, 31341520, 32091585, 33471991, 35084436, 35172496). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including expression and biomedical function studies (1.5 points; PMIDs: 20400963, 22167183, 23047548). The cells with loss of RAD51C or expressing RAD51C variants exhibited a marked increase in the frequency of interstrand cross-links and double strand breaks. Methylation of RAD51C promoter was also observed in the ovarian tumor samples. In summary, RAD51C is definitively associated with autosomal dominant RAD51C-related cancer predisposition. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive for familial ovarian cancer on 04/12/2017 and as disputed for hereditary breast carcinoma on 05/10/2017 by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP. This re-curation as definitive was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 03/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).\nRAD51C is definitively associated with autosomal dominant RAD51C-related cancer predisposition.
