The CAGI4 SickKids clinical genome challenge provided an opportunity to assess the landscape of variants found in a difficult set of 25 unsolved rare disease cases. To address the challenge, we developed a three-stage pipeline, first carefully analyzing data quality, then classifying high-quality gene-specific variants into seven categories, and finally examining each candidate variant for compatibility with the often complex phenotypes of these patients for final prioritization. Variants consistent with the phenotypes were found in 24 out of the 25 cases, and in a number of these, there are prioritized variants in multiple genes. Data quality analysis suggests that some of the selected variants are likely incorrect calls, complicating interpretation. The data providers followed up on three suggested variants with Sanger sequencing, and in one case, a prioritized variant was confirmed as likely causative by the referring physician, providing a diagnosis in a previously intractable case.","dc:creator":"Pal LR","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"CAGI4 SickKids clinical genomes challenge: A pipeline for identifying pathogenic variants."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:60bc01a5-0957-4664-bf1f-b9d7b42f5283_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:60bc01a5-0957-4664-bf1f-b9d7b42f5283_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":9485,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":1.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bffbea81-df11-4768-b9d5-78072d5f2238","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:7569","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*MYH11* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2017 (Pal et al., PMID: 28512736). At least four unique variants (missense, nonsense, splice-site, deletion) were reported in four individuals with CHD (PMID: 28512736, 32859249, 33084842), but only the splice-site variant was included in this curation. The rest were not scored due to presence of variants in other CHD-related genes or high frequencies on gnomAD v4. Of note, there are 4 CNVs encompassing *MYH11* and several other genes reported in individuals with CHD (PMIDs: 22318994, 23979609). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *MYH11* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date October 15th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).
