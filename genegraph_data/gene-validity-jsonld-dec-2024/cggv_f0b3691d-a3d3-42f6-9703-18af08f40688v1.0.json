In this report we describe the mapping and identification of the gene responsible for loss of deep pain perception in a large family from northern Sweden. The loss of pain perception in this family is characterized by impairment in the sensing of deep pain and temperature but with normal mental abilities and with most other neurological responses intact. A severe reduction of unmyelinated nerve fibers and a moderate loss of thin myelinated nerve fibers are observed in the patients. Thus the cases in this study fall into the class of patients with loss of pain perception with underlying peripheral neuropathy. Clinically they best fit into HSAN V. Using a model of recessive inheritance we identified an 8.3 Mb region on chromosome 1p11.2-p13.2 shared by the affected individuals in the family. Analysis of functional candidate genes in the disease critical region revealed a mutation in the coding region of the nerve growth-factor beta (NGFB) gene specific for the disease haplotype. This NGF mutation seems to separate the effects of NGF involved in development of central nervous system functions such as mental abilities, from those involved in peripheral pain pathways. This mutation could therefore potentially provide an important tool to study different roles of NGF, and of pain control.","dc:creator":"Einarsdottir E","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A mutation in the nerve growth factor beta gene (NGFB) causes loss of pain perception."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0b3691d-a3d3-42f6-9703-18af08f40688_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f0b3691d-a3d3-42f6-9703-18af08f40688_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8},{"id":"cggv:f0b3691d-a3d3-42f6-9703-18af08f40688_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.4},{"id":"cggv:2665a122-cf09-42d5-9639-491c8cdb7866_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2665a122-cf09-42d5-9639-491c8cdb7866","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:64046d02-0148-48d5-bf11-6c2e35ec0bdd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002506.3(NGF):c.681_682del (p.Ala228LeufsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915941392"}},"detectionMethod":"Candidate gene screening","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000970","obo:HP_0010829","obo:HP_0007021","obo:HP_0000272","obo:HP_0001256"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Genomic linkage ","secondTestingMethod":"Genotyping","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:af7de787-cd29-4d61-b20a-adad02544a8a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:64046d02-0148-48d5-bf11-6c2e35ec0bdd"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20978020","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Nerve growth factor β (NGFβ) and tyrosine kinase receptor type A (TRKA) are a well studied neurotrophin/receptor duo involved in neuronal survival and differentiation.

We describe a novel NGF mutation in an individual with typical HSAN5 findings. The mutation c.361C>T, p.R121W is at the last residue of the furin cleavage motif Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg in proNGF. We show that the p.R121W mutation completely abolishes the formation of mature NGF-β. Surprisingly, mutant p.R121W cells produced very little proNGF. Instead, the two progressive cleavage products of proNGF were produced, proA-NGF and proB-NGF, with proB-NGF being the predominant NGF-derived peptide and the only peptide secreted by mutant p.R121W cells. We found that the ability of the p.R121W mutation to cause tropomyosin receptor kinase A autophosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was significantly reduced compared to controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). By studying the PC12 cell line morphology and neurite length over a week, we found the p.R121W mutation had residual, but much reduced, neurotrophic activity when compared to wild-type NGF. Finally, we assessed whether the p.R121W mutation affected apoptosis and found a reduced protective effect compared to wild-type NGF.

The CKO FD mice exhibit developmental delays, sensory abnormalities, and less organized dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) with attenuated axons compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, the CKO FD DRGs show elevated HDAC6 levels, reduced acetylated α-tubulin, unstable microtubules, and impairment of axonal retrograde transport of nerve growth factor (NGF). These abnormalities in DRG properties underlie neuronal degeneration and FD symptoms. Phosphatidylserine treatment decreased HDAC6 levels and thus increased acetylation of α-tubulin. Further PS treatment resulted in recovery of axonal outgrowth and enhanced retrograde axonal transport by decreasing histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) levels and thus increasing acetylation of α-tubulin levels.
