The level of the immune response is directly related to the concentration of MHCII molecules in the cell, which have a central role in initiating the immune response. MHCII molecules are therefore a potential target for the development of immunosuppressant drugs for the treatment of organ transplant rejection and autoimmune disease. The expression of MHCII molecules is regulated by a cell specific multiprotein complex. The RFX complex is the key DNA binding component of this complex. The RFX complex is composed of three proteins-RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXB-all of which are required for activation of expression of the MHCII genes. Little is currently known about the precise regions of the RFX proteins that are required for complex formation, or their structure. We have therefore identified the key regions of RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXB, which are required to form the RFX complex and have characterized the individual domains and the complexes they form using NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our results support a model for the assembly of the RFX complex in which the interaction between RFX5 and RFXAP promote folding of a poorly structured region ofRFXAP, which is required for high affinity binding of RFXB to the RFX5.RFXAP complex.","dc:creator":"Briggs L","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Formation of the RFX gene regulatory complex induces folding of the interaction domain of RFXAP."},"rdfs:label":"RFX interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:53b17c5d-ccea-4674-8746-a2bc39ad95f0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:51e88d5e-d9e9-4762-aaf3-54e565d6f64c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f3b29ce-4cd5-4b6c-8610-ebc91f63f681","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Cells now express HLA-DR, -DP and -DQ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9118943","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) deficiency is a disease of gene regulation that provides a unique opportunity for the genetic dissection of the molecular mechanisms controlling transcription of MHC-II genes.

It is frequently difficult to establish a definitive diagnosis of the disease on the basis of clinical and immunological criteria. Moreover, the phenotypical homogeneity precludes unambiguous identification of the regulatory gene that is affected. Identification of the four genes mutated in the disease has now allowed us to develop a rapid and straightforward diagnostic test for new MHCII-deficiency patients. This test is based on direct correction of the genetic defect by transduction of cells from patients with lentiviral vectors encoding CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5, or RFXAP. We have validated this approach by defining the molecular defects in two new patients. The RFXANK vector restored MHCII expression in a T cell line from one patient. The RFXAP vector corrected primary cells (PBL) from a second patient. Molecular analysis confirmed the presence of homozygous mutations in the RFXANK and RFXAP genes, respectively.

Together, this insertion in the promoter region represents a novel type of MHC-II gene silencing in MHC-II deficiency patients.","dc:creator":"van Eggermond MC","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Transcriptional silencing of RFXAP in MHC class II-deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"FGK"},{"id":"cggv:2af499c8-e875-48cb-9b2e-ffbc73f48507","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2af499c8-e875-48cb-9b2e-ffbc73f48507_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:2af499c8-e875-48cb-9b2e-ffbc73f48507_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR showing absence of RFXAP transcript, absence of HLA expression "}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:53b17c5d-ccea-4674-8746-a2bc39ad95f0_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:facb9fec-d45e-4f1f-94f1-8b83498469e9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:facb9fec-d45e-4f1f-94f1-8b83498469e9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:216d5284-2058-4b2a-b6c3-24133fcc283d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000538.4(RFXAP):c.709-1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA387858237"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002028","obo:HP_0005401","obo:HP_0011839","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0002090"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:770e991e-9e70-4ac6-a8c6-d9ea3261d1f1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:216d5284-2058-4b2a-b6c3-24133fcc283d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29527204"},"rdfs:label":"P5"},{"id":"cggv:770e991e-9e70-4ac6-a8c6-d9ea3261d1f1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:770e991e-9e70-4ac6-a8c6-d9ea3261d1f1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e1ff00ad-dcf4-444d-af09-f51c926db394_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e1ff00ad-dcf4-444d-af09-f51c926db394","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:f8bf22be-d373-4acb-aceb-d5268c18dded","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000538.4(RFXAP):c.163C>T (p.Gln55Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118954"}},"detectionMethod":"Coding region was amplified by PCR, subcloned and sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:fb7f5b71-5eef-4b18-bcd5-2d099901f30c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f8bf22be-d373-4acb-aceb-d5268c18dded"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9287230"},"rdfs:label":"ABI"},{"id":"cggv:fb7f5b71-5eef-4b18-bcd5-2d099901f30c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb7f5b71-5eef-4b18-bcd5-2d099901f30c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:fb7f5b71-5eef-4b18-bcd5-2d099901f30c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Lack of HLA-DR expression in cell line derived from patient"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c7387ff9-9f2c-480a-a66d-1c56f010435b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7387ff9-9f2c-480a-a66d-1c56f010435b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5909e02f-5ef0-4746-879b-51296de3a28f"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0000938","obo:HP_0005401","obo:HP_0002028","obo:HP_0032218","obo:HP_0000821","obo:HP_0100651","obo:HP_0000823"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1004ff3f-39d2-458f-8b67-76f4c56224ce_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5909e02f-5ef0-4746-879b-51296de3a28f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31028919","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) form a fundamental mucosal barrier and actively participate in tolerance and immunity against intestinal contents.

Pathogenic variants in RFXAP are associated with BLS complementation group D. Patients with BLS exhibit opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, reduced class-switched antibody levels and reduced CD4 T cell numbers.  Nine variants were curated and are composed of frameshift, nonsense, splice site and promoter variants causing the silence of gene expression. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Heterozygous carriers have not been shown to have a clinical phenotype. The maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (12 pts) for this curation.\n \nRFXAP is one of four trans-acting regulatory factors that are required for the transcription of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) genes.  RFXAP is a component of the RFX complex, which is composed of RFXAP, RFX5 and RFXANK. The RFX complex binds to the MHC class II promoter, promotes the assembly of other components of the MHC class II enhanceosome and initiates transcription of MHC class II genes (PMID: 9118943, 19274739, 16337482). MHC class II plays an essential role in the development, maintenance, and activation of CD4+ T cells. As such, patients with BLS exhibit significant defects in CD4+ T cell development and function. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 6/15/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n \n\nBiocurator:Ryan Martinez\n\nExpert:Miao Sun\n\n\nThis association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:53b17c5d-ccea-4674-8746-a2bc39ad95f0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
