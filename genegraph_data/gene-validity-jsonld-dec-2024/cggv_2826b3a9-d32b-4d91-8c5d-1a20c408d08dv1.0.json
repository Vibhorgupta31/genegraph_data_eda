Moreover, individuals with inherited defects of MALT1, CARD9, and CARD11 present with immunological and clinical phenotypes. Here, we characterized a case of autosomal-recessive, complete BCL10 deficiency in a child with a broad immunodeficiency, including defects of both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity. The patient died at 3 years of age and was homozygous for a loss-of-expression, loss-of-function BCL10 mutation. The effect of BCL10 deficiency was dependent on the signaling pathway, and, for some pathways, the cell type affected. Despite the noted similarities to BCL10 deficiency in mice, including a deficient adaptive immune response, human BCL10 deficiency in this patient resulted in a number of specific features within cell populations. Treatment of the patient's myeloid cells with a variety of pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) elicited a normal response; however, NF-κB-mediated fibroblast functions were dramatically impaired. The results of this study indicate that inherited BCL10 deficiency should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency with B cell, T cell, and fibroblast defects.

Three variants (nonsense and splice donor) that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 25365219, 32008135, 34868072). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Individuals affected with combined immunodeficiency due to BCL10 deficiency present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections. While more evidence is needed to establish the full phenotype, patients reported to date have normal total T cell counts but a deficit of memory T cells combined with impaired effector T cell functions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased memory B cells. Low counts of other T cell subsets and NK cells have been described. Heterozygous carriers are reported as unaffected (PMID: 25365219, 34868072). \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by biochemical studies, protein interactions, functional and rescue assays, as well as animal models (PMIDs: 10400625, 24074955, 25365219, 32008135, 11163238, 12910267). BCL10 is a part of the CARD11/9–BCL10–MALT1 (CBM) complex. It acts as a signaling molecule transducing the triggering of cell surface antigen receptors to NF-kappaB activation (PMID: 10400625, 24074955). We have previously established other genes within this complex including CARD11 as definitively associated with severe combined immune deficiency. Affected patient cells show altered NF-kappaB signaling that is rescued by wild type (PMID: 25365219, 32008135). BCL10 knockout mice have B cell lymphopenia, reduced B cell proliferation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and impaired immune responses consistent with combined immunodeficiency (PMID: 11163238, 12910267).\n\nIn summary, BCL10 is definitively associated with combined immunodeficiency due to BCL10 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
