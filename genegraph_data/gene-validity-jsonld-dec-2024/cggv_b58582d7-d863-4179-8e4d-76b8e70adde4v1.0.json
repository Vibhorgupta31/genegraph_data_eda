Data were collected on an Arndt-Wonacott camera at -2 degrees C. The structure was refined to an R factor of 0.223 by the Jack-Levitt method, starting from Baldwin's model of human carbon monoxide haemoglobin. The active sites in the alpha and beta subunit are distinct. The iron atoms are 0.16(8) A and 0.00(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin carbons and nitrogens (0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin nitrogens) in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively, in correlation with the orientation of HisF8 relative to the porphyrin nitrogens. The haem group appears to be nearly planar in the alpha subunit but ruffled in the beta subunit. The Fe-O(1)-O(2) angles are 153(7) degrees and 159(12) degrees in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively. The oxygen molecule forms a hydrogen bond to N epsilon of HisE7 in the alpha, but either none or a weak one in the beta subunit. The following bond lengths were found: Fe-N epsilon (HisF8) = 1.94(9) A (alpha) and 2.07(9) A (beta); Fe-O(1) = 1.66(8) A (alpha) and 1.87(13) A (beta); Fe-Nporph (mean = 1.99(5) A (alpha) and 1.96(6) A (beta). These dimensions agree with the values obtained in oxymyoglobin and model compounds. The C-terminal residues, ArgHC3(141 alpha) and HisHC3(146 beta), are relatively delocalized, and their positions do not enable them to form the intersubunit salt bridges in which they are involved in deoxyhaemoglobin. The penultimate tyrosine residues, TyrHC2 140 alpha and 145 beta, are relatively localized and maintain the hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of ValFG5 (93 alpha and 98 beta), with only minor variations compared to their geometry in deoxyhaemoglobin. TyrHC2(145 beta), however, alternates between a major and a minor site, in conjunction with CysF9(93 beta), both sharing the internal pocket between the F and H helices while in the major conformation. This suggests that the role of the penultimate tyrosines in the allosteric mechanism may differ from that previously proposed by Perutz. The overall quaternary structure of oxyhaemoglobin is identical, within experimental error, to that of carbon monoxide haemoglobin, and thus confirms the applicability of the allosteric mechanisms proposed by Perutz and Baldwin & Chothia to the process of oxygen binding.","dc:creator":"Shaanan B","dc:date":"1983","dc:title":"Structure of human oxyhaemoglobin at 2.1 A resolution."},"rdfs:label":"Protein interaction with HBB"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded as this evidence provides a link to a gene associated with unstable hemoglobinopathy"},{"id":"cggv:cd2a1c66-866e-48ca-ab52-44d7f426aeaf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f15063e2-7edc-448d-9bce-0efb88b68de7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The protein product of HBA1/HBA2 is part of a complex that functions to bind oxygen and release oxygen.

Unstable hemoglobin disease results from the presence of a structurally abnormal hemoglobin variant which leads to Heinz bodies or basophilic inclusions in the red blood cells. The disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, heat-labile hemoglobin, and is sometimes accompanied by splenomegaly and jaundice. The clinical severity and presentation of the unstable hemoglobinopathies vary widely. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability in unstable hemoglobin disease and other disease entities associated with *HBA1*. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: AD familial erythrocytosis 7, AD and AR alpha-thalassemia, AD hemoglobin M disease, and AD unstable hemoglobin disease. This curation addresses *HBA1* in relation to AD unstable hemoglobin disease. At least 17 (13 missense, 1 nonsense and 3 deletion/insertion) variants that have been reported in 17 probands with AD unstable hemoglobin disease in  publications (PMIDs: 14076130, 5643522, 902765, 108887, 7338471, 7275660, 7161109, 6547932, 2833478, 2574721, 2599879, 12972031, 19815833, 6526652) are included in this curation. This gene disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including expression pattern of HBA1 across human tissues which is highly specific within whole blood (PMID: 23715323), biochemical studies indicating the well-established function of *HBA1* in oxygen binding (PMID: 11747442), and its protein-protein interaction with the beta hemoglobin chain encoded by the *HBB* gene (PMID: 6644819), which harbors variants associated with unstable hemoglobin disease. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/22/2023 (SOP Version 10).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b58582d7-d863-4179-8e4d-76b8e70adde4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
