One noncanonical function of BMP signaling regulates biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs. We have previously shown that this function is abrogated in patients with HPAH, making it a highly sensitive readout of BMP pathway integrity. Ataluren (PTC124) is an investigational drug that permits ribosomal readthrough of premature stop codons, resulting in a full-length protein. It exhibits oral bioavailability and limited toxicity in human trials. Here, we tested ataluren in lung- or blood-derived cells from patients with HPAH with nonsense mutations in BMPR2 (n = 6) or SMAD9 (n = 1). Ataluren significantly increased BMP-mediated microRNA processing in six of the seven cases. Moreover, rescue was achieved even for mutations exhibiting significant nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Response to ataluren was dose dependent, and complete correction was achieved at therapeutic doses currently used in clinical trials for cystic fibrosis. BMP receptor (BMPR)-II protein levels were normalized and ligand-dependent phosphorylation of downstream target Smads was increased. Furthermore, the usually hyperproliferative phenotype of pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells was reversed by ataluren. These results indicate that ataluren can effectively suppress a high proportion of BMPR2 and SMAD9 nonsense mutations and correct BMP signaling in vitro. Approximately 29% of all HPAH mutations are nonsense point mutations. In light of this, we propose ataluren as a potential new personalized therapy for this significant subgroup of patients with PAH.

Genomic DNA samples were either whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) according to standard protocols. The whole-genome sequencing was performed at WuXi Apptech (Shanghai, China) using a PCR-free library preparation and paired-end (2 x 150 bp) sequencing on the HiSeq X Ten platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) to yield a minimum of 35 x coverage. The whole exome sequencing was performed at Novogene Corporation (Beijing, China) using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kit (50 MB or 60 MB) and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq instruments to provide a mean coverage of more than 100× on the target regions of every sample. Prior to sequencing, samples were randomized to minimize batch effects.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","secondTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:7fac31aa-5159-49f7-af7d-69bb4da9296c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:cc0c0c4e-8620-4b1c-b3c0-09dcbb0425c8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001127217.3(SMAD9):c.787C>T (p.Arg263Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA387870389"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30578397"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30578397","rdfs:label":"WXJ03"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:1c73bf88-f69b-492f-95a5-b34129720254_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:546514c9-6f99-4554-8b6f-d3135e4ee6bc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageValue":26,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1c73bf88-f69b-492f-95a5-b34129720254_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:263ff59c-8d79-4319-b001-0ac729eb044c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001127217.2(SMAD9):c.880C>T (p.Arg294Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA211296"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21920918"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21920918","rdfs:label":"HPAH-3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:660bcbb2-ae52-4a4a-b9e2-676369afcdfe_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:469c1b00-28c3-4bc4-9cee-31ae2879f651","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"Targeted capture/sequencing, multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification and exome sequencing.

At least 15 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data, including protein interaction, functional alteration in non-patient and patient cells and rescue in patient cells.\nSummary of case-level data: 7.3 points\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 19211612, 21920918, 29650961, 31727138, 30578397). The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency.\nSummary of experimental evidence: 4.5 points.\nThe gene-disease association is supported by data demonstrating protein interaction, functional alteration in non-patient and patient cells and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 19211612, 21920918). \nThe evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship has been replicated over more than 10 years.
