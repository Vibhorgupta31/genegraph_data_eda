Coumarins target blood coagulation by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase multiprotein complex (VKOR). This complex recycles vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K hydroquinone, a cofactor that is essential for the post-translational gamma-carboxylation of several blood coagulation factors. Despite extensive efforts, the components of the VKOR complex have not been identified. The complex has been proposed to be involved in two heritable human diseases: combined deficiency of vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors type 2 (VKCFD2; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 607473), and resistance to coumarin-type anticoagulant drugs (warfarin resistance, WR; OMIM 122700). Here we identify, by using linkage information from three species, the gene vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which encodes a small transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. VKORC1 contains missense mutations in both human disorders and in a warfarin-resistant rat strain. Overexpression of wild-type VKORC1, but not VKORC1 carrying the VKCFD2 mutation, leads to a marked increase in VKOR activity, which is sensitive to warfarin inhibition.","dc:creator":"Rost S","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mutations in VKORC1 cause warfarin resistance and multiple coagulation factor deficiency type 2."},"rdfs:label":"Rost_VKORC1 ER localization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Mislocalization from the ER has been shown to be the mechanism of disease due to the missense variant, Arg98Trp, the only reported mutation in this disease.

To investigate the biological role of VKORC1 in vivo, we generated VKORC1 knockout mice. Homozygous VKORC1-deficient mice developed normally until birth. Within 2-20 days after birth, the knockout mice died due to extensive, predominantly intracerebral haemorrhage. Bleeding resulted from a severe deficiency of gamma-carboxylated clotting factors. This lethal phenotype could be rescued by oral administration of vitamin K. Additionally, morphometric analysis of the limbs in VKORC1-deficient animals revealed reduced length of bone calcification relative to wild-type control mice. The observed phenotype of VKORC1 knockout mice excludes the existence of other enzymes with VKOR activity that can substitute to supply vitamin K hydroquinone required for maturation of blood clotting factors.

VKORC1 encodes the catalytic subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, which is involved in the reduction of inactive vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to active vitamin K (RefSeq, Aug 2015). Patients with VKCFD2 present with severe bleeding manifestations and absent or reduced activity of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.  The condition, VKCFD, type 1 is caused by mutations in the GGCX gene.\n\nVKORC1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive VKCFD2 in 2004 (Rost et al, PMID: 14765194). Only one missense variant has been reported in this gene in relation to VKCFD2. While several polymorphisms in VKORC1 have been reported in association with variability in response to vitamin K antagonists (VKA), this does not constitute a clinical disease entity. These variants have not been included in this curation. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (3 points):\nAt least 3 patients from 3 families in 5 publications have been reported with the same homozygous missense variant, Arg98Trp, which is considered a mutational hotspot (PMID: 12704386). The variant segregated in 5 additional family members. The mechanism is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n  \nSummary of experimental data (3.5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by a knock-out mouse model that recapitulates the bleeding phenotype seen in human patients, however, it is more severe and lethal (PMID: 19492146). VKORC1 function is not completely understood, but it localizes to the ER and its mislocalization due to the Arg98Trp variant is reported to be the mechanism of disease in VKCFD2 (PMID: 14765194, 24963046). Wild-type VKORC1 restores VKOR activity in cell culture (PMID: 14765194).\n  \nIn summary, the level of evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of VKORC1 and autosomal recessive combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, type 2, is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the HT GCEP on 06/24/2020. It was reevaluated on 04/03/2023. As a result of this reevaluation no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:84145ffe-9835-4a3a-a2ae-6d0c6bd34007"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
