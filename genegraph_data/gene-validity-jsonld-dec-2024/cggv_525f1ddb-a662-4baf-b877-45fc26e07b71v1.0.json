Recently, a de novo candidate mutation (p.Arg292Pro) in the gamma isoform of CAMK2 (CAMK2G) was identified in a patient with severe intellectual disability (ID), but the mechanism(s) by which this mutation causes ID is unknown. Here, we identified a second, unrelated individual, with a de novo CAMK2G p.Arg292Pro mutation, and used in vivo and in vitro assays to assess the impact of this mutation on CAMK2G and neuronal function. We found that knockdown of CAMK2G results in inappropriate precocious neuronal maturation. We further found that the CAMK2G p.Arg292Pro mutation acts as a highly pathogenic gain-of-function mutation, leading to increased phosphotransferase activity and impaired neuronal maturation as well as impaired targeting of the nuclear CAMK2G isoform. Silencing the catalytic site of the CAMK2G p.Arg292Pro protein reversed the pathogenic effect of the p.Arg292Pro mutation on neuronal maturation, without rescuing its nuclear targeting. Taken together, our results reveal an indispensable function of CAMK2G in neurodevelopment and indicate that the CAMK2G p.Arg292Pro protein acts as a pathogenic gain-of-function mutation, through constitutive activity toward cytosolic targets, rather than impaired targeting to the nucleus.","dc:creator":"Proietti Onori M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"The intellectual disability-associated CAMK2G p.Arg292Pro mutation acts as a pathogenic gain-of-function."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30184290","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"substantial experimental evidence supporting the variants effect on the protein"},{"id":"cggv:321402ab-d948-4e5f-954a-081b7bf85f57_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3557d423-1499-4638-b6b8-298cdb0ffd82","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0000341","obo:HP_0002518","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0000331","obo:HP_0004279","obo:HP_0000343","obo:HP_0004425","obo:HP_0002553","obo:HP_0001290","obo:HP_0005274","obo:HP_0000637","obo:HP_0000411","obo:HP_0010068","obo:HP_0001808","obo:HP_0000431","obo:HP_0010864"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Microarray which was negative.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:321402ab-d948-4e5f-954a-081b7bf85f57_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:217d9c06-2023-4766-8cc3-103ae39f10b6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23033978","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The causes of intellectual disability remain largely unknown because of extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity.","dc:creator":"de Ligt J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Diagnostic exome sequencing in persons with severe intellectual disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23033978","rdfs:label":"Trio 32"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Significant experimental evidence supporting impact of the variant on the protein."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:525f1ddb-a662-4baf-b877-45fc26e07b71_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:525f1ddb-a662-4baf-b877-45fc26e07b71_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d4f5e877-8221-42b5-9601-fa98f00efdff","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a449f427-1f65-4a6e-b5df-1bc4d7ce93aa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"CAMK2G is expressed in the hippocampus during gestation and is the dominant isoform during the first trimester when the nervous system starts developing and contributes substantially in the second and third trimester (Fig 1A).

CAMK2G was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability in 2012 (23033978: de Ligt et al. 2012). Only one heterozygous missense variant has been identified in two unrelated individuals both with de novo inheritance and similar phenotypic presentations (23033978: de Ligt et al. 2012; 30184290: Onori et al. 2018). Multiple functional studies were done to assess the impact of the variant on the protein and the results showed an effect on protein stability and nuclear localization (30184290: Onori et al. 2018). A cell culture model using mouse primary hippocampal neurons showed substantial alteration of neuronal morphology in mice transfected with shRNA directed against Camk2g when compared with controls (30184290: Onori et al. 2018). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, based on only one variant being identified and the mechanism of disease being unclear. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
