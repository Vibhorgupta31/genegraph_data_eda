We have found five new mutations in the RAB3GAP1 gene in seven patients with suspected Micro Syndrome from families with Turkish, Palestinian, Danish, and Guatemalan backgrounds. A thorough clinical investigation of the patients has allowed the delineation of symptoms that are consistently present in the patients and may aid the differential diagnosis of Micro Syndrome for patients in the future. All patients had postnatal microcephaly, micropthalmia, microcornia, bilateral congenital cataracts, short palpebral fissures, optic atrophy, severe mental retardation, and congenital hypotonia with subsequent spasticity. Only one patient had microcephaly at birth, highlighting the fact that congenital microcephaly is not a consistent feature of Micro syndrome. Analysis of the brain magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) revealed a consistent pattern of polymicrogyria in the frontal and parietal lobes, wide sylvian fissures, a thin hypoplastic corpus callosum, and increased subdural spaces. All patients were homozygous for the mutations detected and all mutations were predicted to result in a truncated RAB3GAP1 protein. The analysis of nine polymorphic markers flanking the RAB3GAP1 gene showed that the mutation c.1410C>A (p.Tyr470X), for which a Danish patient was homozygous, occurred on a haplotype that is shared by the unrelated heterozygous parents of the patient. This suggests a possible founder effect for this mutation in the Danish population.","dc:creator":"Morris-Rosendahl DJ","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"New RAB3GAP1 mutations in patients with Warburg Micro Syndrome from different ethnic backgrounds and a possible founder effect in the Danish."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 5"},{"id":"cggv:9e0016b2-fae7-4dab-bd5c-491d374b3b8d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e0016b2-fae7-4dab-bd5c-491d374b3b8d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f2a06188-dc84-4f31-a33c-e8b8f557beb2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2a06188-dc84-4f31-a33c-e8b8f557beb2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:eba3d27f-3cba-42d3-9184-d42384c708f8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000002.12:g.135115386G>A (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573131695"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002079","obo:HP_0000519","obo:HP_0008897","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002539","obo:HP_0007633","obo:HP_0000347"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"child tested negative for CMV during the first week of life.

Causative biallelic germline mutations have been identified in RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2, or RAB18, each of which encode proteins involved in membrane trafficking. This report provides an up to date overview of all known disease variants identified in 29 previously published families and 52 new families. One-hundred and forty-four Micro and nine Martsolf families were investigated, identifying mutations in RAB3GAP1 in 41% of cases, mutations in RAB3GAP2 in 7% of cases, and mutations in RAB18 in 5% of cases. These are listed in Leiden Open source Variation Databases, which was created by us for all three genes. Genotype-phenotype correlations for these genes have now established that the clinical phenotypes in Micro syndrome and MS represent a phenotypic continuum related to the nature and severity of the mutations present in the disease genes, with more deleterious mutations causing Micro syndrome and milder mutations causing MS. RAB18 has not yet been linked to the RAB3 pathways, but mutations in all three genes cause an indistinguishable phenotype, making it likely that there is some overlap. There is considerable genetic heterogeneity for these disorders and further gene identification will help delineate these pathways.","dc:creator":"Handley MT","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutation spectrum in RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2, and RAB18 and genotype-phenotype correlations in warburg micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"K2.1"},{"id":"cggv:11edc60b-a0ac-4e91-a7f2-b65d05ec37e5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:11edc60b-a0ac-4e91-a7f2-b65d05ec37e5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b1355712-f6d0-43bc-950c-0da30b54eddb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b1355712-f6d0-43bc-950c-0da30b54eddb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:f891bfac-40ae-4d78-b460-031d8d06f730","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015166.4(MLC1):c.42del (p.Met15CysfsTer43)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/552049"}},{"id":"cggv:f546bf5f-a39c-4bf9-9780-8e6dd46e600b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012233.3(RAB3GAP1):c.469G>T (p.Gly157Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/561095"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:88e958be-2479-41fe-84d8-b354b183d944_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f891bfac-40ae-4d78-b460-031d8d06f730"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25326635","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Clinical whole-exome sequencing is increasingly used for diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected genetic disorders.","dc:creator":"Yang Y","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Molecular findings among patients referred for clinical whole-exome sequencing."}},{"id":"cggv:fc11e2f3-91fb-433b-992c-671c4979be3e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f546bf5f-a39c-4bf9-9780-8e6dd46e600b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25326635"}],"rdfs:label":"365"},{"id":"cggv:88e958be-2479-41fe-84d8-b354b183d944","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:88e958be-2479-41fe-84d8-b354b183d944_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:fc11e2f3-91fb-433b-992c-671c4979be3e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc11e2f3-91fb-433b-992c-671c4979be3e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1d1bab90-8cfb-4920-8186-9a665d49ad34_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d1bab90-8cfb-4920-8186-9a665d49ad34","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:55b50649-4891-4a88-9965-4f7ac4589f17","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012233.3(RAB3GAP1):c.1009C>T (p.Arg337Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA236072"}},{"id":"cggv:2b9f0aab-58fd-4b67-bffc-a0df2b5c6e56","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012233.3(RAB3GAP1):c.560G>C (p.Arg187Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA348567175"}}],"detectionMethod":"All coding exons of the RAB3GAP1 gene were evaluated","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000519","obo:HP_0002079","obo:HP_0008897","obo:HP_0002539","obo:HP_0007633"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:64f79421-bab8-4b9b-8311-342ae56b7ded_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:55b50649-4891-4a88-9965-4f7ac4589f17"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26421802","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, severely delayed motor and intellectual development, microcornea, congenital cataracts, optic atrophy, and hypogonadism.

was reported in relation to Warburg Micro Syndrome in 2005 (PMID: 15696165). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship is largely case-level data. Variants in this gene have been reported across many publications (PMID: 25326635, 20512159, 23420520, 26421802). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. However, functional assays have not been done for this gene and would provide an area of interest for future publication. The mechanism for disease is loss of function. In summary, RAB3GAP1 is definitively associated with Warburg Micro Syndrome.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a1e4a47e-757a-442f-b82f-2ddfd69d0854"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
