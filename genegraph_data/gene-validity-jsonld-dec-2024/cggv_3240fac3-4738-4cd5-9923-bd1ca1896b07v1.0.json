Here, we report a patient who developed disseminated mycobacteriosis early in life and had several viral infections, including herpetic skin infection and interstitial pneumonia by cytomegalovirus with severe respiratory distress. Molecular analysis of STAT1 showed a novel homozygous mutation affecting a splice site, leading to exon 3 skipping and to synthesis of a lower molecular weight STAT1 protein. This mutation leads to marked reduction of STAT1 phosphorylation; the electromobility shift assay showed a complete defect of DNA-binding activity, which accounts for the complete impairment of peripheral blood mononuclear cell functional response to both IFN-γ and IFN-α. Moreover, analysis of natural killer cells showed a defective STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN-α and impaired basal cytolytic activity, suggesting that the STAT1-dependent pathway might be important for natural killer cell function. These results suggested that exon 3 skipping of STAT1 leads to abnormal signaling in response to IFN-γ and IFN-α, which is associated with susceptibility to intracellular pathogens and viruses.","dc:creator":"Vairo D","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Severe impairment of IFN-γ and IFN-α responses in cells of a patient with a novel STAT1 splicing mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"P1-Vairo"},{"id":"cggv:7b3a4322-3318-4c06-a190-bd64e941ebda","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7b3a4322-3318-4c06-a190-bd64e941ebda_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:7b3a4322-3318-4c06-a190-bd64e941ebda_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"T cells from the patient displayed approximately 50% of the normal amount of P-Tyr-701-STAT1 after treatment with the cytokine, whereas control cells displayed normal phosphorylation \n"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"A homozygous nucleotide substitution in a child to consanguinous parents"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6c44a662-93b2-45a2-8735-53f56f0e0d63_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c44a662-93b2-45a2-8735-53f56f0e0d63","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:08b71b7e-2d35-4128-84ee-5f45e2bcfbc1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007315.4(STAT1):c.1927dup (p.Thr643AsnfsTer4)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA120082"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"disseminated BCG infection 8 wk , swinging fevers, a generalized maculopapular rash, massive hepatosplenomegaly, and increasing respiratory distress requiring ventilation and intensive care.\nAcid-fast bacilli were found on bronchoalveolar lavage and lymph node skin and liver biopsies, in which a noncaseating, granulomatous reaction was seen\n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0020087"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c96ca89f-dc40-42d7-a649-375b7d79350a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:08b71b7e-2d35-4128-84ee-5f45e2bcfbc1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16585605","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The autosomal recessive form of human complete Stat-1 deficiency is a rare disorder, thus far reported in two unrelated patients, both of whom developed disseminated bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and subsequently died of viral illnesses before detailed studies of the condition could be performed.

ISGF3 is induced mainly by IFN-alpha/beta, and GAF by IFN-gamma, although both factors can be activated by both types of IFN. Individuals with mutations in either chain of the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) are susceptible to infection with mycobacteria. A heterozygous STAT1 mutation that impairs GAF but not ISGF3 activation has been found in other individuals with mycobacterial disease. No individuals with deleterious mutations in the IFN-alpha/beta signaling pathway have been described. We report here two unrelated infants homozygous with respect to mutated STAT1 alleles.

We report here a new form of partial STAT1 deficiency in 2 siblings presenting mycobacterial and viral diseases. Both carried a homozygous missense mutation replacing a lysine with an asparagine residue at position 201 (K201N) of STAT1. This mutation causes the abnormal splicing out of exon 8 from most STAT1 mRNAs, thereby decreasing (by ~ 70%) STAT1 protein levels. The mutant STAT1 proteins are not intrinsically deleterious, in terms of tyrosine phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, homodimerization into γ-activating factor and heterotrimerization into ISGF-3, binding to specific DNA elements, and activation of the transcription. Interestingly, the activation of γ-activating factor and ISGF3 was impaired only at early time points in the various cells from patient (within 1 hour of stimulation), whereas sustained impairment occurs in other known forms of complete and partial recessive STAT1 deficiency. Consequently, delayed responses were normal; however, the early induction of interferon-stimulated genes was selectively and severely impaired. Thus, the early cellular responses to human interferons are critically dependent on the amount of STAT1 and are essential for the appropriate control of mycobacterial and viral infections.","dc:creator":"Kong XF","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A novel form of human STAT1 deficiency impairing early but not late responses to

The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of\nfunction. Absence or impaired protein expression and the abolition or impaired cellular responses to IFN-γ, IFN-α/β, or IFN-λ, are\ndemonstrated in the patients affected, leading to severe and potentially fatal mycobacterial and viral infections.\n\nThis gene- disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. Enriched STAT1 expression was detected in\nEBV-transformed B cells (PMID 23715323). Nuclear extracts of HeLaS3 cells treated with IFN-γ and IFN-α showed an increase in\nnuclear localization of STAT1 (PMID: 16319195). Activation of ISGF3 by IFN-α is shown to be impaired in cells of the patients\nhomozygous with respect to the mutated *STAT1* alleles. No IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)–binding activity was\ndetected in nuclear extracts from the mutated in response to IFN-α (PMID: 12590259). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay\n(EMSA) showed no γ-activated sequence (GAS)–binding proteins in response to IFN-γ in STAT1 mutant cell. A similar defect was\nshown in a patient with complete IFN-γR1 deficiency (PMID: 12590259).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *STAT1* and immunodeficiency 31B, mycobacterial and viral infections, autosomal recessive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld overtime.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3240fac3-4738-4cd5-9923-bd1ca1896b07"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
