Exome sequencing identified recessive variants in PYROXD1 in nine probands from five families. Affected individuals presented in infancy or childhood with slowly progressive proximal and distal weakness, facial weakness, nasal speech, swallowing difficulties, and normal to moderately elevated creatine kinase. Distinctive histopathology showed abundant internalized nuclei, myofibrillar disorganization, desmin-positive inclusions, and thickened Z-bands. PYROXD1 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic pyridine nucleotide-disulphide reductase (PNDR). PNDRs are flavoproteins (FAD-binding) and catalyze pyridine-nucleotide-dependent (NAD/NADH) reduction of thiol residues in other proteins. Complementation experiments in yeast lacking glutathione reductase glr1 show that human PYROXD1 has reductase activity that is strongly impaired by the disease-associated missense mutations. Immunolocalization studies in human muscle and zebrafish myofibers demonstrate that PYROXD1 localizes to the nucleus and to striated sarcomeric compartments. Zebrafish with ryroxD1 knock-down recapitulate features of PYROXD1 myopathy with sarcomeric disorganization, myofibrillar aggregates, and marked swimming defect. We characterize variants in the oxidoreductase PYROXD1 as a cause of early-onset myopathy with distinctive histopathology and introduce altered redox regulation as a primary cause of congenital muscle disease.","dc:creator":"O'Grady GL","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Variants in the Oxidoreductase PYROXD1 Cause Early-Onset Myopathy with Internalized Nuclei and Myofibrillar Disorganization."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27745833","rdfs:label":"Family A-III"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The c.285+1G>A splice variant is found at an overall allele frequency in gnomAD of 0.00008756 with a MAF of 0.0001563 (4/25598 alleles) in the non-Finnish European population. cDNA analysis confirmed disruption of the donor splice site, with in-frame skipping of exon 3.

We recruited and analyzed 16 families with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) of Arab descent from Saudi Arabia and Sudan who did not have confirmed genetic diagnoses. The analysis included both traditional and next-generation sequencing approaches. Cellular and metabolic studies were performed on Pyroxd1 siRNA C2C12 myoblasts and controls. Pathogenic mutations were identified in eight of the 16 families. One Sudanese family of Arab descent residing in Saudi Arabia harbored a homozygous c.464A>G, p.Asn155Ser mutation in PYROXD1, a gene recently reported in association with myofibrillar myopathy and whose protein product reduces thiol residues. Pyroxd1 deficiency in murine C2C12 myoblasts yielded evidence for impairments of cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation, while CG10721 (Pyroxd1 fly homolog) knockdown in Drosophila yielded a lethal phenotype. Further investigations indicated that Pyroxd1 does not localize to mitochondria, yet Pyroxd1 deficiency is associated with decreased cellular respiration. This study identified pathogenic mutations in half of the LGMD families from the cohort, including one in PYROXD1. Developmental impairments were demonstrated in vitro for Pyroxd1 deficiency and in vivo for CG10721 deficiency, with reduced metabolic activity in vitro for Pyroxd1 deficiency.","dc:creator":"Saha M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Impact of PYROXD1 deficiency on cellular respiration and correlations with genetic analyses of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in Saudi Arabia and Sudan."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30345904","rdfs:label":"Family 1288 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant Asn155Ser, is present at an overall allele frequency in gnomAD of 0.00004546 with a MAF of 0.0001212 (3/24752 alleles) in the Finnish European population.

Here we describe three novel PYROXD1 families at the clinical, histological, and genetic level. Histological analyses on muscle biopsies from all families revealed fiber size variability, endomysial fibrosis, and muscle fibers with multiple internal nuclei and cores. Further characterization of the structural muscle defects uncovered aggregations of myofibrillar proteins, and provided evidence for enhanced oxidative stress. Sequencing identified homozygous or compound heterozygous PYROXD1 mutations including the first deep intronic mutation reinforcing a cryptic donor splice site and resulting in mRNA instability through exonisation of an intronic segment. Overall, this work expands the PYROXD1 mutation spectrum, defines and specifies the histopathological hallmarks of the disorder, and indicates that oxidative stress contributes to the pathomechanism. Comparison of all new and published cases uncovered a genotype/phenotype correlation with a more severe and early-onset phenotypic presentation of patients harboring splice mutations resulting in reduced PYROXD1 protein levels compared with patients carrying missense mutations.","dc:creator":"Lornage X","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Clinical, histological, and genetic characterization of PYROXD1-related myopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31455395","rdfs:label":"P1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The c.285+1G>A splice variant affects the essential donor splice site of the in-frame exon 3 and is found at an overall allele frequency in gnomAD of 0.00008756 with a MAF of 0.0001563 (4/25598 alleles) in the non-Finnish European population.

At least 7 unique variants (including missense, frameshift, and intronic) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in four publications (PMIDs: 27745833, 31455395, 30345904, 30515627). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in six additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by a Zebrafish knockdown model which is rescued by expression of human PYROXD1 (PMID: 27745833). Of note, this gene has been implicated in 12 families to date with a progressive course of disease and a predominant involvement of upper and lower limb muscles, however some exhibit a LGMD-like phenotype with childhood or adulthood disease onset while others are affected at birth, or in infancy, and manifest a more severe and complex clinical picture including scoliosis, nasal speech, joint hypermobility, contractures, rigid spine, pectus excavatum, and anomalies of the feet and hands. Overall and in view of the histological characteristics on biopsies as cores, central nuclei, and sarcoplasmic aggregates, PYROXD1-related myopathy can be considered as mixture of core myopathy, centronuclear myopathy, and myofibrillar myopathy which here have all been lumped into one disease entity.
