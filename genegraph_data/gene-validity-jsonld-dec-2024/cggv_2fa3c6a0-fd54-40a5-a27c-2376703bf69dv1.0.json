Impairments in chromosome maintenance are linked to rare chromosome breakage disorders. Here, we have identified a chromosome breakage syndrome associated with severe lung disease in early childhood. Four children from two unrelated kindreds died of severe pulmonary disease during infancy following viral pneumonia with evidence of combined T and B cell immunodeficiency. Whole exome sequencing revealed biallelic missense mutations in the NSMCE3 (also known as NDNL2) gene, which encodes a subunit of the SMC5/6 complex that is essential for DNA damage response and chromosome segregation. The NSMCE3 mutations disrupted interactions within the SMC5/6 complex, leading to destabilization of the complex. Patient cells showed chromosome rearrangements, micronuclei, sensitivity to replication stress and DNA damage, and defective homologous recombination. This work associates missense mutations in NSMCE3 with an autosomal recessive chromosome breakage syndrome that leads to defective T and B cell function and acute respiratory distress syndrome in early childhood.","dc:creator":"van der Crabben SN","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Destabilized SMC5/6 complex leads to chromosome breakage syndrome with severe lung disease."}},"rdfs:label":"Subject B"},{"id":"cggv:e71e67b9-ccee-4217-8b01-0fd1b59d0df5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e71e67b9-ccee-4217-8b01-0fd1b59d0df5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e71e67b9-ccee-4217-8b01-0fd1b59d0df5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Shows poor binding with NSMCE4, poor co-elution with NSMCE1 and poor expression of NSMCE3 and SMC5/6 complex.

germline variants in NSMCE3 were first reported in relationship to Lung disease, immunodeficiency and chromosome breakage syndrome in 2016 (PMID: 27427983). NSMCE3 is a component of the SMC5/6 complex, which has roles in maintenance of chromosome integrity and genomic stability. In the initial report, four patients from two families were identified due to severe lung disease following multiple virus-induced pneumonias. Heterozygous carriers have not been shown to have a clinical phenotype.  Further testing identified chromosomal breakage in cultured lymphocytes, as well as a combined T and B cell dysfunction with recurrent infections. Subsequent studies involving five patients with biallelic NSMCE3 missense variants did not reveal immunodeficiency; though all presented with severe lung disease (PMID: 33741030). All five patients were homozygous for a single missense variant in NSMCE3 that was previously identified in the initial report (PMID: 27427983). Based on this information, it is hypothesized patients with biallelic variants in NSMCE3 display variable expressivity of immune defects. Finally, there is limited research investigating the relationship between NSMCE3 and the immune system, therefore no experimental evidence was included in this curation.\n \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the immunodeficiency component of this gene-disease relationship. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 6/20/2024 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2fa3c6a0-fd54-40a5-a27c-2376703bf69d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
