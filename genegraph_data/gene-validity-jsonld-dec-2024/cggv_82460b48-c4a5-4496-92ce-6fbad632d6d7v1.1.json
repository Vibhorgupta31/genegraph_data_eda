The primary molecular defects reside in the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, particularly in proteins that link the membrane skeleton to the overlying lipid bilayer and its integral membrane constituents. Ankyrin-1 is the predominant linker molecule. It attaches spectrin, the major skeletal protein, to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, the RBC anion exchanger. Two-thirds of patients with HS have combined spectrin and ankyrin-1 deficiency; deficiency of band 3 occurs in about 15 to 20% (ref.1). These data suggest that ankyrin-1 or band 3 defects may be common in HS. To test this we screened all 42 coding exons plus the 5' untranslated/promoter region of ankyrin-1 and the 19 coding exons of band 3 in 46 HS families. Twelve ankyrin-1 mutations and five band 3 mutations were identified. Missense mutations and a mutation in the putative ankyrin-1 promoter were common in recessive HS. In contrast, ankyrin-1 and band 3 frameshift and nonsense null mutations prevailed in dominant HS. Increased accumulation of the normal protein product partially compensated for the ankyrin-1 or band 3 defects in some of these null mutations. Our findings indicate that ankyrin-1 mutations are a major cause of dominant and recessive HS (approximately 35 to 65%), that band 3 mutations are less common (approximately 15 to 25%), and that the severity of HS is modified by factors other than the primary gene defect.","dc:creator":"Eber SW","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Ankyrin-1 mutations are a major cause of dominant and recessive hereditary spherocytosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8640229","rdfs:label":"ANo_Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d8f01e26-870f-4239-a596-6f6fff37e50e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d75f40a-06c6-4c56-99a0-d0a5ca8dde19","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"For NGS, custom probes were used to capture the full coding regions plus 20 bp of non-coding flanking sequence and all previously known pathogenic variants for the ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, SPTA1 and EPB42 genes.

In contrast, all other membrane skeletal associations appeared to remain intact up to pH 9.3, after which they were also seen to dissociate. Whereas hemolysis of mechanically unstressed cells did not begin until approximately pH 9.3, where the membrane skeletons began to disintegrate, enhanced fragmentation of shear stressed membranes was seen to begin near pH 8, where band 3 dissociation was first observed. Furthermore, the shear-induced fragmentation rate was found to reach a maximum at pH 9.4, ie, where band 3 dissociation was essentially complete. Based on these correlations, we hypothesize that the band 3-ankyrin linkage of the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer is essential for red blood cell stability in the face of mechanical distortion but not for cellular integrity in the absence of mechanical stress.","dc:creator":"Low PS","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Contribution of the band 3-ankyrin interaction to erythrocyte membrane mechanical stability."},"rdfs:label":"ANK1 RBC Membrane Mechanical Stability"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:82460b48-c4a5-4496-92ce-6fbad632d6d7_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ca49b82-d45d-43ce-b1f6-c12bc6c0d4d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7dd1f9fa-2ffd-4e6f-86ea-ec94188197a2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The cells transfected with the variant demonstrated significantly increased osmotic fragility as measured by increased % of cell rupture compared to those transfected with the WT ANK1.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31016877","rdfs:label":"Osmotic fragility"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1a50a3f5-94fb-40e1-90cb-b12cbe1925d0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c02128ab-ae95-4426-825a-76cdcdefaacf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"RBCs from HS patients ANK1 variants had increased turnover (decreased HbA1c), which correlated with disease severity.

Red cells in HS are characterized by membrane instability and reduced deformability and there is marked heterogeneity in disease severity among patients. To unravel this variability in disease severity, we analyzed blood samples from 21 HS patients with defects in ankyrin, band 3, α-spectrin or β-spectrin using red cell indices, eosin-5-maleimide binding, microscopy, the osmotic fragility test, Percoll density gradients, vesiculation and ektacytometry to assess cell membrane stability, cellular density and deformability. Reticulocyte counts, CD71 abundance, band 4.1 a:b ratio, and glycated hemoglobin were used as markers of RBC turnover. We observed that patients with moderate/severe spherocytosis have short-living erythrocytes of low density and abnormally high intercellular heterogeneity. These cells show a prominent decrease in membrane stability and deformability and, as a consequence, are quickly removed from the circulation by the spleen. In contrast, in mild spherocytosis less pronounced reduction in deformability results in prolonged RBC lifespan and, hence, cells are subject to progressive loss of membrane. RBC from patients with mild spherocytosis thus become denser before they are taken up by the spleen. Based on our findings, we conclude that RBC membrane loss, cellular heterogeneity and density are strong markers of clinical severity in spherocytosis.","dc:creator":"Huisjes R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis."},"rdfs:label":"Increased RBC turnover in patients with ANK1 variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:82460b48-c4a5-4496-92ce-6fbad632d6d7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04ae9491-9dad-46fd-b1de-6d0a92e833f6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f5e2df5-89f4-4b52-a1e9-616ea6f90302","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both mice and humans display severe anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and osmotic fragility of red blood cells.

This study investigated genetic factors associated with red blood cell (RBC) physiology and structural integrity that may impact on blood component storage and transfusion outcome. Forward and reverse genetic approaches were employed with pedigrees of ENU-treated mice using a homozygous recessive breeding strategy. In a \"forward genetic\" approach, pedigree selection was based upon identification of an altered phenotype followed by exome sequencing to identify a causative mutation. In a second strategy, a \"reverse genetic\" approach based on selection of pedigrees with mutations in genes of interest was utilised and, following breeding to homozygosity, phenotype assessed. Thirty-three pedigrees were screened by the forward genetic approach. One pedigree demonstrated reticulocytosis, microcytic anaemia and thrombocytosis. Exome sequencing revealed a novel single nucleotide variation (SNV) in Ank1 encoding the RBC structural protein ankyrin-1 and the pedigree was designated Ank1(EX34). The reticulocytosis and microcytic anaemia observed in the Ank1(EX34) pedigree were similar to clinical features of hereditary spherocytosis in humans. For the reverse genetic approach three pedigrees with different point mutations in Spnb1 encoding RBC protein spectrin-1β, and one pedigree with a mutation in Epb4.1, encoding band 4.1 were selected for study. When bred to homozygosity two of the spectrin-1β pedigrees (a, b) demonstrated increased RBC count, haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (HCT). The third Spnb1 mutation (spectrin-1β c) and mutation in Epb4.1 (band 4.1) did not significantly affect the haematological phenotype, despite these two mutations having a PolyPhen score predicting the mutation may be damaging. Exome sequencing allows rapid identification of causative mutations and development of databases of mutations predicted to be disruptive. These tools require further refinement but provide new approaches to the study of genetically defined changes that may impact on blood component storage and transfusion outcome.

HS is characterized by the presence of spherical-shaped erythrocytes, termed spherocytes, on a peripheral blood smear. Spherocytes can accumulate in the spleen, causing anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. Complications include hyperbilirubinemia in neonates, cholelithiasis, hemolytic episodes, aplastic crises, and iron overload, although mild cases may go undetected without a blood smear. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in inheritance pattern between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive HS. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split by inheritance pattern into multiple disease entities with Spherocytosis, Type 1 (OMIM:182900) being the dominant form and the split curation for autosomal recessive HS will be curated separately. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Nine variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) that have been reported in nine probands in three publications (PMIDs: 8640229, 31016877, 32436265) are included in this curation.  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function of ANK, leading to a loss of flexibility and shape of the erythrocyte membrane. This gene-disease association is also supported by multiple animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and biochemical function experiments (PMIDs: 2137557, 2139228, 1826225, 24688720, 31147440, 31016877). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) was reached. In summary, ANK1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Hereditary Spherocytosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date March 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:82460b48-c4a5-4496-92ce-6fbad632d6d7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
