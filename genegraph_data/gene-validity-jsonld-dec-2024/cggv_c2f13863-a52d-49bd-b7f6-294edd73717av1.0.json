Subsequent to sequencing all coding exons of the X chromosome, we identified a single novel variant within the linkage region, affecting a conserved codon of PAK3.

In addition, the introduced residue conferred a dominant-negative function to the protein that drives the syndromic phenotype. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies in zebrafish embryos, we show that PAK3(N389) escapes its physiologic degradation and is able to perturb MAPK signaling via an uncontrolled kinase-independent function, which in turn leads to alterations of cerebral and craniofacial structures in vivo.

Next-generation sequencing now offers new promise for biomarker and diagnostic discovery, in developed as well as resource-limited countries. In this broader global health context, X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is an inherited genetic disorder that is associated with a range of phenotypes impacting societies in both developed and developing countries. Although intellectual disability arises due to diverse causes, a substantial proportion is caused by genomic alterations. Studies have identified causal XLID genomic alterations in more than 100 protein-coding genes located on the X-chromosome. However, the causes for a substantial number of intellectual disability and associated phenotypes still remain unknown. Identification of causative genes and novel mutations will help in early diagnosis as well as genetic counseling of families. Advent of next-generation sequencing methods has accelerated the discovery of new genes involved in mental health disorders. In this study, we analyzed the exomes of three families from India with nonsyndromic XLID comprising seven affected individuals. The affected individuals had varying degrees of intellectual disability, microcephaly, and delayed motor and language milestones. We identified potential causal variants in three XLID genes, including PAK3 (V294M), CASK (complex structural variant), and MECP2 (P354T). Our findings reported in this study extend the spectrum of mutations and phenotypes associated with XLID, and calls for further studies of intellectual disability and mental health disorders with use of next-generation sequencing technologies.","dc:creator":"Muthusamy B","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals Novel Mutations in X-linked Intellectual Disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28481730","rdfs:label":"IV.2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Downgraded as no experimental evidence."},{"id":"cggv:d86554fa-14b7-4580-8a15-ee9ffd8b474c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd24c373-a881-490b-b420-41f91d2b09f7","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"We analysed 12 extended families with idiopathic\nmental retardation (10 nonspecific and two syndromal).

Despite recent progress, in most cases the molecular defects underlying this disorder remain unknown. Recently, a study using the candidate gene approach demonstrated the presence of mutations in PAK3 (p21-activating kinase) associated with nonspecific mental retardation. PAK3 is a member of the larger family of PAK genes. PAK proteins have been implicated as critical downstream effectors that link Rho-GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton and to MAP kinase cascades, including the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. We screened 12 MRX pedigrees that map to a large region overlying Xq21-q24. Mutation screening of the whole coding region of the PAK3 gene was performed by using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. We have identified a novel missense mutation in exon 2 of PAK3 gene (R67C) in MRX47. This confirms the involvement of PAK3 in MRX following the report of a nonsense mutation recently reported in MRX30. In the MRX47 family, all affected males show moderate to severe mental retardation. No seizures, statural growth deficiency, or minor facial or other abnormal physical features were observed. This mutation R67C is located in a conserved polybasic domain (AA 66-68) of the protein that is predicted to play a major role in the GTPases binding and stimulation of Pak activity.","dc:creator":"Bienvenu T","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Missense mutation in PAK3, R67C, causes X-linked nonspecific mental retardation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10946356","rdfs:label":"MRX47"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0a888c18-6460-42ff-9989-292a8449682f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4573ff6a-1bca-4b98-ba19-148e89fc9458","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"detectionMethod":"To investigate the possible contribution of de\nnovo and other rare variants to cerebral palsy, we sequenced the exomes of\n183 sporadic cases and where available, their unaffected parents.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0030746","obo:HP_0006970","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001250"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:0a888c18-6460-42ff-9989-292a8449682f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4b838eb2-e520-4456-9980-58b3f342c566","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000023.11:g.111216490C>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA414241997"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25666757","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common, clinically heterogeneous group of disorders affecting movement and posture.

Ten de novo mutations in three previously identified disease genes (TUBA1A (n=2), SCN8A (n=1) and KDM5C (n=1)) and in six novel candidate CP genes (AGAP1, JHDM1D, MAST1, NAA35, RFX2 and WIPI2) were predicted to be potentially pathogenic for CP.

The authors report a patient with a novel PAK3 mutation, who presented with intellectual disability, severe automutilation, and epilepsy. His magnetic resonance imaging changes were most likely secondary to lacerations from parenchymal contusions. His behavior was difficult to manage with behavior interventions or multiple medications.

Here, we report on a Tunisian family of X-linked moderate mental retardation with behavioural symptoms, common dysmorphic features, oro-motor impairment and secondary microcephaly. Linkage analysis showed that affected male subjects and obligate carrier female subjects share a common haplotype in the Xp21.31 - Xq23 region that contains the PAK3 gene. Direct sequencing of PAK3 coding exons and flanking intronic sequences allowed us to identify the first splice mutation in PAK3 gene located at the 5' end of intron 6 (c.276+4A>G), which results in a complete switch-off of the genuine donor splice site and an activation of a cryptic donor splice site (GTAAG) located four nucleotides downstream to the genuine one. RT-PCR experiments using the RNA from the patient's lymphoblasts showed that PAK3 transcripts contain four additional nucleotides that lead to a disruption of reading frame with a premature stop codon at position 128.

We report here that the three mutations R419X, A365E, and R67C, responsible for mental retardation have different effects on the biological functions of PAK3. The R419X and A365E mutations completely abrogate the kinase activity. The R67C mutation drastically decreases the binding of PAK3 to the small GTPase Cdc42 and impairs its subsequent activation by this GTPase. We also report that PAK3 binds significantly more Cdc42 than Rac1 and is selectively activated by endogenous Cdc42, suggesting that PAK3 is a specific effector of Cdc42. Interestingly, the expression of the three mutated proteins in hippocampal neurons affects spinogenesis differentially. Both kinase-dead mutants slightly decrease the number of spines but profoundly alter spine morphology, whereas expression of the R67C mutant drastically decreases spine density.
