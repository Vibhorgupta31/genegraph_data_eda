It was believed that these two proteins represented unique results of protein evolution in vertebrate muscle. In this paper we report the identification of a third giant protein from vertebrate muscle, obscurin, encoded on chromosome 1q42. Obscurin is approximately 800 kD and is expressed specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The complete cDNA sequence of obscurin reveals a modular architecture, consisting of >67 intracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)- or fibronectin-3-like domains with multiple splice variants. A large region of obscurin shows a modular architecture of tandem Ig domains reminiscent of the elastic region of titin. The COOH-terminal region of obscurin interacts via two specific Ig-like domains with the NH(2)-terminal Z-disk region of titin. Both proteins coassemble during myofibrillogenesis. During the progression of myofibrillogenesis, all obscurin epitopes become detectable at the M band. The presence of a calmodulin-binding IQ motif, and a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain in the COOH-terminal region suggest that obscurin is involved in Ca(2+)/calmodulin, as well as G protein-coupled signal transduction in the sarcomere.","dc:creator":"Young P","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Obscurin, a giant sarcomeric Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein involved in sarcomere assembly."},"rdfs:label":"Western Blot"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:98263637-3165-4375-849b-dc490f7f4ac6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3cc0fe8-af37-42d9-b997-5794f91ab3a5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Obscurin mutants exhibited significantly lower levels of obscurin protein compared with the other DCM samples and controls: (D4, 45±7%, p = <0.0001, n = 8, D14, 48\n±3%, p = <0.0001, n = 21 and D20, 72±6%, p = <0.014, n = 14).

These diseases are genetically diverse and associated with rare mutations in a large number of genes, many of which overlap among the phenotypes. To better investigate the genetic overlap between these three phenotypes and to identify new genotype-phenotype correlations, we designed a custom gene panel consisting of 115 genes known to be associated with cardiomyopathic phenotypes and channelopathies. A cohort of 38 unrelated patients, 16 affected by DCM, 14 by HCM and 8 by ARVC, was recruited for the study on the basis of more severe phenotypes and family history of cardiomyopathy and/or sudden death. We detected a total of 142 rare variants in 40 genes, and all patients were found to be carriers of at least one rare variant. Twenty-eight of the 142 rare variants were also predicted as potentially pathogenic variants and found in 26 patients. In 23 out of 38 patients, we found at least one novel potential gene-phenotype association. In particular, we detected three variants in OBSCN gene in ARVC patients, four variants in ANK2 gene and two variants in DLG1, TRPM4, and AKAP9 genes in DCM patients, two variants in PSEN2 gene and four variants in AKAP9 gene in HCM patients. Overall, our results confirmed that cardiomyopathic patients could carry multiple rare gene variants; in addition, our investigation of the genetic overlap among cardiomyopathies revealed new gene-phenotype associations. Furthermore, as our study confirms, data obtained using targeted next-generation sequencing could provide a remarkable contribution to the molecular diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, early identification of patients at risk for arrhythmia development, and better clinical management of cardiomyopathic patients.","dc:creator":"Forleo C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing detects novel gene-phenotype associations and expands the mutational spectrum in cardiomyopathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28750076","rdfs:label":"1718DCM"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"MAF of 0.06% in gnomAD.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least three variants (including missense and frameshift variants) have been reported in humans with DCM (Marston et al., 2015, PMID: 26406308; Rowland et al., 2015, PMID: 27855815). In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by expression studies and  in vitro functional assays. Expression studies have documented low levels of obscurin within the heart (Young et al., 2001, PMID: 11448995; Marston et al., 2015, PMID: 26406308). Yeast 2 hybrid and in vitro binding assay noted an interaction between obscurin and the titin Z-disc (Young et al., 2001, PMID: 11448995). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of OBSCN with autosomal dominant DCM.
