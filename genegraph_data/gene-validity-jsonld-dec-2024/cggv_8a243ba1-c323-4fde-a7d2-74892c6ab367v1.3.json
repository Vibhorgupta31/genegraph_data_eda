CDGS patients show a large number of glycoprotein abnormalities resulting in dysmorphy, encephalopathy, and other organ disorders. The majority of CDGSs described to date are related to an impaired biosynthesis of dolichyl pyrophosphate-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, we identified in four related patients a novel type of CDGS characterized by an accumulation of dolichyl pyrophosphate-linked Man9GlcNAc2. Elaborating on the analogy of this finding with the phenotype of alg5 and alg6 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, we have cloned and analyzed the human orthologs to the ALG5 dolichyl phosphate glucosyltransferase and ALG6 dolichyl pyrophosphate Man9GlcNAc2 alpha1,3-glucosyltransferase in four novel CDGS patients. Although ALG5 was not altered in the patients, a C-->T transition was detected in ALG6 cDNA of all four CDGS patients. The mutation cosegregated with the disease in a Mendelian recessive manner. Expression of the human ALG5 and ALG6 cDNA could partially complement the respective S. cerevisiae alg5 and alg6 deficiency. By contrast, the mutant ALG6 cDNA of CDGS patients failed to revert the hypoglycosylation observed in alg6 yeasts, thereby proving a functional relationship between the alanine to valine substitution introduced by the C-->T transition and the CDGS phenotype. The mutation in the ALG6 alpha1,3-glucosyltransferase gene defines an additional type of CDGS, which we propose to refer to as CDGS type-Ic.","dc:creator":"Imbach T","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"A mutation in the human ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALG6 gene causes carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type-Ic."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a243ba1-c323-4fde-a7d2-74892c6ab367_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:8a243ba1-c323-4fde-a7d2-74892c6ab367_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a7ad014-ea10-4b08-8ebf-a9802e76eeb8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a7ad014-ea10-4b08-8ebf-a9802e76eeb8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:433866b9-ddb8-49ee-b9eb-f83a8ae7a2eb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_013339.4(ALG6):c.257+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA223057"}},{"id":"cggv:ded70f30-1352-4f09-bd01-afd55ca94798","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_013339.4(ALG6):c.680G>A (p.Gly227Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA888217"}}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b71bb61d-30d3-4ad6-bc1f-b437ff4a6508_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ded70f30-1352-4f09-bd01-afd55ca94798"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23430515","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"ALG6-CDG (formerly named CDG-Ic) (phenotype OMIM 603147, genotype OMIM 604566), is caused by defective endoplasmic reticulum α-1,3-glucosyltransferase (E.C 2.4.1.267) in the N-glycan assembly pathway (Grünewald et al. 2000).

The genomic organization of the human ALG6 gene was determined, revealing 14 exons spread over 55 kb. By polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of ALG6 exons, three mutations, in addition to the previously described A333 V substitution, were detected in CDG-Ic patients. The detrimental effect of these mutations on ALG6 activity was confirmed by complementation of alg6 yeast mutants. Haplotype analysis of CDG-Ic patients revealed a founder effect for the ALG6 allele bearing the A333 V mutation.

The maternal mutation, C998T, causing an A333V substitution, has been shown to cause CDG-Ic, whereas the two paternal mutations, T391C (Y131H) and C924A (S308R) have not previously been reported. The mutations were tested for their ability to rescue faulty N:-linked glycosylation of carboxypeptidase Y in an ALG6-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. Normal human ALG6 rescues glycosylation and A333V partially rescues, whereas the combined paternal mutations (Y131H and S308R) are ineffective. Underglycosylation resulting from each of these mutations is much more severe in rapidly dividing yeast. Similarly, incomplete protein glycosylation in the patient is most severe in rapidly dividing enterocytes during gastroenteritis-induced stress.

Associated phenotypes include strabismus, seizures, truncal muscular hypotonia, intellectual disability, global developmental delay and ataxia (OMIM#603147). At least 41 affected individuals with variants in ALG6 have been reported in the literature, and variants have been observed to segregate with disease in several families (PMID: 27287710, PMID: 10359825, PMID: 20398363). A recurrent variant, A333V, has been observed across multiple ancestral groups. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional evidence demonstrating the impact of variants on the expression and structure of the encoded ALG protein (PMID: 10359825, PMID: 10914684, PMID: 11106564, PMID: 16007612). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between ALG6 and ALG-CDG. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 11, 2022 (SOP 9).
