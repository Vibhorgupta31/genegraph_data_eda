Here, we show that mutations in KLHL24 cause HCM in humans. Using genome-wide linkage analysis and exome sequencing, we identified homozygous mutations in KLHL24 in two consanguineous families with HCM. Of the 11 young affected adults identified, 3 died suddenly and 1 had a cardiac transplant due to heart failure. KLHL24 is a member of the Kelch-like protein family, which acts as substrate-specific adaptors to Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligases. Endomyocardial and skeletal muscle biopsies from affected individuals of both families demonstrated characteristic alterations, including accumulation of desmin intermediate filaments. Knock-down of the zebrafish homologue klhl24a results in heart defects similar to that described for other HCM-linked genes providing additional support for KLHL24 as a HCM-associated gene. Our findings reveal a crucial role for KLHL24 in cardiac development and function.","dc:creator":"Hedberg-Oldfors C","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Cardiomyopathy with lethal arrhythmias associated with inactivation of KLHL24."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1d4ce43-4c2d-41a0-b821-a11ac8eb8fca_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:faae44bd-b0ab-403f-96a4-2eef99bc0c6d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:faae44bd-b0ab-403f-96a4-2eef99bc0c6d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c045793f-1bc5-4e33-8101-1e7ad0536f27","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017644.3(KLHL24):c.917G>A (p.Arg306His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2721630"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"ICD at 35yo, normal sinus rhythm, Small left ventricular cavity, LV end-diastolic volume (mL)=37, Septal wall thickness (cm)=2.2, Posterior wall thickness (cm)=1.9, EF=67%","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0005157","obo:HP_0002875","obo:HP_0001653","obo:HP_0001962"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"linkage mapping of 5 phenotypically affected individuals, CNV analysis","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:a3baab67-6f84-42d5-9f98-fd362d560c38_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c045793f-1bc5-4e33-8101-1e7ad0536f27"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30715372"},"rdfs:label":"Family B V:2"},{"id":"cggv:a3baab67-6f84-42d5-9f98-fd362d560c38","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3baab67-6f84-42d5-9f98-fd362d560c38_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a3baab67-6f84-42d5-9f98-fd362d560c38_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Knock down of the cardiac-specific zebrafish homolog of KLHL24, klhl24a with antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) technique resulted in defects in heart function at 48 hours postfertilization (hpf).

Defects in structural proteins such as keratins cause skin fragility, epitomized by epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a life-threatening disorder. Here we show that dominant mutations of KLHL24, encoding a cullin 3-RBX1 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor, cause EB. We have identified start-codon mutations in the KLHL24 gene in five patients with EB. These mutations lead to truncated KLHL24 protein lacking the initial 28 amino acids (KLHL24-ΔN28). KLHL24-ΔN28 is more stable than its wild-type counterpart owing to abolished autoubiquitination. We have further identified keratin 14 (KRT14) as a KLHL24 substrate and found that KLHL24-ΔN28 induces excessive ubiquitination and degradation of KRT14. Using a knock-in mouse model, we have confirmed that the Klhl24 mutations lead to stabilized Klhl24-ΔN28 and cause Krt14 degradation.
