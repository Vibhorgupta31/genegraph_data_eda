Although insertions, deletions, nonsense and missense mutations have been identified, no genotype-phenotype correlation could be found, suggesting that the gene alterations lead to a loss of protein function irrespective of the mutation.

We previously showed that Twist haploinsufficiency caused by a Y103X nonsense mutation in SCS alters both proliferation and osteoblast gene expression in human calvarial osteoblasts, indicating that Twist is an important regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Here we show that Twist haploinsufficiency alters osteoblast apoptosis in SCS. Analysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labelling (TUNEL) demonstrated increased osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis in coronal sutures from two SCS patients with nonsense mutations (Y103X and Q109X) that result in the synthesis of bHLH-truncated proteins, and one patient with a missense mutation in the basic domain (R118C) that abolishes Twist DNA binding. To assess the mechanisms involved, we studied osteoblast apoptosis in mutant (M-Tw) calvarial cells bearing the Y103X mutation resulting in decreased Twist mRNA and protein levels. M-Tw cells cultured in low serum conditions showed enhanced DNA fragmentation compared to normal (Nl) age-matched calvarial cells. Biochemical analysis showed increased activity of initiator caspases-2 and -8 and downstream effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 in mutant osteoblasts. Caspase-2 was upstream of caspase-8 and effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 because their activities were suppressed by a specific caspase-2 inhibitor. M-Tw osteoblasts also showed increased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. However, the activity of the downstream effector caspase-9 was not increased due to overexpression of the antagonist protein Hsp70. Detection of differentially expressed genes using cDNA expression array revealed increased Bax and TNFalpha mRNA levels in M-Tw compared to Nl cells, a finding confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Neutralization of TNFalpha overexpression using anti-TNFalpha or anti-TNF receptor 1 antibodies abolished the increased activity of caspase-2, caspase-8 and caspases-3, -6 and -7 in M-Tw osteoblasts. These studies provide novel evidence that Twist haploinsufficiency in SCS promotes osteoblast apoptosis by a TNFalpha-caspase-2-caspase-8-caspases-3, -6, -7 cascade, and uncover a molecular mechanism in which Twist plays an anti-apoptotic role in human calvarial osteoblasts.","dc:creator":"Yousfi M","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Twist haploinsufficiency in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome induces calvarial osteoblast apoptosis due to increased TNFalpha expression and caspase-2 activation."},"rdfs:label":"Increased osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis (Y103X)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Variant seen in 1 case (FSCSLC75) described in Howard 1997 (PMID: 8988166) however this study does not support or refute pathogenicity.

We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. We mapped TWIST to human chromosome 7p21-p22 and mutational analysis reveals nonsense, missense, insertion and deletion mutations in patients.

The emerging cascade of molecular components involved in craniofacial and limb development now includes TWIST, which may function as an upstream regulator of FGFRs.","dc:creator":"Howard TD","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutations in TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8988166","rdfs:label":"FSCSAGFl4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Inherited missense variant with no functional evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:1730a1bb-49c2-4c11-8c45-e8747d8fb91d_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81fdc305-360f-4df7-b6f7-eaf91dd9c1c9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf746ff3-6331-4b73-bba2-5517a2bfdf47","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Dx of Robinow-Sorauf syndrome (lumped under this curation) Craniosynostosis and broad thumbs and halluces \n2 days: suffered seizures which were treated with phenobarbital\n4 months: protruding fontanelle w/o signs of brain pressure was noted\n15-months-old: plagiocephaly, downward slanting palpebral fissures and marked bilateral ptosis, a protruding anterior fontanelle, and broad thumbs and halluces with valgus deformity \nRadiographs: duplication of distal phalanx of the halluces \n","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:81fdc305-360f-4df7-b6f7-eaf91dd9c1c9_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:76081e1f-64af-4525-a367-82601c0d7009","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000474.4(TWIST1):c.460dup (p.Arg154LysfsTer84)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7981"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10465122","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Kunz J","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Identification of a frameshift mutation in the gene TWIST in a family affected with Robinow-Sorauf syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10465122","rdfs:label":"III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:8723b01f-073b-42a2-b1c3-585cadad5bb0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a88b0d8-6868-48e2-a868-a106d829c898","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001159","obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0000520","obo:HP_0004440","obo:HP_0000263","obo:HP_0001357","obo:HP_0010193","obo:HP_0010055","obo:HP_0000324"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:8723b01f-073b-42a2-b1c3-585cadad5bb0_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:48c46155-425f-421a-b7e5-af153121ae10","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000474.4(TWIST1):c.211C>T (p.Gln71Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA280125"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1240778","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"ACS was highly variable in this family.

Here we report linkage of BPES in a large Indian pedigree to chromosome 7p13-p21; affected only two-point and multipoint analyses using D7S488, D7S2551 and D7S2562 both showed peak lod scores of 3.61 coincident with D7S2562. Recombinations in affected individuals placed the critical region between D7S488 and D7S629. When both affected and unaffected individuals were considered, a maximum two-point lod score of 3.38 at theta = 0.08 was obtained with D7S2551 while a peak multipoint lod score of 3.64 was obtained between D7S488 and D7S2551. Segregation analysis revealed two unaffected individuals carrying the affected haplotype accounted for the difference in peak, relative to the affected only analysis. The chromosome 7p candidate genes inhibin beta A and epidermal growth factor receptor map outside this region whereas the HOX1 gene cluster may map inside this region. Although BPES is sometimes associated with female infertility due to premature ovarian failure, in the current family affected females were fertile.

Studying a series of 22 unrelated ACS III patients, we have found TWIST mutations in 16/22 cases. Interestingly, these mutations consistently involved the b-HLH domain of the protein. Indeed, mutant genotypes included frameshift deletions/insertions, nonsense and missense mutations, either truncating or disrupting the b-HLH motif of the protein. This observation gives additional support to the view that most ACS III cases result from loss-of-function mutations at the TWIST locus. The P250R recurrent FGFR 3 mutation was found in 2/22 cases presenting mild clinical manifestations of the disease but 4/22 cases failed to harbour TWIST or FGFR 3 mutations. Clinical re-examination of patients carrying TWIST mutations failed to reveal correlations between the mutant genotype and severity of the phenotype.

This syndrome was first described independently by Saethre and Chotzen in 1931 and 1932, respectively. The mechanism of disease is haploinsufficiency caused by either protein degradation or subcellular mislocalization based upon the variant‚Äôs location in TWIST1 (10749989). Numerous variants (nonsense, frameshift etc.) have been identified in patients with SCS. This gene-disease association is supported by genetic, segregation, and experimental evidence. After completing a lumping and splitting evaluation, the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations expert panel decided to lump Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and Robinow-Sorauf syndrome; these conditions are not distinct entities and lack differences in phenotype, molecular mechanism, and inheritance pattern. This is consistent with the published literature (12791045). Notably, TWIST1 has also been described in association with non-syndromic Craniosynostosis and Sweeney-Cox syndrome. These conditions will be assessed separately. In summary, TWIST is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert panel on 1/28/21 (SOP version 8).
