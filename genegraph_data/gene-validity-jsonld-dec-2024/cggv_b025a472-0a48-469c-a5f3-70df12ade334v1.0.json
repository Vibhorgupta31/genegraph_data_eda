In this study we tried to investigate the expression of Tmie protein in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung, as well as in the cochlea. We examined various tissue samples from five different age groups of C57BL/6J animals. Using western blotting analysis, the expression of Tmie protein in these organs has been identified. The results show that Tmie protein expression in the cochlea has been increased in postnatal developmental stages, indicating that Tmie plays an important role in not only the development and also in the function of the cochlea. The expression pattern of Tmie in adult mouse organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, and spleen significantly vary in adult rats.

Using a positional cloning strategy, we have identified the mutant locus responsible for this pathology. The affected gene (Tmie) lies within a 40 kb deletion in the original sr allele. In a newly identified allele, Tmie contains a nonsense mutation expected to truncate the C-terminal end of its product. The 153 amino acid protein encoded by the gene shows no similarity to other known proteins, and is predicted to contain a signal peptide and at least one transmembrane domain. Tmie transcripts were identified in several tissues, including the cochlea. Loss of function of Tmie results in postnatal alterations of sensory hair cells in the cochlea, including defects in stereocilia, the apical projections of hair cells that are important in mechanotransduction of sound. These morphological defects are associated with a profound failure to develop normal auditory function. Consistent with a conserved role for this gene in the cochlea, the genetic mapping data presented here support human TMIE as the gene affected at DFNB6, a non-syndromic hearing loss locus.

This association was made using case-level data and experimental evidence. At least 8 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. TMIE was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2002 (Naz et al.​). Association is seen in at least 8 or probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 12145746, 19438934, 24416283). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 11 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, knockout mouse models, biochemical function studies, protein interaction studies and a rescue in a mouse model (PMIDs: 25467981, 25475183, 19934034, 12140191). In summary, TMIE is definitively associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 9/29/2017.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b025a472-0a48-469c-a5f3-70df12ade334"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
