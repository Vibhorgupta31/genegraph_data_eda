The molecular basis of the platelet production defect is unknown. Despite high conservation of cytochrome c between human and mouse (91.4% identity), introducing the G41S mutation into mouse cytochrome c in a knockin mouse (CycsG41S/G41S) did not recapitulate the low platelet phenotype of Thrombocytopenia Cargeeg. While investigating the cause of this disparity we found a lack of conservation of the functional impact of cytochrome c mutations on caspase activation across species. Mutation of cytochrome c at residue 41 has distinct effects on the ability of cytochrome c to activate caspases depending on the species of both the cytochrome c and its binding partner Apaf-1. In contrast to our previous results showing the G41S mutation increases the ability of human cytochrome c to activate caspases, here we find this activity is decreased in mouse G41S cytochrome c. Additionally unlike wildtype human cytochrome c, G41S cytochrome c is unable to activate caspases in Xenopus embryo extracts. Taken together these results demonstrate a previously unreported species-specific component to the interaction of cytochrome c with Apaf-1. This suggests that the electrostatic interaction between cytochrome c and Apaf-1 is not the sole determinant of binding, with additional factors controlling binding specificity and affinity.

In PMID 24326104 this variant investigated in complementation studies in S. cerevisiae, which carry a CYC1 deletion, and the rescue of failure to grow was significantly reduced compared to wildtype under temperature-induced stress conditions. A ~30-40% reduction in oxygen consumption was also observed in both yeast and mouse cells expressing the variant. In Cycs−/−/Cyct−/− mouse lung fibroblasts, both basal and STS-induced apoptosis were enhanced when the mutant construct was expressed compared to the wild-type cDNA."},{"id":"cggv:4829384b-fe13-4128-b151-14f969ef4b25_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:578d4309-55a6-483a-b711-b153e13ec0ba","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:4829384b-fe13-4128-b151-14f969ef4b25_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:49571174-8fe6-4e9d-9209-54259a5e50be"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32581362"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32581362","rdfs:label":"N013631"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Insufficient demographic information is provided to determine if this is an independent occurrence of the Leu99Val missense variant.\n"},{"id":"cggv:3cd0fab7-828b-42c4-b255-139d1f438288_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f98158f-e7cc-410c-a696-e0c0d722294b","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3cd0fab7-828b-42c4-b255-139d1f438288_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:99296c2a-89a0-456b-a3be-9f2dc2bb3e0a"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32581362"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32581362","rdfs:label":"A002680"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Insufficient demographic information is provided to determine if this is an independent occurrence of the Gly42Ser missense variant."},{"id":"cggv:64e1d254-2e76-4794-b0a2-36f948c8bb87_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fd844186-3c07-4581-8844-11aa73dd9241","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Capture baits were designed to target all consensus coding sequences of the ThromboGenomics genes, the first and last 100 bp of introns, 5’ and 3’ UTRs, regions 1,000bp upstream of the transcription start site and the position of known pathogenic variants.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"The patients was sequenced with the ThromboGenomics  HTS panel V2 or V3 which includes 80 and 96  genes, respectively, associated with bleeding, thrombotic and platelet disorders.","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:64e1d254-2e76-4794-b0a2-36f948c8bb87_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:99296c2a-89a0-456b-a3be-9f2dc2bb3e0a"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31064749"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31064749","rdfs:label":"TGP0164"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The Gly42Ser missense variant has ample evidence to support a deleterious effect on the protein as described for the family in PMID: 18345000.

Various etiologies of thrombocytopenia, including genetic, immunological, and hematopoietic abnormalities, determine the prognosis for this disease. In this study, we identified a novel heterozygous mutation in a gene encoding cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS, MIM123970) using whole exome sequencing. This variant (c.301_303del:p.Lys101del) is located in the α-helix of the cytochrome c (CYCS) C-terminal domain. In silico structural analysis suggested that this mutation results in protein folding instability. CYCS is one of the key factors regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Using the yeast model system, we clearly demonstrated that this one amino acid deletion (in-frame) resulted in significantly reduced cytochrome c protein expression and functional defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, indicating that the loss of function of cytochrome c underlies thrombocytopenia. The clinical features of known CYCS variants have been reported to be confined to mild or asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, as was observed for the patient in our study. This study clearly demonstrates that thrombocytopenia can result from CYCS loss-of-function variants.","dc:creator":"Uchiyama Y","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"A novel CYCS mutation in the α-helix of the CYCS C-terminal domain causes non-syndromic thrombocytopenia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30051457","rdfs:label":"II-4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This in frame deletion, Lys101del, was introduced in S. pombe and exhibited a growth defect on YEA?Gly plates, similar to the cyc1 deletion strain.

At least 6 unique variants (5 missense and 1 small in-frame deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 18345000, 2432610, 27479822, 30051457, 31064749, 32581362). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 34 additional family members. Experimental evidence of a functional alteration of platelet formation (PMID: 27861742) was shown in patient cells, however the normal function of CYCS in relation to platelet formation remains unclear. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\nThe point total of 6.8 is intermediate between the Limited and Moderate classification. The Hemostasis Thrombosis GCEP has determined that the appropriate classification is Limited because there is a lack of experimental evidence (only 0.5pt) explaining the role the gene plays in disease.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:772f2ad2-5d8c-41f6-95c4-39063daf77be"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
