At least 16 unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 5 publications (PMID19526370, 20197121, 20693550, 20453710, 29217198).
