This was demonstrated by tandem mass spectrometry. After incubation of P6C with PLP, two adducts appeared and the PLP signal decreased (Fig. 2). Incubation of PLP with urine from an individual with pyridoxine-dependent seizures produced identical adducts. Knoevenagel condensation of PLP and P6C is expected to inactivate PLP, reducing the function of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD, which requires PLP as a cofactor.

Despite treatment, neurodevelopmental disabilities are still observed in most PDE patients underlining the need for adjunct therapies. Over 60 years after the initial description of PDE, we report the first animal model for this disease: an aldh7a1-null zebrafish (Danio rerio) displaying deficient lysine metabolism and spontaneous and recurrent seizures in the larval stage (10 days postfertilization). Epileptiform electrographic activity was observed uniquely in mutants as a series of population bursts in tectal recordings. Remarkably, as is the case in human PDE, the seizures show an almost immediate sensitivity to pyridoxine and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, with a resulting extension of the life span. Lysine supplementation aggravates the phenotype, inducing earlier seizure onset and death. By using mass spectrometry techniques, we further explored the metabolic effect of aldh7a1 knockout. Impaired lysine degradation with accumulation of PDE biomarkers, B6 deficiency, and low γ-aminobutyric acid levels were observed in the aldh7a1-/- larvae, which may play a significant role in the seizure phenotype and PDE pathogenesis.

Patients with this same condition have also been reported as having folinic acid responsive seizures (Gallagher et al, 2009, PMID 19142996). ALDH7A1 encodes alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin, which converts alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde (AASA) to alpha-aminoadipic acid, a critical step in lysine catabolism. Variants in ALDH7A1 causing PDE were first reported by Mills et al, 2006 (PMID 16491085). Since then, over eighty PDE-associated variants have been reported in ALDH7A1 (see Pena et al, 2017, PMID 30058881, for review). Data from 10 patients with 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) from 2 publications were curated (Mills et al, 2006, PMID 16491085; Salomons et al, 2007, PMID 17721876). Additional cases are available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase (antiquitin), which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical features of the disease (Mills et al, 2006, PMID 16491085), expression in brain (Jansen et al, 2014; PMID 24122892), functional studies of missense variants (Coulter-Mackie et al, 2012, PMID 22784480), and the phenotype observed in two CRISPR-generated aldh7a1 zebrafish models (Pena et al, 2017; PMID 29061647; Zabinyakov et al, 2017, PMID 29053735). Additional experimental data supporting the gene-disease relationship is available but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. Data curated by Illumina is included in this curation. In summary, ALDH7A1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive PDE. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
