Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case level data and segregation data. At least 11 unique variants (missense (n=10) and nonsense (n=1)) have been reported in humans, representing at least 17 probands from 4 publications (Duboscq-Bidot L et al, 2009, PMID: 19525294; Moulik et al, 2009, PMID: 19608030, Dalin et al, 2017, PMID: 27886618, Haas et al, 2015, PMID: 25163546). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members (Duboscq-Bidot L et al, 2009, PMID: 19525294). In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by evidence from expression studies (Duboscq-Bidot L et al, 2009, PMID: 19525294; Moulik et al, 2009, PMID: 19608030) and in vitro functional assays (Moulik et al, 2009, PMID: 19608030). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of ANKRD1 with autosomal dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on February 14, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3dcc6918-d7e7-4385-b343-bc8b8678b3a4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
