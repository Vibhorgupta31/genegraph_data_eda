Previous studies have indicated high levels of genetic heterogeneity, with estimates of more than 2500 autosomal ID genes, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (AR). Here, we combined microarray genotyping, homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) mapping, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, and whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify disease genes/mutations in 192 multiplex Pakistani and Iranian consanguineous families with non-syndromic ID. We identified definite or candidate mutations (or CNVs) in 51% of families in 72 different genes, including 26 not previously reported for ARID. The new ARID genes include nine with loss-of-function mutations (ABI2, MAPK8, MPDZ, PIDD1, SLAIN1, TBC1D23, TRAPPC6B, UBA7 and USP44), and missense mutations include the first reports of variants in BDNF or TET1 associated with ID. The genes identified also showed overlap with de novo gene sets for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcriptional studies showed prominent expression in the prenatal brain. The high yield of AR mutations for ID indicated that this approach has excellent clinical potential and should inform clinical diagnostics, including clinical whole exome and genome sequencing, for populations in which consanguinity is common. As with other AR disorders, the relevance will also apply to outbred populations.","dc:creator":"Harripaul R","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mapping autosomal recessive intellectual disability: combined microarray and exome sequencing identifies 26 novel candidate genes in 192 consanguineous families."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:021d5aa5-6447-4b49-a748-219c4dd356f4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:021d5aa5-6447-4b49-a748-219c4dd356f4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91d8c521-cde0-47ff-95a9-98dcd58e534f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f54b5a02-a793-45cd-ada6-75b62858892f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The phentype of pidd1 mice is not similar to phentype obseved in humans.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33414379","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"PIDD1 encodes p53-Induced Death Domain protein 1, which acts as a sensor surveilling centrosome numbers and p53 activity in mammalian cells. Early results also suggest a role in DNA damage response where PIDD1 may act as a cell-fate switch, through interaction with RIP1 and NEMO/IKKg, activating NF-ÎºB signaling for survival, or as an apoptosis-inducing protein by activating caspase-2. Biallelic truncating mutations in CRADD-the protein bridging PIDD1 and caspase-2-have been reported in intellectual disability (ID), and in a form of lissencephaly. Here, we identified five families with ID from Iran, Pakistan, and India, with four different biallelic mutations in PIDD1, all disrupting the Death Domain (DD), through which PIDD1 interacts with CRADD or RIP1. Nonsense mutations Gln863* and Arg637* directly disrupt the DD, as does a missense mutation, Arg815Trp. A homozygous splice mutation in the fifth family is predicted to disrupt splicing upstream of the DD, as confirmed using an exon trap. In HEK293 cells, we show that both Gln863* and Arg815Trp mutants fail to co-localize with CRADD, leading to its aggregation and mis-localization, and fail to co-precipitate CRADD. Using genome-edited cell lines, we show that these three PIDD1 mutations all cause loss of PIDDosome function. Pidd1 null mice show decreased anxiety, but no motor abnormalities. Together this indicates that PIDD1 mutations in humans may cause ID (and possibly lissencephaly) either through gain of function or secondarily, due to altered scaffolding properties, while complete loss of PIDD1, as modeled in mice, may be well tolerated or is compensated for.","dc:creator":"Sheikh TI","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Biallelic mutations in the death domain of PIDD1 impair caspase-2 activation and are associated with intellectual disability."},"rdfs:label":"pidd1 knock out mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No similarity of phenotypes were found between mice models and human."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:021d5aa5-6447-4b49-a748-219c4dd356f4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d15ea798-0641-4b67-b85e-a6bbd65ea308_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d15ea798-0641-4b67-b85e-a6bbd65ea308","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3fc43ae5-9aef-487a-9aba-c6167fc63657","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_145886.4(PIDD1):c.2443C>T (p.Arg815Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5789564"}},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:8418d94b-fe60-4caa-a874-3a8343fbaf1b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3fc43ae5-9aef-487a-9aba-c6167fc63657"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29302074","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Autosomal recessive (AR) gene defects are the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID) in countries with frequent parental consanguinity, which account for about 1/7th of the world population.

In the recent years, biallelic pathogenic variants in CRADD have been associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder (MRT34; MIM 614499) characterized by pachygyria with a predominant anterior gradient, megalencephaly, epilepsy and intellectual disability. More recently, biallelic pathogenic variants in PIDD1 have been described in a few families with apparently nonsydnromic intellectual disability. Here, we aim to delineate the genetic and radio-clinical features of PIDD1-related disorder. Exome sequencing was carried out in six consanguineous families. Thorough clinical and neuroradiological evaluation was performed for all the affected individuals as well as reviewing all the data from previously reported cases. We identified five distinct novel homozygous variants (c.2584C>T p.(Arg862Trp), c.1340G>A p.(Trp447*), c.2116_2120del p.(Val706Hisfs*30), c.1564_1565delCA p.(Gln522fs*44), and c.1804_1805del p.(Gly602fs*26) in eleven subjects displaying intellectual disability, behaviorial and psychiatric features, and a typical anterior-predominant pachygyria, remarkably resembling the CRADD-related neuroimaging pattern.

This disorder is characterized by moderate to severe global developmental delay/intellectual disability, and variant lissencephaly with neuropsychiatric features. Nine variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) that have been reported in 11 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28397838, 29302074, 33414379, 34163010) are included in this curation. All the reported probands were from consanguineous families and are homozygous. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is believed to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by in vitro functional assays (PMID: 33414379). Four different biallelic variants in *PIDD1* (p.Gln863*, p.Arg637*, c.2275-1G>A and p.Arg815Trp ) were found to disrupt the Death Domain (DD), through which PIDD1 interacts with CRADD and RIP1. Nonsense variants Gln863* and Arg637* directly disrupt the DD, as does a missense variant, Arg815Trp. In HEK293 cells, both Gln863*and Arg815Trp mutants failed to co-localize with CRADD, leading to pidd1 aggregation, mis-localization, and failure to co-precipitate CRADD. All the three *PIDD1* variants listed above caused loss of PIDDosome function in genome-edited cell lines. \n In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PIDD1 and autosomal recessive intellectual developmental disorder-75 with neuropsychiatric features and variant lissencephaly. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen ID/Autism GCEP on the meeting date June 4th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:021d5aa5-6447-4b49-a748-219c4dd356f4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
