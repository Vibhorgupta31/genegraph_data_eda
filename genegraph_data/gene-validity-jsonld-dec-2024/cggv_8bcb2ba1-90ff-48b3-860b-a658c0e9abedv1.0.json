S1P regulates lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, and lysosome biogenesis in mice and in cultured cells. However, how S1P differentially regulates these diverse functions in humans has been unclear. In addition, no human disease with S1P deficiency has been identified. Here, we report a pediatric patient with an amorphic and a severely hypomorphic mutation in MBTPS1. The unique combination of these mutations results in a frequency of functional MBTPS1 transcripts of approximately 1%, a finding that is associated with skeletal dysplasia and elevated blood lysosomal enzymes. We found that the residually expressed S1P is sufficient for lipid homeostasis but not for ER and lysosomal functions, especially in chondrocytes. The defective S1P function specifically impairs activation of the ER stress transducer BBF2H7, leading to ER retention of collagen in chondrocytes. S1P deficiency also causes abnormal secretion of lysosomal enzymes due to partial impairment of mannose-6-phosphate-dependent delivery to lysosomes. Collectively, these abnormalities lead to apoptosis of chondrocytes and lysosomal enzyme-mediated degradation of the bone matrix. Correction of an MBTPS1 variant or reduction of ER stress mitigated collagen-trafficking defects. These results define a new congenital human skeletal disorder and, more importantly, reveal that S1P is particularly required for skeletal development in humans. Our findings may also lead to new therapies for other genetic skeletal diseases, as ER dysfunction is common in these disorders.","dc:creator":"Kondo Y","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Site-1 protease deficiency causes human skeletal dysplasia due to defective inter-organelle protein trafficking."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8bcb2ba1-90ff-48b3-860b-a658c0e9abed_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8bcb2ba1-90ff-48b3-860b-a658c0e9abed_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fedca384-29c7-482d-9c16-9f8d431189b4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca90c96d-1344-4566-b9fc-270dd93a5af0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"S1P-KO and GPT-KO clones showed increased activity of the M6P-dependent lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase compared with supernatants from WT cells, i","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30046013","rdfs:label":"Saos2 osteosarcoma cell line lacking S1P (S1P-KO cells) "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8bcb2ba1-90ff-48b3-860b-a658c0e9abed_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2245f4e9-c6e0-476d-85e2-4d2e3fa3c978","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb98523f-53e6-433a-bd35-b71827dcf990","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In the mouse models with inducible global or chondrocyte-specific deficiency of S1P, the researchers observed elevated plasma lysosomal enzyme activities and bone defects.

Blood lysosomal enzyme levels have also been shown to be elevated with a delay in development. The first variant described was compound heterozygosity for mutations in the MBTPS1 gene: a 1-bp duplication and a missense mutation. In the current study, we examined a Saudi consanguineous family. Clinical features like spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, indicative of characteristic skeletal abnormalities, and impaired cognitive abilities were observed. Our patient has dysmorphic facial features, short stature, and significant skeletal deformities. A homozygous missense MBTPS1 (c.2634C > A p. (Ser878Arg)) with unknown significance was discovered in the whole exome; pathogenic MBTPS1 variants cause the autosomal recessive Kondo-Fu type of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDKF, OMIM®: 618392). The whole exome sequence, which described a homozygous missense variant of unknown clinical significance (VUS, class 3 variant) in the MBTPS1 gene, was heterozygous in both asymptomatic parents. We are mindful that changing the classification of a variant of unknown significance is challenging. Considering clinical phenotypes and radiological findings produced by the pathogenic mutation in the MBTPS1 gene, the identified c.2634C > A variant is supported and may be categorized as likely pathogenic based on clinical symptoms.","dc:creator":"Alotaibi M","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Identification of a New Variant of the MBTPS1 Gene of the Kondo-Fu Type of Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia (SEDKF) in a Saudi Patient."}},"rdfs:label":"Aloitabi et al., "},{"id":"cggv:dfbdc6e2-234b-493c-ae05-3d3f4c0411d2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dfbdc6e2-234b-493c-ae05-3d3f4c0411d2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8433,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":16.1,"subject":{"id":"cggv:aa410012-4664-441f-a378-766dde41c0c0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0032721","gene":"hgnc:15456","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"MBTPS1 was first reported in relation to the Autosomal Recessive Kondo-Fu type of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDKF) in 2018 by Yuji Kondo et al. (PMID: 30046013). SEDKF is a disorder characterized by several features including short stature, chest deformity, spine abnormalities, reduced bone density, hernia, abdominal protrusion, cataracts, developmental delay, and distinctive facial features. Additional symptoms may include abnormal gait, cranial abnormalities, mild intellectual disability, and seizures. Diagnostic imaging reveals various skeletal abnormalities, and elevated levels of certain lysosomal enzymes can be detected in blood samples (Wang, Hua et al., PMID: 38048414). \nBiallelic variants in MBTPS1 have been reported in individuals diagnosed with SEDKF. In addition, two individuals with cataract, alopecia, oral mucosal disorder, and psoriasis-like syndrome (CAOP), and compound heterozygous a stop loss variant and another variant in MBTPS1, have been described (Chen et al. 2022, PMID: 35362222). SEDKF and CAOP present with overlapping clinical features, including bilateral cataracts and sparse hair, and may represent a clinical spectrum. Both disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no clear difference in molecular mechanism, although we note that both CAOP patients have a MBTPS1 stop loss variant; stop loss variants have not been reported in SEDKF. According to criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have lumped CAOP and SEDKF under one disease entity: Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kondo-Fu type (OMIM: 618392). If additional cases with CAOP are reported in the future, we may re-evaluate the lumping and splitting decision. However, at the current time, there is insufficient evidence for splitting. Of note, an individual with a different phenotype than SEDKF or CAOP and a heterozygous de novo variant in MBTPS1, compatible with a gain of function mechanism, has been reported (PMID: 31070020) indicating that MBTPS1 may be associated with multiple disease entities. The disease entity resulting from de novo, gain of function variants in MBTPS1 will be curated separately in the future. \nTwelve variants (including missense, nonsense, and splicing variants) that have been reported in 9 probands in 8 publications (PMID: 30046013, PMID: 32857899, PMID: 32420688, PMID: 35362222, PMID: 36330313, PMID: 36714646, PMID: 38337829, PMID: 36816387) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence: Mouse lines displayed elevated plasma lysosomal enzyme activities and bone defects, similar to the patients (PMID: 30046013). An mbtps1-knockdown zebrafish model was also generated using an antisense morpholino (mbtps1-MO) and showed skeletal deformities, delayed development, and skin abnormalities (PMID: 35362222). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between MBTPS1 and Autosomal Recessive Kondo-Fu type of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal GCEP on May 7, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\nFirst paper from Kondo et al., PMID: 30046013 is from 2018.
