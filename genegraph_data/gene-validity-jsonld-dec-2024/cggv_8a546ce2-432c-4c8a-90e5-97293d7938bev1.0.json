LDS is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in either TGF-β receptor gene (TGFBR1 or TGFBR2), which are predicted to result in diminished TGF-β signaling; however, aortic surgical samples from patients show evidence of paradoxically increased TGF-β signaling. We generated 2 knockin mouse strains with LDS mutations in either Tgfbr1 or Tgfbr2 and a transgenic mouse overexpressing mutant Tgfbr2. Knockin and transgenic mice, but not haploinsufficient animals, recapitulated the LDS phenotype. While heterozygous mutant cells had diminished signaling in response to exogenous TGF-β in vitro, they maintained normal levels of Smad2 phosphorylation under steady-state culture conditions, suggesting a chronic compensation. Analysis of TGF-β signaling in the aortic wall in vivo revealed progressive upregulation of Smad2 phosphorylation and TGF-β target gene output, which paralleled worsening of aneurysm pathology and coincided with upregulation of TGF-β1 ligand expression. Importantly, suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and TGF-β1 expression correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan. Together, these data suggest that increased TGF-β signaling contributes to postnatal aneurysm progression in LDS.","dc:creator":"Gallo EM","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Angiotensin II-dependent TGF-β signaling contributes to Loeys-Dietz syndrome vascular pathogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"TGFBR1-M318R develop aortic dissection and aneurysm"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":4,"dc:description":"This mouse model represents a genetic knockin of a patient derived mutation that recapitulates the cardiovascular phenotypes associated with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome, therefore the points were increased."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":419,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:33d96aaf-bac6-42e6-8bdb-c444c3b498eb","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018954","gene":"hgnc:11772","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The first report indicating a relationship between the TGFBR1 gene and autosomal dominant Loeys Dietz syndrome was reported by Dietz et al in 2005 (PMID: 15731757). Loeys Dietz syndrome is a multisystemic disorder with craniofacial, skeletal, integumental and ocular involvement (reviewed in Van Laer et al., 2014 PMID: 24443023 ). Loeys Dietz syndrome comprises a broad phenotypic spectrum of severity including seemingly isolated aortic aneurysm and/or dissection to the full syndrome  and thus represents a continuum of disease (reviewed in Van Laer et al., 2014 PMID: 24443023; Verstraeten et al., 2016 PMID: 26919284). Aortic aneurysm and tortuosity represent the  major morbidity and mortality of Loeys Dietz syndrome. Over 120 variants have been identified in TGBFR1 (Verstraeten et al., 2016 PMID: 26919284) according to the UMD-TGFBR1 database (http://www.umd.be/TGFBR1/), with the majority being missense and more rarely, nonsense, splice site and small deletions. The mechanism for the gene-disease relationship is perturbation of the TGF beta signaling pathway, however the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear and could include gain of function and dominant negative (reviewed in Van Laer et al., 2014 PMID: 24443023; Verstraeten et al., 2016 PMID: 26919284). The majority of the mutations result in aberrant kinase activity of TGFBR1. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, functional data, and model organisms. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for more than 10 years and a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data is available and the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. \n\nIn summary, TGFBR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Loeys Dietz syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on March 27, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8a546ce2-432c-4c8a-90e5-97293d7938be"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
