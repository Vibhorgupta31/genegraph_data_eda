The N-terminal blocking of proteins occurs in a wide range of eukariotic cells, where more than 50% of the cytosolic proteins can be N-alpha-acetylated. The acetylation which occurs during or after the biosynthesis of the polypeptide chains serves to protect the intracellular proteins from proteolysis. Food processing can also generate N-alpha-acetylated proteins and peptides. The mechanism underlying the intracellular catabolism of N-acetylated proteins has not yet been elucidated, however. It is generally assumed that two enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of the N-terminal part of the proteins. The NH(2)-blocked peptides generated during proteolysis may be cleaved by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase (APH). This releases the N-terminal amino acid, which is in turn deacetylated by an aminoacylase, the most common of which is aminoacylase 1 (ACY 1). The corresponding free amino acid is therefore available for protein synthesis. Both APH and ACY 1 are cytoplasmic enzymes, which have been isolated from various mammalian tissues. APH belongs to a novel class of serine-type peptidases called the prolyl oligopeptidase (PROP) family. ACY 1 belongs to the M20 metalloenzyme family. In this review, the processes involved in alpha- and epsilon-acetylation and the catabolism of endogenous proteins and proteins involved in food processing are discussed. We then focus on the characteristics of the APH and ACY 1 enzymes involved in the final release of the free amino acids, which are essential to protein synthesis.","dc:creator":"Perrier J","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Catabolism of intracellular N-terminal acetylated proteins: involvement of acylpeptide hydrolase and acylase."},"rdfs:label":"ACY1 Function in Degredation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Aminoacylase 1 is responsible for a crucial step in the degredation of aceylated amino acids.

Deficiency of aminoacylase 1 due to mutations in the aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) gene follows an autosomal-recessive trait of inheritance and is characterized by accumulation of N-acetyl amino acids in the urine. In affected individuals neurological findings such as febrile seizures, delay of psychomotor development and moderate mental retardation have been reported. Except for one missense mutation which has been studied in Escherichia coli, mutations underlying aminoacylase 1 deficiency have not been characterized so far. This has prompted us to approach expression studies of all mutations known to occur in aminoacylase 1 deficient individuals in a human cell line (HEK293), thus providing the authentic human machinery for posttranslational modifications. Mutations were inserted using site directed mutagenesis and aminoacylase 1 enzyme activity was assessed in cells overexpressing aminoacylase 1, using mainly the natural high affinity substrate N-acetyl methionine. Overexpression of the wild type enzyme in HEK293 cells resulted in an approximately 50-fold increase of the aminoacylase 1 activity of homogenized cells. Most mutations resulted in a nearly complete loss of enzyme function. Notably, the two newly discovered mutations p.Arg378Trp, p.Arg378Gln and the mutation p.Arg393His yielded considerable residual activity of the enzyme, which is tentatively explained by their intramolecular localization and molecular characteristics. In contrast to aminoacylase 1 variants which showed no detectable aminoacylase 1 activity, aminoacylase 1 proteins with the mutations p.Arg378Trp, p.Arg378Gln and p.Arg393His were also detected in Western blot analysis.

Here, we present four children with genetic deficiency of ACY1. They were identified through organic acid analyses using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealing increased urinary excretion of several N-acetylated amino acids, including the derivatives of methionine, glutamic acid, alanine, leucine, glycine, valine, and isoleucine. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of urine samples detected a distinct pattern of N-acetylated metabolites, consistent with ACY1 dysfunction. Functional analyses of patients' lymphoblasts demonstrated ACY1 deficiency. Mutation analysis uncovered recessive loss-of-function or missense ACY1 mutations in all four individuals affected. We conclude that ACY1 mutations in these children led to functional ACY1 deficiency and excretion of N-acetylated amino acids. Questions remain, however, as to the clinical significance of ACY1 deficiency. The ACY1-deficient individuals were ascertained through urine metabolic screening because of unspecific psychomotor delay (one subject), psychomotor delay with atrophy of the vermis and syringomyelia (one subject), marked muscular hypotonia (one subject), and follow-up for early treated biotinidase deficiency and normal clinical findings (one subject). Because ACY1 is evolutionarily conserved in fish, frog, mouse, and human and is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) in human, a role in CNS function or development is conceivable but has yet to be demonstrated.

Here, we report the case of ACY1 enzyme deficiency in a 6-year-old girl presenting severe intellectual disability, motor retardation, absence of spontaneous locomotor activity and severe speech delay. Urinary excretion of N-acetylated amino acids was present. Mutational analysis of ACY1 gene identified the new homozygous c.1001_1001+5del6 mutation, which alters the mRNA transcription leading to exon 13 skipping and inclusion of a premature stop codon (p.Lys308Glufs*7). A quantitative fluorescent multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (QFM-PCR) assay has been set up and confirmed homozygosity of the mutation in the patient's DNA. Biochemical analysis showed absence of ACY1 enzyme activity in the patient's fibroblasts. The structure of the mutated protein has been defined by homology modeling (HM).

At least 10 unique variants, most of which are missense or null, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 24997716, 24117009, 16465618, 17562838, 21414403, 16274666, 20480396). All of these probands share the common biochemical abnormality of organic aciduria and have confirmatory verification of deficent aminoacylase activity in fibroblasts or lymphocytes. Other phenotypes are observed in individual probands, such as psychomotor delay, hypotonia, and seizures, however the presence of asymptomatic probands indicates these phenotypes may or may not be associated with the biochemical abnormality.\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with significantly reduced or absent aminoacylase activity causing accumulation of acylated amino acids in the tissues and urine. This gene-disease association is also supported by the protein's biological function and functional studies in E. coli, demonstrating that mutant proteins have significantly impacted catalytic activity when compared to the wild-type. No animal models for this abnormality have been published at this time. \nIn summary, ACY1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive aminoacylase 1 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:67196825-d32f-4070-9c15-debaa2287b73"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
