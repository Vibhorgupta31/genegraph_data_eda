Most affected patients have seizures and their cognitive level varies from normal to severely impaired. Mutations in the Filamin-A (or FLNA) gene are the main cause of PH, but the underlying pathological mechanism remains unknown. Although two FlnA knockout mouse strains have been generated, none of them showed the presence of ectopic nodules. To recapitulate the loss of FlnA function in the developing rat brain, we used an in utero RNA interference-mediated knockdown approach and successfully reproduced a PH phenotype in rats comparable with that observed in human patients. In FlnA-knockdown rats, we report that PH results from a disruption of the polarized radial glial scaffold in the ventricular zone altering progression of neural progenitors through the cell cycle and impairing migration of neurons into the cortical plate. Similar alterations of radial glia are observed in human PH brains of a 35-week fetus and a 3-month-old child, harboring distinct FLNA mutations not previously reported. Finally, juvenile FlnA-knockdown rats are highly susceptible to seizures, confirming the reliability of this novel animal model of PH.

Human mutations in the Filamin A (FLNA) and ADP-ribosylation factor guanine exchange factor 2 [ARFGEF2; encoding brefeldin-A-inhibited guanine exchange factor-2 (BIG2)] genes give rise to this disorder. Previously, we have reported that Big2 inhibition impairs neuronal migration and binds to FlnA, and its loss promotes FlnA phosphorylation. FlnA phosphorylation dictates FlnA-actin binding affinity and consequently alters focal adhesion size and number to effect neuronal migration. Here we show that FlnA loss similarly impairs migration, reciprocally enhances Big2 expression, but also alters Big2 subcellular localization in both null and conditional FlnA mice. FlnA phosphorylation promotes relocalization of Big2 from the Golgi toward the lipid ruffles, thereby activating Big2-dependent Arf1 at the cell membrane. Loss of FlnA phosphorylation or Big2 function impairs Arf1-dependent vesicle trafficking at the periphery, and Arf1 is required for maintenance of cell-cell junction connectivity and focal adhesion assembly. Loss of Arf1 activity disrupts neuronal migration and cell adhesion. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a potential mechanism whereby coordinated interactions between actin (through FlnA) and vesicle trafficking (through Big2-Arf) direct the assembly and disassembly of membrane protein complexes required for neuronal migration and neuroependymal integrity.

Human Filamin A gene (FLNA) mutations are associated with classical X-linked bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), featuring contiguous heterotopic nodules, mega cisterna magna, cardiovascular malformations and epilepsy. FLNA encodes an F-actin-binding cytoplasmic phosphoprotein and is involved in early brain neurogenesis and neuronal migration. A rare, recessive form of bilateral PNH with microcephaly and severe delay is associated with mutations of the ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide-exchange factor-2 (ARFGEF2) gene, required for vesicle and membrane trafficking from the trans-Golgi. However, PH is a heterogeneous disorder. We studied clinical and brain MRI of 182 patients with PH and, based on its anatomic distribution and associated birth defects, identified 15 subtypes. Classical bilateral PNH represented the largest group (98 patients: 54%). The 14 additional phenotypes (84 patients: 46%) included PNH with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), temporo-occipital PNH with hippocampal malformation and cerebellar hypoplasia, PNH with fronto-perisylvian or temporo-occipital polymicrogyria, posterior PNH with hydrocephalus, PNH with microcephaly, PNH with frontonasal dysplasia, PNH with limb abnormalities, PNH with fragile-X syndrome, PNH with ambiguous genitalia, micronodular PH, unilateral PNH, laminar ribbon-like and linear PH. We performed mutation analysis of FLNA in 120 patients, of whom 72 (60%) had classical bilateral PNH and 48 (40%) other PH phenotypes, and identified 25 mutations in 40 individuals. Sixteen mutations had not been reported previously. Mutations were found in 35 patients with classical bilateral PNH, in three with PNH with EDS and in two with unilateral PNH. Twenty one mutations were nonsense and frame-shift and four missense. The high prevalence of mutations causing protein truncations confirms that loss of function is the major cause of the disorder. FLNA mutations were found in 100% of familial cases with X-linked PNH (10 families: 8 with classical bilateral PNH, 1 with EDS and 1 with unilateral PH) and in 26% of sporadic patients with classical bilateral PNH. Overall, mutations occurred in 49% of individuals with classical bilateral PNH irrespective of their being familial or sporadic. However, the chances of finding a mutation were exceedingly gender biased with 93% of mutations occurring in females and 7% in males. The probability of finding FLNA mutations in other phenotypes was 4% but was limited to the minor variants of PNH with EDS and unilateral PNH. Statistical analysis considering all 42 mutations described so far identifies a hotspot region for PNH in the actin-binding domain (P < 0.05).","dc:creator":"Parrini E","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Periventricular heterotopia: phenotypic heterogeneity and correlation with Filamin A mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16684786","rdfs:label":"15"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The variant was identified by single candidate gene sequencing."},{"id":"cggv:60e2e1ea-2424-4c0c-bcbb-376c9209657b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3304e20f-d2a3-49be-b122-f044c13cbfac","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":29,"firstTestingMethod":"Denaturing gradient gel","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0200067","obo:HP_0007165","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0002795"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:60e2e1ea-2424-4c0c-bcbb-376c9209657b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:50a418cc-009a-4e36-bfd3-4ba8021f49b7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001110556.2(FLNA):c.1828+2T>G (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA415242176"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19917821","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (BPNH) is the most common form of periventricular heterotopia.

In addition, X-chromosome inactivation studies in DNA of blood cells revealed a skewed pattern in the proband, and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed a higher expression of the mutated allele in the proband compared to that of the mother.

Vascular dilatation (mainly the aorta), joint hypermobility and variable skin findings are also associated anomalies, with some reports suggesting that this might represents a separate syndrome allelic to XL-PH, termed as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-periventricular heterotopia variant (EDS-PH). Here, we report a cohort of 11 males and females with both hypomorphic and null mutations in FLNA that manifest a wide spectrum of connective tissue and vascular anomalies. The spectrum of cutaneous defects was broader than previously described and is inconsistent with a specific type of EDS. We also extend the range of vascular anomalies associated with XL-PH to included peripheral arterial dilatation and atresia. Based on these observations, we suggest that there is little molecular or clinical justification for considering EDS-PH as a separate entity from XL-PH, but instead propose that there is a spectrum of vascular and connective tissues anomalies associated with this condition for which all individuals with loss-of-function mutations in FLNA should be evaluated.

The majority of the affected individuals are female, while the affected males are typically prenatally or neonatally lethal. Common features include periventricular nodular heterotopia and epilepsy, while additional features such as cardiovascular abnormalities, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability, and developmental delay have also been reported in some patients (Reinstein et al., PMID: 23032111; Parrini et al., PMID: 16684786; Tsuneda et al., PMID: 18427995).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. FLNA variants leading to periventricular nodular heterotopia have been reported in more than one hundred probands in the literature (PMID: 16684786, 18427995, 19917821, 23032111, 24089482, 26471271, and 29449050). Additionally, evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes animal models and in vitro rescue experiments (PMID: 16825286, 17172441, 22076441, and 24089482). Defects in the FLNA gene may also result in FG syndrome 2, X-linked cardiac valvular dysplasia, congenital short bowel syndrome, and neuronal intestinal pseudoobstruction, which all share overlapping phenotypes with some patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia (OMIM *300017). Of note, while loss-of-function variants in the FLNA gene lead to periventricular nodular heterotopia, gain-of-function variants cause X-linked otopalatodigital spectrum disorders (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1393/). In summary, FLNA is definitively associated with X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/27/20 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:80bc6280-7c21-4168-8a98-93c31fead5d7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
