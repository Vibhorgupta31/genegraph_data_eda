Dysfunction of the classical pathway leads to impaired adaptive and innate immunity in humans. In contrast the exact role of the alternative NFκB pathway mediated by RelB in humans remains largely elusive. We have recently identified deleterious mutations in RelB in patients with combined immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. We studied here the biological effects of RelB deficiency on the immune system. We show that the thymus in this patient is dysplastic and consequently new thymus emigrants are rare and there is an accumulation of CD45 RO(+) T cells with an increase in CD62L(+) central memory cells. The TCR repertoire of these cells appears skewed with selective clonal expansion. In vitro responses to T cell mitogens were markedly depressed and so were PHA induced IL2 and IFNγ production. In addition, the TH1 promoting T bet and STAT1 were reduced. In contrast, hyper-activation was seen in response to anti-CD3 and CD28. T cell dependent antibody responses were low to absent in all patients. We found that BAFF-R was reduced and CD40 signaling aberrant. Critically, CD27(+) memory cells were absent. We have shown here for the first time the role of RelB on lymphocyte development in humans. In the absence of RelB, B cells development is arrested, resulting in poor production of immunoglobulins and specific antibodies. T cell maturation in the thymus appears altered with reduced output and production of a skewed T cell repertoire with expansion of clones which are likely the cause of the autoimmune features observed in these patients.","dc:creator":"Sharfe N","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"The effects of RelB deficiency on lymphocyte development and function."},"rdfs:label":"Mitogen responsiveness"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:eb3415ab-4fa5-4f53-8ae4-7b4c620a3391_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f143bca1-1e6f-4fec-8ea7-80a4ddd584d8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d6ea8e4-6b7a-4ace-901d-c6e18801f463","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Normal T cell numbers, T cell mitogen response, response to vaccination and production of immunoglobulin following HSCT","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28552761","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Ovadia A","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for RelB deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"HSCT"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This is a HSCT and too broad to show that it is correction of the RelB deficiency that is driving recovery."},{"id":"cggv:13239bd7-86d8-4497-a7d7-e3407b0576fa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:043a86ad-085a-4d22-8bc4-38e5403cb7e2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Thymic architecture is altered in the moues model and in human.

The molecular control of mTEC development remains incompletely understood. We here demonstrate by TEC-specific gene manipulation in mice that the NF-κB transcription factor subunit RelB, which is activated by the alternative NF-κB pathway, regulates development of mature mTECs in a dose-dependent manner. Mice with conditional deletion of Relb lacked mature mTECs and developed spontaneous autoimmunity. In addition, the NF-κB subunits RelA and c-Rel, which are both activated by classical NF-κB signaling, were jointly required for mTEC differentiation by directly regulating the transcription of Relb. Our data reveal a crosstalk mechanism between classical and alternative NF-κB pathways that tightly controls the development of mature mTECs to ensure self-tolerance.","dc:creator":"Riemann M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Central immune tolerance depends on crosstalk between the classical and alternative NF-κB pathways in medullary thymic epithelial cells."},"rdfs:label":"Conditional RelB KO mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:261aa582-d9f2-4467-a525-b77926d7a512","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4147e42b-9fd1-45ce-9bd0-61e42aeeec9f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Human patients also show loss of thymic medulla","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7845467","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dendritic cells (DC) derived from bone marrow are critical in the function of the immune system, for they are the primary antigen-presenting cells in the activation of T-lymphocyte response.

Here we show that relB expression also correlates with differentiation of DC in autoimmune infiltrates in situ, and that a mutation disrupting the relB gene results in mice with impaired antigen-presenting cell function, and a syndrome of excess production of granulocytes and macrophages. Thymic UEA-1+ medullary epithelial cells from normal mice show striking similarities to DC and, interestingly, these cells are also absent in relB mutant mice. Taken together, these results suggest that relB is critical in the coordinated activation of genes necessary for the differentiation of two unrelated but phenotypically similar cells (DC and thymic UEA-1+ medullary epithelial cells) and is therefore a candidate for a gene determining lineage commitment in the immune system.","dc:creator":"Burkly L","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Expression of relB is required for the development of thymic medulla and dendritic cells."},"rdfs:label":"RELB ko mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"A different KO was already scored, wanted to include as historical first identified."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:eb3415ab-4fa5-4f53-8ae4-7b4c620a3391_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb3415ab-4fa5-4f53-8ae4-7b4c620a3391_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:eb3415ab-4fa5-4f53-8ae4-7b4c620a3391_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:a45c9016-fabf-4048-a17e-64e751235306_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a45c9016-fabf-4048-a17e-64e751235306","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:913182d1-a402-47c6-a682-6f2379de5910","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006509.4(RELB):c.1191C>A (p.Tyr397Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406305826"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Linkage analysis","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3fec4fa1-2879-4e9d-bdaa-9a6926b29943_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:913182d1-a402-47c6-a682-6f2379de5910"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26385063"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:3fec4fa1-2879-4e9d-bdaa-9a6926b29943","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3fec4fa1-2879-4e9d-bdaa-9a6926b29943_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3fec4fa1-2879-4e9d-bdaa-9a6926b29943_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Western blot for protein"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"homozygote with consanguinity, reduced to 2 pts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0bfe8370-4334-47a1-a37c-738a5a80e8de_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bfe8370-4334-47a1-a37c-738a5a80e8de","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9b78afbd-4caf-42d7-b3c6-79a64459fd79","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006509.4(RELB):c.401AGC[3] (p.Gln135dup)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/996038"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0032255","obo:HP_0000777","obo:HP_0002090","obo:HP_0011839"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:bea068fd-818c-4b95-bb8f-8f154ae1dee8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9b78afbd-4caf-42d7-b3c6-79a64459fd79"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33791233","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"This study presents a relatively rare case of disseminated ","dc:creator":"Ding X","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Disseminated "}},"rdfs:label":"proband"},{"id":"cggv:bea068fd-818c-4b95-bb8f-8f154ae1dee8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bea068fd-818c-4b95-bb8f-8f154ae1dee8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:bea068fd-818c-4b95-bb8f-8f154ae1dee8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"reduction in protein and mRNA expression in patient.

In this work, three children were identified to have a homozygous RELB nonsense variant through linkage analysis and whole genome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing. The LOF was verified by demonstrating the reductions of RELB RNA and protein levels in the patients with this homozygous variant. This paper is not catalogued in PubMed but can be found at https://doi.org/10.14785/lpsn-2015-0005. Further analysis was performed in a follow up study, but genetic analysis was not performed (PMID: 26385063). The family is scored under this manuscript as the patients’ features and findings are described. Immunological defects of these three patients include dysplastic thymus, abnormal T cell repertoire and dysfunctional T and B cells (PMID: 26385063). A second nonsense variant has been reported (p.R307*), but there is no description of patient’s clinical features (PMID: 33083013). A third variant leading to a frameshift mutation was found in a patient with an oppurtunistic fungal infection and reduced T cell counts (PMID: 33791233). Heterozygous carriers have not been reported in the literature. \n\nRelB is a component of alternative nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) signaling pathway. RelB functions as a heterodimer with p52 NF-kB, which is a production of NIK activated p100 (NF-kB2) processing. RelB:p52 heterodimers are important for lymphoid organogenesis, humoral immunity, DC maturation and thymus development. The RelB protein is expressed in B lymphocytes and is absent in patients with RelB variant associated with CID. In vitro functional data demonstrate alterations in T and B cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production (PMID:26385063). Mouse models of RelB deficiency and conditional RelB knockout systems showed defects in medullary thymic epithelial cells, Foxp3+ regulatory T cell development and were prone to develop autoimmunity, replicating some defects seen in patients with Omenn syndrome or colitis (PMID:28385374, 7845467). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) rescued T and B lymphocyte functions and improved quality life (PMID: 28552761). In summary, RELB has limited association with combined immunodeficiency.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 3/16/2023  (SOP Version 9 ).\n\nThere is only limited gene-disease relationship and evaluation of affected patients. Therefore we decided to reduce the classification to limited at this time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:eb3415ab-4fa5-4f53-8ae4-7b4c620a3391"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
