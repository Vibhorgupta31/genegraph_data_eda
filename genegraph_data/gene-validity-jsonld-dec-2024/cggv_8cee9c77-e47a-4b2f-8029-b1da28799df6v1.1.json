The *MT-TL2* gene encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) for leucine (CUN). Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V and thus impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities.\n\nThe *MT-TL2* gene has been associated with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). However, after extensive literature review, while the reported cases have brain appearances similar to those observed in LSS, evidence of variant pathogenicity was insufficient. Additionally, there is no experimental evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. \n\nIn summary, there is no evidence for a causal role for *MT-TL2* variants in maternally-inherited LSS. This gene-disease association is not supported by experimental evidence and no reports have directly implicated the gene in LSS.\n\nThe relationship between MT-TL2 and Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 14, 2021.
