Using the positional candidate approach, we have identified a C-->T substitution in a novel gene, Rd3, that encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein of 195 amino acids. The rd3 mutation results in a predicted stop codon after residue 106. This change is observed in four rd3 lines derived from the original collected mice but not in the nine wild-type mouse strains that were examined. Rd3 is preferentially expressed in the retina and exhibits increasing expression through early postnatal development. In transiently transfected COS-1 cells, the RD3-fusion protein shows subnuclear localization adjacent to promyelocytic leukemia-gene-product bodies. The truncated mutant RD3 protein is detectable in COS-1 cells but appears to get degraded rapidly. To explore potential association of the human RD3 gene at chromosome 1q32 with retinopathies, we performed a mutation screen of 881 probands from North America, India, and Europe. In addition to several alterations of uncertain significance, we identified a homozygous alteration in the invariant G nucleotide of the RD3 exon 2 donor splice site in two siblings with Leber congenital amaurosis. This mutation is predicted to result in premature truncation of the RD3 protein, segregates with the disease, and is not detected in 121 ethnically matched control individuals. We suggest that the retinopathy-associated RD3 protein is part of subnuclear protein complexes involved in diverse processes, such as transcription and splicing.","dc:creator":"Friedman JS","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Premature truncation of a novel protein, RD3, exhibiting subnuclear localization is associated with retinal degeneration."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5590322-fd83-40a0-af90-57bb06cb2cfc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5590322-fd83-40a0-af90-57bb06cb2cfc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":22,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3c0de86e-fd51-473b-bcbf-d4ff4fb594cf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001164688.2(RD3):c.180C>A (p.Tyr60Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA274682"}},"detectionMethod":"Linkage studies were initiated submitting the core family of four affected siblings, the unaffected brother and the parents, to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-genotyping using a microarray (Affymetrix Mapping 50k Xba 240; Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK).

It is occasionally the presenting symptom of multisystemic ciliopathies which diagnosis will require a specific care of patients. Nineteen LCA genes are currently identified and three of them account for both non-syndromic and syndromic forms of the disease. RD3 (LCA12) was implicated as a LCA gene based on the identification of homozygous truncating mutations in two LCA families despite the screening of large cohorts of patients. Here we provide a comprehensive survey of RD3 mutations and of their clinical expression through the screening of a cohort of 852 patients originating worldwide affected with LCA or early-onset and severe RD. We identified three RD3 mutations in seven unrelated consanguineous LCA families - i.e., a 2 bp deletion and two nonsense mutations - predicted to cause complete loss of function. Five families originating from the Southern Shores of the Mediterranean segregated a similar mutation (c.112C>T, p.R38*) suggesting that this change may have resulted from an ancient founder effect. Considering the low frequency of RD3 carriers, the recurrence risk for LCA in non-consanguineous unions is negligible for both heterozygote and homozygote RD3 individuals. The LCA12 phenotype in our patients is highly similar to those of patients with mutant photoreceptor-specific guanylate cyclase (GUCY2D/LCA1). This observation is consistent with the report of the role of RD3 in trafficking of GUCYs and gives further support to a common mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration in LCA12 and LCA1, i.e., inability to increase cytoplasmic cGMP concentration in outer segments and thus to recover the dark-state. Similar to LCA1, LCA12 patients have no extraocular symptoms despite complete inactivation of both RD3 alleles, supporting the view that extraocular investigations in LCA infants with RD3 mutations should be avoided.","dc:creator":"Perrault I","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Union makes strength: a worldwide collaborative genetic and clinical study to provide a comprehensive survey of RD3 mutations and delineate the associated phenotype."}},"rdfs:label":"NEM 5/II1F"},{"id":"cggv:d388f754-a30f-4fac-9787-07f725b58d83","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d388f754-a30f-4fac-9787-07f725b58d83_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:749d4269-b892-4a1a-8104-43d567d3ac9b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:749d4269-b892-4a1a-8104-43d567d3ac9b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:cefb8752-51a5-4068-90c9-2da612a60fd2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001164688.2(RD3):c.136G>T (p.Glu46Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA274687"}},"detectionMethod":"Patients of all cohorts were screened by direct sequencing using intronic primers designed to amplify the two RD3 coding exons and intron-exon boundaries.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008002","obo:HP_0032123","obo:HP_0000608","obo:HP_0006934","obo:HP_0007686"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:e8eb8570-2cd5-467e-ba32-67c0dc39230a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cefb8752-51a5-4068-90c9-2da612a60fd2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23308101"},"rdfs:label":"FJC/F/4"},{"id":"cggv:e8eb8570-2cd5-467e-ba32-67c0dc39230a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8eb8570-2cd5-467e-ba32-67c0dc39230a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:06ea31ca-f642-44dd-ad5d-3b4c9c4173d7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06ea31ca-f642-44dd-ad5d-3b4c9c4173d7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a6d1dcc9-a5c5-4661-8129-f239e0aba0ab","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001164688.2(RD3):c.112C>T (p.Arg38Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA274684"}},"detectionMethod":"Haplotype analysis was performed using 4/5 families segregating the c.112C>T mutation of the RD3 gene.

Mutations in the gene encoding RD3 resulting in unstable non-functional C-terminal truncated proteins are responsible for early onset photoreceptor degeneration in Leber congenital amaurosis 12 (MIM#610612). Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest and most severe form of all inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) and the most frequent cause of inherited blindness in children.\nLeber congenital amaurosis-12 (LCA12) is an autosomal recessive form of Inherited retinal disease (IRD) and is characterized by congenital nystagmus, low vision, sluggish pupillary reflexes, absence of ocular pursuit from birth (Perrault et al., 2013)\n*RD3* is located at 1q32.3 and consists of 3 exons encoding a basic protein of 195 amino acids that is preferentially expressed in the retina (Aravindan S et al. 2017). It exhibits increasing expression throughout mouse early postnatal development. It is highly expressed in cone and rod outer segments, and colocalizes with GC1 and GC2. In cones, RD3 protein binds the C-terminus of GC1 and mediates its export from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomal vesicles. GC1 and GC2 loss iis observed n photoreceptor cells of *rd3* mice expressing a truncated unstable rd3 protein. RD3 protein promotes accumulation of retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in the photoreceptor outer segment and suppresses RetGC activation by guanylyl cyclase–activating proteins (GCAPs). Truncating variants in RD3 cause severe retinal disease by preventing the inhibitory interaction of RD3 with the guanylyl cyclase (Chang B et al. 1993; Friedman JS et al., 2006; Zulliger R. et al., 2016; Peshenko IV et al. 2019). RD3 also negatively regulaes RetGC by binding it and blocking activation by GCAPs. This ability of RD3 to bind and suppress RetGC is likely critical for photoreceptor survival (Peshenko IV et al. 2019).\n\nA total of 9 variants have already been identified underlying Leber congenital amaurosis 12. The mutation spectrum in *RD3* includes 4 nonsense, 3 frameshifts and 2 splice junction losses (PMID: 17186464, 22531706, 23308101).\n\nIn this curation, data from 3 consanguineous families and 2 isolated individuals with 5 unique variants), were collected from 3 publications (Friedman JS, et al., 2006, PMID: 17186464, Preising MN, et al., 2012, PMID: 22531706, Perrault I, et al., 2013, PMID: 23308101).\n\nExperimental evidence for expression, biochemical function and animal model systems were calculated as well (Aravindan S, et al., 2017, PMID: 29030614, Peshenko IV, et al., 2019, PMID: 30559291, Friedman JS, et al., 2006, PMID: 17186464).\n\nIn summary, *RD3* is definitively associated with RD3-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 4th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
