Fgfr2b, expressed in epithelia, is required for limb outgrowth and branching morphogenesis, whereas the mesenchymal Fgfr2c variant is required by the osteocyte lineage for normal skeletogenesis. Gain-of-function mutations in human FGFR2c are associated with craniosynostosis syndromes. To confirm and extend this evidence, we introduced a Cys342Tyr replacement into Fgfr2c to create a gain-of-function mutation equivalent to a mutation in human Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes. Fgfr2c(C342Y/)(+) heterozygote mice are viable and fertile with shortened face, protruding eyes, premature fusion of cranial sutures, and enhanced Spp1 expression in the calvaria. Homozygous mutants display multiple joint fusions, cleft palate, and trachea and lung defects, and die shortly after birth. They show enhanced Cbfa1/Runx2 expression without significant change in chondrocyte-specific Ihh, PTHrP, Sox9, Col2a, or Col10a gene expression. Histomorphometric analysis and bone marrow stromal cell culture showed a significant increase of osteoblast progenitors with no change in osteoclastogenic cells. Chondrocyte proliferation was decreased in the skull base at embryonic day 14.5 but not later. These results suggest that long-term aspects of the mutant phenotype, including craniosynostosis, are related to the Fgfr2c regulation of the osteoblast lineage. The effect on early chondrocyte proliferation but not gene expression suggests cooperation of Fgfr2c with Fgfr3 in the formation of the cartilage model for endochondral bone.","dc:creator":"Eswarakumar VP","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A gain-of-function mutation of Fgfr2c demonstrates the roles of this receptor variant in osteogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Eswarakumar Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Additional study (Motch Perrine et al. 2019; PMID: 31064775) used to upgrade score of this original model.

At least 12 variants (missense and splice) have been reported in 24 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 7719333, 7719345, 8841188, 9150725, 9475591, 9475590, 10712195, 15996217, 34182859, 15305355). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including two studies of one mouse model (PMIDs: 15316116, 31064775). In summary, FGFR2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Pfeiffer Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/16/2021. \nGene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) â€“ Version 8.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:eccfe56b-15d7-4ba9-abf2-163dfd3dab3c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
