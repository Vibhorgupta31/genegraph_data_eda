Both SMAD1 and ERK signalings were significantly activated in CFC-iPSCs during EB formation. Most of the β-catenin was dissociated from the membrane and preferentially localized into the nucleus in CFC-EBs. Furthermore, activation of SMAD1 signaling recapitulated early developmental defects in wild-type iPSCs.

Germline mutations in BRAF have been identified in 50-75% of patients with cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, which is characterized by congenital heart defects, distinctive facial features, short stature and ectodermal abnormalities. We recently demonstrated that mice expressing a Braf Q241R mutation, which corresponds to the most frequent BRAF mutation (Q257R) in CFC syndrome, on a C57BL/6J background are embryonic/neonatal lethal, with multiple congenital defects, preventing us from analyzing the phenotypic consequences after birth. Here, to further explore the pathogenesis of CFC syndrome, we backcrossed these mice onto a BALB/c or ICR/CD-1 genetic background. On a mixed (BALB/c and C57BL/6J) background, all heterozygous Braf(Q241R/+) mice died between birth and 24 weeks and exhibited growth retardation, sparse and ruffled fur, liver necrosis and atrial septal defects (ASDs). In contrast, 31% of the heterozygous Braf(Q241R/+) ICR mice survived over 74 weeks. The surviving Braf(Q241R/+) ICR mice exhibited growth retardation, sparse and ruffled fur, a hunched appearance, craniofacial dysmorphism, long and/or dystrophic nails, extra digits and ovarian cysts. The Braf(Q241R/+) ICR mice also showed learning deficits in the contextual fear-conditioning test. Echocardiography indicated the presence of pulmonary stenosis and ASDs in the Braf(Q241R/+) ICR mice, which were confirmed by histological analysis.

Children born with germ-line mutations in BRAF, MEK1 or MEK2 develop cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, skin and hair abnormalities and mental retardation. CFC syndrome mutations in BRAF promote both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired variants. CFC syndrome has a progressive phenotype, and the availability of clinically active inhibitors of the MAPK pathway prompts the important question as to whether such inhibitors might be therapeutically effective in the treatment of CFC syndrome. To study the developmental effects of CFC mutant alleles in vivo, we have expressed a panel of 28 BRAF and MEK alleles in zebrafish embryos to assess the function of human disease alleles and available chemical inhibitors of this pathway. We find that both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired CFC mutant alleles promote the equivalent developmental outcome when expressed during early development and that treatment of CFC-zebrafish embryos with inhibitors of the FGF-MAPK pathway can restore normal early development. Importantly, we find a developmental window in which treatment with a MEK inhibitor can restore the normal early development of the embryo, without the additional, unwanted developmental effects of the drug.","dc:creator":"Anastasaki C","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Kinase-activating and kinase-impaired cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome alleles have activity during zebrafish development and are sensitive to small molecule inhibitors."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish knock in for 9 different variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"These changes do not implicate CFC explicitly"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2149,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:adb0fca7-8b44-4e50-9c59-361d32bae1d5","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015280","gene":"hgnc:1097","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"There is a definitive association between alteration of the BRAF gene and cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome. The maximum amount of scorable genetic evidence has been published showing de novo as well as non-de novo variants occur in BRAF in patients with CFC syndrome (Gripp et al., 2007; Louati et al., 2014; Makita et al., 2007; Mucciolo, Dello Russo, D'Emidio, Mesoraca, & Giorlandino, 2016; Narumi et al., 2007; Niihori et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Viciana, Tetsu, et al., 2006). The BRAF gene is located in the Ras/MAPK pathway which is associated with the Noonan phenotype and variants found in CFC patients in this gene disrupt the RAS pathway function as demonstrated by both mouse and zebrafish models (Anastasaki, Estep, Marais, Rauen, & Patton, 2009; Aoki et al., 2016; Moriya et al., 2015; Rauen, 2013). Of note, BRAF has also been classified as moderate in association with Noonan syndrome (NS), limited in association with NS with multiple lentigines, and disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating BRAF with NS with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a53e5a92-126f-4b00-a89b-af55d4f342ca"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
