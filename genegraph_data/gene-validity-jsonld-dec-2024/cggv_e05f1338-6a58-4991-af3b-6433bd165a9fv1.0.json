Two enzymes, ADA1 and ADA2, are known to possess ADA activity in humans. Although the structure of ADA1 and its role in lymphocytic activation have been known for a long time, the structure and function of ADA2, a member of ADGF, remain enigmatic. Here, we found that ADA2 is secreted by monocytes undergoing differentiation into macrophages or DCs and that it binds to the cell surface via proteoglycans and ADRs. We demonstrate that ADA1 and ADA2 increase the rate of proliferation of monocyte-activated CD4+ T cells independently of their catalytic activity. We also show that ADA2 induces T cell-dependent differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and stimulates macrophage proliferation. Our discovery of the growth factor-like activity of ADA2 explains clinical observations and suggests that this enzyme could be used as a drug candidate to modulate the immune responses during inflammation and cancer.","dc:creator":"Zavialov AV","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Human adenosine deaminase 2 induces differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and stimulates proliferation of T helper cells and macrophages."},"rdfs:label":"ADA2 expression in human cell lines"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Human myeloid lineage cells found to secrete ADA2 as measured by ADA2 activity"},{"id":"cggv:3bc545c8-6719-4547-85a4-276f5aa68252","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d99aa7d8-5e0b-4486-b7ff-2f5c04e90e8f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"HPA database information shows that ADA2 expression is enriched in the spleen, monocytes, and dendritic cells; immune cells have been shown to be affected in patients with ADA2 deficiency.

Adenosine deaminases ADA1 and ADA2 (ADAs) decrease the level of adenosine by converting it to inosine, which serves as a negative feedback mechanism. Mutations in the genes encoding ADAs lead to impaired immune function, which suggests a crucial role for ADAs in immune system regulation. It is not clear why humans and other mammals possess two enzymes with adenosine deaminase activity. Here, we found that ADA2 binds to neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells and B cells that do not express CD26, a receptor for ADA1. Moreover, the analysis of CD4+ T-cell subset revealed that ADA2 specifically binds to regulatory T cells expressing CD39 and lacking the receptor for ADA1. Also, it was found that ADA1 binds to CD16- monocytes, while CD16+ monocytes preferably bind ADA2. A study of the blood samples from ADA2-deficient patients showed a dramatic reduction in the number of lymphocyte subsets and an increased concentration of TNF-α in plasma. Our results suggest the existence of a new mechanism, where the activation and survival of immune cells is regulated through the activities of ADA2 or ADA1 anchored to the cell surface.","dc:creator":"Kaljas Y","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Human adenosine deaminases ADA1 and ADA2 bind to different subsets of immune cells."},"rdfs:label":"ADA2 binds to immune cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:e05f1338-6a58-4991-af3b-6433bd165a9f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b236170c-cd22-4268-9839-6f7170a2701f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b22c9e5-7e14-46bf-b6eb-0bba01a3e974","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"B cells from multiple patients with DADA2 and healthy controls were stimulated with CpG and CD40L and then proliferation was measured based on CFSE staining.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there is insufficient evidence of a difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern despite genotype:phenotype correlations that may explain the wide phenotypic spectrum observed from *ADA2* (PMID: 30406060, 31945408, 35095905, 37256629). Therefore, these entities were curated together under the umbrella term “deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2.” DADA2 is a heterogenous disease with variable expressivity that has different clinical manifestations including vasculitis, immune system dysregulation, and hematopoietic system impairment. Clinical features range from livedo racemosa, early-onset stroke, peripheral neuropathy, systemic vasculitis, musculoskeletal issues, and immune features such as systemic inflammation, severe bone marrow failure (severe B cell deficiency and pure red cell aplasia are among the most notable features), and immunodeficiency (PMID: 30406060, 31945408, 35095905, 35898506, 37179309, 37256629). DADA2 displays inter- and intrafamilial variability and penetrance is incomplete as asymptomatic individuals with biallelic *ADA2* variants have been reported (PMID: 26867732, 27059682, 31945408). ADA2 activity is much lower in individuals with biallelic pathogenic *ADA2* variants than in carriers and healthy controls (PMID: 32001434, 32054602, 32650798, 37256629). Notably, carriers of *ADA2* disease-causing variants have decreased ADA2 expression compared to healthy controls and there have been rare reports of carriers presenting with clinical features of DADA2 (PMID: 24552284, 29681619). \n\nEleven variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, deletion) that have been reported in 8 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 24552284, 24737293, 28665179, 35774100, 35852217) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including an animal model, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays in both cell lines and patient-derived cells (PMIDs: 20453107, 24552284, 27663683, 32707604, 34004258, 35529868, 35663977). For example, ADA2 knockdown in a Zebrafish model resulted in increased bleeding and ischemia in the brain and neutropenia (PMID: 24552284). In an in vitro cell culture model, incubation of either a monocyte cell line lacking ADA2 expression or DADA2 patient-derived monocytes with an endothelial cell line resulted in damage to the endothelial cell layer (PMID: 24552284). DADA2 patient-derived B cells display decreased proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion following stimulation (PMID: 32707604). In a series of rescue experiments, transduction of DADA2 patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells or macrophages with a lentivirus carrying human ADA2 rescued features of disease, including decreased stem cell proliferation and stem cell and macrophage pro-inflammatory responses (PMID: 35529868). Hematopoietic cell transplantation has been demonstrated to rescue ADA2 activity and ameliorate hematological and immunological features with no new vascular events in DADA2 patients, particularly those presenting with bone marrow failure, immune cytopenia, malignancy, or immunodeficiency (PMID: 34324127, 35095905, 37256629).\n\nIn summary, *ADA2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e05f1338-6a58-4991-af3b-6433bd165a9f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
