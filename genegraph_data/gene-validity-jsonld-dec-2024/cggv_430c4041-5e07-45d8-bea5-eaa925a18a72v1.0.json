Primary MHC class II deficiency is a genetically heterogeneous disease of gene regulation that offers the unique opportunity of a genetic approach for the identification of the functionally relevant regulatory genes and factors. Most patients exhibit a characteristic defect in the binding of a nuclear complex, RFX, to the X box motif of MHC class II promoters. Genetic complementation of a B-lymphocyte cell line from such a patient with a cDNA expression library has allowed us to isolate RFX5, the regulatory gene responsible for the MHC class II deficiency. This gene encodes a novel DNA-binding protein that is indeed a subunit of the RFX complex. Mutations in the RFX5 gene have been characterized in two patients. Transfection of the patient's cells with the RFX5 cDNA repairs the binding defect and fully restores expression of all the endogenous MHC class II genes in vivo.","dc:creator":"Steimle V","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"A novel DNA-binding regulatory factor is mutated in primary MHC class II deficiency (bare lymphocyte syndrome)."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:430c4041-5e07-45d8-bea5-eaa925a18a72_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:430c4041-5e07-45d8-bea5-eaa925a18a72_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:7d5f7277-73fd-46cf-830c-26348015ffea_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7d5f7277-73fd-46cf-830c-26348015ffea","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:62a5060a-3a18-45cc-ab56-283b81db65f6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001025603.2(RFX5):c.715C>T (p.Arg239Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341937049"}},"detectionMethod":"WES and direct sequencing of RFX5","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"CD3+ T cells 0.24x10^3, CD4/CD8 0.35, HLA-DR expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes was undetectable.

Nevertheless, it was believed that some affected infants with residual T cell, such as patients with MHC II deficiency, will be misdiagnosed by this assay. A full immune workup and genetic analysis using direct Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing have been performed to a patient that was identified by the Israeli NBS program for SCID. The patient was found to have severe CD4 lymphopenia with an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio, low TREC levels in peripheral blood, abnormal response to mitogen stimulation, and a skewed T cell receptor repertoire. HLA-DR expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes was undetectable suggesting a diagnosis of MHC II deficiency. Direct sequencing of the RFX5 gene revealed a stop codon change (p. R239X, c. C715T), which could cause the patient's immune phenotype. His parents were found to be heterozygote carriers for the mutation. Whole exome sequencing could not identify other potential mutations to explain his immunodeficiency. The patient underwent successful conditioned hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from healthy matched unrelated donor and is currently well and alive with full chimerism. Infants with MHC class II deficiency can potentially be identified by the TREC-based assay NBS for SCID. Therefore, MHC II molecules (e.g., HLA-DR) measurement should be part of the confirmatory immune-phenotyping for patients with positive screening results. This will make the diagnosis of such patients straightforward.","dc:creator":"Marcus N","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"MHC II deficient infant identified by newborn screening program for SCID."}},"rdfs:label":"Israeli Patient"},{"id":"cggv:bcbb1346-78d2-44ba-a84f-0cad6da99ea8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bcbb1346-78d2-44ba-a84f-0cad6da99ea8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"This nonsense variant occurs in exon 9 or 11 and is expected to result in NMD, it is homozygous due to consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:02aa8f4d-ada2-43f6-8a6f-d2a7254bbbb7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02aa8f4d-ada2-43f6-8a6f-d2a7254bbbb7","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3caa58c0-bf34-473a-aa76-03313900c2e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001025603.2(RFX5):c.116+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA29560961"}},"detectionMethod":"Full-length cDNA clones were sequenced and the affected region was PCR amplified from genomic DNA and Sanger sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:9daeb079-370b-46fd-a973-3a791dd76205_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3caa58c0-bf34-473a-aa76-03313900c2e6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9401005","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"MHC class II deficiency is a severe primary immunodeficiency characterised by the absence of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) gene expression.

MHC class II molecules are essential for the presentation of exogenous peptides to CD4+ helper T cells and thus in the adaptive immune response. Mutations in four trans-acting genes *CIITA,* *RFXANK,* *RFX5,* and *RFXAP* are responsible for the primary immunodeficiency. Pathogenic variants in RFX5 are associated with BLS complementation group C.Affected individuals typically present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections, failure to thrive, low levels of CD4+ T cells, and undetectable undetectable MHC class II (e.g., HLA DR) expression on monocytes and B cells. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be bialleleic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers of *RFX5* loss of function variants are not reported to be clinically affected. \nThe *RFX5* curation includes 8 variants (frameshift, nonsense, missense, and splice site) reported in 8 probands from 6 publications (PMIDs: 7744245, 9401005, 10079298, 12368908, 30084052, 29527204). Additional evidence is available however the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached. This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence including its biochemical function, as part of the RFX complex, of binding DNA in a X1-box-spiceifc manner to allow for transcriptional activation of MHC class II molecules (PMID: 10938133). The MHC class II deficiency can be rescued in patient cells by expression of wildtype *RFX5* (PMID: 7744245 ). Furthermore, it interacts with the transactivator *CIITA,* which is also implicated in MHC class II deficiency (PMID: 10938133). Additionally, RFX5−/− mice exhibit an immune deficiency that is very similar to that of MHC-II–deficient patients (PMID: 9491996).  In summary, *RFX5* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MHC class II deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:430c4041-5e07-45d8-bea5-eaa925a18a72"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
