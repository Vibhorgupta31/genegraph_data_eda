Chicken POP3 and mouse Pop1 are first preferentially expressed in atrium and later also in the subepicardial compact layer of the ventricles. Chicken POP1 and mouse Pop2 are expressed in the entire heart except the outflow tract. All three Pop genes are expressed in heart and skeletal muscle of the adult mouse and lower in lung. Pop1 and Pop2 expression is upregulated in uterus of pregnant mice. Like the mouse genes, human POP genes are predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle.

Autosomal recessive LGMD (MONDO:0015152) is characterized by adult-onset weakness primarily affecting the proximal muscles of the lower limbs.\nSummary of Genetic Evidence (6.8 points): Three unique missense variants from this initial publication have been reported in humans and segregate with the disease in two additional family members (PMID:31610034). One unique missense variant (PMID:35075722), and two unique variants considered LOF (PMID:35842834, PMID:37104941), have also been reported. \n \nSummary of Experimental Evidence (1 point): The mechanism for disease is hypothesized to be biallelic loss-of-function, with mutant protein unable to regulate TREK-1 and potentially causing altered skeletal muscle development. However, without further functional studies and potential models, the exact pathogenic mechanisms or other affected pathways are not yet known. This gene-disease association is supported by limited experimental evidence. *POPDC3* is uniquely expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, providing evidence towards an association with this muscle-affecting disorder. A Zebrafish knock-out mutant model demonstrated ventral tail curvature and dystrophic changes in myofibers, indicating a function related to muscle tissue, however the limited similarity between this model and human probands as well as the question regarding the type of pathogenic mechanism limits the reliability.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence (7.8 points) to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bb7755df-a1e3-4398-a771-cd6c2d112b68"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
