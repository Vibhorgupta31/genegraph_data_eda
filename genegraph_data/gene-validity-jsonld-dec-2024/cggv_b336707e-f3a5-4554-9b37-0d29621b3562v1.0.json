Together with previously reported cases, patients with DYRK1A mutations share many clinical features and may have a recognizable phenotype that includes, by decreasing order of frequency: developmental delay or ID with behaviors suggesting autism spectrum disorder, microcephaly, epileptic seizures, facial dysmorphism including ear anomalies (large ears, hypoplastic lobes), thin lips, short philtrum and frontal bossing.

DYRK1A has a critical role in brain growth and development primarily by regulating cell proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal plasticity and survival. Several patients have been reported with chromosome 21 aberrations such as partial monosomy, involving multiple genes including DYRK1A. In addition, seven other individuals have been described with chromosomal rearrangements, intragenic deletions or truncating mutations that disrupt specifically DYRK1A. Most of these patients have microcephaly and all have significant intellectual disability. In the present study, we report 10 unrelated individuals with DYRK1A-associated intellectual disability (ID) who display a recurrent pattern of clinical manifestations including primary or acquired microcephaly, ID ranging from mild to severe, speech delay or absence, seizures, autism, motor delay, deep-set eyes, poor feeding and poor weight gain. We identified unique truncating and non-synonymous mutations (three nonsense, four frameshift and two missense) in DYRK1A in nine patients and a large chromosomal deletion that encompassed DYRK1A in one patient. On the basis of increasing identification of mutations in DYRK1A, we suggest that this gene be considered potentially causative in patients presenting with ID, primary or acquired microcephaly, feeding problems and absent or delayed speech with or without seizures.

MNB/DYRK1A is one of the genes on human chromosome 21 that has raised most interest, due to its relationship with the brain functions that are altered in DS. Although a number of interesting experimental mouse models for DS are being developed, we still know little about the expression of Mnb/Dyrk1A during mouse brain development. Here, we report that Mnb/Dyrk1A displays a rather dynamic spatio-temporal expression pattern during mouse central nervous system development. Our data indicate that Mnb/Dyrk1A is specifically expressed in four sequential developmental phases: transient expression in preneurogenic progenitors, cell cycle-regulated expression in neurogenic progenitors, transient expression in recently born neurones, and persistent expression in late differentiating neurones. Our results also suggest that the subcellular localization of MNB/DYRK1A, including its translocation to the nucleus, is finely regulated. Thus, the MNB/DYRK1A protein kinase could be a key element in the molecular machinery that couples sequential events in neuronal development. This rich repertoire of potential functions in the developing central nervous system is suitable to be linked to the neurological alterations in DS through the use of mouse experimental models.","dc:creator":"Hämmerle B","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"The spatio-temporal and subcellular expression of the candidate Down syndrome gene Mnb/Dyrk1A in the developing mouse brain suggests distinct sequential roles in neuronal development."},"rdfs:label":"ISH and immunohistochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b336707e-f3a5-4554-9b37-0d29621b3562_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:98203c9a-84d9-4d47-bb28-aeb0fc598652","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fdcf7989-7a21-4c83-b66a-f44a1b2c101e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mutations in genes that associate with ID and ASD have been reported to show defects in dendritic spine growth and radial migration.

These mutant mice present altered proportions of excitatory and inhibitory neocortical neurons and synapses. Moreover, we provide evidence that alterations in the production of cortical excitatory neurons are contributing to these defects. Indeed, by the end of the neurogenic period, the expression of developmental regulated genes involved in neuron differentiation and/or activity is altered.
