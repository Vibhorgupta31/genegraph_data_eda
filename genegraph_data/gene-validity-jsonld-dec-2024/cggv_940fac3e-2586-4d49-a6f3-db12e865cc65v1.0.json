DNA cleavage followed by homology-directed repair (HDR) using an exogenous template has previously been used to correct COL7A1 mutations. HDR rates can be modest, and the double-strand DNA breaks that initiate HDR commonly result in accompanying undesired insertions and deletions (indels). To overcome these limitations, we applied an A•T→G•C adenine base editor (ABE) to correct two different COL7A1 mutations in primary fibroblasts derived from RDEB patients. ABE enabled higher COL7A1 correction efficiencies than previously reported HDR efforts. Moreover, ABE obviated the need for a repair template, and minimal indels or editing at off-target sites was detected. Base editing restored the endogenous type VII collagen expression and function in vitro. We also treated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from RDEB fibroblasts with ABE. The edited iPSCs were differentiated into mesenchymal stromal cells, a cell population with therapeutic potential for RDEB. In a mouse teratoma model, the skin derived from ABE-treated iPSCs showed the proper deposition of C7 at the dermal-epidermal junction in vivo. These demonstrate that base editing provides an efficient and precise genome editing method for autologous cell engineering for RDEB.","dc:creator":"Osborn MJ","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Base Editor Correction of COL7A1 in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Patient-Derived Fibroblasts and iPSCs."},"rdfs:label":"Western blot"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9539e9ec-6d7f-4d8a-971b-ba0edfcd92c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3734ca92-9a0e-496b-8db1-03e03b2a2b06","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Patient carries homozygous variants, NM_000094.4(COL7A1):c.553C>T, showed now COL7A1 expression in patient derived  fibroblast cell culture.

These mice expressed collagen VII at about 10% of normal levels, and their phenotype closely resembled characteristics of severe human DEB, including mucocutaneous blistering, nail dystrophy, and mitten deformities of the extremities. The oral blistering experienced by these mice resulted in growth retardation, and repeated blistering led to excessive induction of tissue repair, causing TGF-beta1-mediated contractile fibrosis generated by myofibroblasts and pseudosyndactyly in the extremities. Intradermal injection of WT fibroblasts resulted in neodeposition of collagen VII and functional restoration of the dermal-epidermal junction. Treated areas were also resistant to induced frictional stress. In contrast, untreated areas of the same mouse showed dermal-epidermal separation following induced stress.

In this study, we have identified COL7A1 mutations in a large multi-ethnic cohort of 152 extended Iranian families with high degree of consanguinity. The patients were diagnosed by clinical manifestations, histopathology, and immunoepitope mapping. Mutation detection consisted of a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism-based whole-genome homozygosity mapping, Sanger sequencing, and gene-targeted next-generation sequencing. A total of 104 distinct mutations in COL7A1 were identified in 149 of 152 families (98%), 56 (53%) of them being previously unreported. Ninety percent of these mutations were homozygous recessive, reflecting consanguinity in these families. Three recurrent mutations were identified in five or more families, and haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect in two of them. In conclusion, COL7A1 harbored mutations in the overwhelming majority of patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, and most of them in this Iranian cohort were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The mutation profile attests to the impact of consanguinity in these families.","dc:creator":"Vahidnezhad H","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa: COL7A1 Mutation Landscape in a Multi-Ethnic Cohort of 152 Extended Families with High Degree of Customary Consanguineous Marriages."}},"rdfs:label":"11-1"},{"id":"cggv:96bb4b77-0d32-4af8-abd4-00649cbf20f5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96bb4b77-0d32-4af8-abd4-00649cbf20f5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b912584b-8b39-455b-a955-a45102debc53_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b912584b-8b39-455b-a955-a45102debc53","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ffb95af4-7bc3-4d0e-8e22-d009c338c680","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000094.4(COL7A1):c.4128delT","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/663385"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:ff5be9d0-661e-4aca-a716-66d9c4640573_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ffb95af4-7bc3-4d0e-8e22-d009c338c680"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27899325"},"rdfs:label":"54-1"},{"id":"cggv:ff5be9d0-661e-4aca-a716-66d9c4640573","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff5be9d0-661e-4aca-a716-66d9c4640573_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9f3a679a-cacc-41a5-a0b3-26e1a812cd98_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f3a679a-cacc-41a5-a0b3-26e1a812cd98","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:5b5c4ba2-1ef6-4a01-998f-bc54bd6f4e4e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000094.4(COL7A1):c.565C>T (p.Gln189Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/1070885"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0200041","obo:HP_0002860","obo:HP_0008066"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:63741842-4402-47c4-ad21-60456153a14c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5b5c4ba2-1ef6-4a01-998f-bc54bd6f4e4e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27899325"},"rdfs:label":"16-1"},{"id":"cggv:63741842-4402-47c4-ad21-60456153a14c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63741842-4402-47c4-ad21-60456153a14c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d02af25b-e478-4ca1-bc45-dac0197bd7cf_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d02af25b-e478-4ca1-bc45-dac0197bd7cf","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9e2e249b-fc1b-4679-9510-e12c2b27890d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000094.3(COL7A1):c.4233del (p.Gly1412fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/587424"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Mutilating scarring of the hands and feet, corneal involvement, poor dentition","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0200041","obo:HP_0002860","obo:HP_0008066"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:462d17bc-6690-47c4-a66e-14965457c3b9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9e2e249b-fc1b-4679-9510-e12c2b27890d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27899325"},"rdfs:label":"55-1"},{"id":"cggv:462d17bc-6690-47c4-a66e-14965457c3b9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:462d17bc-6690-47c4-a66e-14965457c3b9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This variant was found in 5 unrelated families in west Iran, exclusively in Lurish ethinicity, and haplotype analysis suggested founder effect.

Inheritance can be autosomal dominant or recessive. We report here 4 cases of BDN, 2 of which presented with aplasia cutis congenita of the lower extremities. All patients improved rapidly and blister formation ceased by the third month of life in 3 cases. In these patients only residual milia, nail dystrophies and atrophic scarring at sites of aplasia cutis were visible by one year. Family history indicated dominant inheritance in 2 cases, confirmed by identification of COL7A1 mutation. Molecular analysis also revealed recessive inheritance in the 2 sporadic cases. A literature search identified several patients with BDN born with skin defects localized to the lower extremities. In conclusion, these findings indicate that aplasia cutis congenita is not an infrequent manifestation of BDN.

The RDEB is the most severe form of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). It is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the collage VII gene COL7A1. Patients with RDEB have up to 50 fold increased incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (PMID: 26083672). Clinically, the risk of developing SCC appears to parallel the severity, extent of ulceration and scarring of the skin, which in turn correlates with loss of collagen VII expression and decreased or absent anchoring fibrils. Loss-of-function mutations in COL7A1 in RDEB patients lead to dermal-epidermal tissue separation as a consequence of impaired interactions with major dermal epidermal junction (DEJ) components. More than 700 COL7A1 recessive DEB-causing variants spanning the entire gene have been described for all forms of DEB. Homozygous loss of function variants from a large study on 152 Iranian families with 238 patients of DEB (PMID: 27899325) and a small study (PMID: 26864810) are recorded in this curation for genetic evidence (12 points). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (6 points).  A knockdown shCOL7 SCC-IC1 cell line demonstrated loss of COL7 reduced differentiation, increased VEGF expression, angiogenesis and invasion in shCOL7 xenografts similar to that seen in RDEB patients (PMID: 26476432). COL7A1-null mice die too early to initiate cancer studies (PMID: 10523500). A collagen VII hypomorphic mouse, homozygous Col7a1flNeo/flNeo mice, as an immunocompetent animal model for DEB showed expression of collagen VII at about 10% of normal levels, and their phenotype closely resembled characteristics of severe human DEB, including mucocutaneous blistering, nail dystrophy, and mitten deformities of the extremities. Wildtype fibroblast injection restored Collagen VII deposition and function at the DEJZ (PubMed: 18382769). In addition, an ABEmax (adenine base editor) corrected endogenous COL7A1 in autologous cells [patient derived fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)] can restore normalized epithelial architecture via increased COL7 expression (PMID: 31437443). In summary, both genetic and extensive experimental evidence demonstrate that COL7A1 is definitely associated with autosomal recessively inherited Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB), which is associated with increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:940fac3e-2586-4d49-a6f3-db12e865cc65"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
