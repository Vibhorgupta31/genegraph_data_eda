Generally a perinatally lethal disease, a few long-term survivors have been reported. Recently, mutations in the carboxy-propeptide of type II collagen have been identified in two patients with PLSD-T, indicating that PLSD-T is a type 2 collagen-associated disorder. We studied eight additional cases of PLSD-T and found that all had mutations in the C-propeptide domain of COL2A1. The mutational spectrum includes missense, stop codon and frameshift mutations. All non-sense mutations were located in the last exon, where they would escape non-sense-mediated RNA-decay. We conclude that PLSD-T is caused by mutations in the C-propeptide domain of COL2A1, which lead to biosynthesis of an altered collagen chain (as opposed to a null allele). Similar mutations have recently been found to be the cause of spondyloperipheral dysplasia, a non-lethal dominant disorder whose clinical and radiographical features overlap those of the rare long-term survivors with PLSD-T. Thus, spondyloperipheral dysplasia and PLSD-T constitute a novel subfamily within the type II collagenopathies, associated with specific mutations in the C-propeptide domain and characterized by distinctive radiological features including metaphyseal changes and brachydactyly that set them apart from other type 2 collagenopathies associated with mutations in the triple-helical domain of COL2A1. The specific phenotype of C-propeptide mutations could result from a combination of diminished collagen fibril formation, toxic effects through the accumulation of unfolded collagen chains inside the chondrocytes, and alteration of a putative signaling function of the carboxy-propeptide of type 2 collagen.","dc:creator":"Zankl A","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Dominant negative mutations in the C-propeptide of COL2A1 cause platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, torrance type, and define a novel subfamily within the type 2 collagenopathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15643621","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Missense variant without radiographs, supporting functional evidence, or inheritance pattern.

Therefore, animal models corresponding to multiple type II collagenopathies are required. In this study we identified a novel Col2a1 missense mutation--c.44406A>C (p.D1469A)--produced by large-scale N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in a mouse line. This mutation was located in the C-propeptide coding region of Col2a1 and in the positions corresponding to a human COL2A1 mutation responsible for platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type (PLSD-T). The phenotype was inherited as a semidominant trait. The heterozygotes were mildly but significantly smaller than wild-type mice. The homozygotes exhibited lethal skeletal dysplasias, including extremely short limbs, severe spondylar dysplasia, severe pelvic hypoplasia, and brachydactyly. As expected, these skeletal defects in the homozygotes were similar to those in PLSD-T patients. The secretion of the mutant proteins into the extracellular space was disrupted, accompanied by abnormally expanded rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and upregulation of ER stress-related genes, such as Grp94 and Chop, in chondrocytes. These findings suggested that the accumulation of mutant type II collagen in the ER and subsequent induction of ER stress are involved, at least in part in the PLSD-T-like phenotypes of the mutants. This mutant should serve as a good model for studying PLSD-T pathogenesis and the mechanisms that create the great diversity of type II collagenopathies.","dc:creator":"Furuichi T","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"ENU-induced missense mutation in the C-propeptide coding region of Col2a1 creates a mouse model of platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type."},"rdfs:label":"Disrupted secretion of Col2a1 into extracellular space"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a4c42c43-7b6a-4456-aeb1-7a00302a468b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:df4cfb07-8038-4a8d-ac2a-d2fd6fda6580","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:504dc1ff-91f9-4b6a-a65a-438d7c352b8e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The homozygotes exhibited lethal skeletal dysplasias, including extremely short limbs, severe spondylar dysplasia, severe pelvic hypoplasia, and brachydactyly.

However, the mechanisms generating this diversity remain to be determined. Here we identified a novel Col2a1 mutant mouse line by screening a large-scale N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutant mouse library. This mutant possessed a p.Tyr1391Ser missense mutation in the C-propeptide coding region, and this mutation was located in positions corresponding to the human COL2A1 mutation responsible for platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type (PLSD-T). As expected, p.Tyr1391Ser homozygotes exhibited lethal skeletal dysplasias resembling PLSD-T, including extremely short limbs and severe dysplasia of the spine and pelvis. The secretion of the mutant proteins into the extracellular space was disrupted, accompanied by an abnormally expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the up-regulation of ER stress-related genes in chondrocytes. Chondrocyte apoptosis was severely induced in the growth plate of the homozygotes. These findings strongly suggest that ER stress-mediated apoptosis caused by the accumulated mutant proteins in ER contributes to skeletal dysplasia in Co12a1 mutant mice and PLSD-T patients.

Platyspondylic dysplasia-Torrance type is lethal in the neonatal period (PMID:Â 14729840). This curation includes patients diagnosed with Platypondylic dysplasia-Luton type, which represents the less severe, non-lethal end of the same spectrum of disease.  Causative variants of PLSD-T fall within the C-propeptide region of COL2A1 (PMID:Â 12961049). At least 10 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift etc.) have been reported in patients with PLSD-T. Genetic and experimental evidence, including two mouse models, support this gene-disease relationship. Notably, COL2A1 and Achondrogenesis type 2-hypochondrogenesis has been classified as a definitive gene-disease relationship by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders Expert Panel. Other conditions associated with COL2A1 (Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita SEDC, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with marked metaphyseal changes SEMD, Kniest dysplasia, Spondyloperipheral dysplasia, SED with metatarsal shortening (Czech dysplasia), Stickler syndrome type I, Dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses) will be assessed separately (PMID: 31633310). In summary, COL2A1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Platyspondylic dysplasia-Torrance type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/1/21.
