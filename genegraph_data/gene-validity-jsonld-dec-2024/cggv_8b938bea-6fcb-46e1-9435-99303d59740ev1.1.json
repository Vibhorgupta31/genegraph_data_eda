The clinical presentation remains fairly stable and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy. To date, only a few families with autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia have been reported. Linkage to 3pter was demonstrated in one large Australian family and this locus was designated spinocerebellar ataxia type 29. The objective of this study is to describe an unreported Canadian family with autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia and to identify the underlying genetic causes in this family and the original Australian family.","dc:creator":"Huang L","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Missense mutations in ITPR1 cause autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b938bea-6fcb-46e1-9435-99303d59740e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b938bea-6fcb-46e1-9435-99303d59740e_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2.2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:8b938bea-6fcb-46e1-9435-99303d59740e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3873,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:00d35b34-af0f-41d6-b662-352ecf14d2fa","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007298","gene":"hgnc:6180","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*ITPR1* was first reported in relation to Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 29 in 2012 by Huang et al. (PMID: 22986007), and clinical features include congenital cerebellar ataxia, infantile-onset hypotonia, dysarthria, gross motor development, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. The mechanism of action is point mutations present in the ligand transferase, IP3 binding, and RyR & IP3R homology domains of ITPR1 (PMIDs: 28620721, 27108798). This curation has case-level data of 10 variants across the same number of individuals in six publications (PMIDs: 29186133, 29925855, 25794864, 28620721, 27062503, 15623688) for a maximum of 12 points for genetic evidence; however, more evidence is available in the literature. In addition, three families with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 29, *ITPR1* variants, and four or more segregations were identified across three publications (PMIDs: 15623688, 22986007, 28488678). \n\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia Type 15 (MIM: 606658) has also been implicated with *ITPR1* however, it was not curated as per ClinGen Lumping & Splitting criteria due to its difference in proposed mechanism of action and phenotype. Clinical features of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 15 include progressive gait/limb ataxia, eye movement abnormalities, dysarthria, and balance problems and was first associated with *ITPR1* in 2008 by Hara et al. (PMID: 18579805). In addition, autosomal dominant and recessive forms of Gillespie syndrome have been definitively and moderately implicated (respectively) with *ITPR1* with a dominant-negative effect caused by missense variants and predicted null variants (respectively) in the transmembrane and ion transport domains of ITPR1 (PMID: 27108798). Clinical features of Gillespie Syndrome include iris aniridia/hypoplasia, congenital hypotonia, progressive cerebellar ataxia, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and this association was first made in 2016 by both Gerber et al. (PMID: 27108797) and McEntagart et al. (PMID: 27108798). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence of the relationship between *ITPR1* and Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 29. This has been demonstrated in multiple research and clinical settings and has been validated over time. This curation was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/3/21 (SOP V8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8b938bea-6fcb-46e1-9435-99303d59740e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
