We have carried out a radiographic, morphologic, biochemical and molecular study in a case of achondrogenesis type II. Electron micrographs showed inclusion bodies of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum in the chondrocytes and the presence of sparse collagen fibers in the cartilage matrix. Protein analysis of collagen from cartilage indicated posttranslational overmodification of the major cyanogen bromide peptides, and suggested a mutation near the carboxyl terminus of the type II collagen molecule. Analysis at the DNA level demonstrated that the phenotype was produced by a single base change (G-->C) that resulted in the substitution of glycine691 by arginine in the type II collagen triple helical domain. We confirm previous observations in three cases of hypochondrogenesis that glycine substitutions in the alpha 1(II) chain can result in a phenotype at the most severe end of the type II collagenopathy spectrum.","dc:creator":"Mortier GR","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"A radiographic, morphologic, biochemical and molecular analysis of a case of achondrogenesis type II resulting from substitution for a glycine residue (Gly691-->Arg) in the type II collagen trimer."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7757081","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Unconfirmed de novo missense variant"},{"id":"cggv:8ae88a1d-7cee-4c93-8636-ddafd47320cd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e171e24-fe22-489a-b078-4871e215f17e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"Sequencing of COL2A1","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"cupped metaphyses, enlarged humeral metaphyses, pubic branches were not visible","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0003026","obo:HP_0000926","obo:HP_0009826","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0002866"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:8ae88a1d-7cee-4c93-8636-ddafd47320cd_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:758a2573-58ac-4714-84d9-ee89aa4caa73"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7741714","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Two different mutations were found in two unrelated probands with lethal chondrodysplasias, one with achondrogenesis type II and the other with the less severe phenotype of hypochondrogenesis. The mutations in the COL2A1 gene were identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of genomic DNA followed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and restriction site analysis. The proband with achondrogenesis type II had a heterozygous single-base mutation that substituted aspartate for glycine at position 310 of the alpha 1(II) chain of type II procollagen. The proband with hypochondrogenesis had a heterozygous single-base mutation that substituted serine for glycine at position 805. Type II collagen extracted from cartilage from the probands demonstrated the presence of type I collagen and a delayed electrophoretic mobility, indicating post-translational overmodifications. Analysis of CNBr peptides showed that, in proband 1, the entire peptides were overmodified. Examination of chondrocytes cultured in agarose or alginate indicated that there was a delayed secretion of type II procollagen. In addition, type II collagen synthesized by cartilage fragments from the probands demonstrated a decreased thermal stability. The melting temperature of the type II collagen containing the aspartate-for-glycine substitution was reduced by 4 degrees C, and that of the collagen containing the serine-for-glycine substitution was reduced by 2 degrees C. Electron microscopy of the extracellular matrix from the chondrocyte cultures showed a decreased density of matrix and the presence of unusually short and thin fibrils. Our results indicate that glycine substitutions in the N-terminal region of the type II collagen molecule can produce more severe phenotypes than mutations in the C-terminal region. The aspartate-for-glycine substitution at position 310, which was associated with defective secretion and a probable increased degradation of collagen, is the most destabilizing mutation yet reported in type II procollagen.","dc:creator":"Bonaventure J","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Substitution of aspartic acid for glycine at position 310 in type II collagen produces achondrogenesis II, and substitution of serine at position 805 produces hypochondrogenesis: analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7741714","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for de novo missense variants"},{"id":"cggv:ee47e9df-3398-4d34-97f5-3ad56e862f2c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf945f2b-a637-47fe-bc65-8b510e262855","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"PCR of exons 40 and 41 of COL2A1","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"absent ossification of ischium","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008857","obo:HP_0008788","obo:HP_0009826","obo:HP_0003026","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0000773","obo:HP_0100569","obo:HP_0003021","obo:HP_0002866","obo:HP_0000969","obo:HP_0030290"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:ee47e9df-3398-4d34-97f5-3ad56e862f2c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4f40cc42-39c2-4fad-baa9-316b6e683a59","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001844.5(COL2A1):c.2905G>A (p.Gly969Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA250680"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7829510","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"An autosomal dominant mutation in the COL2A1 gene was identified in a fetus with achondrogenesis type II. A transition of G2853 to A in exon 41 produced a substitution of Gly769 by Ser within the triple helical domain of the alpha 1(II) chain of type II collagen, interrupting the mandatory Gly-X-Y triplet sequence required for the normal formation of stable triple helical type II collagen molecules, resulting in the complete absence of type II collagen in the cartilage, which had a gelatinous composition. Type I and III collagens were the major species found in cartilage tissue and synthesized by cultured chondrocytes along with cartilage type XI collagen. However, cultured chondrocytes produced a trace amount of type II collagen, which was retained within the cells and not secreted. In situ hybridization of cartilage sections showed that the chondrocytes produced both type II and type I collagen mRNA. As a result, it is likely that the chondrocytes produced type II collagen molecules, which were then degraded. The close proximity of the Gly769 substitution by Ser to the mammalian collagenase cleavage site at Gly775-Leu776 may have produced an unstable domain that was highly susceptible to proteolysis. The type I and III collagens that replaced type II collagen were unable to maintain the normal structure of the hyaline cartilage but did support chondrocyte maturation, evidenced by the expression of type X collagen in the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate cartilage.","dc:creator":"Chan D","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"A COL2A1 mutation in achondrogenesis type II results in the replacement of type II collagen by type I and III collagens in cartilage."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7829510","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Unconfirmed de novo missense variant"},{"id":"cggv:90bc5ea8-364f-402c-ae5e-44b1b7ddcbf8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d47e3960-4a54-4e0c-b346-660fd43b93b2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"PCR of all 54 exons of COL2A1 and flanking exons","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Cartilage morphology: hypervascular, hypercellular","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000476","obo:HP_0000946","obo:HP_0011800","obo:HP_0002980","obo:HP_0100569","obo:HP_0000969","obo:HP_0008788","obo:HP_0003026","obo:HP_0003021","obo:HP_0000175"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:90bc5ea8-364f-402c-ae5e-44b1b7ddcbf8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:a2dd6de9-a281-41c2-a0fa-84aaf090ae29","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001844.5(COL2A1):c.2258G>A (p.Gly753Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA384546052"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10797431"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10797431","rdfs:label":"ISDR 92-240"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for de novo missense variant"},{"id":"cggv:a892eeec-3b68-4799-bc5e-91514f4f88e4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9470f480-1c5b-4433-b952-5f0072e66253","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000773","obo:HP_0002866","obo:HP_0000969","obo:HP_0100569","obo:HP_0004331","obo:HP_0003026"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a892eeec-3b68-4799-bc5e-91514f4f88e4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:aa1a9246-f909-4c9a-9b51-67944967d891","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001844.5(COL2A1):c.4231del (p.Leu1411CysfsTer24)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139532521"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31392067"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31392067","rdfs:label":"Case 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"After call: radiographs resemble Platyspondylic dysplasia, Torrance type more than anchondrogenesis.

has been described in association with autosomal dominant Achondrogenesis type II, a severe disorder affecting cartilage and bone development. Comstock et al. described Achondrogenesis type II in 2010 as being \"characterized by severe micromelic dwarfism with small chest and prominent abdomen, incomplete ossification of the vertebral bodies, and disorganization of the costochondral junction\". At least 15 unique variants have been identified in patients (PMIDs: 17994563, 7741714, 7829510, 7757081, 10797431, 31392067, 25823796, 31299979). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, COL2A1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Achondrogenesis type II. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
