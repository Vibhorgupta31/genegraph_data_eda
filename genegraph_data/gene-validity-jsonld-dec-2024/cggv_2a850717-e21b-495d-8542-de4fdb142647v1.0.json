We aimed to analyze the spectrum of mutations responsible for the disorder in Spanish and Argentinian patients, not previously studied. We identified all the ARSB mutant alleles, nine of them novel, in 12 Spanish and 4 Argentinian patients. The new changes were as follows: six missense mutations: c.245T>G [p.L82R], c.413A>G [p.Y138C], c.719C>T [p.S240F], c.922G>A [p.G308R], c.1340G>T [p.C447F] and c.1415T>C [p.L472P]; one nonsense mutation: c.966G>A [p.W322X]; and two intronic changes involving splice sites: c.1142+2T>A, in the donor splice site of intron 5, which promotes skipping of exon 5, and c.1143-1G>C, which disrupts the acceptor site of intron 5, resulting in skipping of exon 6. We also report 10 previously described mutations as well as several non-pathogenic polymorphisms. Haplotype analysis indicated a common origin for most of the mutations found more than once. Most of the patients were compound heterozygotes, whereas only four of them were homozygous. These observations confirm the broad allelic heterogeneity of the disease, with 19 different mutations in 16 patients. However, the two most frequent mutations, c.1143-1G>C and c.1143-8T>G, present in both populations, accounted for one-third of the mutant alleles in this group of patients.","dc:creator":"Garrido E","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Identification of the molecular defects in Spanish and Argentinian mucopolysaccharidosis VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) patients, including 9 novel mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:c6ee05cf-e062-4a06-8f3c-c2d16ee7a6ea_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2b303fcc-93be-414f-b42a-3ac27b9d740b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17643332"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient ML1"},{"id":"cggv:c6ee05cf-e062-4a06-8f3c-c2d16ee7a6ea","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6ee05cf-e062-4a06-8f3c-c2d16ee7a6ea_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:13b6418f-5ffd-4b05-b1a3-58e4621559fc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13b6418f-5ffd-4b05-b1a3-58e4621559fc_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:13b6418f-5ffd-4b05-b1a3-58e4621559fc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Supporting functional data (PMID: 18406185): expression in COS-7 cells, showed <6% of wild-type enzyme activity "}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1522f65c-6129-4c90-a9e9-54ddcecba69b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1522f65c-6129-4c90-a9e9-54ddcecba69b","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:2b303fcc-93be-414f-b42a-3ac27b9d740b"},{"id":"cggv:91a7301b-57cf-4fdf-bb47-ae31562e96b1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000046.5(ARSB):c.943C>T (p.Arg315Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/559828"}}],"detectionMethod":"Southern blotting of cDNA","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Male with severe form of MPS6, previously reported (Patient 4) in PMID: 17672828, said to have severe disease per biochemical testing including absent ASB protein by Western immunoblot","secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:cdb600d2-5012-4513-9052-b3bac823c1e4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2b303fcc-93be-414f-b42a-3ac27b9d740b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20143913","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Apparent homozygosity for the mutation p.R315X present on exon 5 of the arylsulfatase B (ARSB) gene in a mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patient was solved in this study by further testing for a second mutation.

In order to determine the gene defect in a clinically severe MPS VI patient, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were generated from the patient's fibroblast mRNA and also from a 4-sulfatase cDNA clone and subjected to the chemical cleavage technique to detect mismatched bases, which were then identified by direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products. The patient was homozygous for an early frameshift mutation caused by the deletion of a G at position 238 (delta G238), which produces a truncated 4-sulfatase with an altered amino acid sequence from amino acid 80 to a premature stop codon at codon 113 relative to the normal 4-sulfatase reading frame of 533 amino acids. Since the mutation occurs only 40 amino acids past the signal peptidase cleavage site, it is most likely that this will result in a protein with no 4-sulfatase activity. This is consistent with the severe clinical presentation and the absence of 4-sulfatase enzyme activity or mutant 4-sulfatase protein in the patient. The patient was also found to be homozygous for two polymorphisms, i.e., a G to A transition at nucleotide 1072 resulting in a valine358 to methionine substitution (V358M) and a salient A to G transition in the third base of the proline397 codon at nucleotide 1191.","dc:creator":"Litjens T","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"An N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase mutation (delta G238) results in a severe Maroteaux-Lamy phenotype."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:9b80c0b1-711e-4c5d-806d-3d247daa6913","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b80c0b1-711e-4c5d-806d-3d247daa6913_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Scored 1 total given ClinGen SVI recommendations for 1pt max for homozygous variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2a850717-e21b-495d-8542-de4fdb142647_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:e386cdd1-7aa0-4311-b48e-cb5963802a0a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e386cdd1-7aa0-4311-b48e-cb5963802a0a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:47519f9d-768b-46da-b1ae-d4e0fbe79dd6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000046.5(ARSB):c.979C>T (p.Arg327Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/559832"}},{"id":"cggv:bd33778d-03d0-4426-aec9-b696c612985f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000046.5(ARSB):c.630_636del (p.Met209_Tyr210insTer)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/559800"}}],"detectionMethod":"PCR amplification of cDNA followed by Sanger sequencing of exons 1-8 of ARSB gene","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"ASB enzyme activity 15pmol/min/mg and urinary GAG 683 ug/mg Creatinine ","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:ceeb58ae-5a76-4cfc-8555-7024eb6b8273_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:47519f9d-768b-46da-b1ae-d4e0fbe79dd6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17458871","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI; Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B, ARSB) gene.

Thirteen substitutions (c.215T>G [p.L72R] c.284G>A [p.R95Q], c.305G>A [p.R102H], c.323G>T [p.G108V], c.389C>T [p.P130L], c.511G>A [p.G171S], c.904G>A [p.G302R], c.944G>A [p.R315Q], c.1057T>C [p.W353R], c.1151G>A [p.S384N], c.1178A>C [p.H393P], c.1289A>G [p.H430R] and c.1336G>C [p.G446R]), one deletion (c.238delG), and two intronic mutations (c.1213+5G>A and c.1214-2A>G) were identified. Nine of the 16 mutations identified were novel (R102H, G108V, P130L, G171S, W353R, H430R, G446R, c.1213+5G>A and c.1214-2A>G). The two common polymorphisms c.1072G>A [p.V358M] and c.1126G>A [p.V376M] were identified in some of the patients, along with the silent mutations c.972A>G and c.1191A>G. Cultured fibroblast ARSB mutant protein and residual activity were determined for each patient and, together with genotype information, used to predict the expected clinical severity of each patient.","dc:creator":"Karageorgos L","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Mutational analysis of mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patients undergoing a phase II trial of enzyme replacement

Birth prevalence is between 1 in 43,261 and 1 in 1,505,160 live births. The disorder shows a wide spectrum of symptoms from slowly to rapidly progressing forms. The characteristic skeletal dysplasia includes short stature, dysostosis multiplex and degenerative joint disease. Rapidly progressing forms may have onset from birth, elevated urinary glycosaminoglycans (generally >100 microg/mg creatinine), severe dysostosis multiplex, short stature, and death before the 2nd or 3rd decades. A more slowly progressing form has been described as having later onset, mildly elevated glycosaminoglycans (generally <100 microg/mg creatinine), mild dysostosis multiplex, with death in the 4th or 5th decades. Other clinical findings may include cardiac valve disease, reduced pulmonary function, hepatosplenomegaly, sinusitis, otitis media, hearing loss, sleep apnea, corneal clouding, carpal tunnel disease, and inguinal or umbilical hernia. Although intellectual deficit is generally absent in MPS VI, central nervous system findings may include cervical cord compression caused by cervical spinal instability, meningeal thickening and/or bony stenosis, communicating hydrocephalus, optic nerve atrophy and blindness. The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the ARSB gene, located in chromosome 5 (5q13-5q14). Over 130 ARSB mutations have been reported, causing absent or reduced arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase) activity and interrupted dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate degradation. Diagnosis generally requires evidence of clinical phenotype, arylsulfatase B enzyme activity <10% of the lower limit of normal in cultured fibroblasts or isolated leukocytes, and demonstration of a normal activity of a different sulfatase enzyme (to exclude multiple sulfatase deficiency). The finding of elevated urinary dermatan sulfate with the absence of heparan sulfate is supportive. In addition to multiple sulfatase deficiency, the differential diagnosis should also include other forms of MPS (MPS I, II IVA, VII), sialidosis and mucolipidosis. Before enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with galsulfase (Naglazyme), clinical management was limited to supportive care and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Galsulfase is now widely available and is a specific therapy providing improved endurance with an acceptable safety profile.

As an initial step toward enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant feline 4S (rf4S) in MPS VI cats, the feline 4S cDNA was isolated and expressed in CHO-KI cells and rf4S was immunopurified from the culture medium. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the precursor form of immunopurified rf4S was a 66-kDa polypeptide that underwent maturation to a 43-44-kDa polypeptide. Endocytosis of rf4S by cultured feline MPS VI myoblasts was predominantly mediated by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor and resulted in the correction of dermatan sulfate storage. The mutation causing feline MPS VI was identified as a base substitution at codon 476, altering a leucine codon to a proline (L476P). The L476P allele displayed no detectable 4S activity when expressed in CHO-KI cells and was observed only as a \"precursor\" polypeptide that was not secreted into the medium.

ARSB encodes aryl sulfatase B (ASB), an enzyme that catalyzes the removal of the C4 sulfate ester group from the N-acetylgalactosamine sugar residue at the nonreducing terminus of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate (DS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) during lysosomal degradation (as reviewed in PMID: 17458871; PMID: 30118150). Among individuals with MPS6, ASB deficiency results in accumulation of DS and CS, which leads to symptoms including short stature, coarse facies, dysostosis multiplex, hepatosplenomegaly, corneal clouding, and cardiac disease. \n\nThe disease mechanism of MPS6 is loss of function. MPS6 was first reported in 1963 (PMID: 14091597) and the first report of biallelic variants in ARSB among patients with MPS6 was published in 1991 (PMID: 1718978). Since then, at least 201 unique variants in 478 cases have been identified (PMID: 30118150). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between MPS6 and ARSB. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants, as well as larger deletions and duplications. In total, fourteen variants from nine probands in six publications were curated. Of note, three missense variants, c.454C>T (p.Arg152Trp), c.962T>C (p.Leu321Pro), and c.629A>G (p.Tyr210Cys), are estimated to account for 18.5% of reported cases. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between ARSB and MPS6 includes the biochemical function of the gene product (the ASB enzyme) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with MPS6 (PMID: 20385007; PMID: 4271367), the biochemical and clinical features of a feline animal model homozygous for the p.Leu476Pro variant (PMID: 8910299), and the impact of enzyme replacement therapy among human MPS6 patients (PMID: 16647419). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, ARSB is definitively associated with MPS6. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time.
