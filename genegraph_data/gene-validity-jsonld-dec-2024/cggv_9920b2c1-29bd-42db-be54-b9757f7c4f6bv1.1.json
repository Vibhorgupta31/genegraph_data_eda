Various methods have been used to identify the disease‑associated genes. However, targeted next‑generation sequencing (NGS) is not yet considered an option for routine use. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of using targeted NGS in patients with CHD concomitant with CLP. Between November 2015 and May 2017, a total of 17 patients with CHD concomitant with CLP, who were excluded from a diagnosis of trisomy syndrome, were selected at The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the patients. The copy number variants (CNVs) were determined by conducting a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array with Illumina HumanOmni1‑Quad Beadchip, while information on other gene mutations was obtained from targeted sequencing. The functions of gene mutations were then predicted using the PolyPhen‑2, SIFT and Mutation Taster tools. Finally, Sanger sequencing was used to verify the mutations. The results identified no pathogenic mutations in CNVs analyzed by high‑throughput SNP sequencing. Targeted NGS results demonstrated that 10 patients (58.8%) carried gene mutations, including 4 (23.5%) genetically diagnosed cases and 6 (35.3%) cases with unknown etiology. The 4 known diseases were Opitz G/BBB syndrome caused by MID1 gene mutation, Loeys‑Dietz syndrome caused by TGFBR1 gene mutation, Ritscher‑Schinzel/3C syndrome caused by KIAA0196 gene mutation and CHARGE syndrome caused by CHD7 gene mutation. The remaining 6 cases were not genetically diagnosed, although they carried candidate genes. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that targeted NGS was an effective and accurate candidate gene detection method in patients with CHD concomitant with CLP.","dc:creator":"Bu H","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Targeted next‑generation sequencing for research and diagnostics in congenital heart disease, and cleft lip and/or palate."}},"rdfs:label":"3"},{"id":"cggv:9a3c7416-8ac6-46b4-89bc-16820361792f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a3c7416-8ac6-46b4-89bc-16820361792f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Variant is not homozygous; only a single heterozygous variant was identified in this individual; as such, variant was not scored"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:31fa72da-4480-4678-a849-d57361813cb6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31fa72da-4480-4678-a849-d57361813cb6","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3407d3b2-950d-41b4-850b-971797ff38c1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014846.4(WASHC5):c.3335+2T>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA145522"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Macrocephaly, prominent forehead, low posterior hairline, wide and downslanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, coloboma (right iris), low set ears, brachycephaly, CNS findings (increased cisterna magna, unusual frontal horns), ID.","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3407d3b2-950d-41b4-850b-971797ff38c1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24065355"},"rdfs:label":"1"},{"id":"cggv:62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR using RNA from 2 of the affected individuals (no indication which patients were used) and 1 control individual showed a mean 7.85-fold reduction in the relative amount of KIAA0196 transcript in patient samples vs control.

WASHC5 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 in 2013 (Elliott et al., PMID: 24065355). This disorder is characterized by brain malformations, with neurodevelopmental findings, dysmorphic features, and cardiovascular malformations.\nWASHC5 has also been associated with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia 8 by Valdmanis et al. in 2007 (PMID: 17160902). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found  a difference in inheritance pattern and in clinical phenotype. Therefore, the diseases were split into Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 (OMIM: 220210) and hereditary spastic paraplegia 8 (OMIM: 603563). The split curation for autsomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia 8 has been curated separately.\n\nEvidence supporting the relationship between WASHC5 and Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 includes case-level data. Elliott et al. (2013, PMID: 24065355) identified a homozygous canonical splice site variant in 10 affected individuals from an isolated First Nations community. A homozygous missense variant was identified in another individual but was not scored (Maddirevula et al., 2020, PMID: 33456446). This gene-disease relationship is not supported by experimental evidence. There are two animal models ( one mouse and one zebrafish) reported in the literature but neither provide evidence to support the gene-disease relationship (Bu et al., PMID:32417190)\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 09.17.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9920b2c1-29bd-42db-be54-b9757f7c4f6b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
