We describe here a non-consanguineous family with two affected boys presenting with early onset of severe axonal neuropathy, optic atrophy, intellectual disability, auditory neuropathy and chronic respiratory and gut disturbances. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on all family members and we identified compound heterozygous variants (c.[760C>A];[1528G>C];p.[(Gln254Lys);(Ala510Pro)] in the polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1 (PNPT1) gene in both affected individuals. PNPT1 encodes the polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) protein, which is involved in the transport of small RNAs into the mitochondria. These RNAs are involved in the mitochondrial translation machinery, responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrially encoded subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. Both PNPT1 variants are within highly conserved regions and predicted to be damaging. These variants resulted in quaternary defects in the PNPase protein and a clear reduction in protein and mRNA expression of PNPT1 in patient fibroblasts compared with control cells. Protein analysis of the OXPHOS complexes showed a significant reduction in complex I (CI), complex III (CIII) and complex IV (CIV). Enzyme activity of CI and CIV was clearly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared with controls along with a 33% reduction in total mitochondrial protein synthesis. In vitro rescue experiments, using exogenous expression of wild-type PNPT1 in patient fibroblasts, ameliorated the deficiencies in the OXPHOS complex protein expression, supporting the likely pathogenicity of these variants and the importance of WES in efficiently identifying rare genetic disease genes.","dc:creator":"Alodaib A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing identifies novel variants in PNPT1 causing oxidative phosphorylation defects and severe multisystem disease."},"rdfs:label":"PNPT1 localisation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Mitochondrial localisation of PNPT1 consistent with mitochondrial defects observed in disease phenotype."},{"id":"cggv:ccf0b9c4-ce07-445c-b572-13324bddf449","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e734b574-fd6a-48ae-9495-f93a60effe92","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Fig 3 PNPASE Augments the Import of RNase P, 5S rRNA, and MRP RNAs into Yeast Mitochondria.

Consequently, in mammals, mitochondrial DNA is subjected to bidirectional transcription that generates overlapping transcripts, which are capable of forming long double-stranded RNA structures1,2. However, to our knowledge, mitochondrial double-stranded RNA has not been previously characterized in vivo. Here we describe the presence of a highly unstable native mitochondrial double-stranded RNA species at single-cell level and identify key roles for the degradosome components mitochondrial RNA helicase SUV3 and polynucleotide phosphorylase PNPase in restricting the levels of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA. Loss of either enzyme results in massive accumulation of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA that escapes into the cytoplasm in a PNPase-dependent manner. This process engages an MDA5-driven antiviral signalling pathway that triggers a type I interferon response. Consistent with these data, patients carrying hypomorphic mutations in the gene PNPT1, which encodes PNPase, display mitochondrial double-stranded RNA accumulation coupled with upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and other markers of immune activation. The localization of PNPase to the mitochondrial inter-membrane space and matrix suggests that it has a dual role in preventing the formation and release of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA into the cytoplasm. This in turn prevents the activation of potent innate immune defence mechanisms that have evolved to protect vertebrates against microbial and viral attack.","dc:creator":"Dhir A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial double-stranded RNA triggers antiviral signalling in humans."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30046113","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variant located in the catalytic domain; patient fibroblasts from demonstrated an accumulation of dsRNA (J2 signal) that was not observed in control cells (Fig. 3b).
