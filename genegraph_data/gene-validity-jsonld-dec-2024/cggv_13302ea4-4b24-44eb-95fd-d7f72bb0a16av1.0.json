Its causes are poorly understood but a number of affected cases are associated with chromosomal abnormalities. We set out to localize the breakpoints in a patient with sporadic HLH and a de novo translocation. Initial studies showed that the apparently simple 1q41;3q27.1 translocation was actually combined with a 4-Mb inversion, also de novo, of material within 1q41. We therefore localized all four breakpoints and found that no known transcription units were disrupted. However we present a case, based on functional considerations, synteny and position of highly conserved non-coding sequence elements, and the heterozygous Prox1(+/-) mouse phenotype (ventricular hypoplasia), for the involvement of dysregulation of the PROX1 gene in the aetiology of HLH in this case. Accordingly, we show that the spatial expression pattern of PROX1 in the developing human heart is consistent with a role in cardiac development. We suggest that dysregulation of PROX1 gene expression due to separation from its conserved upstream elements is likely to have caused the heart defects observed in this patient, and that PROX1 should be considered as a potential candidate gene for other cases of HLH. The relevance of another breakpoint separating the cardiac gene ESRRG from a conserved downstream element is also discussed.","dc:creator":"Gill HK","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Separation of the PROX1 gene from upstream conserved elements in a complex inversion/translocation patient with hypoplastic left heart."},"rdfs:label":"Expression of PROX1 in Developing Human Heart"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:13302ea4-4b24-44eb-95fd-d7f72bb0a16a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73845ded-4007-4984-b543-69589c3d0426","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f97e58ef-bf9b-4f23-904c-cef16fbb3503","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This is similar to the human CHD phenotype that displays hypoplastic left heart ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19091769","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Impaired cardiac muscle growth and aberrant myocyte arrangement underlie congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy. We show that cardiac-specific inactivation of the murine homeobox transcription factor Prox1 results in the disruption of expression and localisation of sarcomeric proteins, gross myofibril disarray and growth-retarded hearts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Prox1 is required for direct transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding the structural proteins alpha-actinin, N-RAP and zyxin, which collectively function to maintain an actin-alpha-actinin interaction as the fundamental association of the sarcomere. Aspects of abnormal heart development and the manifestation of a subset of muscular-based disease have previously been attributed to mutations in key structural proteins. Our study reveals an essential requirement for direct transcriptional regulation of sarcomere integrity, in the context of enabling foetal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, maintenance of contractile function and progression towards inherited or acquired myopathic disease.","dc:creator":"Risebro CA","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Prox1 maintains muscle structure and growth in the developing heart."},"rdfs:label":"Neonatal Prox1 +/- mice "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded due to expert opinon not being convinced of strong default evidence for CHD "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":9157,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":1.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6698219b-9edb-43b6-9705-781dfed9cf3c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:9459","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*PROX1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2009 (Gill Harinder K et al., PMID: 19471316). One unique 4- Mb de novo inversion that has been reported in one proband with CHD in one publication is included in this curation (PMID:  19471316). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression evidence and an animal model. (PMID:19091769, 19471316). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between* PROX1* and congenital heart disease has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role PROX1 plays in this disease.
