Although mouse Por gene ablation causes embryonic lethality, POR missense mutations cause disordered steroidogenesis, ambiguous genitalia, and Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS), which has also been attributed to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations. We sequenced the POR gene and FGFR2 exons 8 and 10 in 32 individuals with ABS and/or hormonal findings that suggested POR deficiency. POR and FGFR2 mutations segregated completely. Fifteen patients carried POR mutations on both alleles, 4 carried mutations on only one allele, 10 carried FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations, and 3 patients carried no mutations. The 34 affected POR alleles included 10 with A287P (all from whites) and 7 with R457H (four Japanese, one African, two whites); 17 of the 34 alleles carried 16 \"private\" mutations, including 9 missense and 7 frameshift mutations. These 11 missense mutations, plus 10 others found in databases or reported elsewhere, were recreated by site-directed mutagenesis and were assessed by four assays: reduction of cytochrome c, oxidation of NADPH, support of 17alpha-hydroxylase activity, and support of 17,20 lyase using human P450c17. Assays that were based on cytochrome c, which is not a physiologic substrate for POR, correlated poorly with clinical phenotype, but assays that were based on POR's support of catalysis by P450c17--the enzyme most closely associated with the hormonal phenotype--provided an excellent genotype/phenotype correlation. Our large survey of patients with ABS shows that individuals with an ABS-like phenotype and normal steroidogenesis have FGFR mutations, whereas those with ambiguous genitalia and disordered steroidogenesis should be recognized as having a distinct new disease: POR deficiency.","dc:creator":"Huang N","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Diversity and function of mutations in p450 oxidoreductase in patients with Antley-Bixler syndrome and disordered steroidogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Huang E.coli Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6275d46a-f005-45f8-b3ec-e9722f8dd39e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d34bae33-5cde-4ee4-b96d-626c3af2d35c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7af16f11-9fa8-448f-ae94-f5bd67553b71","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The aberrant development of the skull upon POR deletion in osteoprogenitor cells in this mouse model not only implicates POR in bone development but it recapitulates, at least partially, the observed craniofacial deformities and bone defects leading to fracture in severe POR-deficient human patients","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24086598","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is the primary electron donor for cytochromes P450, dehydrocholesterol reductase, heme oxygenase, and squalene monooxygenase. Human patients with specific mutations in POR exhibit severe developmental malformations including disordered steroidogenesis, sexual ambiguities and various bone defects, similar to those seen in patients with Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS). To probe the role of POR during bone development, we generated a conditional knockout mouse (CKO) by cross breeding Por (lox/lox) and Dermo1 Cre mice. CKO mice were smaller than their littermate controls and exhibited significant craniofacial and long bone abnormalities. Differential staining of the CKO mice skull bases shows premature fusion of the sphenooccipital and basioccipital-exoccipital synchondroses. Class III malocclusion was noted in adult knockout mice with an unusual overgrowth of the lower incisors. Shorter long bones were observed along with a reduction in the bone volume fraction, measured by microCT, in the Por-deleted mice compared to age- and sex-matched littermate controls. Concerted up- or down-regulation of proteins in the FGF signaling pathway observed by immunohistochemistry in the tibia samples of CKO mice compared to wild type controls shows a decrease in the FGF signaling pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a mouse model that recapitulates both skull and long bone defects upon Por deletion, offering an approach to study the sequelae of POR mutations. This unique model demonstrates that P450 metabolism in bone itself is potentially important for proper bone development, and that an apparent link exists between the POR and FGF signaling pathways, begging the question of how an oxidation-reduction flavoprotein affects developmental and cellular signaling processes.

Clinical manifestations in affected patients are highly variable. We report on a girl with P450 oxidoreductase deficiency who presented with virilisation at birth. There was transient maternal virilisation during pregnancy as well. She was initially diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency and/or aromatase deficiency. At 1 year of age, skeletal abnormalities suggestive of Antley-Bixler syndrome were detected. Molecular analysis of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene was normal but POR gene analysis showed that she was homozygous for an R457H missense mutation. The diagnosis, P450 oxidoreductase deficiency, was confirmed. Results of her endocrine studies and urinary steroid profiling are also presented.","dc:creator":"But WM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Ambiguous genitalia, impaired steroidogenesis, and Antley-Bixler syndrome in a patient with P450 oxidoreductase deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"But Proband"},{"id":"cggv:525a595f-00da-4d23-b7a9-da836b8dc72f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:525a595f-00da-4d23-b7a9-da836b8dc72f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8b3b9746-1c15-4070-8083-beed1e2cb10e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8b3b9746-1c15-4070-8083-beed1e2cb10e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:03c458c6-e80e-479c-a5ac-71000cea2ccd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000941.3(POR):c.529G>C (p.Gly177Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4303718"}},{"id":"cggv:bab99e9f-d491-48f5-aa37-a77446048d3b"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Presented delayed puberty, loss of pubic hair, mild facial dysmorphism was noted: micrognathia, high arched palate, and low-set deformed ears.

Antley-Bixler Syndrome is a rare syndromic craniosynostosis characterized by midface hypoplasia, radiohumeral synostosis, femoral bowing, and joint contractures. Phenotypes specific to POR-related Antley-Bixler include steroidogenesis and genital anomalies. There is variation seen in the literature, with some cases with pathogenic POR variants having isolated craniofacial phenotypes or isolated genital anomalies and steroidogenesis. The cases included in this curation for POR and POR-related Antley-Bixler Syndrome exhibited both craniofacial phenotypes and genital anomalies/steroidogenesis. This curation includes 6 variants (missense, splice, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in 7 probands from 6 publications (PMIDs: 32615689, 18853185, 32851239, 20124576, 26670660, 28841001). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 24086598, 15793702). In summary, POR is definitively associated with autosomal recessive POR-related Antley-Bixler Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
