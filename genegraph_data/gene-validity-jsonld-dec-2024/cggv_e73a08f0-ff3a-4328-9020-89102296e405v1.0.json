DLG3 encodes synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family. Neuronal SAP102 is expressed during early brain development and is localized to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. It is composed of three amino-terminal PDZ domains, an src homology domain, and a carboxyl-terminal guanylate kinase domain. The PDZ domains interact directly with the NR2 subunits of the NMDA glutamate receptor and with other proteins responsible for NMDA receptor localization, immobilization, and signaling. The mutations identified in this study all introduce premature stop codons within or before the third PDZ domain, and it is likely that this impairs the ability of SAP102 to interact with the NMDA receptor and/or other proteins involved in downstream NMDA receptor signaling pathways. NMDA receptors have been implicated in the induction of certain forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression, and these changes in synaptic efficacy have been proposed as neural mechanisms underlying memory and learning. The disruption of NMDA receptor targeting or signaling, as a result of the loss of SAP102, may lead to altered synaptic plasticity and may explain the intellectual impairment observed in individuals with DLG3 mutations.","dc:creator":"Tarpey P","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mutations in the DLG3 gene cause nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15185169","rdfs:label":"III-3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"not genomic wide sequencing, not experimental evidence"},{"id":"cggv:29fca55b-9348-4ba1-a47e-0f993e44dca0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:91c9caca-967a-44f9-8fcb-bf34aa5fe9a9","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:29fca55b-9348-4ba1-a47e-0f993e44dca0_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:94f15fbd-7770-48fd-b38a-ec746afbbf92","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021120.3(DLG3):c.1092dupC (p.Thr365Hisfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/29942"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15185169"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15185169","rdfs:label":"II-5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"not genomic wide sequencing,"},{"id":"cggv:dcc0089f-6b16-4136-ab9a-5c025fd2904d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:88820c25-6a16-4e00-b8c6-2bb6de7700ff","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"X-Exome sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:dcc0089f-6b16-4136-ab9a-5c025fd2904d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f80ce947-51cc-4c0e-9ceb-5cd408526b86","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"XM_006724625.2(DLG3):c.649C>T (p.Arg217Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA413492393"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25649377","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with more than 100 genes known to date. Most genes are responsible for a small proportion of patients only, which has hitherto hampered the systematic screening of large patient cohorts. We performed targeted enrichment and next-generation sequencing of 107 XLID genes in a cohort of 150 male patients. Hundred patients had sporadic intellectual disability, and 50 patients had a family history suggestive of XLID. We also analysed a sporadic female patient with severe ID and epilepsy because she had strongly skewed X-inactivation. Target enrichment and high parallel sequencing allowed a diagnostic coverage of >10 reads for ~96% of all coding bases of the XLID genes at a mean coverage of 124 reads. We found 18 pathogenic variants in 13 XLID genes (AP1S2, ATRX, CUL4B, DLG3, IQSEC2, KDM5C, MED12, OPHN1, SLC9A6, SMC1A, UBE2A, UPF3B and ZDHHC9) among the 150 male patients. Thirteen pathogenic variants were present in the group of 50 familial patients (26%), and 5 pathogenic variants among the 100 sporadic patients (5%). Systematic gene dosage analysis for low coverage exons detected one pathogenic hemizygous deletion. An IQSEC2 nonsense variant was detected in the female ID patient, providing further evidence for a role of this gene in encephalopathy in females. Skewed X-inactivation was more frequently observed in mothers with pathogenic variants compared with those without known X-linked defects.

Strikingly, either mutation of these critical residues or knockdown of endogenous SAP102 can rescue the defective surface expression and synaptic localization of PDZ binding-deficient GluN2B. These data reveal an unexpected, nonscaffolding role for SAP102 in the synaptic clearance of GluN2B-containing NMDARs.","dc:creator":"Chen BS","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"SAP102 mediates synaptic clearance of NMDA receptors."},"rdfs:label":"IP and Y2H"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e73a08f0-ff3a-4328-9020-89102296e405_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b814c94d-97cf-40a8-8d77-ecf47ce0e17a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ee64aee-5f3d-4d53-8f7a-11d41eb6ebf4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"spatial learning associate with human intellectual ability","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17344405","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Understanding the mechanisms whereby information encoded within patterns of action potentials is deciphered by neurons is central to cognitive psychology. The multiprotein complexes formed by NMDA receptors linked to synaptic membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins including synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102) and other associated proteins are instrumental in these processes. Although humans with mutations in SAP102 show mental retardation, the physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved are unknown. Using SAP102 knock-out mice, we found specific impairments in synaptic plasticity induced by selective frequencies of stimulation that also required extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. This was paralleled by inflexibility and impairment in spatial learning. Improvement in spatial learning performance occurred with extra training despite continued use of a suboptimal search strategy, and, in a separate nonspatial task, the mutants again deployed a different strategy. Double-mutant analysis of postsynaptic density-95 and SAP102 mutants indicate overlapping and specific functions of the two MAGUKs. These in vivo data support the model that specific MAGUK proteins couple the NMDA receptor to distinct downstream signaling pathways. This provides a mechanism for discriminating patterns of synaptic activity that lead to long-lasting changes in synaptic strength as well as distinct aspects of cognition in the mammalian nervous system.","dc:creator":"Cuthbert PC","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Synapse-associated protein 102/dlgh3 couples the NMDA receptor to specific plasticity pathways and learning strategies."},"rdfs:label":"SAP102 null mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"the same KO mouse also used in 27466188"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":442,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f30149c6-d644-430b-8e4b-3c825cfdf333","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019181","gene":"hgnc:2902","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The DLG3 gene has been associated with non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 2018 Jul 26.
