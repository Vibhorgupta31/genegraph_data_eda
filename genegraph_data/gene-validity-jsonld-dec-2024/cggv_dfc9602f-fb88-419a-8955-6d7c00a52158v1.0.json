Disruption of DNA replication can lead to genomic instability, with the accumulation of point mutations or larger chromosomal anomalies such as rearrangements. While cancer is the most common class of disease associated with genomic instability, several congenital diseases with dysfunctional DNA replication give rise to similar DNA alterations. In this review, we discuss all congenital diseases that arise from pathogenic variants in essential replication genes across the spectrum of aberrant replisome assembly, origin activation and DNA synthesis. For each of these conditions, we describe their clinical phenotypes as well as molecular studies aimed at determining the functional mechanisms of disease, including the assessment of genomic stability. By comparing and contrasting these diseases, we hope to illuminate how the disruption of DNA replication at distinct steps affects human health in a surprisingly cell-type-specific manner.","dc:creator":"Schmit M","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Congenital Diseases of DNA Replication: Clinical Phenotypes and Molecular Mechanisms."},"rdfs:label":"Review on Congenital Diseases of DNA Replication"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"since multiple genes from the same functional pathway forming a complex are implicated in the disorder with specific triad of features, upgraded to 1.0"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:dfc9602f-fb88-419a-8955-6d7c00a52158_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a6fdc6f-8262-44b7-87b4-a47ee1bef224","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06f524b8-7c2b-4df6-95ca-b82379e1a723","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"impaired BrDU incorporation, impaired cilia formation, increased centrosome number, and aberrant chondroinduction phenotype.

Mutations in ATR, which also functions during replication, can cause Seckel syndrome, a clinically related disorder. These findings suggest that impaired DNA replication could underlie the developmental defects characteristic of these disorders. Here, we show that although origin licensing capacity is impaired in all patient cells with mutations in origin licensing component proteins, this does not correlate with the rate of progression through S phase. Thus, the replicative capacity in MGS patient cells does not correlate with clinical manifestation. However, ORC1-deficient cells from MGS patients and siRNA-mediated depletion of origin licensing proteins also have impaired centrosome and centriole copy number. As a novel and unexpected finding, we show that they also display a striking defect in the rate of formation of primary cilia. We demonstrate that this impacts sonic hedgehog signalling in ORC1-deficient primary fibroblasts. Additionally, reduced growth factor-dependent signaling via primary cilia affects the kinetics of cell cycle progression following cell cycle exit and re-entry, highlighting an unexpected mechanism whereby origin licensing components can influence cell cycle progression. Finally, using a cell-based model, we show that defects in cilia function impair chondroinduction. Our findings raise the possibility that a reduced efficiency in forming cilia could contribute to the clinical features of MGS, particularly the bone development abnormalities, and could provide a new dimension for considering developmental impacts of licensing deficiency.","dc:creator":"Stiff T","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Deficiency in origin licensing proteins impairs cilia formation: implications for the aetiology of Meier-Gorlin syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"siRNA mediated CDT1 knockdown in control fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:814a16bf-a62d-42b2-8862-9f09465b869b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ad1578c-8e2a-44a8-8241-885fadeff9c4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"MGS patient lymphoblastoid cell lines display impaired origin licensing capacity as shown through episome replication following transfection of EBV episomes with no impaired rate of S phase progression.

Strong mutations in dup cause embryonic lethality, preceded by a failure to undergo S phase during the postblastoderm divisions. dup is required also for DNA replication in the adult ovary, establishing that dup is needed for DNA replication at multiple stages of development. Strikingly, DUP protein colocalizes with the origin recognition complex to specific sites in the ovarian follicle cells. This suggests that DUP plays a direct role in DNA replication. The dup transcript is cell cycle regulated and is under the control of E2F and Cyclin E. Interestingly, dup mutant embryos fail both to downregulate S phase genes and to engage a checkpoint preventing mitosis until completion of S phase. This could be either because these events depend on progression of S phase beyond the point blocked in the dup mutants or because DUP is needed directly for these feedback mechanisms.","dc:creator":"Whittaker AJ","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Drosophila double parked: a conserved, essential replication protein that colocalizes with the origin recognition complex and links DNA replication with mitosis and the down-regulation of S phase transcripts."},"rdfs:label":"Drosophila dup mutants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Cellular phenotype in flies is consistent with suggested disease mechanism affecting replication.

This case is therefore of clinical interest for many forms of inherited growth retardation, and will assist in providing more information and clinical guidance for females of reproductive age.","dc:creator":"Knapp KM","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Successful pregnancies in an adult with Meier-Gorlin syndrome harboring biallelic CDT1 variants."}},{"id":"cggv:036e3d3d-181b-444a-a23c-e278e1edb8f9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cbe6e203-94d8-4e1f-8f34-0d529ea2fb08"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33338304"}],"rdfs:label":"Case report"},{"id":"cggv:3902dd31-653a-4c9a-af45-d0f786055968","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3902dd31-653a-4c9a-af45-d0f786055968_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:036e3d3d-181b-444a-a23c-e278e1edb8f9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:036e3d3d-181b-444a-a23c-e278e1edb8f9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:036e3d3d-181b-444a-a23c-e278e1edb8f9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"minigene splicing assay with no canonical transcript produced; variant results in 2 alternate splicing products that both lead to a frameshift (one with exon 9 skipping and fs p.Ile426Glyfs*93, the second more abundant product with intron 8 retention in the plasmid and likely NMD: p.Ile426_Ala431delinsValSerArgProGlnTer)\nAdditionally, predicted to affect splicing: SpliceAI 0.88"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f9d32336-4cf9-41a6-a97f-c6e9d89f32f4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9d32336-4cf9-41a6-a97f-c6e9d89f32f4","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:03896a13-b289-463e-9918-45af0ef3374c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_030928.4(CDT1):c.832G>T (p.Glu278Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA397077338"}},{"id":"cggv:ff953f3f-09c3-4e48-9841-814247b92735"}],"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of 5 candidate genes\n","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Clinical features of the classical triad of MGS (e.g., short stature, microtia, small/absent patella): The patient \"died after a sudden cardiac arrest and had congenital lobar emphysema for which he required surgery.\"","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:c586a85d-3983-477e-a688-f22a1056921a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ff953f3f-09c3-4e48-9841-814247b92735"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22333897","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microtia, patellar aplasia/hypoplasia, and short stature. Recently, mutations in five genes from the pre-replication complex (ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6), crucial in cell-cycle progression and growth, were identified in individuals with MGS. Here, we report on genotype-phenotype studies in 45 individuals with MGS (27 females, 18 males; age 3 months-47 years). Thirty-five individuals had biallelic mutations in one of the five causative pre-replication genes. No homozygous or compound heterozygous null mutations were detected. In 10 individuals, no definitive molecular diagnosis was made. The triad of microtia, absent/hypoplastic patellae, and short stature was observed in 82% of individuals with MGS. Additional frequent clinical features were mammary hypoplasia (100%) and abnormal genitalia (42%; predominantly cryptorchidism and hypoplastic labia minora/majora). One individual with ORC1 mutations only had short stature, emphasizing the highly variable clinical spectrum of MGS. Individuals with ORC1 mutations had significantly shorter stature and smaller head circumferences than individuals from other gene categories. Furthermore, compared with homozygous missense mutations, compound heterozygous mutations appeared to have a more severe effect on phenotype, causing more severe growth retardation in ORC4 and more frequently pulmonary emphysema in CDT1. A lethal phenotype was seen in four individuals with compound heterozygous ORC1 and CDT1 mutations. No other clear genotype-phenotype association was observed. Growth hormone and estrogen treatment may be of some benefit, respectively, to growth retardation and breast hypoplasia, though further studies in this patient group are needed.","dc:creator":"de Munnik SA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Meier-Gorlin syndrome genotype-phenotype studies: 35 individuals with pre-replication complex gene mutations and 10 without molecular diagnosis."}},{"id":"cggv:fd0c4064-4091-4459-bd67-8ea4535bc6b0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:03896a13-b289-463e-9918-45af0ef3374c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22333897"}],"rdfs:label":"I6"},{"id":"cggv:c586a85d-3983-477e-a688-f22a1056921a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c586a85d-3983-477e-a688-f22a1056921a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c586a85d-3983-477e-a688-f22a1056921a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"See P11 in PMID 21358632: Bicknell et al.

The CDT1 cooperates with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and CDC6 in recruiting mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex to DNA to form pre-replication complexes and is also implicated in mitosis. The CDT1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Meier-Gorlin syndrome 4 (MGS4) in 2011 (Bicknell et al. 2011 PMID 21358632; Guernsey et al. 2011 PMID 21358631). Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) is characterized by a clinical triad of symptoms: short stature, microtia, and small or absent patellae. Additional features reported in individuals with MGS4 may include IUGR with failure to thrive, reduced body weight, respiratory issues, pulmonary emphysema, abnormal genitalia in males and mammary hypoplasia in females, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and dysmorphic facial features with small mouth, microretrognathia, and full lips, among other presentations (22333897: de Munnik et al. 2012). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least nine unique variants have been found in either compound heterozygous (n=7) or homozygous (n=1) state in eight cases diagnosed with MGS from five reports in the literature (21358631; 21358632; Munnik et al., 2012 PMID 22333897; Kim et al. 2017 PMID 28425089; Knapp et al. 2020 PMID 33338304). These included four unique missense variants (one of which is is predicted to impact splicing), two nonsense variants, one frameshift variant, one intronic variant shown to affect splicing, and one in frame indel (removing 1 amino acid) variant. More genetic evidence has been reported in the literature but was not scorable according to the current guidelines (21358632; 28425089; Fitzgerald et al. 2015 PMID 25533962; Retterer et al. 2016 PMID 26633542). Experimental evidence includes data on biochemical function, functional alteration and a non-human model organism. A number of genes involved in pre-replication complex formation and function have been associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS). Specifically, ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDC6, CDC45, MGM5, GMNN, and DONSON have all been associated with autosomal recessive MGS (33477564: Schmit and Bielinsky 2021). Patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines show impaired origin licensing capacity as shown through reduced episome replication (Stiff et al. 2013 PMID 23516378). Several biallelic Dup (CDT1-ortholog) loss-of-function Drosophila mutants are either embryonically lethal with some mutants showing a block in replication early in S phase, or present with defect in replication in ovaries of adult females (Whittaker et al. 2000 PMID 10898791). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between CDT1 and autosomal recessive Meier-Gorlin syndrome 4. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dfc9602f-fb88-419a-8955-6d7c00a52158"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
