Affected individuals with the hepatocerebral form of MDS have early progressive liver failure and neurological abnormalities, hypoglycemia and increased lactate in body fluids. Affected tissues show both decreased activity of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain complexes (I, III, IV, V) and mtDNA depletion. We used homozygosity mapping in three kindreds of Druze origin to map the gene causing hepatocerebral MDS to a region of 6.1 cM on chromosome 2p13, between markers D2S291 and D2S2116. This interval encompasses the gene (DGUOK) encoding the mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK). We identified a single-nucleotide deletion (204delA) within the coding region of DGUOK that segregates with the disease in the three kindreds studied. Western-blot analysis did not detect dGK protein in the liver of affected individuals. The main supply of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for mtDNA synthesis comes from the salvage pathway initiated by dGK and thymidine kinase-2 (TK2). The association of mtDNA depletion with mutated DGUOK suggests that the salvage-pathway enzymes are involved in the maintenance of balanced mitochondrial dNTP pools.","dc:creator":"Mandel

advances in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension, its pathogenesis remains elusive. Insight may be gained from study of early-onset familial idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension, in which Mendelian mutations may account for disease. We performed exome sequencing of eight subjects from six kindreds with onset of portal hypertension of indeterminate etiology during infancy or childhood. Three subjects from two consanguineous families shared the identical rare homozygous p.N46S mutation in DGUOK, a deoxyguanosine kinase required for mitochondrial DNA replication; haplotype sharing demonstrated that the mutation in the two families was inherited from a remote common ancestor. All three affected subjects had stable portal hypertension with noncirrhotic liver disease for 6-16 years of follow-up. This mutation impairs adenosine triphosphate binding and reduces catalytic activity. Loss-of-function mutations in DGUOK have previously been implicated in cirrhosis and liver failure but not in isolated portal hypertension. Interestingly, treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency viral infection with the nucleoside analogue didanosine is known to cause portal hypertension in a subset of patients and lowers deoxyguanosine kinase levels in vitro; the current findings implicate these effects on deoxyguanosine kinase in the causal mechanism.","dc:creator":"Vilarinho S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Recurrent

mutations in deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) cause mitochondrial DNA depletion and a clinical phenotype that consists of neonatal liver failure, nystagmus and hypotonia. In this series, we have identified 15 different mutations in the DGUOK gene from 9 kindreds. Among them, 12 have not previously been reported. Nonsense, splice site, or frame-shift mutations that produce truncated proteins predominate over missense mutations. All patients who harbor null mutations had early onset liver failure and significant neurological disease. These patients have all died before 2-years of age. Conversely, two patients carrying missense mutations had isolated liver disease and are alive in their 4th year of life without liver transplant. Five subjects were detected by newborn screening, with elevated tyrosine or phenylalanine. Consequently, this disease should be considered if elevated tyrosine is identified by newborn screening. Mitochondrial DNA content was below 10% of controls in liver in all but one case and modestly reduced in blood cells. With this paper a total of 39 different mutations in DGUOK have been identified. The most frequent mutation, c.763_c.766dupGATT, occurs in 8 unrelated kindreds. 70% of mutations occur in only one kindred, suggesting full sequencing of this gene is required for diagnosis. The presentation of one case with apparent viral hepatitis, without neurological disease, suggests that this disease should be considered in patients with infantile liver failure regardless of the presence of neurological features or apparent infectious etiology.","dc:creator":"Dimmock DP","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular features of mitochondrial DNA depletion due to mutations in deoxyguanosine kinase."}},{"id":"cggv:93b7d91d-23ec-4d3a-9e36-2b298a4d5d00_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1506aff5-cf7b-41f6-848e-6a582bf20544"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18205204"}],"rdfs:label":"Dimmock et al 2008, Case 2.2"},{"id":"cggv:93b7d91d-23ec-4d3a-9e36-2b298a4d5d00","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93b7d91d-23ec-4d3a-9e36-2b298a4d5d00_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:93b7d91d-23ec-4d3a-9e36-2b298a4d5d00_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Post mortem - mtDNA depletion in muscle and liver (8% and 30% of age and tissue matched controls, respectively)"}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"1.5 + 0.2 (mtDNA depletion in muscle) + 0.2 (mtDNA depletion in liver)"},{"id":"cggv:46cf8bd7-dffa-406a-8a5d-0f773caf0dee","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46cf8bd7-dffa-406a-8a5d-0f773caf0dee_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:46cf8bd7-dffa-406a-8a5d-0f773caf0dee_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Post mortem - mtDNA depletion in muscle and liver (8% and 30% of age and tissue matched controls, respectively)"}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"1.5 + 0.2 (mtDNA depletion in muscle) + 0.2 (mtDNA depletion in liver)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:93c7e0a9-a00e-435f-82b7-29cd8b1cc7a3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93c7e0a9-a00e-435f-82b7-29cd8b1cc7a3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:dfa42478-1fe0-437b-ad0b-8657a466eece","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_080916.3(DGUOK):c.763_766dup (p.Phe256Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1718354"}},{"id":"cggv:2efeeacd-cb72-4700-8570-66e9b2f7f788","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_080916.3(DGUOK):c.819T>G (p.Phe273Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347302101"}}],"detectionMethod":"\n\nPaternal c.763_766dup; p.

In addition, mtDNA synthesis requires a balanced supply of nucleotides that is achieved by nucleotide recycling inside the mitochondria and import from the cytosol.

Similar apparent negative co-operativity in the binding of the phosphate acceptors to the wild-type enzyme was found for the mutant. In contrast, abnormal bimodal kinetics were shown with ATP as the phosphate donor, suggesting an impairment of the ATP binding mode at the phosphate donor site. No kinetic behaviours were found for two other patients with splicing defects or premature stop codon.

While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *DGUOK*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *DGUOK* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 14 variants (six missense, six nonsense or frameshift variants resulting in premature truncation, two variants impacting splicing) in eight probands from six publications (PMIDs: 11687800, 18205204, 26874653, 29137425, 30956829, 35750291). However, there are more than 100 cases reported in the literature (PMIDs: 28215579, 20301766). Affected individuals have a spectrum of clinical features ranging from infantile or childhood onset noncirrhotic portal hypertension, isolated hepatic failure (with at least one case that was apparently spontaneously reversible), hepatic failure with neurologic involvement that is often fatal, and adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy with chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia and multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions in muscle.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function in maintenance of mitochondrial DNA quantity and integrity, as well as functional alteration in patient cells, and knockout animal models (PMIDs: 28215579, 17073823, 31127938). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DGUOK* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 22, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dd4c3ef2-6738-4770-ad64-4db31672ca9a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
