The factors underlying this rare disease are poorly understood. We characterized the immunological and intestinal features of 6 unrelated MIA-CID patients. All patients displayed a profound, generalized lymphocytopenia, with few lymphocytes present in the lymph nodes. The thymus was hypoplastic and exhibited an abnormal distribution of epithelial cells. Patients also had profound disruption of the epithelial barrier along the entire gastrointestinal tract. Using linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing, we identified 10 mutations in tetratricopeptide repeat domainâ€“7A (TTC7A), all of which potentially abrogate TTC7A expression. Intestinal organoid cultures from patient biopsies displayed an inversion of apicobasal polarity of the epithelial cells that was normalized by pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase. Our data indicate that TTC7A deficiency results in increased Rho kinase activity, which disrupts polarity, growth, and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, and which impairs immune cell homeostasis, thereby promoting MIA-CID development.","dc:creator":"Bigorgne AE","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"TTC7A mutations disrupt intestinal epithelial apicobasal

However, clues to related underlying molecular dysfunctions remain elusive. It is now shown based on the study of TTC7A-deficient and wild-type cells that TTC7A is an essential nuclear protein. It binds to chromatin, preferentially at actively transcribed regions. Its depletion results in broad range of epigenomic changes at proximal and distal transcriptional regulatory elements and in altered control of the transcriptional program. Loss of WT_TTC7A induces general decrease in chromatin compaction, unbalanced cellular distribution of histones, higher nucleosome accessibility to nuclease digestion along with genome instability, and reduced cell viability. Our observations characterize for the first time unreported functions for TTC7A in the nucleus that exert a critical role in chromatin organization and gene regulation to safeguard healthy immune and intestinal status.","dc:creator":"El-Daher MT","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A is a nuclear factor that modulates transcription and chromatin structure."},"rdfs:label":"Activation induced cell death"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This paper shows that TTC7A is important of chromatin structure and nuclear organization.

TTC7A deficiency is associated with an immunodeficiency primarily characterized by T and B cell lymphopenia, very low immunoglobulin levels and variable numbers of intestinal atresias effecting the small and/or large bowel. The reported severity of immunodeficiency is variable and is likely due to the residual activity of TTC7A protein product. There have also been reports of TTC7A variants associated with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Over 52 variants have been reported and are predominantly composed of frameshift indels, nonsense and variants in splice sites resulting in loss of exons. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. 21 unique variants from 15 probands across 5 publications were curated (PMID:23830146, 25174867, 29174094, 23423984, 24292712). Heterozygous carriers have not been shown to have a clinical phenotype. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (12 pts).\n\nExperimentally, in vitro studies primarily use patient derived cells to support this gene-disease relationship for the immunodeficiency component of CID-MIA. Many of the published studies perform mechanistic analysis on enterocytes and are not reviewed here. Pertaining to the immune phenotype of CID-MIA, the TTC7A protein has been shown to be expressed in thymic tissue and lymphoblasts derived from patients (PMID: 23820146, 25174867). As well, functional data has demonstrated T cell from affected patients show impaired proliferation, cytoskeletal defects and increased activation induced cell death (PMID: 25174867, 25745186, 30455981). Mouse models of TTC7A deficiency replicate decreased thymus size and lymphocytopenia, do not phenocopy atresias seen in humans, and show alterations in iron metabolism not noted in human studies (PMID: 7579418, 16093647). This may imply differences in functionality between mouse and human orthologs. Mechanistically, TTC7A has been implicated in cytoskeletal dynamics, generation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate on the inner plasma membrane, as well as regulator of chromatin structure and nuclear organization. However, there is no consensus as to how TTC7A causes immunodeficiency seen in CID-MIA patients. In summary, TTC7A is strongly associated with CID-MIA. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 8/19/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:80cadac5-067c-49e7-a021-ee4eec83984a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
