We have ascertained nine consanguineous families with primary microcephaly from India. To establish linkage of these nine families to known MCPH loci, microsatellite markers were selected from the candidate regions of each of the six known MCPH loci and used to genotype the families. The results were suggestive of linkage of three families to the MCPH5 locus and one family to the MCPH2 locus. The remaining five families were not linked to any of the known loci. DNA-sequence analysis identified one known (Arg117X) and two novel (Trp1326X and Gln3060X) mutations in the three MCPH5-linked families in a homozygous state.

Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with genetic heterogeneity, the ASPM locus being most common. Postnatal imaging data are scarce and prenatal imaging unreported. Microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern shares features with primary microcephaly, but it is not clear whether these disorders are part of a phenotypic continuum. We examined a consanguineous family with a daughter affected with primary microcephaly and an ongoing pregnancy. We performed prenatal and postnatal brain magnetic resonance imaging and genetic analyses in the course of genetic evaluation. The affected daughter and the fetus were homozygous for polymorphic markers linked to the ASPM locus, and we identified a novel, truncating ASPM mutation by direct sequencing of the gene. Imaging at 30 and 35 gestational weeks showed microcephaly with simplified gyration, more severe anteriorly. The antero-posterior gradient of gyration persisted 1 week after birth. Brain imaging in the affected sister also showed some degree of a predominantly anterior simplification of gyration. Our data suggest that one form of autosomal recessive microcephaly is allelic to at least a subset of microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern, and that the neuronal depletion associated with the ASPM defect predominantly affects the anterior cortex.","dc:creator":"Desir J","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Primary microcephaly with ASPM mutation shows simplified cortical gyration with antero-posterior gradient pre- and post-natally."}},"rdfs:label":"p.Thr1399AsnfsTer20"},{"id":"cggv:c3b78ce8-04f6-4d4b-95b9-3983d69bcf8b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3b78ce8-04f6-4d4b-95b9-3983d69bcf8b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading for consanguinity/homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9910650f-00ac-48c2-8475-dcfb30fd1335_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9910650f-00ac-48c2-8475-dcfb30fd1335","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2c1145e3-50fb-4dc9-8c40-69d9084e7f48","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018136.5(ASPM):c.3978G>A (p.Trp1326Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340327"}},"detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis done on candidate regions of MCPH1-6","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"severe microcephaly (head circumference 11 SD below mean); narrow bifrontal diameter; limited speaking ability (short sentences); partial occupational independence; unable to read and write","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0033695","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0000340","obo:HP_0100716","obo:HP_0000752"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b8105d1d-9eea-42e3-8973-18bbc2867d0d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2c1145e3-50fb-4dc9-8c40-69d9084e7f48"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15355437"},"rdfs:label":"p.Trp1326Ter (homozyg.)"},{"id":"cggv:b8105d1d-9eea-42e3-8973-18bbc2867d0d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b8105d1d-9eea-42e3-8973-18bbc2867d0d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading due to homozygosity/consanguinity.

Humans with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) show a small but otherwise grossly normal cerebral cortex associated with mild to moderate mental retardation. Genes linked to this condition offer potential insights into the development and evolution of the cerebral cortex. Here we show that the most common cause of MCPH is homozygous mutation of ASPM, the human ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster abnormal spindle gene (asp), which is essential for normal mitotic spindle function in embryonic neuroblasts. The mouse gene Aspm is expressed specifically in the primary sites of prenatal cerebral cortical neurogenesis. Notably, the predicted ASPM proteins encode systematically larger numbers of repeated 'IQ' domains between flies, mice and humans, with the predominant difference between Aspm and ASPM being a single large insertion coding for IQ domains. Our results and evolutionary considerations suggest that brain size is controlled in part through modulation of mitotic spindle activity in neuronal progenitor cells.","dc:creator":"Bond J","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"ASPM is a major determinant of cerebral cortical size."}},"rdfs:label":"p.Gln421fs "},{"id":"cggv:bb99b557-cf24-4e27-a8ca-9a9424325762","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb99b557-cf24-4e27-a8ca-9a9424325762_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading due to homozygosity/consanguinity.

They also suggest that low birth weight may be a feature of MCPH, a finding that needs confirmation, and confirm that ASPM mutations are associated with simplified cortical gyration.","dc:creator":"Saadi A","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Compound heterozygous ASPM mutations associated with microcephaly and simplified cortical gyration in a consanguineous Algerian family."}},{"id":"cggv:ad8e59c0-891f-424a-aba8-33c129313bd8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bbf9c68a-d2a0-497b-bb76-5ba09a10974d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19332161"}],"rdfs:label":"comp. het. for p.Arg797Ter and p.Lys2595fs in trans"},{"id":"cggv:ad8e59c0-891f-424a-aba8-33c129313bd8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad8e59c0-891f-424a-aba8-33c129313bd8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d3652d07-eaa4-4887-8924-112a45804465","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d3652d07-eaa4-4887-8924-112a45804465_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:725d1ea6-12ae-4ef8-b556-354079bda916_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:725d1ea6-12ae-4ef8-b556-354079bda916","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:771344b3-1114-4bbc-9dc9-91e657a2de0c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018136.5(ASPM):c.719_720del (p.Ser240CysfsTer16)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340321"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"head circumference 4+ SD below mean","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000252","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:7cfc1666-38ae-4c28-8f95-f0f92c22ba69_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:771344b3-1114-4bbc-9dc9-91e657a2de0c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12355089"},"rdfs:label":"p.Ser240fs "},{"id":"cggv:7cfc1666-38ae-4c28-8f95-f0f92c22ba69","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7cfc1666-38ae-4c28-8f95-f0f92c22ba69_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgrading for homozygosity/consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:41e82e1a-528f-48ee-9e07-22865077f61d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41e82e1a-528f-48ee-9e07-22865077f61d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:504f4fee-28a6-4347-8bf8-503364eeb240","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be4d43a2-139d-4593-87e3-679b95d90279","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"HT1080 cells (epithelial cells from patients with fibrosarcoma but normal ASPM) were studied.

The predicted gene product contains two putative N-terminal calponin-homology (CH) domains and a block of putative calmodulin-binding IQ domains common in actin binding cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. Previous studies in mouse suggest that ASPM is preferentially expressed in the developing brain. Our analyses reveal that ASPM is widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues and upregulated in malignant cells. Several alternatively spliced variants encoding putative ASPM isoforms with different numbers of IQ motifs were identified. The major ASPM transcript contains 81 IQ domains, most of which are organized into a higher order repeat (HOR) structure. Another prominent spliced form contains an in-frame deletion of exon 18 and encodes 14 IQ domains not organized into a HOR. This variant is conserved in mouse. Other spliced variants lacking both CH domains and a part of the IQ motifs were also detected, suggesting the existence of isoforms with potentially different functions. To elucidate the biochemical function of human ASPM, we developed peptide specific antibodies to the N- and C-termini of ASPM. In a western analysis of proteins from cultured human and mouse cells, the antibodies detected bands with mobilities corresponding to the predicted ASPM isoforms. Immunostaining of cultured human cells with antibodies revealed that ASPM is localized in the spindle poles during mitosis. This finding suggests that MCPH is the consequence of an impairment in mitotic spindle regulation in cortical progenitors due to mutations in ASPM.","dc:creator":"Kouprina N","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"The microcephaly ASPM gene is expressed in proliferating tissues and encodes for a mitotic spindle protein."},"rdfs:label":"HT1080 Expression analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:41e82e1a-528f-48ee-9e07-22865077f61d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47edeae3-54b5-4ae4-9eb5-49dacf037544","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a27e0094-8ac9-4037-ab3d-8a877f4cb664","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The microcephaly and brain anomalies seen in mice reflect the anomalies seen in humans.

Wild-type cells in telophase exhibit ASPM immunoreactivity in the midbody region, which was decreased in the 1-25 mutants and absent in the 1-7 mutants.

The function of the Aspm protein in neural progenitor cell expansion, as well as its localization to the mitotic spindle and midbody, suggest that it regulates brain development by a cell division-related mechanism. Furthermore, evidence that positive selection affected ASPM during primate evolution has led to suggestions that such a function changed during primate evolution. Here, we report that in Aspm mutant mice, truncated Aspm proteins similar to those causing microcephaly in humans fail to localize to the midbody during M-phase and cause mild microcephaly. A human ASPM transgene rescues this phenotype but, interestingly, does not cause a gain of function. Strikingly, truncated Aspm proteins also cause a massive loss of germ cells, resulting in a severe reduction in testis and ovary size accompanied by reduced fertility. These germline effects, too, are fully rescued by the human ASPM transgene, indicating that ASPM is functionally similar in mice and humans. Our findings broaden the spectrum of phenotypic effects of ASPM mutations and raise the possibility that positive selection of ASPM during primate evolution reflects its function in the germline.","dc:creator":"Pulvers JN","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in mouse Aspm (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) cause not only microcephaly but also major defects in the germline."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Upgraded as two different mutant lines were analyzed (one had a 7 exon-long gene, and the other a 25 exon-long gene).
