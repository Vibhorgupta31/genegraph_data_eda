Combination of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequence analysis allowed us to show that a 4-bp deletion in intron 2 (IVS2+5_+8delGTAA) of the NDUFV2 gene (encoding NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2) causes complex I deficiency and early onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with trunk hypotonia in three affected sibs of a consanguineous family. The homozygous mutation altering the consensus splice-donor site of exon 2 resulted in 70% decreased NDUFV2 protein and complex I deficiency. While mutation in a number of genes encoding complex I subunits essentially result in neurological symptoms, this first mutation in NDUFV2 is strikingly associated with cardiomyopathy, as previously observed in the unique case of NDFUS2 mutations.","dc:creator":"Bénit P","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutant NDUFV2 subunit of mitochondrial complex I causes early onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a5b5d66-4640-48a8-ac99-842593bac366_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a5b5d66-4640-48a8-ac99-842593bac366_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:cdd11c0a-d04f-4ecf-ac62-55a3163f29ec_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cdd11c0a-d04f-4ecf-ac62-55a3163f29ec","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":9,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:e3a0e643-3324-4f8d-94d2-91a06e9e3e91","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021074.5(NDUFV2):c.427C>T (p.Arg143Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8887215"}},{"id":"cggv:9387f589-dc84-46a1-a8cd-5be6e48e1e53","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021074.5(NDUFV2):c.580G>A (p.Glu194Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA401858014"}}],"detectionMethod":"genome screening","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Leigh syndrome (diagnosed using criteria defined by Rahman)\nComplex I deficiency\nDevelopmental delay\nMRI) revealed high intensities in the brain stem (pons)\nBlood lactate and pyruvate were increased (7.23 and 0.26mmol/L; normal range <1.8 and <0.1mmol/L),\n","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:eaaba60c-d0cd-450a-9b7b-c4697f3d0c2a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9387f589-dc84-46a1-a8cd-5be6e48e1e53"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28429146","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of infancy and early childhood. It is clinically diagnosed by typical manifestations and characteristic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Unravelling mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) dysfunction behind LS is essential for deeper understanding of the disease, which may lead to the development of new therapies and cure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical validity of various diagnostic tools in confirming MRC disorder in LS and Leigh-like syndrome (LL). The results of enzyme assays, molecular analysis, and cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements were examined. Of 106 patients, 41 were biochemically and genetically verified, and 34 had reduced MRC activity but no causative mutations. Seven patients with normal MRC complex activities had mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene. Five further patients with normal activity in MRC were identified with causative mutations. Conversely, 12 out of 60 enzyme assays performed for genetically verified patients returned normal results. No biochemical or genetic background was confirmed for 19 patients. OCR was reduced in ten out of 19 patients with negative enzyme assay results. Inconsistent enzyme assay results between fibroblast and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were observed in 33% of 37 simultaneously analyzed cases. These data suggest that highest diagnostic rate is reached using a combined enzymatic and genetic approach, analyzing more than one type of biological materials where suitable. Microscale oxygraphy detected MRC impairment in 50% cases with no defect in MRC complex activities.","dc:creator":"Ogawa E","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Clinical validity of biochemical and molecular analysis in diagnosing Leigh syndrome: a study of 106 Japanese patients."}},{"id":"cggv:ead5b291-e441-43d1-b77d-af00ed8256f5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e3a0e643-3324-4f8d-94d2-91a06e9e3e91"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28429146"}],"rdfs:label":"Ogawa 2017 Pt1177"},{"id":"cggv:eaaba60c-d0cd-450a-9b7b-c4697f3d0c2a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eaaba60c-d0cd-450a-9b7b-c4697f3d0c2a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:eaaba60c-d0cd-450a-9b7b-c4697f3d0c2a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"reported in CH state in a second proband from Japan in PMID: 34405929 Kishita et al. 2021\n"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Missense without impact"},{"id":"cggv:ead5b291-e441-43d1-b77d-af00ed8256f5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ead5b291-e441-43d1-b77d-af00ed8256f5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ead5b291-e441-43d1-b77d-af00ed8256f5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"exon 5/8"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"LOF NMD expected 1.5 pt\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:84b1eefd-65f0-4bdb-8a9f-c502c8cdf953_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84b1eefd-65f0-4bdb-8a9f-c502c8cdf953","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:80d2c1b2-6da2-4c40-bbd7-dc826e18bb8a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021074.5(NDUFV2):c.120+5_120+8del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8887112"}},"detectionMethod":"DHPLC used to r/o: NDUFV1, NDUFS8, NDUFS7, NDUFB6, NDUFA8, NDUFS1, NDUFS2\n","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Denaturing gradient gel","phenotypeFreeText":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and truncal hypotonia.

We observed five different consequences: (i) individuals with MGVs presenting as blended phenotypes (ii) individuals with MGVs presenting with distinct phenotypes (iii) individuals with MGVs with age-dependent penetrance (iv) individuals with MGVs with one phenotype obscured by another more predominant phenotype (v) two distinct phenotypes in different individuals in families with MGVs. Consanguinity was present in eight (8/14, 57.1%) of them. Thirteen families had two Mendelian disorders and one had three Mendelian disorders. The risk of recurrence of one or more conditions in these families ranged from 25% to 75%.

However, pathogenic variants in some of these genes can lead to clinical manifestations which overlap with other neuromuscular diseases, which can be caused by pathogenic variants in non-mitochondrial genes as well. Mitochondrial pathogenic variants can be found in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or in any of the 1,500 nuclear genes with a mitochondrial function. We have performed a two-step next-generation sequencing approach in a cohort of 117 patients, mostly children, in whom a mitochondrial disease-cause could likely or possibly explain the phenotype. A total of 86 patients had a mitochondrial disorder, according to established clinical and biochemical criteria. The other 31 patients had neuromuscular symptoms, where in a minority a mitochondrial genetic cause is present, but a non-mitochondrial genetic cause is more likely. All patients were screened for pathogenic variants in the mtDNA and, if excluded, analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). Variants were filtered for being pathogenic and compatible with an autosomal or X-linked recessive mode of inheritance in families with multiple affected siblings and/or consanguineous parents. Non-consanguineous families with a single patient were additionally screened for autosomal and X-linked dominant mutations in a predefined gene-set. We identified causative pathogenic variants in the mtDNA in 20% of the patient-cohort, and in nuclear genes in 49%, implying an overall yield of 68%. We identified pathogenic variants in mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial genes in both groups with, obviously, a higher number of mitochondrial genes affected in mitochondrial disease patients. Furthermore, we show that 31% of the disease-causing genes in the mitochondrial patient group were not included in the MitoCarta database, and therefore would have been missed with MitoCarta based gene-panels. We conclude that WES is preferable to panel-based approaches for both groups of patients, as the mitochondrial gene-list is not complete and mitochondrial symptoms can be secondary. Also, clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders would require sequential use of multiple different gene panels. We conclude that WES is a comprehensive and unbiased approach to establish a genetic diagnosis in these patients, able to resolve multi-genic disease-causes.","dc:creator":"Theunissen TEJ","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Whole Exome Sequencing Is the Preferred Strategy to Identify the Genetic Defect in Patients With a Probable or Possible Mitochondrial Cause."}},"rdfs:label":"Theunissen 2018 Paediatric patient"},{"id":"cggv:058e82b7-7501-4dce-84b0-da673a75f6d7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:058e82b7-7501-4dce-84b0-da673a75f6d7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:058e82b7-7501-4dce-84b0-da673a75f6d7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"see 33811136: Lui et al. 2022 rescue in patient fibroblasts\n"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"missense with impact support"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8481e36a-e464-4a3e-a770-29edb3731ec2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8481e36a-e464-4a3e-a770-29edb3731ec2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:16f8f201-c016-4b1e-b81f-48351dba0a1f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021074.5(NDUFV2):c.404G>C (p.Cys135Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA402024406"}},{"id":"cggv:a6faa758-2223-4a61-b6e0-9e21052f487e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021074.5(NDUFV2):c.467T>A (p.Leu156His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA402024539"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Developmental arrest/delay from 4 months, hypertonia of both lower extremities.\nNormal lactate \nMRI showed a characteristic pattern of cystic changes in the deep\nperiventricular white matter.

We used a rapid method to screen patients with isolated complex I deficiencies for nuclear genes mutations by Surveyor nuclease digestion of cDNAs. Eight complex I nuclear genes, among the most frequently mutated (NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS4, NDUFS7, NDUFS8, NDUFV1 and NDUFV2), were studied in 22 cDNA fragments spanning their coding sequences in 8 patients with a biochemically proved complex I deficiency. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and missense mutations were detected in 18.7% of the cDNA fragments by Surveyor nuclease treatment. Molecular defects were detected in 3 patients. Surveyor nuclease screening is a reliable method for genotyping nuclear complex I deficiencies, easy to interpret, and limits the number of sequence reactions.

The *NDUFV2* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) flavoprotein 2, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*NDUFV2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2003 (PMID: 12754703), in a proband with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy, feeding difficulty, and growth failure who died at three months of age. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFV2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFV2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFV2* was previously curated by this GCEP on November 20, 2019 (SOP Version 7) as having a Limited association with Leigh Syndrome Spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.   \n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *NDUFV2* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes nine unique variants in ten probands from nine publications (PMIDs: 12754703, 19167255, 26008862, 33811136, 34405929, 28429146, 30369941, 34276053, 30831263).

Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of generally severe disease which includes LSS. Clinical features include developmental regression, seizures, progressive spasticity, microcephaly, hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, optic atrophy, feeding difficulty, and failure to thrive. The age of onset ranges from birth to early infancy. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and a C. elegans model system (PMIDs: 33340416. 19672299). \n\nIn summary, there is Definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
