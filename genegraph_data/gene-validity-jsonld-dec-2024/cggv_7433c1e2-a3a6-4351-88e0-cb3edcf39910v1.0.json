Mutations at p cause a reduction of eumelanin (black-brown) pigment and altered morphology of black pigment granules (eumelanosomes), but have little effect on pheomelanin (yellow-red) pigment. We show here that the human complementary DNA DN10, linked to the p locus in mice, identifies the human homologue (P) of the mouse p gene, and appears to encode an integral membrane transporter protein. The expression pattern of this gene in various p mutant mice correlates with the pigmentation phenotype; moreover, an abnormally sized messenger RNA is detected in one mutant, p(un), which reverts to the normal size in p(un) revertants. The human P gene corresponds to the D15S12 locus within the chromosome segment 15q11-q13, which is typically deleted in patients with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome (see ref. 5 for review). These disorders are phenotypically distinct, depending on the parent of origin of the deleted chromosome, but both syndromes are often associated with hypopigmentation of the skin, hair and eyes (see ref. 8 for review), and deletion of the P gene may be responsible for this hypopigmentation. In addition, we report a mutation in both copies of the human P gene in one case of tyrosinase-positive (type II) oculocutaneous albinism, recently linked to 15q11-q13 (ref. 9).","dc:creator":"Rinchik EM","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"A gene for the mouse pink-eyed dilution locus and for human type II oculocutaneous albinism."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d18a188c-5789-4be5-9012-b7793aa4387b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d18a188c-5789-4be5-9012-b7793aa4387b","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:fede5da4-4778-4652-900d-bdd1239b4018","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000015.10:g.27966689C>T (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA391356942"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:24224f20-e074-4b94-881c-036a9d975111_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fede5da4-4778-4652-900d-bdd1239b4018"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29345414","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Albinism is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by variable degrees of hypopigmentation and by nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia, and chiasmatic misrouting of the optic nerves.

To obtain a precise diagnosis, we screened the 19 known albinism genes in 990 index patients using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization. A molecular diagnosis was obtained in 72.32% of patients. A total of 243 new pathogenic variants were identified. Intragenic rearrangements represented 10.8% of all pathogenic alleles. NGS panel analysis allowed establishing a diagnosis for the rarest forms of the disease, which could not be diagnosed otherwise.

albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous recessive disorder with hypopigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes. At least 16 genes have been identified as causative genes for human OCA. No comprehensive analysis has been conducted to study the spectral distribution of OCA in Chinese patients. We screened 127 unrelated and unselected Chinese OCA patients for mutations in the TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2, and HPS1 genes. We found that the spectrum of mutational genes and alleles of OCA is population specific. OCA1 is the most common (70.1% of cases) form of Chinese OCA, whereas OCA2, OCA4, and HPS1 account for 10.2%, 12.6%, and 1.6%, respectively. No apparent pathological mutation of TYRP1 has been found. Thirty-eight previously unreported mutational alleles were identified from these OCA patients and were not found in 100 nonalbinism subjects. Of the TYR mutational alleles, 81.1% were clustered on exons 1 and 2. Ten common alleles account for 74.6% of the mutational TYR alleles in Chinese OCA1 patients. The p.D160H allele accounts for 55.6% of the mutational SLC45A2 alleles in Chinese OCA4 patients. These results provide useful information for the establishment of an optimized strategy of gene diagnosis and genetic counseling of Chinese OCA patients.","dc:creator":"Wei

OCA2 is about twice as common as OCA1 in African and African-American populations. We now describe an interstitial deletion that removes a single exon of the P gene. In a large family from an inbred population of tri-racial origin, all individuals with OCA2 were found to be homozygous for this allele. Moreover, the same mutant P allele was detected in several unrelated African American individuals with OCA2, but not in Caucasians with OCA2. The detection of the same allele in two unrelated Africans with OCA2 indicates an African origin for this allele.","dc:creator":"Durham-Pierre D","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"African origin of an intragenic deletion of the human P gene in tyrosinase positive oculocutaneous albinism."}},"rdfs:label":"CL"},{"id":"cggv:6196008a-97da-4019-bb9d-08f3e9fb0037","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6196008a-97da-4019-bb9d-08f3e9fb0037_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Per the Gene Curation SOP, two LOF variants could score up to 3 points.

We generated WES data for probands and family members and vetted variants through rephenotyping, segregation analyses, and population studies.ResultsThe most common presentation was neurological disease (64%). Seven (9%) probands were diagnosed by CMA. Family WES data were informative for 37 (51%) of the 72 remaining individuals, yielding a specific genetic diagnosis (n = 32) or revealing a novel molecular etiology (n = 5). For five (7%) additional subjects, negative WES decreased the likelihood of genetic disease. Compared to trio analysis, \"family\" WES (average seven exomes per proband) reduced filtered candidate variants from 22 ± 6 to 5 ± 3 per proband. Nineteen (51%) alleles were de novo and 17 (46%) inherited; the latter added to a population-based diagnostic panel. We found actionable secondary variants in 21 (4.2%) of 502 subjects, all of whom opted to be informed.ConclusionCMA and family-based WES streamline and economize diagnosis of rare genetic disorders, accelerate novel gene discovery, and create new opportunities for community-based screening and prevention in underserved populations.","dc:creator":"Strauss KA","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Genomic diagnostics within a medically underserved population: efficacy and implications."}},{"id":"cggv:013aacc2-c30c-451b-bc8a-beb6b3f00891_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:35b14d3b-e258-4503-899b-8570e4e6a39b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28726809"}],"rdfs:label":"Proband no. 34"},{"id":"cggv:013aacc2-c30c-451b-bc8a-beb6b3f00891","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:013aacc2-c30c-451b-bc8a-beb6b3f00891_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:e5adec37-276e-482c-acf6-e4bf27cde246","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5adec37-276e-482c-acf6-e4bf27cde246_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:59445978-b286-4079-9015-f3c98c7233cb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59445978-b286-4079-9015-f3c98c7233cb","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:b0d807c9-f342-47bf-9cf5-89ddc76598f8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000275.3(OCA2):c.1432G>A (p.Gly478Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA391359506"}},{"id":"cggv:c4f4a82e-93cc-4ec0-8d4d-9a6621919160","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000275.3(OCA2):c.287A>C (p.Glu96Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7439528"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:4f1037ee-8193-42c1-9735-dcefdc64462f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b0d807c9-f342-47bf-9cf5-89ddc76598f8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29345414"},{"id":"cggv:def7570e-ffab-4889-b3df-4399057b7606_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c4f4a82e-93cc-4ec0-8d4d-9a6621919160"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29345414"}],"rdfs:label":"P200"},{"id":"cggv:4f1037ee-8193-42c1-9735-dcefdc64462f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f1037ee-8193-42c1-9735-dcefdc64462f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:def7570e-ffab-4889-b3df-4399057b7606","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:def7570e-ffab-4889-b3df-4399057b7606_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7df5c383-8d51-42fd-9a5c-e190146a61ea_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7df5c383-8d51-42fd-9a5c-e190146a61ea","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:0efd0810-2ef4-40da-8dce-9b4ae8b606e2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000275.3(OCA2):c.1182+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7439180"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:dd4ed316-5469-49dd-8314-2233786f27ca_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0efd0810-2ef4-40da-8dce-9b4ae8b606e2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29345414"},"rdfs:label":"P121"},{"id":"cggv:dd4ed316-5469-49dd-8314-2233786f27ca","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd4ed316-5469-49dd-8314-2233786f27ca_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Per the Gene Curation SOP, two LOF variants could score up to 3 points.

The prevalence of all forms of albinism varies considerably worldwide and has been estimated at approximately 1/17,000, suggesting that about 1 in 70 people carry a gene for OCA. The clinical spectrum of OCA ranges, with OCA1A being the most severe type with a complete lack of melanin production throughout life, while the milder forms OCA1B, OCA2, OCA3 and OCA4 show some pigment accumulation over time. Clinical manifestations include various degrees of congenital nystagmus, iris hypopigmentation and translucency, reduced pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, foveal hypoplasia, reduced visual acuity usually (20/60 to 20/400) and refractive errors, color vision impairment and prominent photophobia. Misrouting of the optic nerves is a characteristic finding, resulting in strabismus and reduced stereoscopic vision. The degree of skin and hair hypopigmentation varies with the type of OCA. The incidence of skin cancer may be increased. All four types of OCA are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. At least four genes are responsible for the different types of the disease (TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 and MATP). Diagnosis is based on clinical findings of hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, in addition to the characteristic ocular symptoms. Due to the clinical overlap between the OCA forms, molecular diagnosis is necessary to establish the gene defect and OCA subtype. Molecular genetic testing of TYR and OCA2 is available on a clinical basis, while, at present, analysis of TYRP1 and MATP is on research basis only. Differential diagnosis includes ocular albinism, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome, and Waardenburg syndrome type II. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are possible when the disease causing mutations have been identified in the family. Glasses (possibly bifocals) and dark glasses or photocromic lenses may offer sufficient help for reduced visual activity and photophobia. Correction of strabismus and nystagmus is necessary and sunscreens are recommended. Regular skin checks for early detection of skin cancer should be offered.

The characterization of a nested set of deletions around p will facilitate detailed molecular analyses of the genes and developmental functions associated with this part of the mouse genome.","dc:creator":"Lyon MF","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Genetic and molecular analysis of recessive alleles at the pink-eyed dilution (p) locus of the mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Complementation Analysis of Twenty p Alleles"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This evidence along with experimental evidence published by Rinchik et al., 1993 (PMID:8421497) and Gardner et al., 1992 (PMID:1509264) will be combined together for a total score of 2 points."},{"id":"cggv:c233d76c-6d9a-4357-84b4-b3de9fb8a32f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b9417852-6005-4c85-aa3f-3d9ff65cd6e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Wu et al identified 6 rhesus macaques with features of albinism including pink skin, red hair, horizontal nystagmus, a difference in the iris pigmentation between affected vs controls, extensive hypopigmentation and absence of foveal centralis, and a loss of pigmentation in the choroid vasculature. The authors pointed out that the rhesus model more closely recapitulates some of the eye phenotypes observed in humans, as they have a fovea in which hypopigmentation and/or absence can be observed, where other animal models do not. The authors first examined melanin formation in HEK293T cells following OCA2 knockdown using shRNA and the co-transfection with both wild type TYR with and without either wild type OCA2 or mutant OCA2. No pigmentation was observed in the OCA2 silenced HEK293T cells overexpressing wild type TYR alone. The simulatneous overexpression of wild type OCA2 and wild type TYR resulted in apparent pigmentation. However, the co-transfection of mutant OCA3 and wild type TYR led to significant depigmentation and reduced melanin production. This demonstrated that the OCA2 variant identified in the 6 rhesus monkeys could biologically affect melanin production.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259106","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Human visual acuity is anatomically determined by the retinal fovea. The ontogenetic development of the fovea can be seriously hindered by oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), which is characterized by a disorder of melanin synthesis. Although people of all ethnic backgrounds can be affected, no efficient treatments for OCA have been developed thus far, due partly to the lack of effective animal models. Rhesus macaques are genetically homologous to humans and, most importantly, exhibit structures of the macula and fovea that are similar to those of humans; thus, rhesus macaques present special advantages in the modeling and study of human macular and foveal diseases. In this study, we identified rhesus macaque models with clinical characteristics consistent with those of OCA patients according to observations of ocular behavior, fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography.

Combined linkage and homozygosity analysis based on a fully penetrant monogenic autosomal recessive mode of inheritance identified a critical interval of 15 Mb on chromosome 3. We obtained whole genome sequence data from one affected dog, three wolves, and 188 control dogs. Filtering for private variants revealed a single variant with predicted high impact in the critical interval in LOC100855460 (XM_005618224.1:c.377+2T>G LT844587.1:c.-45+2T>G). The variant perfectly co-segregated with the phenotype in the family. We genotyped 181 control dogs with normal pigmentation from diverse breeds including 22 unrelated German Spitz dogs, which were all homozygous wildtype. Comparative sequence analyses revealed that LOC100855460 actually represents the 5'-end of the canine OCA2 gene. The CanFam 3.1 reference genome assembly is incorrect and separates the first two exons from the remaining exons of the OCA2 gene. We amplified a canine OCA2 cDNA fragment by RT-PCR and determined the correct full-length mRNA sequence (LT844587.1). Variants in the OCA2 gene cause oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in humans, pink-eyed dilution in mice, and similar phenotypes in corn snakes, medaka and Mexican cave tetra fish. We therefore conclude that the observed oculocutaneous albinism in German Spitz is most likely caused by the identified variant in the 5'-splice site of the first intron of the canine OCA2 gene.","dc:creator":"Caduff M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"OCA2 splice site variant in German Spitz dogs with oculocutaneous albinism."},"rdfs:label":"German Spitz Dog"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"No functional evidence was provided demonstrated that this variant had an effect on the protein product."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3673,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:a7f3c287-9e76-42db-bc2d-58d16d8044c8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008746","gene":"hgnc:8101","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders in which the biosynthesis of melanin pigment is reduced in the skin, hair, and eyes. Phenotypes associated include iris hypopigmentation, reduction in hair, skin, and eye pigment, abnormality of the optic nerve, nystagmus, photophobia, strabismus, and visual impairment (PMID:17980020). OCA is further broken down by type based on phenotypic differences. Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 is less severe than type 1 with skin and hair pigmentation ranging from minimal to near normal. Variants in OCA2 were first reported in relation to OCA2 in 1993 by Rinchik et al (PMID:8421497). Variants in OCA2 account for approximately 30% of worldwide cases of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (at least 154 unique variants have been reported) (PMID:32963319). Evidence from 26 probands in 7 publications have been included in this curation, representing 31 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) (PMIDs:115712365, 1906277, 33612058, 19865097, 28726809, 29345414, 33808351). Of note, the most common OCA2 variant among African individuals with oculocutaneous albinism, previously referred to in the literature as Brown oculocutaneous albinism [MIM:203200], is a 2.7 kb deletion; this variant is thought to account for ~20% of African cases (PMID:21085994). Please note that because the pigmentary phenotype due to pathogenic variants in OCA2 and other OCA genes can appear different in individuals of African descent. Per ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, the General Gene Curation Expert Panel has not identified a difference in phenotypes associated with both disease entities or types of variants associated with either presentation. Therefore, the GCEP has decided to lump this entity into this curation. The gene-disease relationship between oculocutaneous albinism type 2 and OCA2 is supported by evidence for protein interaction in melanocytes between the P protein encoded by OCA2 and both tyrosinase, and tyrosinase related protein 1 (encoded by two other genes, TYR and TYRP1, known to also be associated with oculocutaneous albinism) (PMID:19060277). Additionally, there are multiple animal models available to support this gene-disease relationship, including mice (PMIDs:1495987, 1509264, 8421497), German Spitz dogs (PMID:28973042), and Rhesus macaques (PMID:32259106). In summary there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in OCA2 and oculocutaneous albinism type 2. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/25/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
