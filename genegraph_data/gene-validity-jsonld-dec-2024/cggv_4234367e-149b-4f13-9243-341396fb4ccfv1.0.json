We re-evaluated a large family with acute myeloid leukemia originally seen at NIH in 1969. We used whole exome sequencing to study this family, and conducted in silico bioinformatics analysis, protein structural modeling and laboratory experiments to assess the impact of the identified CEBPA Q311P mutation. Unlike most previously identified germline mutations in CEBPA, which were N-terminal frameshift mutations, we identified a novel Q311P variant that was located in the C-terminal bZip domain of C/EBPα. Protein structural modeling suggested that the Q311P mutation alters the ability of the CEBPA dimer to bind DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the Q311P mu-tant had attenuated binding to DNA, as predicted by the protein modeling. Consistent with these findings, we found that the Q311P mutation has reduced transactivation, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. From 45 years of follow up, we observed incomplete penetrance (46%) of CEBPA Q311P. This study of a large multi-generational pedigree reveals that a germline mutation in the C-terminal bZip domain can alter the ability of C/EBP-α to bind DNA and reduces transactivation, leading to acute myeloid leukemia.","dc:creator":"Pathak A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Whole exome sequencing reveals a C-terminal germline variant in CEBPA-associated acute myeloid leukemia: 45-year follow up of a large family."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26721895","rdfs:label":"Patient IV.4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Protein molecular modeling pointed to preferential P:P (mutant:mutant) dimerization and a decreased ability of the Q311P dimer to bind DNA compared to the wild-type dimer.

We identified 151 (12.8%) patients with CEBPA mutations (91 CEBPA(dm) and 60 CEBPA(sm)). The incidence of germline mutations was 7% (5 of 71), including 3 C-terminal mutations. CEBPA(dm) patients had a lower frequency of concurrent mutations than CEBPA(sm) patients (P < .0001). Both, groups were associated with a favorable outcome compared with CEBPA(wt) (5-year overall survival [OS] 63% and 56% vs 39%; P < .0001 and P = .05, respectively). However, in multivariable analysis only CEBPA(dm) was a prognostic factor for favorable OS outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36, P < .0001; event-free survival, HR 0.41, P < .0001; relapse-free survival, HR 0.55, P = .001).

This study examines the genetic events initiating leukemia and details the clinical progression of disease across multiple families harboring germ-line CEBPA mutations. Clinical data were collected from 10 CEBPA-mutated families, representing 24 members with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whole-exome (WES) and deep sequencing were performed to genetically profile tumors and define patterns of clonal evolution. Germline CEBPA mutations clustered within the N-terminal and were highly penetrant, with AML presenting at a median age of 24.5 years (range, 1.75-46 years). In all diagnostic tumors tested (n = 18), double CEBPA mutations (CEBPAdm) were detected, with acquired (somatic) mutations preferentially targeting the C-terminal. Somatic CEBPA mutations were unstable throughout the disease course, with different mutations identified at recurrence. Deep sequencing of diagnostic and relapse paired samples confirmed that relapse-associated CEBPA mutations were absent at diagnosis, suggesting recurrence was triggered by novel, independent clones. Integrated WES and deep sequencing subsequently revealed an entirely new complement of mutations at relapse, verifying the presentation of a de novo leukemic episode. The cumulative incidence of relapse in familial AML was 56% at 10 years (n = 11), and 3 patients experienced ≥3 disease episodes over a period of 17 to 20 years. Durable responses to secondary therapies were observed, with prolonged median survival after relapse (8 years) and long-term overall survival (10-year overall survival, 67%).

The expression of CEBPa in human myeloid and lymphoid  leukemias, was determined using  cryopreserved marrow or peripheral blood  samples obtained from patients  at diagnosis or relapse  (Table 1). Nine of 10 myeloid leukemias expressed this  transcription   factor, whereas CEBPa was  not detected in any of the seven lymphoid leukemias examined. To determine whether C/EBPa is present in normal myelomonocytic cells, a virtually pure population of developing myeloid cells  was  isolated  from human marrow, extracted, and analyzed for C/EBPa by Western blotting (Fig 3C). CEBPa was detected in these cells.To further examine the lineage-specific  expression of CEBPa, cytospins of human marrow were incubated with either normal  rabbit serum  or C/EBPa antiserum, and bound   antibodies  were detected immunocytochemically (Fig 4a and b).

These studies show a unique temporal pattern of C/EBP isoform expression in the myeloid lineage. In particular, C/EBP alpha expression is very high in proliferative myelomonocytic cells, and diminishes during phenotypic maturation. While we have detected C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta in multiple myeloid leukemia cell lines, and C/EBP alpha in normal myeloid cells and in de novo human myeloid leukemias, we have not detected these C/EBP isoforms in either erythroid or lymphoid cells. Finally, we show that C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta protein and messenger RNA levels correlate in maturing granulocytic cells.

To mimic the most common mutations affecting CEBPA-that is, those leading to loss of the 42 kDa C/EBPalpha isoform (p42) while retaining the 30kDa isoform (p30)-we modified the mouse Cebpa locus to express only p30. p30 supported the formation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. However, p42 was required for control of myeloid progenitor proliferation, and p42-deficient mice developed AML with complete penetrance. p42-deficient leukemia could be transferred by a Mac1+c-Kit+ population that gave rise only to myeloid cells in recipient mice. Expression profiling of this population against normal Mac1+c-Kit+ progenitors revealed a signature shared with MLL-AF9-transformed AML.","dc:creator":"Kirstetter P","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Modeling of C/EBPalpha mutant acute myeloid leukemia reveals a common expression signature of committed myeloid leukemia-initiating cells."},"rdfs:label":"Kirstetter2008"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"To disrupt translation of p42 from the mouse Cebpa gene, a LoxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette site was generated in the Cebpa locus between the p42 and p30 initiation codons.

At least 16 unique variants (primarily frameshift but also missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 21455213, 30563700, 23716546, 21177436, 26162409, 19953636, 18946494, 18768433, 15902292, 15575056, 26721895). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 15 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is primarily through a dominant negative effect. N-terminal frameshift mutations cause truncation of the 42-kD CEBPA protein and overproduction of a 30-kD which functions in a dominant negative fashion (Pabst et al., 2001 PMID: 11242107). A small set of variants have also been identified near the C-terminal end, in the basic leucine zipper region, which is predicted to disrupt the DNA binding and dimerization of CEBPA.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE: 4 points\nThis gene-disease association is supported by functional alteration of its biochemical function, its expression, and animal models. CEBPA functions as a myeloid transcription factor, acting as an important mediator of granulocytic maturation (Wang et al., 1999 PMID: 10397723). This is supported by the expression of CEBPA both in normal development and during malignancy (Scott et al., 1992 PMID: 1391942). This role in granulocytic maturation is disrupted by N-terminal frameshift mutations, as observed in non-patient H1299 cells (Pabst et al., 2008 PMID: 18768433). This is supported by mice carrying engineered Cebpa alleles, that specifically disrupt the 42-kDa wild-type protein while allowing expression of the dominant-negative 30-kDa form, which led to development of AML with complete penetrance (Kirstetter et al., 2008 PMID: 18394553).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4234367e-149b-4f13-9243-341396fb4ccf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
