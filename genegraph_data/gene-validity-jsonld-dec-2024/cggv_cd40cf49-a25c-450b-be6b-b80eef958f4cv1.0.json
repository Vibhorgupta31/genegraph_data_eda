Despite these striking brain malformations, individuals with CMS generally do not present with significant neurodevelopmental abnormalities, except for hearing loss. Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing of DNA from affected individuals in eight families (including the family in the first report of CMS) revealed four molecular variations (two single-base deletions, a nonsense mutation, and a canonical splice-site mutation) in the G protein-signaling modulator 2 gene, GPSM2, that underlie CMS.

GPSM2/LGN, a mitotic spindle-orienting protein associated with deafness in humans, is a PCP effector involved in kinocilium migration. Here, we link human and mouse truncating mutations in the GPSM2/LGN gene, both leading to hearing loss. The human variant, p.(Trp326*), was identified by targeted genomic enrichment of genes associated with deafness, followed by massively parallel sequencing. Lgn (ΔC) mice, with a targeted deletion truncating the C-terminal GoLoco motifs, are profoundly deaf and show misorientation of the hair bundle and severe malformations in stereocilia shape that deteriorates over time. Full-length protein levels are greatly reduced in mutant mice, with upregulated mRNA levels. The truncated Lgn (ΔC) allele is translated in vitro, suggesting that mutant mice may have partially functioning Lgn. Gαi and aPKC, known to function in the same pathway as Lgn, are dependent on Lgn for proper localization. The polarization of core PCP proteins is not affected in Lgn mutants; however, Lgn and Gαi are misoriented in a PCP mutant, supporting the role of Lgn as a PCP effector. The kinocilium, previously shown to be dependent on Lgn for robust localization, is essential for proper localization of Lgn, as well as Gαi and aPKC, suggesting that cilium function plays a role in positioning of apical proteins. Taken together, our data provide a mechanism for the loss of hearing found in human patients with GPSM2/LGN variants.","dc:creator":"Bhonker Y","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"The GPSM2/LGN GoLoco motifs are essential for hearing."},"rdfs:label":"Bhonker Expression 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6caace20-176d-495f-8483-83534626de9c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:99f4cdad-5cbf-405b-88d8-fd6f6e026c29","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunohistochemistry in mice at embryonic day 16.5, p0, p15, and p60 indicated Gpsm2 localization at apical surfaces of hair and supporting cells in the cochlea, utricle, and saccule and cristae at e16.5 and p0.

Here, we show that mutation of the mouse orthologue of GPSM2 affects actin-rich stereocilia elongation in auditory and vestibular hair cells, causing deafness and balance defects. The G-protein subunit Gαi3, a well-documented partner of Gpsm2, participates in the elongation process, and its absence also causes hearing deficits. We show that Gpsm2 defines an ∼200 nm nanodomain at the tips of stereocilia and this localization requires the presence of Gαi3, myosin 15 and whirlin. Using single-molecule tracking, we report that loss of Gpsm2 leads to decreased outgrowth and a disruption of actin dynamics in neuronal growth cones. Our results elucidate the aetiology of CMCS and highlight a new molecular role for Gpsm2/Gαi3 in the regulation of actin dynamics in epithelial and neuronal tissues.","dc:creator":"Mauriac SA","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Defective Gpsm2/Gαi3 signalling disrupts stereocilia development and growth cone actin dynamics in Chudley-McCullough syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Mauriac 2017 Functional Alteration 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:cd40cf49-a25c-450b-be6b-b80eef958f4c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0f67cdf-19fb-4285-ba49-3ebac0273f07","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78dde2b0-807f-45ef-b193-d9edd8c303e4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Homozygous Lgn(dC/dC) mice had profound congenital hearing loss, however analysis of gross brain morphology by MRI did not show other Chudley-McCullough syndrome phenotypes.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26662512","rdfs:label":"Bhonker Mouse Model 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded because the mouse model did not display phenotypes of Chudley-McCullough syndrome."},{"id":"cggv:816ae8f2-a54b-4a85-8ffa-6023377b1200","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da924ed2-20c3-4235-864d-642921f16829","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Measuring of auditory brainstem responses showed Gpsm2 cKOs were profoundly deaf at 6 weeks of age.

Variants in GPSM2 were first reported in\nhumans with this disease as early as 2010 (Walsh et al.). At least 8 nonsense and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 5 publications (23494849, 22578326, 27180139, 20602914, 21348867). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 12 additional family members. Auditory testing and brain scans have lead to the diagnosis of Chudley-McCullough syndrome in each of these patients. This gene-disease association is supported by relevant expression studies and two mouse models. In summary, GPSM2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Chudley-McCullough syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 5/1/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cd40cf49-a25c-450b-be6b-b80eef958f4c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
