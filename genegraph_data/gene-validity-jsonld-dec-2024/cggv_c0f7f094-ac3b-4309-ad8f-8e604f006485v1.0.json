We identified the human orthologue of yeast PEX10 and observed that its expression rescues peroxisomal matrix-protein import in PBD patients' fibroblasts from complementation group 7 (CG7). In addition, we detected mutations on both copies of PEX10 in two unrelated CG7 patients. A Zellweger syndrome patient, PBD100, was homozygous for a splice donor-site mutation that results in exon skipping and loss of 407 bp from the PEX10 open reading frame. A more mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient was a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation in the PEX10 zinc-binding domain, H290Q, and for a nonsense mutation, R125ter. Although all three mutations attenuate PEX10 activity, the two alleles detected in the mildly affected patient, PBD052, encode partially functional PEX10 proteins.

These disorders are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous and are caused by defective peroxisomal protein import and decreased peroxisomal metabolic function. Mutations in PEX10 have been identified in patients from complementation group 7 (CG7) of the PBDs and we report here an analysis of the genotypes and phenotypes of PEX10-deficient patients. All four PEX10-deficient Zellweger Syndrome (ZS) patients were found to have nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations that remove large portions of the PEX10 coding region. In contrast, a more mildly affected PEX10-deficient neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient expressed a PEX10 allele with a missense mutation, H290Q, affecting the C-terminal zinc-binding domain of the PEX10 product. These results support the hypothesis that severe, loss-of-function mutations in PEX genes cause more severe clinical phenotypes, whereas mildly affected PBD patients have PEX gene mutations that retain residual function. To quantitate the effects of the PEX10 mutations identified here and elsewhere we employed a functional complementation assay. Surprisingly, we observed that nonsense and frameshift mutations predicted to delete the C-terminal 2/3 (R125X) or 1/3 (c.704insA) of the protein displayed nearly normal PEX10 activity. Even more surprising, we found that the unexpectedly high PEX10 activity displayed by these cDNAs could be eliminated by removing or mutating segments of the PEX10 cDNA downstream of the mutations. Although these results demonstrate serious flaws in the PEX10 functional complementation assay, they do suggest that the C-terminal zinc-binding domain is critical for PEX10 function.","dc:creator":"Warren DS","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Phenotype-genotype relationships in PEX10-deficient peroxisome biogenesis disorder patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10862081","rdfs:label":"PBD116"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"left at default due to variant evidence: pcDNA3-PEX10/c.814–815delCT plasmids transfected into patient PD100 cells (lack PEX10 activity, PMID: 9683594), resulted in no detected activity from immunofluorescence\n\nabsent in gnomAD"},{"id":"cggv:e7bc13ce-ac99-46ce-870d-72b7e43d56af_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4bb7b1e2-043b-494b-a2ff-6b62deeff5c9","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA isolated from fibroblasts, sequence analysis of RT-PCR products of 6 PEX10 coding exons","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"impaired/abnormal peroxisomal matrix protein import","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:e7bc13ce-ac99-46ce-870d-72b7e43d56af_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:7bf16cf6-bdb6-4e3a-93ef-51a5cb5d7085"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10862081"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10862081","rdfs:label":"PBD121"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"left at default due to variant evidence: pcDNA3-PEX10/c.814–815delCT plasmids transfected into patient PD100 cells (lack PEX10 activity, PMID: 9683594), resulted in no detected activity from immunofluorescence\n\nabsent in gnomAD"},{"id":"cggv:ab5bfa6d-0a89-44be-b26f-24370f6feb21_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8366eb0f-195d-4270-8769-cae3a45c0f73","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":22,"detectionMethod":"PEX Geen Screen (PMID: 15542397), sequence analysis of PEX10 exons 3-5.

In most cases studies in fibroblasts corroborate results obtained in body fluids. In 1996 Clayton and colleagues described a 10-year old girl with evidence of a peroxisome disorder, based on elevated bile acid metabolites and phytanate. At the time it was not possible to distinguish whether she had a ZSD or a single peroxisomal protein defect. Studies in our laboratory showed that she also had elevated plasma pipecolate, supporting the former diagnosis. Despite the abnormal metabolites detected in blood (phytanate, bile acid intermediates and pipecolate), analysis of multiple peroxisomal pathways in fibroblasts yielded normal results. In addition, she had a milder clinical phenotype than usually associated with ZSD. Since complementation analysis to determine the gene defect was not possible, we screened this patient following the PEX Gene Screen algorithm (PGS). The PGS provides a template for sequencing PEX gene exons independent of complementation analysis. Two mutations in PEX10 were identified, a frameshift mutation inherited from her father and a de novo missense mutation in a conserved functional domain on the other allele. This case highlights that molecular analysis may be essential to the diagnosis of patients at the milder end of the ZSD spectrum. Furthermore, it supports the concept that some tissues are less affected by certain PEX gene defects than brain and liver.","dc:creator":"Steinberg SJ","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"A PEX10 defect in a patient with no detectable defect in peroxisome assembly or metabolism in cultured fibroblasts."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19127411","rdfs:label":"PBD687"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Score reduced due to lack of variant evidence for de novo variant \n\np.Leu113Trpfs (absent in gnomAD) reported to be on paternal allele as well as a third variant, NM_153818.1(PEX10):c.880A>G (p.Thr294Ala) (reportedly benign per ClinVar). \n\np.Leu297Pro (absent in gnomAD) was determined to have arisen on the maternal chromosome as a De Novo variant."},{"id":"cggv:4d1d4c41-0c90-438b-9e3c-7cf6c2373f65_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89d43c9d-ce38-4495-bed2-26f9228f5804","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"RNA isolation and RT-PCR of PEX ORF, products were T/A cloned into PCR2.1 and sequenced, variants detected were then examined by restriction digestion of the PCR fragments of PEX10 gene","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"impaired peroxisome protein import","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:4d1d4c41-0c90-438b-9e3c-7cf6c2373f65_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:37c4505f-c2ee-4dad-bfe5-df95e416a925","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153818.1(PEX10):c.930C>G (p.His310Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6771"}},{"id":"cggv:82c0b1ba-639b-4983-917f-4c83e185a565","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153818.1(PEX10):c.373C>T (p.Arg125Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6772"}}],"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9683594"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9683594","rdfs:label":"PBD052"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Scored as zero due to no evidence of variants being in trans"},{"id":"cggv:52e53266-f38b-4d9c-8610-cee5046e1baa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f516eb96-3ade-4742-9e48-8cb8b8690b20","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"PEX10 cDNA isolated from fibroblasts by RT-PCR, sequencing of cDNA clones","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"impaired peroxisome assembly","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Other","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:52e53266-f38b-4d9c-8610-cee5046e1baa_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:97d66cbd-ceac-44d6-b952-2c48f1499924","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153818.1(PEX10):c.874_875delCT (p.Leu292Valfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/296273"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9700193","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD), such as Zellweger syndrome, are autosomal recessive diseases caused by a deficiency in peroxisome assembly as well as a malfunction of the peroxisomes, where at least 10 genotypes have been reported. We have isolated a human PEX10 cDNA (HsPEX10) by an expressed sequence tag homology search on a human DNA database using yeast PEX10 from Hansenula polymorpha, followed by screening of a human liver cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a peroxisomal protein (a peroxin Pex10p) comprising 326 amino acids, with two putative transmembrane segments and a C3HC4zinc finger RING motif. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of Pex10p are exposed to the cytosol, as assessed by an expression study of epitope-tagged Pex10p. HsPEX10 expression morphologically and biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis in fibroblasts from Zellweger patients of complementation group B in Japan (complementation group VII in the USA). One patient (PBDB-01) possessed a homozygous, inactivating mutation, a 2 bp deletion immediately upstream of the RING motif, which resulted in a frameshift, altering 65 amino acids from the normal.

Mutations in human PEX12 result in Zellweger syndrome, a lethal neurological disorder, and implicate the zinc ring domain in PEX12 function. Using two-hybrid studies, blot overlay assays, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we observed that the zinc-binding domain of PEX12 binds both PEX5, the PTS1 receptor, and PEX10, another integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisomal matrix protein import. Furthermore, we identified a patient with a missense mutation in the PEX12 zinc-binding domain, S320F, and observed that this mutation reduces the binding of PEX12 to PEX5 and PEX10. Overexpression of either PEX5 or PEX10 can suppress this PEX12 mutation, providing genetic evidence that these interactions are biologically relevant. PEX5 is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein and previous PEX5-binding proteins have been implicated in docking PEX5 to the peroxisome surface. However, we find that loss of PEX12 or PEX10 does not reduce the association of PEX5 with peroxisomes, demonstrating that these peroxins are not required for receptor docking.

These peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are characterized by defective peroxisomal matrix protein import and comprise at least 10 complementation groups. The genes defective in seven of these groups and more than 90% of PBD patients are now known. Here we examine the distribution of peroxisomal membrane proteins in fibroblasts from PBD patients representing the seven complementation groups for which the mutant gene is known. Peroxisomes were detected in all PBD cells, indicating that the ability to form a minimal peroxisomal structure is not blocked in these mutants. We also observed that peroxisome abundance was reduced fivefold in PBD cells that are defective in the PEX1, PEX5, PEX12, PEX6, PEX10, and PEX2 genes. These cell lines all display a defect in the import of proteins with the type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1). In contrast, peroxisome abundance was unaffected in cells that are mutated in PEX7 and are defective only in the import of proteins with the type-2 peroxisomal targeting signal. Interestingly, a fivefold reduction in peroxisome abundance was also observed for cells lacking either of two PTS1-targeted peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes, acyl-CoA oxidase and 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase/D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. These results indicate that reduced peroxisome abundance in PBD cells may be caused by their inability to import these PTS1-containing enzymes. Furthermore, the fact that peroxisome abundance is influenced by peroxisomal 105-oxidation activities suggests that there may be metabolic control of peroxisome abundance.","dc:creator":"Chang CC","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Metabolic control of peroxisome abundance."},"rdfs:label":"Metabolic Control"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:c0f7f094-ac3b-4309-ad8f-8e604f006485_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2c2e201-5e61-47a0-a44f-813ff80c029a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:335ba58e-fa0b-494f-9bb7-e720079a0d42","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"restoration of peroxisome assembly","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9700193","rdfs:label":"Restoration of peroxisome assembly"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:b93f26df-2793-4f5d-b040-ed0d06bef19e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a563b3c-40d1-4116-b298-ba9e12f464c8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"rescue of both PTS1 and PTS2 peroxisome protein import, selective permeabilization experiments showed punctate distribution of the peroxisomal matrix proteins in the transfected cells is consistent with import into peroxisome lumen","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9683594","rdfs:label":"Indirect Immunofluorescence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:85048c45-9bfd-4a00-be1a-acee87dcd3b2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:636febbd-49f4-49bd-aa0f-69663b09f15d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"peroxisomal matrix protein import restored","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10862081","rdfs:label":"Rescue patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:7e640b1c-f8e9-4177-8f41-77e9d757a141","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db03472c-69b0-41a7-abce-0c4fd9286355","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"gene alteration shown to cause male sterility by impairing spermatogenesis (Fig. 1C) as well as effected spermatocyte growth and cytokinesis (Fig. 2), resulted in defective PTS1 protein import (Fig. 5), and VLCFA accumulation (Fig. 6)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19933170","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Peroxisomes are vital eukaryotic organelles that participate in lipid metabolism, in particular the metabolism of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA).

The way in which peroxisomal dysfunction leads to the pathophysiological consequences of PBD is not well understood. Here we report that Drosophila pex mutants faithfully recapitulate several key features of human PBD, including impaired peroxisomal protein import, elevated VLCFA levels and growth retardation. Moreover, disruption of pex function results in spermatogenesis defects, including spermatocyte cytokinesis failure in Drosophila. Importantly, increased VLCFA levels enhance these spermatogenesis defects whereas reduced VLCFA levels alleviate them. Thus, regulation of proper VLCFA levels by pex genes is crucial for spermatogenesis. Together our study reveals an indispensable function of pex genes during spermatogenesis and provides a causative link between the phenotypic severity of pex mutants and VLCFA levels.","dc:creator":"Chen H","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Drosophila models of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder: peroxins are required for spermatogenesis and very-long-chain fatty acid metabolism."},"rdfs:label":"Drosophila Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":449,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8a370c84-8a1e-4356-90b4-5785f975a293","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019234","gene":"hgnc:8851","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PEX10 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive peroxisomal biogenesis disorder in 1998 (Okumoto et al., PMID: 9700193).
