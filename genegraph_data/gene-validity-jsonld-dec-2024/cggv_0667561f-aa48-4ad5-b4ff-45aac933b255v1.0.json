CAKUT can be caused by monogenic mutations; however, data are lacking on their frequency. Genetic diagnosis has been hampered by genetic heterogeneity and lack of genotype-phenotype correlation. To determine the percentage of cases with CAKUT that can be explained by mutations in known CAKUT genes, we analyzed the coding exons of the 17 known dominant CAKUT-causing genes in a cohort of 749 individuals from 650 families with CAKUT. The most common phenotypes in this CAKUT cohort were vesicoureteral reflux in 288 patients, renal hypodysplasia in 120 patients, and unilateral renal agenesis in 90 patients. We identified 37 different heterozygous mutations (33 novel) in 12 of the 17 known genes in 47 patients from 41 of the 650 families (6.3%). These mutations include (number of families): BMP7 (1), CDC5L (1), CHD1L (5), EYA1 (3), GATA3 (2), HNF1B (6), PAX2 (5), RET (3), ROBO2 (4), SALL1 (9), SIX2 (1), and SIX5 (1). Furthermore, several mutations previously reported to be disease-causing are most likely benign variants. Thus, in a large cohort over 6% of families with isolated CAKUT are caused by a mutation in 12 of 17 dominant CAKUT genes. Our report represents one of the most in-depth diagnostic studies of monogenic causes of isolated CAKUT in children.","dc:creator":"Hwang DY","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mutations in 12 known dominant disease-causing genes clarify many congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24429398","rdfs:label":"A959-21"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Variant is present in 1/93462 European alleles in gnomAD.

A second member of the SIX family of proteins, unc-39 (SIX5), has also been reported to directly interact with eya-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans. We hypothesized that this interaction would be conserved in humans and that interactors of EYA1 represent good candidate genes for BOR. We therefore screened a cohort of 95 patients with BOR for mutations in SIX5. Four different heterozygous missense mutations were identified in five individuals.

To determine how EYA1 mutations cause BOR syndrome and/or ocular defects, we tested the effects of Eya1 mutations on interactions with Six. Dach, and G proteins by mammalian two-hybrid and GST-pulldown assays. Defective interactions were noted between BOR-type mutations S486P and L504R of Eya1 and Dach1, G proteins, and some Six proteins. These mutations impaired the activation of transcription from a Six-responsive gene, myogenin, with Six5. S486P and L504R showed an altered digestion pattern with trypsin, and L504R also decreased the sensitivity to V8 protease digestion and produced a peptide fragment with a different M(r).

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 5 missense variants have been reported in humans. SIX5 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2007 (Hoskins et al.). Association has been reported in at least 6 probands in 2 publications (17357085, 24429398), however the reported variants are high in frequency in population databases, have no evidence of pathogenicity, and/or an alternate cause of disease has later been reported (21280147). This gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction and biochemical function studies (14704431, 17357085, 11950062). While EYA1 and SIX1 gene inactivation in mice leads to ear and kidney abnormalities, two independent SIX5 mouse models have cataracts and no ear or kidney abnormalities (10802667, 10802668). In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the association between SIX5 and autosomal dominant branchio-oto-renal syndrome. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role SIX5 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 1/16/2018.\nReported variants are not scorable for the following reasons: higher frequency in gnomAD than the disease prevalence, no evidence of pathogenicity, alternate cause of disease later discovered. Additionally, two mouse models for Six5 have cataracts as a phenotype, and no ear or kidney abnormalities.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0667561f-aa48-4ad5-b4ff-45aac933b255"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
