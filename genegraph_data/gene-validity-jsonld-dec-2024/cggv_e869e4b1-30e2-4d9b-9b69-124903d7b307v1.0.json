Numerous disparate roles of vertebrate Cell Division-Cycle-14 (CDC14A) have been proposed largely based on studies of cultured cancer cells in vitro. The in vivo functions of vertebrate CDC14A are largely unknown. We generated and analyzed mutations of zebrafish and mouse CDC14A, developed a computational structural model of human CDC14A protein and report four novel truncating and three missense alleles of CDC14A in human families segregating progressive, moderate-to-profound deafness. In five of these families segregating pathogenic variants of CDC14A, deaf males are infertile, while deaf females are fertile. Several recessive mutations of mouse Cdc14a, including a CRISPR/Cas9-edited phosphatase-dead p.C278S substitution, result in substantial perinatal lethality, but survivors recapitulate the human phenotype of deafness and male infertility. CDC14A protein localizes to inner ear hair cell kinocilia, basal bodies and sound-transducing stereocilia. Auditory hair cells of postnatal Cdc14a mutants develop normally, but subsequently degenerate causing deafness. Kinocilia of germ-line mutants of mouse and zebrafish have normal lengths, which does not recapitulate the published cdc14aa knockdown morphant phenotype of short kinocilia. In mutant male mice, degeneration of seminiferous tubules and spermiation defects result in low sperm count, and abnormal sperm motility and morphology. These findings for the first time define a new monogenic syndrome of deafness and male infertility revealing an absolute requirement in vivo of vertebrate CDC14A phosphatase activity for hearing and male fertility.","dc:creator":"Imtiaz A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"CDC14A phosphatase is essential for hearing and male fertility in mouse and human."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29293958","rdfs:label":"PKSN10 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Variant present in 1/108790 European (non-Finnish) alleles in gnomAD.

CDC14A​ was first associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss in humans in 2016​ (Delmaghani et al.​). The primary disease association for CDC14A is hearing impairment and infertility in males syndrome (HIIMS). The nonsyndromic form of hearing loss has been split from this syndrome, because there is evidence that nonsyndromic hearing loss is caused by a distinct molecular mechanism. Two nonsense variants have been reported to segregate in families with males with normal fertility. These variants are truncating in exon 11 of the gene. In one isoform of the gene, NM_033313.2, exon 11 is the last exon, so truncating variants may encode a fully or partially functional protein sufficient to preserve reproductive function. This isoform does not exist in mice, so experimental studies may not be possible.  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/26/18.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e869e4b1-30e2-4d9b-9b69-124903d7b307"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
