MARBP SATB2 is recently known as a versatile regulator functioning in the differentiation of multiple cell types including embryonic stem cells, osteoblasts and immunocytes. Roles of SATB2 in erythroid cells and its working mechanism in orchestrating target gene expression are largely unexplored. We show here that SATB2 is expressed in erythroid cells and activates γ-globin genes by binding to MARs in their promoters and recruiting histone acetylase PCAF. Further analysis in higher-order chromatin structure shows that SATB2 affects physical proximity of human (G)γ- and (A)γ-globin promoters via self-association. We also found that SATB2 interacts with SATB1, which specifically activates ε-globin gene expression. Our results establish SATB2 as a novel γ-globin gene regulator and provide a glimpse of the differential and cooperative roles of SATB family proteins in modulating clustered genes transcription and mediating higher-order chromatin structures.","dc:creator":"Zhou LQ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"The AT-rich DNA-binding protein SATB2 promotes expression and physical association of human (G)γ- and (A)γ-globin genes."},"rdfs:label":"ChIP shows native SATB2 binding at the globin MAR-gamma"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:44d14081-fa32-4159-9049-35f510d2351a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db392e39-eec4-4a14-b3db-78cefd9fed55","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d468a814-72bf-43e4-bc85-d8fcb1eb2412","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The syndromic phenotype seen in humans with SATB2 is recapitulated in the mouse model.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18255030","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Satb2 is a DNA-binding protein that regulates chromatin organization and gene expression. In the developing brain, Satb2 is expressed in cortical neurons that extend axons across the corpus callosum. To assess the role of Satb2 in neurons, we analyzed mice in which the Satb2 locus was disrupted by insertion of a LacZ gene. In mutant mice, beta-galactosidase-labeled axons are absent from the corpus callosum and instead descend along the corticospinal tract. Satb2 mutant neurons acquire expression of Ctip2, a transcription factor that is necessary and sufficient for the extension of subcortical projections by cortical neurons. Conversely, ectopic expression of Satb2 in neural stem cells markedly decreases Ctip2 expression. Finally, we find that Satb2 binds directly to regulatory regions of Ctip2 and induces changes in chromatin structure. These data suggest that Satb2 functions as a repressor of Ctip2 and regulatory determinant of corticocortical connections in the developing cerebral cortex.","dc:creator":"Alcamo EA","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Satb2 regulates callosal projection neuron identity in the developing cerebral cortex."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model and neuronal defects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Note: There are multiple mouse models reported for SATB2 which have been used to study the craniofacial features, skeletal & dental anomalies and neurological deficits \n (PMIDs: 16751105, 16960803, 18255030, 18255031, 30809123, 25037921, 27478017).

SATB2 (Special AT-rich sequence-Binding protein 2) gene encodes a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds to genomic nuclear matrix attachment regions and participates in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. This highly conserved gene encodes a protein with a N-terminal ubiquitin-like oligomerization domain, two CUT DNA binding motifs and a C-terminal homeodomain. This gene curation is for autosomal dominant SATB2-associated disorder (MONDO:0100147). Heterozygous pathogenic variants in SATB2 have been observed in individuals with intellectual disability, global developmental delay, speech delay, craniofacial dysmorphology, cleft palate, drooling, hypotonia, skeletal and dental anomalies [PMID: 31021519].  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nThere are more than 150 affected individuals reported in the literature to date [PMID: 31021519]. Nearly all cases are de novo; however, there are at least 3 reports of sibling recurrence of this disorder, indicating gonadal mosaicism in one of the parents [PMID: 28151491, 31333717, 31425298]. A spectrum of SATB2 variants including frameshift, nonsense, splice, missense, in-frame insertions, and intragenic deletions have been reported [PMIDs: 28151491, 29436146, 31021519]. The postulated disease mechanism is loss of function, though there has been a report of a nonsense variant (exon 8 of 12) shown to escape nonsense-mediated decay, and thought to cause disease as the result of a dominant negative effect [PMID: 17377962, 23925499]. Currently, only a few SATB2 missense variants have been assessed by studies for aberrant function [PMID: 31021519].\nIn experimental evidence, molecular function and animal models support this gene-disease association. In human K562 erythroid cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-Satb2 antibody confirmed direct Satb2 DNA binding on a matrix attachment region, in the globin locus, [PMID: 22825848]. Multiple mouse models including Satb2+/- & Satb2-/- whole body knockouts and conditional knockouts (brain) have been published [PMIDs: 16751105, 16960803, 18255030, 18255031, 27478017, 27897969, 30809123]. These models recapitulated the neurological, craniofacial, dental and bone anomalies seen in SATB2 associated disorder. Notably, whole body Satb2-/- knockout results in perinatal lethality [PMIDs: 16751105, 16960803]. Conditional knockout of Satb2 in cortex and hippocampus resulted in adult mice which showed hyperactivity, increased impulsivity, altered social interaction behaviors, abnormal social novelty, impaired spatial learning and memory [PMID: 30809123]. In summary, SATB2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant SATB2-associated disorders.  This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel approved this classification on 9/15/2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:44d14081-fa32-4159-9049-35f510d2351a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
