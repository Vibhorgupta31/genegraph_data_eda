Amoeboid movement is characterized by relatively non-polarized cells displaying a high level of bleb-like protrusions. During gastrulation, zebrafish mesodermal cells undergo a series of conversions from amoeboid cell behaviors to more mesenchymal and finally highly polarized and intercalative cell behaviors. We demonstrate that Myosin phosphatase, a complex of Protein phosphatase 1 and the scaffolding protein Mypt1, functions to maintain the precise balance between amoeboid and mesenchymal cell behaviors required for cells to undergo convergence and extension. Importantly, Mypt1 has different cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles. Loss of Mypt1 throughout the embryo causes severe convergence defects, demonstrating that Mypt1 is required for the cell-cell interactions involved in dorsal convergence. By contrast, mesodermal Mypt1 morphant cells transplanted into wild-type hosts undergo dorsally directed cell migration, but they fail to shut down their protrusive behavior and undergo the normal intercalation required for extension. We further show that Mypt1 activity is regulated in embryos by Rho-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation, which is promoted by non-canonical Wnt signaling.

This protein forms part of myosin phosphatase, an enzyme that plays an important regulatory role in cell morphology and motility. PPP1R12A was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant genitourinary and/or brain malformation syndrome in 2020 (Hughes et al., 2020 PMID 31883643). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Twelve unique variants, all of which are predicted to result in protein truncation and nonsense mediated decay, have been reported in humans (Hughes et al., 2020 PMID 31883643). In the majority of cases, the variants were shown to have occurred de novo though parents werenâ€™t available in a few cases. The mechanism for disease is predicted to be haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression in the brain and urogenital system during embryonic development (Hughes et al., 2020 PMID 31883642) and data from C. elegans (Wissman et al., 1999 PMID 10208747), Drosophila (Tan et al., 2003 PMID 12505998), and zebrafish models (Weiser et al., 2009 PMID 19515695). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between PPP1R12A and autosomal dominant genitourinary and/or brain malformation syndrome. Additional reports in humans published at least three years from the first proposal of the association are needed to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 16Oct2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:93fa5165-a907-4ca8-b0d3-bb174bf3fca9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
