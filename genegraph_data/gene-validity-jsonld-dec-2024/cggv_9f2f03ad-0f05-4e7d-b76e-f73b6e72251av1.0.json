Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"AGK Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Score upgraded in accordance with MD-GCEP guidelines"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:9f2f03ad-0f05-4e7d-b76e-f73b6e72251a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:083d5197-43b0-4df8-a955-01e36615a75f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:492c408e-e380-40c4-9e86-80c3c7cd0bb2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The authors generated an AGK knock-out model in HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9.

These results were recapitulated with BN-PAGE (Fig. 2B), and are in line with previous pull-down experiments using FLAG-tagged AGK (Fig. 1E, F). Two protein import substrates of TIM22, GC1 and ANT3, were significantly reduced in the mitochondria of AGK KO cells compared to wt (Fig. 1A). These effects could be reversed by re-introduction of either wt or kinase-dead AGK (Fig. 2C, D). \n\nWith AGK established as a member of the TIM22 complex, the authors investigated the effects of AGK KO on other downstream targets of TIM22. One of these targets was ANT1 (encoded by SLC25A4).

Here we identified AGK as a subunit of the mitochondrial TIM22 protein import complex. We show that AGK functions in a kinase-independent manner to maintain the integrity of the TIM22 complex, where it facilitates the import and assembly of mitochondrial carrier proteins. Mitochondria isolated from Sengers syndrome patient cells and tissues show a destabilized TIM22 complex and defects in the biogenesis of carrier substrates. Consistent with this phenotype, we observe perturbations in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in cells lacking AGK.

The *AGK* gene encodes mitochondrial acylglycerol kinase, a lipid kinase that can phosphorylate both monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol to generate lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, respectively, in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Independent of its kinase activity, this protein also functions as a member of the TIM22 complex, which is required for the import of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the IMM. \n\nThe *AGK* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2012 (PMID: 22284826), in several individuals with variable congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and lactic acidosis (features seen in Sengers syndrome). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *AGK*-related disease, including Sengers syndrome, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *AGK* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *AGK* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes eight variants (four nonsense, four frameshift) in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 22284826, 25208612, 28868593) although additional cases have been reported in the medical literature. Affected individuals had bilateral cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, motor delay, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. Metabolic screening labs showed lactic acidosis. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function and in vitro functional assays demonstrating reduced rates of mitochondrial import due to variants in *AGK* (PMIDs: 33340416, 28712726).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *AGK* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. More than three years have elapsed since the first assertion of this gene-disease relationship, and no contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
