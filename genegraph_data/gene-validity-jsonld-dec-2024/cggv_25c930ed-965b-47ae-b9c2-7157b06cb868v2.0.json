We here investigated 3 novel patients, including the first known adult, from unrelated families with agammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Two of them also presented with intermittent or severe chronic neutropenia. We identified homozygous or compound-heterozygous variants in the gene for folliculin interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), leading to loss of the FNIP1 protein. B-cell metabolism, including mitochondrial numbers and activity and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway, was impaired. These defects recapitulated the Fnip1-/- animal model. Moreover, we identified either uniparental disomy or copy-number variants (CNVs) in 2 patients, expanding the variant spectrum of this novel inborn error of immunity. The results indicate that FNIP1 deficiency can be caused by complex genetic mechanisms and support the clinical utility of exome sequencing and CNV analysis in patients with broad phenotypes, including agammaglobulinemia and HCM. FNIP1 deficiency is a novel inborn error of immunity characterized by early and severe B-cell development defect, agammaglobulinemia, variable neutropenia, and HCM. Our findings elucidate a functional and relevant role of FNIP1 in B-cell development and metabolism and potentially neutrophil activity.","dc:creator":"Saettini F","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Absent B cells, agammaglobulinemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in folliculin-interacting protein 1 deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"P1"},{"id":"cggv:ab6d1b76-4be5-4c8e-b35f-0534895b9c3e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab6d1b76-4be5-4c8e-b35f-0534895b9c3e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ab6d1b76-4be5-4c8e-b35f-0534895b9c3e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Nonsense variant in exon 9 of 18 is predicted to result in NMD.

In this study, we describe a patient harboring a novel genetic variant in FNIP1 causing immunodeficiency with cardiac involvement. Clinical and immunological workups were performed. Genetic evaluation utilizing whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing was conducted. The index patient (subject II-4) presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, recurrent infections, and chronic diarrhea during infancy. Immune workup revealed agammaglobulinemia and a lack of B lymphocytes. Genetic evaluation identified a homozygous 13-bp duplication variant in FNIP1 (c.52_64dupGCGCCCGGCCGCG, p. Asp22GlyfsTer21) resulting in a frameshift in exon 1/18. She was treated with supplemental intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) with good control of sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations. Her sibling (subject II-1) had similar clinical features, along with dysmorphic facial features and hypotony, and succumbed to cardiogenic shock at the age of 2 months, prior to genetic evaluation. Diagnosis of novel immunodeficiencies promotes our understanding of the immune system, enabling genetic counseling as herein, and may assist in the development of novel medical therapies in the future.

Affected individuals carry germ line mutations in folliculin (FLCN), a tumor suppressor gene that becomes biallelically inactivated in kidney tumors by second-hit mutations. Similar to other factors implicated in kidney cancer, FLCN has been shown to modulate activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, its precise in vivo function is largely unknown because germ line deletion of Flcn results in early embryonic lethality in animal models. Here, we describe mice deficient in the newly characterized folliculin-interacting protein 1 (Fnip1). In contrast to Flcn, Fnip1(-/-) mice develop normally, are not susceptible to kidney neoplasia, but display a striking pro-B cell block that is entirely independent of mTOR activity. We show that this developmental arrest results from rapid caspase-induced pre-B cell death, and that a Bcl2 transgene reconstitutes mature B-cell populations, respectively. We also demonstrate that conditional deletion of Flcn recapitulates the pro-B cell arrest of Fnip1(-/-) mice. Our studies thus demonstrate that the FLCN-FNIP complex deregulated in BHD syndrome is absolutely required for B-cell differentiation, and that it functions through both mTOR-dependent and independent pathways.","dc:creator":"Baba M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"The folliculin-FNIP1 pathway deleted in human Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is required for murine B-cell development."},"rdfs:label":"Fnip1−/− mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This mouse model shows strong overlap of cellular phenotypes of patients however clinical phenotypes were not addressed in this publication."},{"id":"cggv:079fe750-8a78-447b-b338-833b3b925bd6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a0b0078-6254-4771-b2cb-9bd0df9b0779","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Shared phenotypes include cardiomyopathy, pre-excitation syndrome, block at pre-b cell stage, and mild reduction in antigen-specific IgM following immunization with the T cell-independent antigen NP-Ficoll.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27303042","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Folliculin (FLCN) is a tumor-suppressor protein mutated in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome, which associates with two paralogous proteins, folliculin-interacting protein (FNIP)1 and FNIP2, forming a complex that interacts with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

Folliculin interacting protein 1 (*FNIP1*) encodes the FNIP1 protein, a regulator of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cellular pathways. FNIP1 controls B cell development through regulation of mitochondrial autophagy (reviewed in PMID: 39013219). FNIP1 deficiency is associated with a syndromic disease that includes B cell immunodeficiency and cardiomyopathy. The latter is related to the important role of FNIP1 in controlling skeletal muscle functional angiogenesis, which is required for muscle revascularization during ischemia (PMID: 37932296). Seven variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) have been reported in seven probands, and one additional family member, in four publications (PMIDs: 32181500, 32905580, 37522988, 39537849). This gene-disease association is supported by its function in nutrient/energy sensing (PMID: 17028174), which is altered in patient cells (PMID: 32905580). Additionally, mouse models recapitulate the block at the pre-B-cell stage and dysregulation of metabolic regulators (PMIDs: 22608497, 22709692) as well as some key features of the disease (PMID: 27303042).
