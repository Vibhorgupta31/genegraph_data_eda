We report five homozygous null mutations in MTX2, encoding Metaxin-2 (MTX2), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, in patients presenting with a severe laminopathy-like mandibuloacral dysplasia characterized by growth retardation, bone resorption, arterial calcification, renal glomerulosclerosis and severe hypertension. Loss of MTX2 in patients' primary fibroblasts leads to loss of Metaxin-1 (MTX1) and mitochondrial dysfunction, including network fragmentation and oxidative phosphorylation impairment. Furthermore, patients' fibroblasts are resistant to induced apoptosis, leading to increased cell senescence and mitophagy and reduced proliferation. Interestingly, secondary nuclear morphological defects are observed in both MTX2-mutant fibroblasts and mtx-2-depleted C. elegans. We thus report the identification of a severe premature aging syndrome revealing an unsuspected link between mitochondrial composition and function and nuclear morphology, establishing a pathophysiological link with premature aging laminopathies and likely explaining common clinical features.","dc:creator":"Elouej S","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Loss of MTX2 causes mandibuloacral dysplasia and links mitochondrial dysfunction to altered nuclear morphology."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95b2738d-c934-401b-8665-dd6a19ec6a05_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95b2738d-c934-401b-8665-dd6a19ec6a05_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ec1b4e3-f113-429d-be30-392c4bc16de6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d4e30b19-1e52-49ab-bed2-1ed2d2e6060a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The number of dead cells upon apoptosis was significantly reduced in patients compared to control fibroblasts, confirmed by the reduction of Caspase 3 cleavage in MTX2-mutant fibroblasts.\nObserved Increased macro-autophagy in MTX2 deficient patient fibroblast cells. \nThe mitochondrial dysfunction and hampered apoptosis may account for the lipodystrophy and progeroid like features, hepatomegaly\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32917887","rdfs:label":"MTX2 and MTX1 deficiency hampers TNF-α-induced apoptosis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:29b3cd55-f0fc-4455-a977-21ecf0470c34","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec866331-c36c-4b50-8163-8ba5f2cb30e4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Immunoblot analysis of MTX2 and other outer mitochondrial membrane proteins of whole-cell extracts from healthy control (WT) and patients’ (MADM2, MADM3) fibroblasts shows that MTX2 deficiency leads to loss of Metaxin-1 (MTX1) and mitochondrial dysfunction, including network fragmentation and oxidative phosphorylation impairment.

recently, mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) with type A and type B lipodystrophy was the first to come to mind in the association of mandibular hypoplasia, lipodystrophy, and acro-osteolysis. However, it has recently been added to the differential diagnosis of MAD, a newly defined syndrome, called MDPS. MDPS is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by postnatal growth retardation, hypotonia, generalized lipodystrophy, skin changes, progeroid traits, and dysmorphic facial features, including prominent eyes, long pinched nose, mandibular hypoplasia, and a small mouth. Biallelic null variants of the MTX2 gene are responsible for this syndrome. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a 6-year-old patient with skeletal dysplasia. WES revealed a novel homozygous c.543+1G>T splice site variant in the MTX2 gene. We also extracted total RNA from peripheral blood and used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to generate cDNA. Sanger sequencing from cDNA showed that exon 8 of MTX2 was skipped. This study adds to the genetics and phenotype of MDPS and underlines the importance of comprehensive clinical and molecular research.","dc:creator":"Yeter Doğan B","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"A novel MTX2 gene splice site variant resulting in exon skipping, causing the recently described mandibuloacral dysplasia progeroid syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Dogan-case report"},{"id":"cggv:5efea302-fd78-4d3e-9635-e769c4467829","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5efea302-fd78-4d3e-9635-e769c4467829_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"(0.5 +0.5) = 1-0.5 = 0.5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4e885720-02b7-45d5-ae76-1226e9e4b10f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e885720-02b7-45d5-ae76-1226e9e4b10f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":23,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:a9174f52-1b80-483b-8a6a-9782864ca1d4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006554.5(MTX2):c.97del (p.Ile33PhefsTer25)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA761100973"}},{"id":"cggv:ce4104dc-f459-4c34-9b48-fe24cd8c67e3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006554.5(MTX2):c.378+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA349698062"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003698","obo:HP_0000093","obo:HP_0006829","obo:HP_0008897","obo:HP_0000822","obo:HP_0000282","obo:HP_0002090","obo:HP_0002371"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:caf3ab67-783c-4817-bef7-7233fd9f4921_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ce4104dc-f459-4c34-9b48-fe24cd8c67e3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38250156","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Proteinuria is a common and important clinical manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an independent risk factor for the progression of kidney disease.

MDPS is a severe laminopathy-like disorder characterized by by dysmorphic facial features, lipodystrophy, skin changes, clavicular hypoplasia, acral osteolysis, and normal intelligence with an unknown prevalence. *MTX2* encodes the metaxin 2 protein which is located at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and faces the cytosolic compartment through direct interaction with its partner Metaxin-1 (MTX1). It is involved in protein translocation into mitochondria.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. Nine unique loss of function variants (frameshift, start loss, splice variants) that have been reported in 8 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation  (PMID: 32917887; Dogan et al 2022, PMID: 36269149; Li et al 2024, PMID: 38250156). \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationshipis also supported by expression studies, t animal models, rescue experiments, and in-vitro functional assays. Experimentally, *MTX2* deficiency is demostrated to result in loss of Metaxin-1 (MTX1) and mitochondrial dysfunction, including network fragmentation and oxidative phosphorylation impairment, which may account for poor growth, hypotonia, muscle weakness, skeletal abnormalities, nephrotic proteinuria and glomerulopathy.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *MTX2* and  autosomal recessive mandibuloacral dysplasia progeroid syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date June 5, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:95b2738d-c934-401b-8665-dd6a19ec6a05"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
