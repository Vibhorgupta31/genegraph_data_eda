HMG-CoA reductase, an essential enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, is the target of statins. We identified nine individuals from five unrelated families with unexplained limb-girdle like muscular dystrophy and bi-allelic variants in HMGCR via clinical and research exome sequencing. The clinical features resembled other genetic causes of muscular dystrophy with incidental high CPK levels (>1,000 U/L), proximal muscle weakness, variable age of onset, and progression leading to impaired ambulation. Muscle biopsies in most affected individuals showed non-specific dystrophic changes with non-diagnostic immunohistochemistry. Molecular modeling analyses revealed variants to be destabilizing and affecting protein oligomerization. Protein activity studies using three variants (p.Asp623Asn, p.Tyr792Cys, and p.Arg443Gln) identified in affected individuals confirmed decreased enzymatic activity and reduced protein stability. In summary, we showed that individuals with bi-allelic amorphic (i.e., null and/or hypomorphic) variants in HMGCR display phenotypes that resemble non-genetic causes of myopathy involving this reductase. This study expands our knowledge regarding the mechanisms leading to muscular dystrophy through dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway, autoimmune myopathy, and statin-induced myopathy.","dc:creator":"Morales-Rosado JA","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Bi-allelic variants in HMGCR cause an autosomal-recessive progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy."}},{"id":"cggv:5e751b15-f668-4f02-81ad-7e593b7291e0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1dfcc3d1-1fe5-49c1-a77c-578e563ea4a4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37167966"}],"rdfs:label":"Family 4 Individual II-1"},{"id":"cggv:dbbe9ac9-2876-4e08-8450-9a49010f0010","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dbbe9ac9-2876-4e08-8450-9a49010f0010_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:5e751b15-f668-4f02-81ad-7e593b7291e0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5e751b15-f668-4f02-81ad-7e593b7291e0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5e751b15-f668-4f02-81ad-7e593b7291e0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Protein is about 20% larger in size than WT resulting in disruption of the stability of the variant, as shown by S200 increase column.

Statins, HMGCR inhibitors, are widely used as cholesterol-reducing drugs. However, statin-induced myopathy is the most adverse side effect of statins. To eludicate the mechanisms underlying statin the myotoxicity and HMGCR function in the skeletal muscle, we developed the skeletal muscle-specific HMGCR knockout mice. Knockout mice exhibited postnatal myopathy with elevated serum creatine kinase levels and necrosis. Myopathy in knockout mice was completely rescued by the oral administration of MVA. These results suggest that skeletal muscle toxicity caused by statins is dependent on the deficiencies of HMGCR enzyme activity and downstream metabolites of the mevalonate pathway in skeletal muscles rather than the liver or other organs.","dc:creator":"Osaki Y","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Skeletal muscle-specific HMG-CoA reductase knockout mice exhibit rhabdomyolysis: A model for statin-induced myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Osaki Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":9375,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":8.95,"subject":{"id":"cggv:aeb17e16-196d-480f-8e26-f7b5feeb9c64","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015152","gene":"hgnc:5006","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*HMGCR* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in 2023 (Yogev Y et al., PMID:36745799). At least 10 variants (eight missense, one in-frame deletion and one intronic) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least six probands in two publications (PMID:36745799, PMID:37167966). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in nine additional family members. One large consanguineous kindred is reported with an LOD score of 4.8204 (PMID:36745799). The mechanism for disease is unknown. This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model recapitulating the human limb-girdle muscular dystrophy phenotype (PMID:26381177). Using skeletal muscle-specific *HMGCR* knockout mice the authors demonstrated that mice missing *HMGCR* expression in their skeletal muscle exhibit muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, elevated creatine kinase levels and abnormal/myopathic muscle biopsy. These clinical features are also seen in the human probands included in this curation. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 13 August 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:83df8b99-e09d-4460-8b77-ec656d47882a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
