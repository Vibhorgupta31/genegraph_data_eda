It has been estimated that 2-5% of patients with NIDDM may have this form of diabetes mellitus. Clinical studies have shown that prediabetic MODY subjects have normal insulin sensitivity but suffer from a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting that pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction rather than insulin resistance is the primary defect in this disorder. Linkage studies have localized the genes that are mutated in MODY on human chromosomes 20 (MODY1), 7 (MODY2) and 12 (MODY3), with MODY2 and MODY3 being allelic with the genes encoding glucokinase, a key regulator of insulin secretion, and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), a transcription factor involved in tissue-specific regulation of liver genes but also expressed in pancreatic islets, insulinoma cells and other tissues.

We have now isolated cDNAs encoding the human homolog of the rat and mouse HNF4 splice variant HNF4 alpha 2, as well as a previously unknown splice variant of this protein, which we called HNF alpha 4. More importantly, we also cloned a novel HNF4 subtype (HNF4 gamma) derived from a different gene and showed that the genes encoding HNF 4 alpha and HNF4 gamma are located on human chromosomes 20 and 8, respectively. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that HNF4 GAMMA is expressed in the kidney, pancreas, small intestine, testis, and colon but not in the liver, while HNF4 alpha RNA was found in all of these tissues. By cotransfection experiments in C2 and HeLa cells, we showed that HNF4 gamma is significantly less active than HNF4 alpha 2 and that the novel HNF4 alpha splice variant HNF4 alpha 4 has no detectable transactivation potential.

As a gene-specific transcription factor, HNF4α exerts its function through various molecular interactions, but its protein recruiting network has not been fully characterized. Here we report the identification of MED25 as one of the HNF4α binding partners in pancreatic ß-cells leading to insulin secretion which is impaired in MODY patients. MED25 is one of the subunits of the Mediator complex that is required for induction of RNA polymerase II transcription by various transcription factors including nuclear receptors. This HNF4α-MED25 interaction was initially identified by a yeast-two-hybrid method, confirmed by in vivo and in vitro analyses, and proven to be mediated through the MED25-LXXLL motif in a ligand-independent manner. Reporter-gene based transcription assays and siRNA/shRNA-based gene silencing approaches revealed that this interaction is crucial for full activation of HNF4α-mediated transcription, especially expression of target genes implicated in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

HNF-4alpha, a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, is expressed in pancreatic islets as well as in the liver, kidney, and intestine. However, the role of HNF-4alpha in pancreatic beta-cell is unclear. To clarify the role of HNF-4alpha in beta-cells, we generated beta-cell-specific HNF-4alpha knock-out (betaHNF-4alphaKO) mice using the Cre-LoxP system. The betaHNF-4alphaKO mice exhibited impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which is a characteristic of MODY1. Pancreatic islet morphology, beta-cell mass, and insulin content were normal in the HNF-4alpha mutant mice. Insulin secretion by betaHNF-4alphaKO islets and the intracellular calcium response were impaired after stimulation by glucose or sulfonylurea but were normal after stimulation with KCl or arginine. Both NAD(P)H generation and ATP content at high glucose concentrations were normal in the betaHNF-4alphaKO mice. Expression levels of Kir6.2 and SUR1 proteins in the betaHNF-4alphaKO mice were unchanged as compared with control mice. Patch clamp experiments revealed that the current density was significantly increased in betaHNF-4alphaKO mice compared with control mice. These results are suggestive of the dysfunction of K(ATP) channel activity in the pancreatic beta-cells of HNF-4alpha-deficient mice.

HNF4A is a transcription factor expressed within the liver, kidney, and pancreas of humans (Drewes et al., 1996 PMID: 8622695). HNF4A has been shown to regulate the expression of HNF1A, another transcription factor that is associated with monogenic diabetes, providing a direct correlation between these monogenic diabetes associated genes (Thomas et al., 2001 PMID: 11590126). \nNumerous variants in HNF4A in relation to the development of monogenic diabetes ( or MODY and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia), including missense, frameshift, nonsense and deletions have been reported in humans. There are databases describing HNF4A variants of interest in monogenic diabetes, including: (1) the HNF4A database in LOVD (https://grenada.lumc.nl/LOVD2/diabetes/home.php?select_db=HNF4A); and (2) The Diagnostic Mutation Database (https://secure.dmudb.net/ngrl-rep/Home.do) (Colclough et al., 2013 PMID: 23348805). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for over 20 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level and segregation data is available, however the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, biochemical evidence, and animal models.\n\nHNF4A has been associated with multiple disease entities and/or phenotypes through autosomal dominant germline inheritance, including:\n(1)\tFanconi renotubular syndrome 4, with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MIM: \t616026); (2) MODY, type I (MIM: 125850); (3) Susceptibility to Diabetes mellitus, noninsulin-dependent (MIM: 125853).\n\nThe Fanconi renotubular syndrome 4 (FRST4) is associated with a single variant in HNF4A, p.Arg76Trp (aka p.Arg85Trp or Arg63Trp dependent on the transcript used, ref. Flanagan et al., 2010 PMID: 20164212, supplementary table 1) and has been shown to occur in at least 7 different probands (PMIDs: 22802087, 24285859, 25819479, 30005691, 28693455, 28458902, 27245055, 20164212). Renal abnormalities often accompany a diagnosis of MODY. Per the criteria outline by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, FRST4 and MODY1 show the same molecular mechanism and phenotypes consistent with a spectrum of MODY diagnosis, therefore they have been lumped into the disease entity, monogenic diabetes (MONDO:0015967). \nThe susceptibility to diabetes mellitus, non-insulin dependent is not currently curated under this gene-disease relationship and will be evaluated independently. \n\nIn summary, HNF4A is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen  Monogenic Diabetes Expert Panel on Feb 26, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:98cb808e-02d3-4378-8e6b-9b1b2883cc65"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
