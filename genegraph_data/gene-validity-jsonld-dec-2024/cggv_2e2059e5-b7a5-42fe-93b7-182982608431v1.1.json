Exome sequencing and molecular analysis in two unrelated families allowed us to identify a homozygous mutation in BANF1 (c.34G>A [p.Ala12Thr]), encoding barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BAF), as the molecular abnormality responsible for this Mendelian disorder. Functional analysis showed that fibroblasts from both patients have a dramatic reduction in BAF protein levels, indicating that the p.Ala12Thr mutation impairs protein stability. Furthermore, progeroid fibroblasts display profound abnormalities in the nuclear lamina, including blebs and abnormal distribution of emerin, an interaction partner of BAF. These nuclear abnormalities are rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type BANF1, providing evidence for the causal role of this mutation. These data demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing for identifying the cause of rare Mendelian disorders and underscore the importance of nuclear envelope alterations in human aging.","dc:creator":"Puente XS","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Exome sequencing and functional analysis identifies BANF1 mutation as the cause of a hereditary progeroid syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"p.Ala12Thr Puente proband 2"},{"id":"cggv:ffad0219-ac19-4af8-971a-5daa8ebf085d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffad0219-ac19-4af8-971a-5daa8ebf085d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ffad0219-ac19-4af8-971a-5daa8ebf085d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Patient fibroblast analysis: Patient fibroblasts had notably decreased expression of BAF than the controls or the heterozygous carrier, the latter of which had moderate levels of BAF. mRNA levels were not substantially altered in the mutant fibroblasts, showing that the mutation impacts protein stability instead of mRNA expression.

Here, we assessed the impact of BAF A12T on NE integrity using NGPS-derived patient fibroblasts. We observed a strong defect in lamin A/C accumulation to NE ruptures in NGPS cells, restored upon homozygous reversion of the pathogenic BAF A12T mutation with CRISPR/Cas9. By combining in vitro and cellular assays, we demonstrated that while the A12T mutation does not affect BAF 3D structure and phosphorylation by VRK1, it specifically decreases the interaction between BAF and lamin A/C. Finally, we revealed that the disrupted interaction does not prevent repair of NE ruptures but instead generates weak points in the NE that lead to a higher frequency of NE re-rupturing in NGPS cells.

Here, we show that the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (Banf1) protein has a role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Banf1 is characterized as a nuclear envelope protein and mutations in Banf1 are associated with the severe premature aging syndrome, Néstor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome. We have previously shown that Banf1 directly regulates the activity of PARP1 in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Here, we show that Banf1 also has a role in modulating DNA double-strand break repair through regulation of the DNA-dependent Protein Kinase catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. Specifically, we demonstrate that Banf1 relocalizes from the nuclear envelope to sites of DNA double-strand breaks. We also show that Banf1 can bind to and directly inhibit the activity of DNA-PKcs. Supporting this, cellular depletion of Banf1 leads to an increase in non-homologous end-joining and a decrease in homologous recombination, which our data suggest is likely due to unrestrained DNA-PKcs activity. Overall, this study identifies how Banf1 regulates double-strand break repair pathway choice by modulating DNA-PKcs activity to control genome stability within the cell.","dc:creator":"Burgess JT","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Barrier-to-autointegration-factor (Banf1) modulates DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice via regulation of DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) activity."},"rdfs:label":"DNA pyruvate kinase/DNA repair activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":9025,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":4,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b9c67219-0f3d-4b3b-a4c6-328451e77811","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013523","gene":"hgnc:17397","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The BANF1 gene is located on chromosome 11 at 11q13.1 and encodes the barrier to autointegration nuclear assembly factor 1 protein, a non-specific DNA-binding protein that plays key roles in mitotic nuclear reassembly, chromatin organization, DNA damage response, gene expression and intrinsic immunity against foreign DNA. BANF1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Néstor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome (NGPS) in 2011 (Puente et al., PMID: 21549337;). NGPS is a unique progeria with a relatively long lifespan with features such as signs of aging, growth delay, reduced subcutaneous fat, decreased diameter of limbs, and stiffening of the joints. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found clear differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between the following disease entities which have therefore been split: autosomal recessive NGPS and BANF1-related neurodevelopmental disorder. The split curation for autosomal dominant BANF1-related neurodevelopmental disorder has been curated separately.\n\nOne missense variant (possible founder variant in Spanish families) that has been reported in 3 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 21549337, 32783369) is included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including protein interaction and biochemical functional evidence, specifically interaction evidence with lamin, and function in DNA stability/repair activity (PMIDs: 36039758, 33660778). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between BANF1 and autosomal recessive NGPS. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
