Disruption of the Mesp1 gene leads to aberrant heart morphogenesis, resulting in cardia bifida. In order to study the defects in Mesp1-expressing cells during gastrulation and in the specification of mesodermal cell lineages, we introduced a (beta)-galactosidase gene (lacZ) under the control of the Mesp1 promoter by homologous recombination. The early expression pattern revealed by (beta)-gal staining in heterozygous embryos was almost identical to that observed by whole mount in situ hybridization. However, the (beta)-gal activity was retained longer than the mRNA signal, which enabled us to follow cell migration during gastrulation. In heterozygous embryos, the Mesp1-expressing cells migrated out from the primitive streak and were incorporated into the head mesenchyme and heart field. In contrast, Mesp1-expressing cells in the homozygous deficient embryos stayed in the primitive streak for a longer period of time before departure. The expression of FLK-1, an early marker of endothelial cell precursors including heart precursors, also accumulated abnormally in the posterior region in Mesp1-deficient embryos. In addition, using the Cre-loxP site-specific recombination system, we could determine the lineage of the Mesp1-expressing cells. The first mesodermal cells that ingressed through the primitive streak were incorporated as the mesodermal component of the amnion, and the next mesodermal population mainly contributed to the myocardium of the heart tube but not to the endocardium. These results strongly suggest that MesP1 is expressed in the heart tube precursor cells and is required for mesodermal cells to depart from the primitive streak and to generate a single heart tube.","dc:creator":"Saga Y","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"MesP1 is expressed in the heart precursor cells and required for the formation of a single heart tube."},"rdfs:label":"MESP1 expressed in heart precursor cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8e86e873-749f-4d44-a1c8-d28405d7dace_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9489411-5eb7-4797-9632-9876ff514a82","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8d5644a-df96-4319-9b75-4162e29f140b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"For each MESP1 variant (wild-type or mutant), FLAG-tagged MESP1 was pulled down from cell lysates and analyzed for its co-precipitation with HA-tagged RING1A.

Mutations in key developmental transcription factor MESP1 and chromatin factors, such as PRC1 and cohesin components, have been found in human congenital heart diseases (CHDs), although their functional mechanism during heart development remains elusive. Here, we find that MESP1 interacts with RING1A/RING1, the core component of PRC1. RING1A depletion impairs human cardiomyocyte differentiation, and cardiac abnormalities similar to those in patients with MESP1 mutations were observed in Ring1A knockout mice. Mechanistically, MESP1 associates with RING1A to activate cardiogenic genes through promoter-enhancer interactions regulated by cohesin and CTCF and histone acetylation mediated by p300. Importantly, CHD mutations of MESP1 significantly affect such mechanisms and impair target gene activation. Together, our results demonstrate the importance of MESP1-RING1A complex in heart development and provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of CHDs caused by mutations in MESP1, PRC1, and cohesin components.","dc:creator":"Liang Q","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Essential role of MESP1-RING1A complex in cardiac differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Pathogenic mutations impair the MESP1-RING1A interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8e86e873-749f-4d44-a1c8-d28405d7dace_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b5dbd87-9d09-4a5f-a15f-eebeca8142aa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43eeb91e-9269-40b5-acce-5e873c581b4d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The cardiac defects observed in Mesp1 null mice align closely with phenotypes of congenital heart defects in humans.
