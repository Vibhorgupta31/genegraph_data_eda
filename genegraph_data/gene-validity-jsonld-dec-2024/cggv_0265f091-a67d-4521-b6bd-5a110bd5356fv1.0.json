A not precisely known proportion of these diseases are genetically determined. We genotyped 43 index-patients (30 DCM, 10 ARVC, 3 RCM) with advanced or end stage cardiomyopathy using a gene panel which covered 46 known cardiomyopathy disease genes. Fifty-three variants with possible impact on disease in 33 patients were identified. Of these 27 (51%) were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic in the MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, NEXN, TNNC1, TNNI3, DES, LMNA, PKP2, PLN, RBM20, TTN, and CRYAB genes. Fifty-six percent (n = 24) of index-patients carried a likely pathogenic or pathogenic mutation. Of these 75% (n = 18) were familial and 25% (n = 6) sporadic cases. However, severe cardiomyopathy seemed to be not characterized by a specific mutation profile. Remarkably, we identified a novel homozygous PKP2-missense variant in a large consanguineous family with sudden death in early childhood and several members with heart transplantation in adolescent

Summary:\nThere is limited evidence that MYH7 is associated with ARVC. Screening of ARVC patient cohorts for MYH7 mutations has been performed in four studies (29709087, 27194543, 29253866 and 30385303). In these studies, a total of 245 ARVC patients were investigated and eight individuals were reported carrying MYH7 variants (a deletion and seven missense). However, the significance of these variants in the context of ARVC is unclear as they were either VUS (e.g. p.Arg1846Cys) or previously reported as causative in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g. p.Lys847del). In one ARVC pedigree the identified MYH7 p.Met877Ile variant did not segregate with ARVC in the family (28699631). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. There is no clear evidence that the identified MYH7 variants contribute to the ARVC phenotype and there is no known disease mechanism that would link MYH7 with ARVC.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0265f091-a67d-4521-b6bd-5a110bd5356f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
