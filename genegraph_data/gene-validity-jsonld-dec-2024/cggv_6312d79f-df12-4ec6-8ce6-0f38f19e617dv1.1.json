Recently, the ALPK3 gene was described as a new hereditary cardiomyopathy gene underlying pediatric cardiomyopathies. Only eight patients carrying mutations in ALPK3 have been reported to date. Here, we report a 3-year-old male patient with both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient presented dysmorphic features and skeletal deformities of hands and feet, pectus excavatum, and cleft palate. The genetic investigation was performed by whole-exome sequencing in the patient and his parents. We identified a novel homozygous mutation in ALPK3 (c.1531_1532delAA; p.Lys511Argfs*12). Our work extends the phenotypic spectrum of the ALPK3-associated cardiomyopathy by reporting additional clinical features. This is the first study of a Tunisian patient with mutation in the ALPK3 gene. In conclusion, ALPK3 should be included in the list of genes to be considered in genetic studies for patients affected with pediatric syndromic cardiomyopathy.","dc:creator":"Jaouadi H","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Novel ALPK3 mutation in a Tunisian patient with pediatric cardiomyopathy and facio-thoraco-skeletal features."}},"rdfs:label":"Jaouadi Proband"},{"id":"cggv:c65cbf96-3205-4608-ac25-c7ade0213702","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c65cbf96-3205-4608-ac25-c7ade0213702_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"gnomAD: absent; absent from WES data of 70 Tunisian individuals; both parents heterozygous for variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0ca16032-40d6-4371-8ea5-ef907b476350_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ca16032-40d6-4371-8ea5-ef907b476350","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c5e4b7be-990b-4aa2-8df7-2e54a7208c1e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020778.4(ALPK3):c.3781C>T (p.Arg1261Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7709571"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"At age 10 IVS thickness =13mm, z-score +6.

We isolated a novel gene designated Midori. Its deduced amino acid sequence contained an ATP/GTP-binding site, Ig-like domain, and Kringle-like domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of Midori was restricted to the fetal and adult heart and adult skeletal muscle in mice. In whole mount in situ hybridization, Midori was expressed in cardiac crescent and developing heart but not in somites. The MIDORI protein was localized in the nucleus and overexpression of Midori induced expression of endogenous Midori itself, suggesting that MIDORI may act as a transcriptional regulator. Permanent P19CL6 cell lines overexpressing Midori more efficiently differentiated into cardiomyocytes than did parental cells, whereas those overexpressing the antisense Midori less efficiently differentiated. These results suggest that Midori may promote the differentiation of P19CL6 into cardiomyocytes.","dc:creator":"Hosoda T","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"A novel myocyte-specific gene Midori promotes the differentiation of P19CL6 cells into cardiomyocytes."},"rdfs:label":"Hosoda Expression "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d6c2c323-ceee-4e0d-9bc3-7ba5c5822b9b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f01910c0-287b-41f6-87b9-e667d4b72a6c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Provides initial evidence of the importance of ALPK3 to heart development, by both in vitro  and in vivo methods.

The LV free and septal walls were significantly larger (~.23cm) compared to WT littermates (~.175cm). The hearts were grossly enlarged in all 4 chambers. Cardiomyocytes from the Alpk3 null mice showed myofibril disarray (looser arrangement). Intercalated discs were reduced. EM confirmed altered structure., the z-band appears wider by EM.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21441111","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cardiomyopathy developed in mice deficient for α-kinase 3 (ALPK3), a nuclear kinase previously implicated in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes. Alpk3               (-/-) mice were produced according to normal Mendelian ratios and appeared normal except for a nonprogressive cardiomyopathy that had features of both hypertrophic and dilated forms of cardiomyopathy. Cardiac hypertrophy in Alpk3               (-/-) mice was characterized by increased thickness of both left and right ventricular (LV and RV) walls and by markedly increased heart weight and increased heart weight/body weight and heart weight/tibia length ratios. Magnetic resonance imaging studies confirmed the increased thickness in both septal and LV free walls at end-diastole, although there was no significant change in LV wall thickness at end-systole. Myocardial hypertrophy was the predominant feature in Alpk3               (-/-) mice, but several changes more typically associated with dilated cardiomyopathy included a marked increase in end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volume, as well as reduced cardiac output, stroke volume, and ejection fractions, suggesting LV chamber dilation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 50% reduction in both septal and free wall LV contractility in Alpk3               (-/-) mice. Interstitial fibrosis and inflammation were notably absent in Alpk3               (-/-) mice; however, light and electron microscopy revealed altered cardiomyocyte architecture, characterized by reduced numbers of abnormal intercalated discs being associated with mild disarray of myofibrils. These lesions could account for the impaired contractility of the myofibrillar apparatus and contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in Alpk3               (-/-) mice.","dc:creator":"Van Sligtenhorst I","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Cardiomyopathy in α-kinase 3 (ALPK3)-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Van Sligtenhorst Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Because the phenotype more closely resembled DCM, I only scored 1 point instead of default 2 points.used a genetrap that inserted  into intron 2 (between exon 2-3) which effectively stopped the transcription of Alpk3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4757,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:890db168-ec58-4ff4-adbc-3d99982ee3da","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005045","gene":"hgnc:17574","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*ALPK3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2016 (Almomani et al., 2016; PMID:26846950). At least 22 variants (nonsense, frameshift, missense, and splice site) that have been reported in 19 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 26846950, 27106955, 33076350, 28630369, 30046096, 31074094, 34862804, 32480058) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated in at least 4 families. More evidence is available in the literature, however the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function, expression, functional alterations (in patient and non-patient cells), and an animal model (PMIDs: 27106955, 11418590, 21441111). In summary, *ALPK3* is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal recessive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. An analysis to determine the strength of evidence for ALPK3 in an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy will be performed separately. \n\nThe relationship between ALPK3 and autosomal recessive  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy GCEP on February 2, 2017. It was re-evaluated on February 7, 2022. As a result of this recuration, the classification changed from the original Strong to Definitive. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Diseases GCEP on February 7, 2022.
