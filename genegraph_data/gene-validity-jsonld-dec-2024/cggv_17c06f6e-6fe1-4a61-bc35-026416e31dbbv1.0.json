Most cases of ALS are sporadic but about 5-10% are familial. Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding protein (TARDBP, also known as TDP43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS, also known as translocated in liposarcoma (TLS)) account for approximately 30% of classic familial ALS. Mutations in several other genes have also been reported as rare causes of ALS or ALS-like syndromes. The causes of the remaining cases of familial ALS and of the vast majority of sporadic ALS are unknown. Despite extensive studies of previously identified ALS-causing genes, the pathogenic mechanism underlying motor-neuron degeneration in ALS remains largely obscure. Dementia, usually of the frontotemporal lobar type, may occur in some ALS cases. It is unclear whether ALS and dementia share common aetiology and pathogenesis in ALS/dementia. Here we show that mutations in UBQLN2, which encodes the ubiquitin-like protein ubiquilin 2, cause dominantly inherited, chromosome-X-linked ALS and ALS/dementia. We describe novel ubiquilin 2 pathology in the spinal cords of ALS cases and in the brains of ALS/dementia cases with or without UBQLN2 mutations. Ubiquilin 2 is a member of the ubiquilin family, which regulates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Functional analysis showed that mutations in UBQLN2 lead to an impairment of protein degradation. Therefore, our findings link abnormalities in ubiquilin 2 to defects in the protein degradation pathway, abnormal protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, indicating a common pathogenic mechanism that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.","dc:creator":"Deng HX","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mutations in UBQLN2 cause dominant X-linked juvenile and adult-onset ALS and ALS/dementia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21857683","rdfs:label":"D II:4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The missense variant Pro509Ser is supported by functional evidence in PMID: 25616961, finding that Pro497Ser interferes with the normal binding of ubiquilin2 to hnRNPA1 (which is also implicated in ALS), with approximately 15% binding compared to WT, suggesting a connection between proteostasis and RNA metabolism.

UBQLN2 encodes ubiquilin 2, which is mainly involved in protein homeostasis, directing misfolded or redundant proteins towards the proteasome. ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons in the brain and lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord, resulting in fatal paralysis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. At least 29 missense variants have been reported in relation to ALS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 30 probands in 13 publications (PMIDs: 21857683, 23138764, 22717235, 24771548, 28716533, 23312802, 22892309, 22560112, 31475037, 23582661, 24684794, 25179229, 25681989), and segregated with disease in at least 21 additional family member. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its role in the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (PMID: 15147878), which is altered in cells expressing variants (PMID: 26075709). Additionally, its role in autophagy is also altered in patient cells (PMID: 28716533) and it interacts in stress granules with additional ALS-implicated genes FUS and TIA1 (PMID: 30442662). Further support is provided by several animal models (drosophila, rat, and mouse) including at least two knock-in mouse models (PMID: 27834214), which recapitulate features of ALS. In summary UBQLN2 is definitively associated with X-linked dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 15. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on 04/13/2021 (SOPv8).\nUsing SOPv8 the 7 point cap for probands with other variant type with some evidence of gene impact in an X-linked disorder has been removed so all 10.45pt are considered to contribute to the classification (with a total of 12pt genetic evidence and 18pt total).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:17c06f6e-6fe1-4a61-bc35-026416e31dbb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
