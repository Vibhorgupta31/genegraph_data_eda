This cellular phenotype is shared by yeast pex mutants, and human orthologues of yeast PEX genes have been shown to be defective in some groups of PBD patients. We identified a putative human orthologue of ScPEX12 by screening the database of expressed sequence tags for cDNAs capable of encoding a protein similar to yeast Pex12p. Although its sequence similarity to yeast Pex12 proteins was limited, PEX12 shared the same subcellular distribution as yeast Pex12p and localized to the peroxisome membrane. PEX12 expression restored peroxisomal protein import in fibroblasts from PBD patients of complement group 3 (CG3) and frameshift mutations in PEX12 were detected in two unrelated CG3 patients.

Liver disease, variable neurodevelopmental delay, retinopathy and perceptive deafness are common to PBDs. PBD patients belonging to complementation group 3 (CG3) have mutations in the PEX12 gene, which codes for a protein (PEX12) that contains two transmembrane domains, and a zinc-binding domain considered to be important for its interaction with other proteins of the peroxisomal protein import machinery. We report on the identification of five PBD patients belonging to CG3. Sequence analysis of their PEX12 genes revealed five different mutations, four of which have not been reported before. Four of the patients have mutations that disrupt the translation frame and/or create an early termination codon in the PEX12 open reading frame predicted to result in truncated protein products, lacking at least the COOH-terminal zinc-binding domain. All these patients display the more severe phenotypes (ZS or NALD).

Mutations in PEX12 are known to underlie the disease in two patients from complementation group 3 of the PBDs. Here we show that all patients from this group carry mutations on both alleles of PEX12. A comparison between PEX12 genotypes and the clinical and cellular phenotypes of the corresponding PBD patients suggests a relatively straightforward relationship between genotype and phenotype in this group of the PBDs, such that the loss of PEX12 function leads to more-severe cellular and clinical phenotypes. However, one patient who presented relatively mild clinical and cellular phenotypes was a compound heterozygote for two seemingly severe mutations on each PEX12 allele. PEX12 mRNA present in the patient's cells was derived from only one allele, the one that carried a 2-bp deletion early in the PEX12 coding region, c.26,27Delta. The deduced protein product of this mRNA would contain only the first eight amino acids of the protein, and yet this mutant PEX12 cDNA displayed significant PEX12 activity in a functional complementation assay. Surprisingly, the PEX12/c.26, 27Delta cDNA directed the synthesis of a 29-kD PEX12 protein in vitro, a result that is consistent with translation initiation at a downstream AUG codon. Transfection studies confirmed the expression of similarly sized PEX12 proteins from the PEX12/c.26,27Delta allele. Thus, it appears that translation initiation at internal AUG codons may modulate disease phenotypes and should be considered whenever unexpectedly mild phenotypes result from severe mutations early in

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive peroxisomal biogenesis disorder in 1997 (Okumoto et al., PMID:9354782). Numerous variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 16.5 points. Variants (nonsense, missense, and frameshift) in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 5 publications (PMIDS: 9090384, 9792857, 14571262, 9354782, 9632816). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is expected to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, cell culture models, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PEX12 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peroxisomal biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:124c97b0-92ed-4921-a0b9-2ff33135139d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
