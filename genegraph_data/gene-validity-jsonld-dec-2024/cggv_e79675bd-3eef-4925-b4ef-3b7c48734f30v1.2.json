We studied a large family in which five individuals presented with a complex, autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections and multiple autoimmune clinical features. We identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 1 of CTLA4. Screening of 71 unrelated patients with comparable clinical phenotypes identified five additional families (nine individuals) with previously undescribed splice site and missense mutations in CTLA4. Clinical penetrance was incomplete (eight adults of a total of 19 genetically proven CTLA4 mutation carriers were considered unaffected). However, CTLA-4 protein expression was decreased in regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in both patients and carriers with CTLA4 mutations. Whereas Treg cells were generally present at elevated numbers in these individuals, their suppressive function, CTLA-4 ligand binding and transendocytosis of CD80 were impaired. Mutations in CTLA4 were also associated with decreased circulating B cell numbers. Taken together, mutations in CTLA4 resulting in CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency or impaired ligand binding result in disrupted T and B cell homeostasis and a complex immune dysregulation syndrome.

Detailed analysis of the open biopsy showed development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) characterized by focal or densely arranged CD19+and CD20+lymphoid follicles and reactive germinal centers. The iBALT contained T cell infiltrates with predominance of CD4+cells including a small subset of Foxp3+Tregs. CD4+T cells occasionally invaded the bronchial mucosa. Majority of lymphocytes belonged to the B cell compartment and included interfollicular plasma cells. Progressive reduction of IgG, IgA and IgM, as well as lack of specific antibodies and gradually evolving lymphopenia were noted, along with continuous reduction of switched memory B cells and naive T cells. Class-switched memory B cells declined over time. Lung disease progressed and proband continued to suffer from frequent relapses of AIHA and ITP. At 18yo, proband developed chronic diarrhea that worsened to severe watery diarrhea. Endoscopy revealed mucosal inflammation of the stomach, duodenum and colon. Villous blunting was accompanied by reduction of Paneth cells, numerous CD4+T cells in the tunica propria, mild intraepithelial CD8+infiltrates, but only rare B and plasma cells.

We report here a Japanese patient with this disorder who has a novel heterozygous single nucleotide insertion, 76_77insT (p. L28SfsX40), in the CTLA4 gene. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patient showed decreased frequency of CTLA-4(high) cells in CD4(+)FOXP3(+) cells following CD3/CD28 stimulation. The patient experienced hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent pneumonia, esophageal candidiasis, cytomegalovirus-positive chronic gastritis, chronic and severe diarrhea, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the patient developed multifocal gastric cancer, histologically poorly and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, associated with chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. Previously, 23 symptomatic cases with heterozygous CTLA4 mutations have been reported. Including the case presented here, 3 of the 24 cases (12.5%) developed gastric cancer. Notably, 2 of 3 patients presented similarly multifocal adenocarcinomas associated with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.

However, less is known about the function of CTLA-4, which is expressed at highest levels after activation. We have generated an antibody to CTLA-4 to investigate the consequences of engagement of this molecule in a carefully defined system using highly purified T cells. We show here that the presence of low levels of B7-2 on freshly explanted T cells can partially inhibit T cell proliferation, and this inhibition is mediated by interactions with CTLA-4. Cross-linking of CTLA-4 together with the TCR and CD28 strongly inhibits proliferation and IL-2 secretion by T cells. Finally, results show that CD28 and CTLA-4 deliver opposing signals that appear to be integrated by the T cell in determining the response to activation.

Signaling through this pathway is complex due to the presence of two B7 family members, B7-1 and B7-2, and two counterreceptors, CD28 and CTLA-4. Studies with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have suggested both positive and negative roles for CTLA-4 in T cell activation. To elucidate the in vivo function of CTLA-4, we generated CTLA-4-deficient mice. These mice rapidly develop lymphoproliferative disease with multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration and tissue destruction, with particularly severe myocarditis and pancreatitis, and die by 3-4 weeks of age. The phenotype of the CTLA-4-deficient mouse strain is supported by studies that have suggested a negative role for CTLA-4 in T cell activation. The severe phenotype of mice lacking CTLA-4 implies a critical role for CTLA-4 in down-regulating T cell activation and maintaining immunologic homeostasis. In the absence of CTLA-4, peripheral T cells are activated, can spontaneously proliferate, and may mediate lethal tissue injury.","dc:creator":"Tivol EA","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Loss of CTLA-4 leads to massive lymphoproliferation and fatal multiorgan tissue destruction, revealing a critical negative regulatory role of CTLA-4."},"rdfs:label":"Tivol_knock-out mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The mouse model evidence is scored default points for recapitulation of the phenotype in homozygous knock-out mice, indicating loss of function disease mechanism in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome due to CTLA4 haploinsuffiency"},{"id":"cggv:e6a48cf0-525a-4cd6-a29c-4f4d02f54ebb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de3713a5-8037-4fb1-b505-224c044cf63c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Heterozygous mice appeared normal; while homozygous mice became sick at 2w of age and died by 3-4w.

Although CTLA-4-deficient T cells proliferated spontaneously and strongly when stimulated through the T cell receptor, they were sensitive to cell death induced by cross-linking of the Fas receptor and by gamma irradiation.

CTLA4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and encodes a protein which transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome due to CTLA4 haploinsufficiency is a complex immune disorder with incomplete penetrance of ~70% (PMID: 30565239), characterized by autoimmune thrombocytopenias and abnormal lymphocytic infiltration of nonlymphoid organs, including the lungs, brain, and gastrointestinal tract, resulting in enteropathy (PMID: 25213377). CTLA4 variants (polymorphisms) are also reported as a risk factor or associated with susceptibility to celiac disease, diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (OMIM); however, these entities are considered within the context of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome due to CTLA4 haploinsufficiency in this curation. \n\nCTLA4 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome due to CTLA4 haploinsufficiency in 2014 by Kuehn et al and Schubert et al. (PMID: 25213377, PMID: 25213377). More than 20 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans in the ClinVar database. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 25213377, 25213377, 25367873, 27102614, 26644313). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score (12 points) for genetic evidence is reached. The mechanism for disease is reported to be loss of function/haploinsufficiency.  \n\nDigenic variants have been reported in the context of inborn errors of immunity. In a patient with a combination of a GOF JAK3 variant and LOF CTLA4 variant, there was evidence of both autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and humoral immunodeficiency with hypogammaglobulinemia and impaired memory B cell differentiation. The parents of this patient who carry one each of these heterozygous variants do not have a clinical phenotype (PMID: 29375547).\nThis suggests there is epistatic modulation of the phenotype in the patient carrying heterozygous variants in these two genes. This patient is not scored for this curation, but noted for information.\n  \nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. CTLA4 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and functions in delivering an inhibitory signal to T cells (PMID: 7543139). Haploinsufficiency of CTLA4 leads to hyperproliferative T cells in patients (PMID: 25213377). Two different knock-out mouse models of CTLA4 recapitulate the human phenotype, including lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (PMID: 7584144, 7481803). Overexpression of wild-type CTLA4 in patient T cells rescues hyperproliferation of cells (PMID: 25213377). Treatment with abatacept, a fusion protein drug incorporating the extracellular domain of WT CTLA4, has been successful in a patient with CTLA4 haploinsufficiency (PMID: 26478010). \n  \nIn summary, CTLA4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e79675bd-3eef-4925-b4ef-3b7c48734f30"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
