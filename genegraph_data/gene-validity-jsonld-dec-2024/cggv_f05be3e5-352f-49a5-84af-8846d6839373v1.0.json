Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Ã… resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Complex I structural model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"At least 18 complex I subunits are associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f05be3e5-352f-49a5-84af-8846d6839373_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bda16b18-336d-4674-a2df-173abcc0d5f3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dee6ce3c-9f0d-45ba-8890-368c11159216","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Assays for respiratory chain enzyme activity confirmed isolated complex I deficiency in muscle: Spectrophotometric assays of skeletal muscle mitochondria from Patients 1 and 2 showed significantly decreased activities in rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome-c reductase (rotenone-sensitive NCCR, complex I and III) with normal activities in succinate-cytochrome-c reductase (SCCR, complex II and III) and COX (complex IV) (Table 1).

The *MT-ND4* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND4. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *MT-ND4* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2003 (PMID: 16120329). Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-ND4* and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 2 variants in 6 cases (5 with m.11777C>A and 1 with m.11240C>T) from 5 publications (PMIDs: 16120329, 15576045, 20502985, 27761019, 32445240). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants (the total score for genetic level evidence in this curation was 9). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 27509854, 16120329). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 17, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f05be3e5-352f-49a5-84af-8846d6839373"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
