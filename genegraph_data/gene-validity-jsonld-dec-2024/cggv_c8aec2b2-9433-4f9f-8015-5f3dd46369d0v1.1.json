Substrate specificity and a detailed kinetic analysis (Na, Pi, H+ concentrations) suggested that expressed uptake activities relate to proximal tubular brush border membrane Na/Pi cotransport. NaPi-2 cDNA contains 2464 bp encoding a protein of 637 aa; NaPi-3 cDNA contains 2573 bp encoding a protein of 639 aa. NaPi-2- and NaPi-3-deduced protein sequences show high homology to each other but are different from the protein sequence deduced from the previously cloned NaPi-1 cDNA (from rabbit proximal tubules). Hydropathy profile predictions suggest at least eight membrane-spanning regions in NaPi-2/3-related proteins. In vitro translation results in proteins of the expected size and suggests glycosylation. Northern blot analysis shows corresponding mRNA species (approximately 2.7 kb) in kidney cortex of various species but no hybridization with RNAs isolated from a variety of other tissues (including intestinal segments); a hybridization signal (approximately 4.8 kb) was observed only in the lung (human). We conclude that we have structurally identified two closely related proteins most likely involved in human and rat renal brush border Na/Pi cotransport.","dc:creator":"Magagnin S","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Expression cloning of human and rat renal cortex Na/Pi cotransport."},"rdfs:label":"Kidney Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c8aec2b2-9433-4f9f-8015-5f3dd46369d0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8aec2b2-9433-4f9f-8015-5f3dd46369d0_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9ac7a2a2-afa4-4563-a217-060a1331bfc4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ac7a2a2-afa4-4563-a217-060a1331bfc4","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":39,"allele":{"id":"cggv:52a0a00d-ab76-405e-8924-71f69a6a7ab7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003052.5(SLC34A1):c.460_480dup (p.Ile154_Val160dup)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3580395"}},"detectionMethod":"Standard techniques for DNA extraction, single-nucleotide-polymorphism microarray-based genomewide scanning, fine mapping, logarithm-of-odds score calculation, SLC34A1 sequence analysis in the affected persons and their unaffected family members, and mutation screening in a panel of DNA samples from healthy control subjects from the same population group.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012213","obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0000114","obo:HP_0031415","obo:HP_0004349","obo:HP_0000117","obo:HP_0004912","obo:HP_0003355","obo:HP_0002150","obo:HP_0003330","obo:HP_0020110"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:47ecef5c-7385-4b7e-927f-a8e5d7768dc5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:52a0a00d-ab76-405e-8924-71f69a6a7ab7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20335586","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We describe two siblings from a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive Fanconi's syndrome and hypophosphatemic rickets.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 (OMIM:613388) has been split from the following disease entities,\nHypercalcemia, infantile, 2 (OMIM: 616963), and Nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis, hypophosphatemic, 1 (OMIM:612286). The lumped disease entity for autosomal recessive hypercalcemia, infantile, 2 and autosomal dominant nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis, hypophosphatemic, 1 has been curated separately.\n\n*SLC34A1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 in 2010 (Magen et al., PMID: 20335586). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. Fanconi renotubular syndrome is a renal disorder resulting from decreased solute and water reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. \n\nOnly one variant (in-frame duplication) has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 20335586, included in this curation). A total of 0.5/12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached considering case-level data.\nThere is very little evidence supporting this gene-disease association beyond the expression of SLC34A1 in the brush border of proximal tubule cells in humans (PMID: 8327470). A total of 0.5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *SLC34A1* and autosomal recessive Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role SLC34A1 plays in this disease.\nThe gene-disease relationship has not been replicated and there is not compelling genetic evidence. Additionally there is no convincing experimental data available.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c8aec2b2-9433-4f9f-8015-5f3dd46369d0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
