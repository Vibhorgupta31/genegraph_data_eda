Here, we report on three complex-I-deficient adult subjects with relatively mild clinical symptoms, including isolated, progressive exercise-induced myalgia and exercise intolerance but with normal later development. Exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing revealed compound-heterozygous mutations in TMEM126B, encoding a complex I assembly factor. Further biochemical analysis of subject fibroblasts revealed a severe complex I deficiency caused by defective assembly. Lentiviral complementation with the wild-type cDNA restored the complex I deficiency, demonstrating the pathogenic nature of these mutations. Further complexome analysis of one subject indicated that the complex I assembly defect occurred during assembly of its membrane module. Our results show that TMEM126B defects can lead to complex I deficiencies and, interestingly, that symptoms can occur only after exercise.","dc:creator":"Sánchez-Caballero L","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in Complex I Assembly Factor TMEM126B Result in Muscle Weakness and Isolated Complex I Deficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9df6705-7638-45c1-b3ec-db19fe0d39b9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9df6705-7638-45c1-b3ec-db19fe0d39b9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33057b11-d8f0-42d5-9e29-79cb6a181c4f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6ddc2299-13ef-4c95-995f-5592a55c9f62","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Chaperone protein involved in the assembly of complex I.

Quantitative real-time PCR revealed knockdown efficiencies of at least 60% for all six different shRNAs sequences (data not shown). A first assessment at the protein level by activity staining after high-resolution clear native electrophoresis (hrCNE) (Wittig et al., 2007) revealed markedly reduced amounts of complex I-containing supercomplexes with three of the short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (V2LHS_175840, V3LHS_365049, and V3LHS_365046; Figure S2A). In all three knockdown cell lines transduced with TMEM126B shRNA and exhibiting strong effects on complex I assembly, the amount of TMEM126B mRNA was lowered by about 70% (Figure S2B). For a more detailed analysis of the effects of TMEM126B knockdown on respiratory chain assembly and function the 143B cell line that had been lentivirally transduced by shRNA V2LHS_175840 was used; hardly any supercomplex pattern could be observed in enriched mitochondrial membranes from these TMEM126B knockdown cells in silver-stained 2D BNE/Tricine SDS gels (Figure 4A). This finding was confirmed by BNE western blot (Figure 4B) and densitometric analysis. Compared to mock-transduced 143B cells, a residual level of only 5% complex I was present as component of respiratory supercomplexes in the TMEM126B knockdown cells (Figures 4B and 4C). In contrast, TMEM126B knockdown did not reduce the levels of respiratory complexes III, IV, and V. by high-resolution respirometry. In analysis of whole-cell respiration, the respiratory control ratio as an indicator of tight coupling of oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory excess capacity was reduced by about 50%, consistent with the reduced levels of complex I (Figure 4D). In intact mitochondria isolated from cultured cells, high-resolution\nrespirometry revealed a reduction in respiration by about two-thirds after TMEM126B knockdown only when the electrons were fed into complex I via the NADH-linked substrates malate and glutamate in ADP-stimulated mitochondria (Figure 4E).

With 44 structural subunits and over 10 assembly factors, it is unsurprising that complex I deficiency is associated with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies including custom, targeted gene panels or unbiased whole-exome sequencing (WES) are hugely powerful in identifying the underlying genetic defect in a clinical diagnostic setting, yet many individuals remain without a genetic diagnosis. These individuals might harbor mutations in poorly understood or uncharacterized genes, and their diagnosis relies upon characterization of these orphan genes. Complexome profiling recently identified TMEM126B as a component of the mitochondrial complex I assembly complex alongside proteins ACAD9, ECSIT, NDUFAF1, and TIMMDC1. Here, we describe the clinical, biochemical, and molecular findings in six cases of mitochondrial disease from four unrelated families affected by biallelic (c.635G>T [p.Gly212Val] and/or c.401delA [p.Asn134Ilefs(∗)2]) TMEM126B variants. We provide functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of these TMEM126B variants, including evidence of founder effects for both variants, and establish defects within this gene as a cause of complex I deficiency in association with either pure myopathy in adulthood or, in one individual, a severe multisystem presentation (chronic renal failure and cardiomyopathy) in infancy. Functional experimentation including viral rescue and complexome profiling of subject cell lines has confirmed TMEM126B as the tenth complex I assembly factor associated with human disease and validates the importance of both genome-wide sequencing and proteomic approaches in characterizing disease-associated genes whose physiological roles have been previously undetermined.","dc:creator":"Alston CL","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Biallelic Mutations in TMEM126B Cause Severe Complex I Deficiency with a Variable Clinical Phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"Alston rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"partial rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction in cells from 1 patient and affected sibling"},{"id":"cggv:2fcb1378-b425-4540-bf63-39177b267b11","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:98346870-4cc3-4440-a291-cc8fc9709b27","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Patient fibroblasts were rescued by lentiviral transduction with wild-type TMEM126B (isoform A, NM_018480.4).

The *TMEM126B* gene encodes transmembrane protein 126B, which is a chaperone protein involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency, with variable onset of disease from soon after birth to adulthood. \n\nThe* TMEM126B* gene was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2016 (PMID: 27374773). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TMEM126B*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TMEM126B* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants (2 missense, 1 frameshift, 1 stop-gained) identified in nine unrelated cases from four publications (PMIDs: 27374773, 27374774, 27290639, 29093663). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Of note, the c.635G>T (p.Gly212Val) variant, a proposed founder variant, has been identified in every case reported to date. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration studies in patient and non-patient cells showing impaired mitochondrial function due to variants or gene knockdown, and rescue of the mitochondrial dysfunction in patient cells following expression of the wildtype protein (PMIDs: 27374773, 27374774, 29093663, 27977873, 22982022). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TMEM126B* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 7, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f9df6705-7638-45c1-b3ec-db19fe0d39b9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
