Copy number gains of ASXL1 occur in chromosome 20q11.2 duplication syndrome and cervical cancer. Truncation mutations of ASXLs occur in autism, Bohring-Opitz and related syndromes, hematological malignancies and solid tumors, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer and high-grade glioma, which are gain- or loss-of-function mutations. The ASXM2 domain is a binding module for androgen receptor and estrogen receptor Î±, while the PHD finger is a ligand of WTIP LIM domains and a putative chromatin-binding module. Phylogenetic analyses of 139 human PHD fingers revealed that ASXL PHD fingers cluster with those of BPTF, DIDO, ING1, KDM5A (JARID1A), KMT2E (MLL5), PHF2, PHF8 and PHF23. The cell context-dependent epigenetic code of ASXLs should be deciphered to develop therapeutics for human diseases.

ASXL proteins consist of ASXN, ASXH, ASXM1, ASXM2 and PHD domains. ASXL1 directly interacts with BAP1, KDM1A (LSD1), NCOA1 and nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), such as retinoic acid receptors, oestrogen receptor and androgen receptor. ASXL family members are epigenetic scaffolding proteins that assemble epigenetic regulators and transcription factors to specific genomic loci with histone modifications. ASXL1 is involved in transcriptional repression through an interaction with PRC2 and also contributes to transcriptional regulation through interactions with BAP1 and/or NHR complexes. Germ-line mutations of human ASXL1 and ASXL3 occur in Bohring-Opitz and related syndromes. Amplification and overexpression of ASXL1 occur in cervical cancer. Truncation mutations of ASXL1 occur in colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), malignant myeloid diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and liver, prostate and breast cancers; those of ASXL2 occur in prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer and those of ASXL3 are observed in melanoma. EPC1-ASXL2 gene fusion occurs in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. The prognosis of myeloid malignancies with misregulating truncation mutations of ASXL1 is poor. ASXL family members are assumed to be tumour suppressive or oncogenic in a context-dependent manner.

Clinical features in affected individuals include feeding difficulties, hypotonia, developmental delay, limited speech, intellectual disability of variable severity, and characteristic facial features. Behavioral issues, including autism spectrum disorder or autistic traits, are common. Seizures are reported in about a third of individuals.\n\nOver 100 affected individuals with nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants have been reported (PMID: 34436830). Most variants are *de novo* and cluster in the last and penultimate exons (PMID: 23383720). Both dominant negative (PMID: 23383720) and loss of function mechanisms (PMID: 26647312) have been proposed. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of disease.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. The ASXL gene family (*ASXL1*, *ASXL2*, and *ASXL3*) participates in body patterning during embryogenesis and encodes proteins involved in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 23736028). Germline *de novo* truncating variants in *ASXL1* and *ASXL2* have been implicated in Bohring-Opitz and Shashi-Pena syndromes, which result in overlapping features of intellectual disability and dysmorphic features (PMIDs: 21706002, 27693232). Further support is provided by animal models in mice (doi: 10.1101/2021.07.20.452995) and frogs (PMID: 32132929). The mouse model was not formally scored in this curation, as it has yet to be published.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ASXL3* and autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 6, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:947933aa-f0f8-4909-abd8-2984dd11dcb8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
