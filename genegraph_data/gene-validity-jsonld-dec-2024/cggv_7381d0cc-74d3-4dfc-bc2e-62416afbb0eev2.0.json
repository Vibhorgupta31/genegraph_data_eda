Decreased activity of catalase may lead to increased hydrogen peroxide concentration, which may contribute to the manifestation of age-related disease. The aim of this study is to examine association of decreased blood catalase activity and catalase exon mutations in patients (n=617) with diabetes (n=380), microcytic anemia (n=58), beta-thalassemia (n=43) and presbycusis (n=136) and in controls (n=295). Overall, 51 patients (8.3%) had less than half of normal blood catalase activity. Their genomic DNA was used for mutation screening of all exons and exon/intron boundaries with polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and PCR-heteroduplex analyses, and mutations were verified with nucleotide sequencing. Seven patients (type 2 diabetes (n=3), gestational diabetes (n=1), microcytic anemia (n=2)) had four novel catalase exon mutations namely, c.106_107insC, p.G36Afs*5(n=3, Hungarian type G1), c.379C>T, p.R127Y (n=2, Hungarian type H1), c.390T>C, p.R129L, (n=1, Hungarian type H2) and c.431A>T, p.N143V (n=1, Hungarian type H3). In patients with decreased blood catalase, the incidence of acatalasemia mutations was significantly high (P<0.0002) in microcytic anemia, type 2 and gestational diabetes. The four novel mutations were probably responsible for low blood catalase activity in 7/51 patients. In the remainder of the cases, other polymorphisms and epigenetic/regulatory factors may be involved.

The nucleotide sequence of the mutant gene was determined for all exons, exon/intron junctions, and 5' and 3' flanking regions, and the findings were compared with the sequence from the normal gene. Seven base differences were found between the two genes. Among them, a G to A substitution at the fifth position of intron 4 (a splicing mutation) seemed most likely to be responsible for the defective catalase synthesis in the subject. To obtain suggestive evidence, we constructed chimeric genes that contained a segment of either the normal or mutant catalase gene, encompassing a 3' part of exon 4, the entire intron 4 and a 5' portion of exon 5, within the third exon of the human alpha-globin gene. When this chimeric gene construct was introduced into simian virus 40-transformed simian cells (COS-7), the transcript of the normal catalase/alpha-globin chimeric gene was spliced correctly, as revealed by Northern blotting and RNase mapping techniques. In contrast, the splicing of the mutant chimeric pre-mRNA occurred between the 5' donor site of the preceding intron and the 3' acceptor site of the intron containing the substitution, thereby skipping one entire exon sequence. Thus, the G to A transition at the fifth position of intron 4 of the catalase gene indeed severely limits the correct splicing of the RNA product. The same splice site mutation was found in the genomic DNA of another acatalasemic individual from an unrelated family. We suggest that this base substitution is the causal mutation of these cases of Japanese-type acatalasemia.","dc:creator":"Wen JK","dc:date":"1990","dc:title":"Molecular analysis of human acatalasemia.

We report here a novel single base deletion in the catalase gene causing Japanese-type acatalasemia. The patient was a 72 year-old Japanese male. His maternal grandmother and his father were first cousins. Molecular analysis using non-RI PCR-SSCP analysis combined with direct sequencing revealed a deletion of the 358th thymine in exon 4 of the patient's catalase gene. The proband was a homozygote and his mother and his three children were heterozygotes for this mutation. The frame shift caused by the nucleotide deletion should alter the downstream amino acid sequence and introduce a new termination codon TGA 43 bp 3' to the mutation.

Hydroxyl radicals are the most deleterious of the activated oxygen intermediates found in aerobic organisms. If formed, they can react with biological molecules in their proximity; the ensuing damage has been implicated in the increasing risk of disease and death associated with aging. To study further the regulation and role of catalase we have undertaken a molecular characterization of the Drosophila catalase gene and two potentially acatalasemic alleles. We have demonstrated that a previously existing allele, Catn4, likely contains a null mutation, a mutation which blocks normal translation of the encoded mRNA. The Catn1 mutation appears to cause a significant change in the protein sequence; however, it is unclear why this change leads to a nonfunctioning protein. Viability of these acatalasemic flies can be restored by transformation with the wild-type catalase gene; hence, we conclude that the lethality of these genotypes is due solely to the lack of catalase. The availability of flies with transformed catalase genes has allowed us to address the effect of catalase levels on aging in Drosophila.

The degree of catalase deficiency in acatalasemic and hypocatalasemic mice varies from tissue to tissue. They therefore may not be suitable for studying the function of this enzyme in certain models of oxidant-mediated tissue injury. We sought to generate a new line of catalase null mice by the gene targeting technique. The mouse catalase (Cat or Cas1) gene was disrupted by replacing parts of intron 4 and exon 5 with a neomycin resistance cassette. Homozygous Cat knockout mice, which are completely deficient in catalase expression, develop normally and show no gross abnormalities. Slices of liver and lung and lenses from the knockout mice exhibited a retarded rate in decomposing extracellular hydrogen peroxide compared with those of wild-type mice. However, mice deficient in catalase were not more vulnerable to hyperoxia-induced lung injury; nor did their lenses show any increased susceptibility to oxidative stress generated by photochemical reaction, suggesting that the antioxidant function of catalase in these two models of oxidant injury is negligible. Further studies showed that cortical injury from physical impact caused a significant decrease in NAD-linked electron transfer activities and energy coupling capacities in brain mitochondria of Cat knockout mice but not wild-type mice. The observed decrease in efficiency of mitochondrial respiration may be a direct result of an increase in mitochondrion-associated calcium, which is secondary to the increased oxidative stress. These studies suggest that the role of catalase in antioxidant defense is dependent on the type of tissue and the model of oxidant-mediated tissue injury.","dc:creator":"Ho YS","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mice lacking catalase develop normally but show differential sensitivity to oxidant tissue injury."},"rdfs:label":"Ho_Acatalasemic mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The evidence is scored reduced points since there is not a clear phenotype associated with Acatalasemia for recapitulation in animal models."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5269,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":8.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f1a44725-cee2-4377-9ef0-d13cc6b0af63","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013571","gene":"hgnc:1516","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"The relationship between CAT and Acatalasemia (also known as acatalasia), an autosomal recessive disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of October, 2019 and reevaluated in September, 2022. No new evidence was has emerged that changes the overall score or classification of the curation. CAT encodes catalase, a peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme present in all aerobic cells. Acatalasemia is associated with absent or reduced catalase activity; however, patients exhibit no significant phenotypes. Since oxidative stress may have a role in the development of many chronic illnesses, acatalasemia is reported to be a risk factor for many diseases including type II diabetes mellitus, schizophrenia, cancer, arithritis and microcytic anemia. This curation considers acatalasemia as the disease entity, with the phenotype being reduced levels of catalase activity.\n\nCAT was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Acatalasemia in 1990 (Wen et al, PMID: 2308162). Variants in this gene include missense, splice region and frameshift variants. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (5.5 points):\nAt least 3 patients from 3 publications have been reported with homozygous variants in CAT (PMIDs: 2308162, 11001624). Several individuals carrying the same variants in the Japanese and Hungarian populations are reported, which may be due to a founder effect. The mechanism of disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function. Heterozygous individuals show intermediate levels of catalase activity.\n  \nSummary of experimental data (4 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by mouse and fly models (PMID: 15178682, 8349109).  \n  \nIn summary, the evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of CAT and Acatalasemia is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
