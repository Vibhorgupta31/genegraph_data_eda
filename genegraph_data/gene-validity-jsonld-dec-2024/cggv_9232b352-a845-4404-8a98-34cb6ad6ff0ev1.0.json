Therefore, HAD should not be referred to as SCHAD. SCHAD is not a member of the HAD family, but instead, belongs to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Previously reported cases of SCHAD deficiency are due to an inherited HAD deficiency. SCHAD, also known as 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10, is important in brain development and aging. Abnormal levels of SCHAD in certain brain regions may contribute to the pathogenesis of some neural disorders.

Mutations in this gene cause HSD10 disease characterized by progressive neurological abnormalities and cardiomyopathy. Disease progression and severity of symptoms is unrelated to the protein's dehydrogenase activity. Recently, it was shown that HSD10 is an essential component of mitochondrial Ribonuclease P (RNase P), an enzyme required for mitochondrial tRNA processing, but little is known about the role of HSD10 in RNase P function. RNase P consists of three different proteins MRPP1, MRPP2 (HSD10) and MRPP3, each of which is essential for RNase P function. Here, we show that HSD10 protein levels are significantly reduced in fibroblasts from patients carrying the HSD17B10 mutation p.R130C. A reduction in HSD10 levels was accompanied by a reduction in MRPP1 protein but not MRPP3 protein. In HSD10 knock-down cells, MRPP1 protein content was also reduced, indicating that HSD10 is important for the maintenance of normal MRPP1 protein levels. Ectopic expression of HSD10 partially restored RNA processing in HSD10 knock-down cells and fibroblasts, and also expression of MRPP1 protein was restored to values comparable to controls. In both, patient fibroblasts and HSD10 knock-down cells, there was evidence of impaired processing of precursor tRNA transcripts of the mitochondrial heavy strand but not the light strand compared with controls. Our findings indicate that HSD10 is important for the maintenance of the MRPP1-HSD10 subcomplex of RNase P and that loss of HSD10 causes impaired mitochondrial precursor transcript processing which may explain mitochondrial dysfunction observed in HSD10 disease.

Here we report a novel missense mutation found in the HSD17B10 gene, namely c.194T>C transition (rs104886492), brought about by the loss of two forked methyl groups of valine 65 in the HSD10 active site.

His HSD10 activity was much lower than the normal control level, with normal β-ketothiolase activity. The c.194T>C mutation in HSD17B10 can be identified by the restriction fragment polymorphism analysis, thereby facilitating the screening of this novel mutation in individuals with intellectual disability of unknown etiology and their family members much easier. The patient's mother is an asymptomatic carrier, and has a mixed ancestry (Hawaiian, Japanese and Chinese). This demonstrates that HSD10 deficiency patients are not confined to a particular ethnicity although previously reported cases were either Spanish or German descendants.","dc:creator":"Seaver LH","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A novel mutation in the HSD17B10 gene of a 10-year-old boy with refractory epilepsy, choreoathetosis and learning disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22132097","rdfs:label":"Seaver 2011 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"No functional evidence."},{"id":"cggv:646d60ab-ea30-42ea-a941-d3e9f51839b4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c4672f95-58b5-470f-907a-d16f2233e5af","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"detectionMethod":"Amplification from both cDNA and genomic DNA followed by sequencing and RFLP analysis.","phenotypeFreeText":"Birth weight, length, and head circumference close to 50th percentile, Could not sit alone before 15 months and could not walk alone until 24 months, Only spoke one word at 24 months, Episode of lethargy and enteritis occurred after a protein‐rich and fatty meal, Elevated excretions of 3‐hydroxy‐2‐methylbutyric acid (3H2MBA), 2‐ethylhydracrylic acid (2EHA), and tiglylglycine (TG), 1.7 mmol/L Blood lactate","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001254","obo:HP_0011179","obo:HP_0006913","obo:HP_0025336","obo:HP_0012104","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002194"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:646d60ab-ea30-42ea-a941-d3e9f51839b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:1cb55fbb-ba61-4352-b760-77edd0b38592"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696021"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696021","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Heterlogous expression in E. coli showed that the variant led to complete inactivity.

The protein belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDR) family and is involved in the catabolism of isoleucine in vivo and steroid metabolism in vitro. MRPP2 also moonlights in a complex with the MRPP1 (also known as TRMT10C) protein for N1-methylation of purines at position 9 of mitochondrial tRNA, and in a complex with MRPP1 and MRPP3 (also known as PRORP) proteins for 5'-end processing of mitochondrial precursor tRNA. Inherited mutations in the HSD17B10 gene encoding MRPP2 protein lead to a childhood disorder characterised by progressive neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy or both. Here we report two patients with novel missense mutations in the HSD17B10 gene (c.34G>C and c.526G>A), resulting in the p.V12L and p.V176M substitutions. Val12 and Val176 are highly conserved residues located at different regions of the MRPP2 structure. Recombinant mutant proteins were expressed and characterised biochemically to investigate their effects towards the functions of MRPP2 and associated complexes in vitro. Both mutant proteins showed significant reduction in the dehydrogenase, methyltransferase and tRNA processing activities compared to wildtype, associated with reduced stability for protein with p.V12L, whereas the protein carrying p.V176M showed impaired kinetics and complex formation. This study therefore identified two distinctive molecular mechanisms to explain the biochemical defects for the novel missense patient mutations.","dc:creator":"Oerum S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Novel patient missense mutations in the HSD17B10 gene affect dehydrogenase and mitochondrial tRNA modification functions of the encoded protein."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28888424","rdfs:label":"Index Case 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Expression in E. coli was similar to wild type, but binding to NADH and NAD+ was reduced.

Protein levels of mutant HSD10(R130C) in patient SF and HSD10(E249Q) in patient SV were about half that of HSD10 in normal controls. The E249Q mutation appears to affect HSD10 subunit interactions, resulting in an allosteric regulatory enzyme. For catalyzing the oxidation of allopregnanolone by NAD+ the Hill coefficient of the mutant enzyme is approximately 1.3. HSD10(E249Q) was unable to catalyze the dehydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and the oxidation of allopregnanolone, a positive modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, at low substrate concentrations. Neurosteroid homeostasis is critical for normal cognitive development, and there is increasing evidence that a blockade of isoleucine catabolism alone does not commonly cause developmental disabilities.
