Although 14 NCL genes have been identified, it is unknown if they act in common disease pathways. Here we show that two disease-associated proteins, CSPα and the depalmitoylating enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1/CLN1) are biochemically linked. We find that in DNAJC5/CLN4 patient brains, PPT1 is massively increased and mis-localized. Surprisingly, the specific enzymatic activity of PPT1 is dramatically reduced. Notably, we demonstrate that CSPα is depalmitoylated by PPT1 and hence its substrate. To determine the consequences of PPT1 accumulation, we compared the palmitomes from control and DNAJC5/CLN4 patient brains by quantitative proteomics. We discovered global changes in protein palmitoylation, mainly involving lysosomal and synaptic proteins. Our findings establish a functional link between two forms of NCL and serve as a springboard for investigations of NCL disease pathways.

A novel single-nucleotide variation (c.344T>G) in the DNAJC5 gene was identified. Mutational screening in an independent family with autosomal dominant ANCL found an in-frame single codon deletion (c.346_348 delCTC) resulting in a deletion of p.Leu116del. These variants fulfill all genetic criteria for disease-causing mutations: they are found in unrelated families with the same disease, exhibit complete segregation between the mutation and the disease, and are absent in healthy controls. In addition, the associated amino acid substitutions are located in evolutionarily highly conserved residues and are predicted to functionally affect the encoded protein (CSPα). The mutations are located in a cysteine-string domain, which is required for membrane targeting/binding, palmitoylation, and oligomerization of CSPα. We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of the functional and structural impact of both mutations on CSPα. We found that these mutations dramatically decrease the affinity of CSPα for the membrane. We did not identify any significant effect on palmitoylation status of CSPα. However, a reduction of CSPα membrane affinity may change its palmitoylation and affect proper intracellular sorting. We confirm that CSPα has a strong intrinsic aggregation propensity; however, it is not modified by the mutations. A complementary disease-network analysis suggests a potential interaction with other NCLs genes/pathways. This is the first replication study of the identification of DNAJC5 as the disease-causing gene for autosomal dominant ANCL. The identification of the novel gene in ANCL will allow us to gain a better understanding of the pathological mechanism of ANCLs and constitutes a great advance toward the development of new molecular diagnostic tests and may lead to the development of potential therapies.","dc:creator":"Benitez BA","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Exome-sequencing confirms DNAJC5 mutations as cause of adult neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22073189","rdfs:label":"Benitez2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The identity of this family is not clear."},{"id":"cggv:5862ec19-0566-4f82-9b20-e8d1a930ee19_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4a12e7b-73e0-413c-853d-32660ce3262b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"detectionMethod":"The exome sequencing was done on two affected individuals who share 1/8 of their genome and an unaffected sibling of one of the affected patients are done to narrow down the candidate variants.

The unifying finding in NCL patients is the accumulation, in neurons and many other cell types, of autofluorescent storage material. There are 13 subtypes of NCLs that are categorized based on the gene that is mutated. DNAJC5 is associated with an autosomal dominant adult NCL (ANCL) with onset ranging from mid 20’s to 40’s. One characteristic that separates ANCL from other types of NCL is the lack of vision loss. DNAJC5 was first reported to be associated with ANCL in 2011 in a study that found two variants in this gene segregating with the disease (Noskova et al. 2011. PMID: 21820099). Three variants have been reported so far: p.Leu115Arg, p.Leu116del, and p.Cys124_Cys133dup. All three variants have been functionally studied and shown to have effects on its own subcellular localization and palmytoylation, which seem to be the result of the tendency to form protein aggregates. Of the eleven reported families, three with p.Leu115Arg and two with p.Leu116del were confirmed independent by the differences in flanking haplotypes. These families were given a score of 1, because their variants were confirmed recurrent and have supporting variant-level functional data. p.Cys124_Cys133dup was seen only in one family and was given a score of 0.5. An LOD score of 5.3 has been published for one of the families with p.Leu116del, resulting in the maximum segregation point of 3 (22978711). Supporting experimental evidence includes protein interaction with PPT1 (12134079) and a consistent reduction in protein expression in brain samples from patients with two different variants, p.Leu115Arg and  p.Leu116del (21820099, 26659577). In summary, a score of 8.5 was given to the genetic evidence and 1 to the experimental evidence, reaching 9.5 in total. DNAJC5’s association with ANCL is moderate.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:67f55ef1-b312-4aac-bc04-67beb2405b4f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
