Rg is expressed in a granular pattern reminiscent of the Golgi network in neuronal cell bodies and colocalizes with transgenic Nbea, suggesting a function in secretory regulation. In contrast to Nbea(-/-) mice, rg null mutants are viable and fertile and exhibit aberrant associative odor learning, changes in gross brain morphology, and synaptic architecture as determined at the larval neuromuscular junction. At the same time, basal synaptic transmission is essentially unaffected, suggesting that structural and functional aspects are separable. Rg phenotypes can be rescued by a Drosophila rg+ transgene, whereas a mouse Nbea transgene rescues aversive odor learning and synaptic architecture; it fails to rescue brain morphology and appetitive odor learning. This dissociation between the functional redundancy of either the mouse or the fly transgene suggests that their complex composition of numerous functional and highly conserved domains support independent functions. We propose that the detailed compendium of phenotypes exhibited by the Drosophila rg null mutant provided here will serve as a test bed for dissecting the different functional domains of BEACH (for beige and human Chediak-Higashi syndrome) proteins, such as Rugose, mouse Nbea, or Nbea orthologs in other species, such as human.","dc:creator":"Volders K","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Drosophila rugose is a functional homolog of mammalian Neurobeachin and affects synaptic architecture, brain morphology, and associative learning."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue Experiment in Drosophila"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5758106a-a81e-41c1-8754-582e50bf2a4e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd1ba8a8-4fb5-40e6-8d65-84b6d796b202","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"These results demonstrate that Drosophila NBEA ( rg ) mutants exhibit phenotypic characteristics reminiscent of human ASD and thus could serve as a genetic model for studying ASDs.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26100104","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in humans characterized by complex behavioral deficits, including intellectual disability, impaired social interactions, and hyperactivity. ASD exhibits a strong genetic component with underlying multigene interactions. Candidate gene studies have shown that the neurobeachin (NBEA) gene is disrupted in human patients with idiopathic autism ( Castermans et al., 2003 ). The NBEA gene spans the common fragile site FRA 13A and encodes a signal scaffold protein ( Savelyeva et al., 2006 ). In mice, NBEA has been shown to be involved in the trafficking and function of a specific subset of synaptic vesicles. ( Medrihan et al., 2009 ; Savelyeva et al., 2006 ). Rugose (rg) is the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian and human NBEA. Our previous genetic and molecular analyses have shown that rg encodes an A kinase anchor protein (DAKAP 550), which interacts with components of the epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR and Notch-mediated signaling pathways, facilitating cross talk between these and other pathways ( Shamloula et al., 2002 ). We now present functional data from studies on the larval neuromuscular junction that reveal abnormal synaptic architecture and physiology. In addition, adult rg loss-of-function mutants exhibit defective social interactions, impaired habituation, aberrant locomotion, and hyperactivity.

The observed alterations in learning and memory and hippocampal LTP are concomitant with decreased expression of the immediate early gene zif268 in dorsomedial striatum and hippocampal CA1 region, increased CREB phosphorylation, and increased hippocampal BDNF expression.

genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder involves the interplay of common and rare variants and their impact on hundreds of genes. Using exome sequencing, here we show that analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 autism cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls implicates 22 autosomal genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, plus a set of 107 autosomal genes strongly enriched for those likely to affect risk (FDR < 0.30). These 107 genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, incur de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the genes implicated encode proteins for synaptic formation, transcriptional regulation and chromatin-remodelling pathways. These include voltage-gated ion channels regulating the propagation of action potentials, pacemaking and excitability-transcription coupling, as well as histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodellers-most prominently those that mediate post-translational lysine methylation/demethylation modifications of histones.

The breakpoint on 13q falls within the second intron of the NBEA gene and is expected to disrupt its expression.  Though this case was not scored, this case ultimately led to further investigation of this gene as a potential cause for neurodevelopmental disorders.  To date more than 20 de novo NBEA variants have been reported in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy (PMID: 30269351, 25363768, 25363760, 31452935). Most of the reported variants are de novo loss-of-function variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants, as well as intragenic deletions; some missense variants have also been reported. This gene is intolerant to both loss-of function and missense variants, as indicated by its pLI score of 1 and missense Z score of 5.51 in the gnomAD database (v2.1.1). This gene-disease relationship is further supported by Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse models as well as rescue experiments (PMID: 26100104, 25484298, 15071111, 23153818, 23100440). In summary, NBEA is definitively associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/2/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f40357db-6cc2-4240-8771-1206cd27298a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
