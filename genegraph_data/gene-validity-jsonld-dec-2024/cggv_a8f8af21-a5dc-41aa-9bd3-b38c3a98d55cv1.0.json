Study of hereditary disorders of neuromuscular transmission, termed congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), has helped elucidate fundamental processes influencing development and function of the nerve-muscle synapse. Using genetic linkage, we find 18 different biallelic mutations in the gene encoding glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1) in 13 unrelated families with an autosomal recessive CMS. Consistent with these data, downregulation of the GFPT1 ortholog gfpt1 in zebrafish embryos altered muscle fiber morphology and impaired neuromuscular junction development. GFPT1 is the key enzyme of the hexosamine pathway yielding the amino sugar UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, an essential substrate for protein glycosylation. Our findings provide further impetus to study the glycobiology of NMJ and synapses in general.","dc:creator":"Senderek J","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway mutations cause neuromuscular transmission defect."}},"rdfs:label":"LGM1.4"},{"id":"cggv:4af11c8b-b704-4324-b124-5895c7e4f8ff","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4af11c8b-b704-4324-b124-5895c7e4f8ff_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4af11c8b-b704-4324-b124-5895c7e4f8ff_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Enzymatic activity in HEK293 cells was mildly reduced (figure S6) to about 70% of wt."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Activity was only mildly reduced in HEK293 cells."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4bf425c6-a156-45ef-a0f2-97c47bbfdf53_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4bf425c6-a156-45ef-a0f2-97c47bbfdf53","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:60f0c34e-fdfb-4967-85c0-2ee73f96883f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001244710.2(GFPT1):c.44C>T (p.Thr15Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1693995"}},{"id":"cggv:852d2b71-d7cc-467b-b157-91934439df2e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001244710.2(GFPT1):c.1_2del (p.Met1ValfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2576991603"}}],"detectionMethod":"WES performed for patients 3, 5, 6, and 8.

Mutations in GFPT1 and other genes downstream of this pathway cause congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) characterized by fatigable muscle weakness owing to impaired neurotransmission. The precise pathomechanisms at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) owing to a deficiency in GFPT1 is yet to be discovered. One of the challenges we face is the viability of Gfpt1-/- knockout mice. In this study, we use Cre/LoxP technology to generate a muscle-specific GFPT1 knockout mouse model, Gfpt1tm1d/tm1d, characteristic of the human CMS phenotype. Our data suggest a critical role for muscle derived GFPT1 in the development of the NMJ, neurotransmission, skeletal muscle integrity and highlight that a deficiency in skeletal muscle alone is sufficient to cause morphological postsynaptic NMJ changes that are accompanied by presynaptic alterations despite the conservation of neuronal GFPT1 expression. In addition to the conventional morphological NMJ changes and fatigable muscle weakness, Gfpt1tm1d/tm1d mice display a progressive myopathic phenotype with the presence of tubular aggregates in muscle, characteristic of the GFPT1-CMS phenotype. We further identify an upregulation of skeletal muscle proteins glypican-1, farnesyltransferase/geranylgeranyltransferase type-1 subunit α and muscle-specific kinase, which are known to be involved in the differentiation and maintenance of the NMJ. The Gfpt1tm1d/tm1d model allows for further investigation of pathophysiological consequences on genes and pathways downstream of GFPT1 likely to involve misglycosylation or hypoglycosylation of NMJs and muscle targets.","dc:creator":"Issop Y","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"GFPT1 deficiency in muscle leads to myasthenia and myopathy in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Issop 2018 Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"The phenotype of the knockout mouse significantly recapitulates human disease."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8739,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:58af8cbe-1819-4a68-ae30-8aeb6324bf68","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012518","gene":"hgnc:4241","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"GFPT1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive congenital myasthenic syndrome 12 in 2011 (Senderek et al., PMID: 21310273).

More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Congenital myasthenic syndrome 12 is characterized by limb-girdle muscle weakness and tubular aggregates on muscle biopsies. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of GFPT1, which is involved in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway that serves as a source of essential amino sugars for the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans, animal models that recapitulate disease, and expression in skeletal muscle (PMIDs: 21310273, 29905857, 11679416). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between GFPT1 and to autosomal recessive congenital myasthenic syndrome 12.This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
