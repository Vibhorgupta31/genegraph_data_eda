ULD has previously been mapped to a locus on chromosome 21 (EPM1). Subsequently, mutations in the cystatin B gene have been found in most cases. In the present work we identified an inbred Arab family with a clinical pattern compatible with ULD, but mutations in the cystatin B gene were absent. We sought to characterize the clinical and molecular features of the disorder. The family was studied by multiple field trips to their town to clarify details of the complex consanguineous relationships and to personally examine the family. DNA was collected for subsequent molecular analyses from 21 individuals. A genome-wide screen was performed using 811 microsatellite markers. Homozygosity mapping was used to identify loci of interest. There were eight affected individuals. Clinical onset was at 7.3 +/- 1.5 years with myoclonic or tonic-clonic seizures. All had myoclonus that progressed in severity over time and seven had tonic-clonic seizures. Ataxia, in addition to myoclonus, occurred in all. Detailed cognitive assessment was not possible, but there was no significant progressive dementia. There was intrafamily variation in severity; three required wheelchairs in adult life; the others could walk unaided. MRI, muscle and skin biopsies on one individual were unremarkable. We mapped the family to a 15-megabase region at the pericentromeric region of chromosome 12 with a maximum lod score of 6.32. Although the phenotype of individual subjects was typical of ULD, the mean age of onset (7.3 years versus 11 years for ULD) was younger. The locus on chromosome 12 does not contain genes for any other form of PME, nor does it have genes known to be related to cystatin B. This represents a new form of PME and we have designated the locus as EPM1B.","dc:creator":"Berkovic SF","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"A new clinical and molecular form of Unverricht-Lundborg disease localized by homozygosity mapping."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15634728","rdfs:label":"VI-5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This family is related to Family B described in El-Shanti et al. and therefore was not scored."},{"id":"cggv:4f5c3d71-70af-49be-a467-31400aba735e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:502e5b1d-fde8-4d37-b55b-7cb714164a69","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0025331","obo:HP_0001350","obo:HP_0002075","obo:HP_0020036","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0032660"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4f5c3d71-70af-49be-a467-31400aba735e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:15341fec-8c97-4f3c-a810-ea07850a35b1"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15642921","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The authors describe three siblings born to consanguineous parents with early onset ataxia, dysarthria, myoclonic, generalized tonic clonic seizures, upward gaze palsy, extensor plantar reflexes, sensory neuropathy, and normal cognition.

We identified four siblings with ataxia, juvenile onset progressive action tremor and atonic seizures from a Jordanian family. The mode of inheritance of this syndrome is autosomal recessive. We performed a genome-wide screen for linkage and fine mapped the region that contains the disease locus. The four affected siblings have ataxia noted at the onset of walking with dysarthria and bulbar features, but no cerebellar hypoplasia on MRI. They all developed a fine tremor that progressed to a coarse action tremor, as well as atonic seizures. Treatment with valproate fully controlled the seizures and improved the tremor, but did not change the course of the ataxia. We mapped the gene responsible for this disorder to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 12.

Recently, it has become evident that a noncanonical Wnt/Frizzled (Fz)/Dishevelled (Dsh) signalling pathway, which is related to the planar-cell-polarity (PCP) pathway in flies, regulates convergent extension during vertebrate gastrulation. Here we isolate and functionally characterise a zebrafish homologue of Drosophila prickle (pk), a gene that is implicated in the regulation of PCP. Zebrafish pk1 is expressed maternally and in moving mesodermal precursors. Abrogation of Pk1 function by morpholino oligonucleotides leads to defective convergent extension movements, enhances the silberblick (slb)/wnt11 and pipetail (Ppt)/wnt5 phenotypes and suppresses the ability of Wnt11 to rescue the slb phenotype. Gain-of-function of Pk1 also inhibits convergent extension movements and enhances the slb phenotype, most likely caused by the ability of Pk1 to block the Fz7-dependent membrane localisation of Dsh by downregulating levels of Dsh protein. Furthermore, we show that pk1 interacts genetically with trilobite (tri)/strabismus to mediate the caudally directed migration of cranial motor neurons and convergent extension. These results indicate that, during zebrafish gastrulation Pk1 acts, in part, through interaction with the noncanonical Wnt11/Wnt5 pathway to regulate convergent extension cell movements, but is unlikely to simply be a linear component of this pathway. In addition, Pk1 interacts with Tri to mediate posterior migration of branchiomotor neurons, probably independent of the noncanonical Wnt pathway.","dc:creator":"Carreira-Barbosa F","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Prickle 1 regulates cell movements during gastrulation and neuronal migration in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"Cell movement regulation in zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The phenotype observed does not match those of patients with PME."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":1101,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":6.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c37eda0a-57be-49fa-a659-cbab971c4aab","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020074","gene":"hgnc:17019","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PRICKLE1 was described in relation to autosomal recessive Progressive myoclonic epilepsy in 2005 by Berkovic et al.
