We demonstrate that CG42630 encodes a novel protein, the coiled coil domain-containing protein 56 (CCDC56), conserved in metazoans. We show that Drosophila CCDC56 protein localizes to mitochondria and contains 87 amino acids in flies and 106 in humans with the two proteins sharing 42% amino acid identity. We show by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and Northern blotting that Drosophila CCDC56 protein and mtTFB1 are encoded on a bona fide bicistronic transcript. We report the generation and characterization of two ccdc56 knock-out lines in Drosophila carrying the ccdc56(D6) and ccdc56(D11) alleles. Lack of the CCDC56 protein in flies induces a developmental delay and 100% lethality by arrest of larval development at the third instar. ccdc56 knock-out larvae show a significant decrease in the level of fully assembled cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and in its activity, suggesting a defect in complex assembly; the activity of the other oxidative phosphorylation complexes remained either unaffected or increased in the ccdc56 knock-out larvae. The lethal phenotype and the decrease in COX were partially rescued by reintroduction of a wild-type UAS-ccdc56 transgene. These results indicate an important role for CCDC56 in the oxidative phosphorylation system and in particular in COX function required for proper development in D. melanogaster. We propose CCDC56 as a candidate factor required for COX biogenesis/assembly.","dc:creator":"Peralta S","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Coiled coil domain-containing protein 56 (CCDC56) is a novel mitochondrial protein essential for cytochrome c oxidase function."},"rdfs:label":"Complex IV assembly factor"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 complex IV subunits/assembly factors associated with PMD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:83ca0cfa-10b9-4bd5-86dd-83bef18e33dc_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:77fe0f4c-83b6-4351-b6d2-c8615722ec34","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a192ef12-3871-4ab5-82f5-0e2b91178fd3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mitochondria from MITRAC12-depleted cells displayed reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity as assessed by in-gel activity staining of mitochondrial protein complexes and enzyme activity measurements, whereas complex V activity was not affected; reduced CIV amount on BN-PAGE/WB compared to control; loss of cytochrome c oxidase activity in MITRAC12 siRNA-treated cells correlated with reduction in amount of CIV; further looked at COX1 translation which was also reduced.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23260140","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial respiratory-chain complexes assemble from subunits of dual genetic origin assisted by specialized assembly factors. Whereas core subunits are translated on mitochondrial ribosomes, others are imported after cytosolic translation. How imported subunits are ushered to assembly intermediates containing mitochondria-encoded subunits is unresolved. Here, we report a comprehensive dissection of early cytochrome c oxidase assembly intermediates containing proteins required for normal mitochondrial translation and reveal assembly factors promoting biogenesis of human respiratory-chain complexes. We find that TIM21, a subunit of the inner-membrane presequence translocase, is also present in the major assembly intermediates containing newly mitochondria-synthesized and imported respiratory-chain subunits, which we term MITRAC complexes. Human TIM21 is dispensable for protein import but required for integration of early-assembling, presequence-containing subunits into respiratory-chain intermediates. We establish an unexpected molecular link between the TIM23 transport machinery and assembly of respiratory-chain complexes that regulate mitochondrial protein synthesis in response to their assembly state.","dc:creator":"Mick DU","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"MITRAC links mitochondrial protein translocation to respiratory-chain assembly and translational regulation."},"rdfs:label":"Mick_HEK293"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Scoring at default - in HEk293, cells: reduced CIV activity and amount"},{"id":"cggv:3c0c2184-610f-4f71-98be-65669ae6b239","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55846945-7e85-4591-8e4d-ad0c792b3f27","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"hCOA3 interfered cells had specific defect in COX activity (30% of controls), whereas the activity of all other respiratory chain complexes, as well as citrate synthase activity, remained unchanged (Fig. 2, A and B).

In humans, COX deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Human COX is composed of 13 subunits of dual genetic origin, whose assembly requires an increasing number of nuclear-encoded accessory proteins known as assembly factors. Here, we have identified and characterized human CCDC56, an 11.7-kDa mitochondrial transmembrane protein, as a new factor essential for COX biogenesis. CCDC56 shares sequence similarity with the yeast COX assembly factor Coa3 and was termed hCOA3. hCOA3-silenced cells display a severe COX functional alteration owing to a decreased stability of newly synthesized COX1 and an impairment in the holoenzyme assembly process. We show that hCOA3 physically interacts with both the mitochondrial translation machinery and COX structural subunits. We conclude that hCOA3 stabilizes COX1 co-translationally and promotes its assembly with COX partner subunits.

The *COA3* gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 3, a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV assembly factor important early in the complex IV assembly process. \n\nThe *COA3* gene has only been reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease once in 2015 (PMID: 25604084). The *COA3* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included compound heterozygous variants (one missense, one frameshift) identified in one proband from one publication (PMID: 25604084). Age of onset in this individual was early childhood and she was 34 years old at the time of this report. She had developmental delay, exercise intolerance, short stature, cognitive impairment, dysmorphic features (epicanthal folds, deep-set eyes), and sensorimotor polyneuropathy (demyelinating with severe axonal loss). Muscle biopsy showed complete absence of COX staining and complex IV activity was 17% of lowest control. Fibroblast testing showed complex IV activity was 65% of lowest control and a reduction in amount of fully assembled COX on BN-PAGE was seen, together with decreased steady state level of COA3 and COX1 on immunoblot and a decrease in COX1 synthesis assessed by pulse labelling. Imaging was not reported, and she had mildly elevated lactate level. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (complex IV activity) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 25604084, 23260140, 22610097, 23362268).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 15, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\nOnly one case has been reported.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:83ca0cfa-10b9-4bd5-86dd-83bef18e33dc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
