After extending the PCR reaction to 30 cycles from 25, a band could clearly be distinguished at the appropriate size for MYO1F indicating transcription of the gene in murine inner ear.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12486594","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Myosin isozymes are essential for hair cells, the sensory cells of the inner ear. Because a myosin-I subfamily member may mediate adaptation of mechanoelectrical transduction, we examined expression of all eight myosin-I isozymes in rodent auditory and vestibular epithelia. Using RT-PCR, we found prominent expression of three isozymes, Myo1b (also known as myosin-Ia or myr 1). Myo1c (myosin-Ib or myr 2). and Myo1e (myr 3). By contrast, Myo1a (brush-border myosin-I), Myo1d (myosin lg or myr 4). Myo1f, Myo1g, and Myo1h were less readily amplified. Because sequence analysis demonstrated that the RT-PCR products encoded the appropriate isozymes, this represents the first demonstration of expression of all eight mouse myosin-I genes. Using immunocytochemistry with isozyme-selective antibodies, we found that Myo1b was located at apical surfaces of supporting cells that surround hair cells in auditory epithelia of postnatal rats. In vestibular epithelia, Myo1b was present in a ring within the apical pole of the hair cell. In both cases, expression was prominent only immediately after birth. Myo1e was found in hair cells of the auditory and vestibular epithelia; this isozyme was enriched in the cuticular plate, the actin meshwork that anchors the stereocilia. Myo1c was found in hair-cell stereocilia, concentrated towards their tips; we confirmed this localization by using adenovirus vectors to direct expression of a GFP-Myo1c tail fusion protein; this fusion protein localized to plasma membranes, often concentrating at stereociliary tips. Myo1c therefore remains the myosin isozyme best localized to carry out transducer adaptation.","dc:creator":"Dumont RA","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Myosin-I isozymes in neonatal rodent auditory and vestibular epithelia."},"rdfs:label":"Dumont Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c422abbd-4f16-4da0-8569-d5d7138be488_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":9323,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":0.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3d9e60b3-985b-4b79-8b62-242a30b044cc","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:7600","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"*MYO1F* was first associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss in 2009 (Zadro et al., PMID: 19027848). At least 6 unique missense variants have been reported in 7 individuals in 2 publications (PMIDs: 19027848, 22938506), however none of the reported variants has convincing evidence of pathogenicity i.e. all were missense variants that either had a high MAF in gnomAD v4., no family history of hearing loss and/or segregations, or the variant was present in unaffected family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression in the murine inner ear (PMID:12486594). In summary, the relationship between *MYO1F* and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss has been disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role *MYO1F* plays in this disease. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 06/06/2017 as per SOP v5. It was reevaluated on 10/31/2024 using SOP v11. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent a review to be consistent with SOP v11. There has been no new evidence published since the last curation.\n\nNone of the six reported missense variants have convincing evidence of pathogenicity, however there is expression evidence in mouse inner ear.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c422abbd-4f16-4da0-8569-d5d7138be488"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
