The disorder is genetically heterogeneous, with 11 BBS genes identified to date, which account for ~70% of affected families. We have combined single-nucleotide-polymorphism array homozygosity mapping with in silico analysis to identify a new BBS gene, BBS12. Patients from two Gypsy families were homozygous and haploidentical in a 6-Mb region of chromosome 4q27. FLJ35630 was selected as a candidate gene, because it was predicted to encode a protein with similarity to members of the type II chaperonin superfamily, which includes BBS6 and BBS10. We found pathogenic mutations in both Gypsy families, as well as in 14 other families of various ethnic backgrounds, indicating that BBS12 accounts for approximately 5% of all BBS cases. BBS12 is vertebrate specific and, together with BBS6 and BBS10, defines a novel branch of the type II chaperonin superfamily. These three genes are characterized by unusually rapid evolution and are likely to perform ciliary functions specific to vertebrates that are important in the pathophysiology of the syndrome, and together they account for about one-third of the total BBS mutational load. Consistent with this notion, suppression of each family member in zebrafish yielded gastrulation-movement defects characteristic of other BBS morphants, whereas simultaneous suppression of all three members resulted in severely affected embryos, possibly hinting at partial functional redundancy within this protein family.","dc:creator":"Stoetzel C","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Identification of a novel BBS gene (BBS12) highlights the major role of a vertebrate-specific branch of chaperonin-related proteins in Bardet-Biedl syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.7},{"id":"cggv:3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9},{"id":"cggv:50452808-e8c7-4160-92ac-eb9f4815602f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50452808-e8c7-4160-92ac-eb9f4815602f","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:cec9b365-5a3c-403a-aebb-3cf115b38232","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152618.3(BBS12):c.1063C>T (p.Arg355Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251706"}},"detectionMethod":"They combined single-nucleotide– polymorphism array homozygosity mapping and Sanger sequencing of the critical region.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Phenotype of the patients described in this study characterized by progressive retinal degen- eration, obesity, cognitive impairment, polydactyly, and kidney anomalies.","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:94585ca4-435a-4624-86b3-d504a2a2e9ab_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cec9b365-5a3c-403a-aebb-3cf115b38232"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17160889"},"rdfs:label":"III.12 C"},{"id":"cggv:94585ca4-435a-4624-86b3-d504a2a2e9ab","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94585ca4-435a-4624-86b3-d504a2a2e9ab_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:246d582f-b12f-465d-8466-c9061bc12848_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:246d582f-b12f-465d-8466-c9061bc12848","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9ce9f178-2374-4a2b-a713-6ba2df4649cc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152618.3(BBS12):c.2102C>A (p.Ser701Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA358226565"}},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide mapping using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 10K Array.

In this study, we present a consanguineous family from Pakistan with postaxial polydactyly and late-onset retinal dysfunction. Adult affected individuals did not show any renal or genital anomalies, obesity, mental retardation or learning difficulties and did thus not fulfill the proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for BBS. We mapped the disease in this family to the BBS12 locus on chromosome 4q27 and identified the novel homozygous p.S701X nonsense mutation in BBS12 in all three affected individuals of this family. We conclude that BBS12 mutations might cause a very mild phenotype, which is clinically not diagnosed by the current diagnostic criteria for BBS. Consequently, we suggest the use of less strict diagnostic criteria in familial BBS families with mild phenotypic expression.","dc:creator":"Pawlik B","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A Novel Familial BBS12 Mutation Associated with a Mild Phenotype: Implications for Clinical and Molecular Diagnostic Strategies."}},"rdfs:label":"IV-3"},{"id":"cggv:450cc80b-76a2-4a24-89c5-760645d319b3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:450cc80b-76a2-4a24-89c5-760645d319b3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a6bdc7b6-66f3-49f2-85c0-9c31555695b9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a6bdc7b6-66f3-49f2-85c0-9c31555695b9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:a91e75cc-5f81-4d04-9782-60d33a5fe5ad","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152618.3(BBS12):c.1372dup (p.Thr458AsnfsTer5)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658821377"}},{"id":"cggv:9e326dc8-ff0c-482a-9714-8a96b6fd313c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152618.3(BBS12):c.591T>A (p.Tyr197Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA358223259"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0100543","obo:HP_0001513","obo:HP_0000124","obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0000119"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:e197e6dd-5db3-4039-ab9c-593f66e837c6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9e326dc8-ff0c-482a-9714-8a96b6fd313c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36574078","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy characterized by 6 primary features of rod-cone dystrophy, central obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, hypogonadism and/or genitourinary malformations, and kidney abnormalities.

The underlying mechanism is biallelic loss-of function variants in the *BBS12* gene, with the mutation spectrum including predominantly missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants. This curation has collected and scored data from 2 consanguineous families and 1 isolated individual with 4 unique variants (PMID: 17160889, PMID: 20648243, PMID: 36574078). Additional genetic evidence was available in the literature but was not included as the maximum score for this category had already been reached.\n\nExperimental evidence for the gene-disease relationship included a zebrafish model with suppression of *bbs12* expression that exhibited defects in gastrulation and movement such as short body axis, broader somites, kinking of the notochord, and dorsal thinning, similar to the phenotypes caused by silencing of other *BBS* gene orthologs (PMID: 17160889). The participation of the BBS12 protein in a complex with BBS6 and BBS10 was also scored as protein interaction data (PMID: 20080638).\n\nIn summary, *BBS12* is definitively associated with BBS12-related ciliopathy, in which one of the major features is retinal dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence.
