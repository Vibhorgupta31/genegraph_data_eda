We report the delineation of a novel type of CDG identified in 2 children presenting with severe developmental delay, seizures, and dysmorphic features. We detected hypoglycosylation on serum transferrin and cerebrospinal fluid beta-trace protein. Lipid-linked oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum of patient fibroblasts showed an accumulation of the dolichyl pyrophosphate Man(5)GlcNAc(2) structure, compatible with the reduced dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase (DolP-Man synthase) activity detected in these patients. Accordingly, 2 mutant alleles of the DolP-Man synthase DPM1 gene, 1 with a 274C>G transversion, the other with a 628delC deletion, were detected in both siblings. Complementation analysis using DPM1-null murine Thy1-deficient cells confirmed the detrimental effect of both mutations on the enzymatic activity. Furthermore, mannose supplementation failed to improve the glycosylation status of DPM1-deficient fibroblast cells, thus precluding a possible therapeutic application of mannose in the patients. Because DPM1 deficiency, like other subtypes of CDG-I, impairs the assembly of N-glycans, this novel glycosylation defect was named CDG-Ie.","dc:creator":"Imbach T","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Deficiency of dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase-1 causes congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ie."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2a4d2b7f-1de8-4f6c-8136-b62b62e1c226_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f88a721-180a-466a-a490-ad2d4b4b18e9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f88a721-180a-466a-a490-ad2d4b4b18e9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","allele":{"id":"cggv:fd38b8a1-1963-46de-867a-95b0581b3e55","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003859.3(DPM1):c.742T>C (p.Ser248Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA150575"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Cardiac, hepatic & splenic abnormalities","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000518","obo:HP_0000707","obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001263"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:7b64ae25-9580-4862-b8b9-0ae8e1cfece7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fd38b8a1-1963-46de-867a-95b0581b3e55"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36579437","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) and Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are inborn metabolic disorders caused by defects in some metabolic pathways.

Addition of 250 microM mannose to the culture medium corrected the size of the truncated oligosaccharide. Microsomes from fibroblasts of these patients were approximately 95% deficient in dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase activity, with an apparent K(m) for GDP-Man approximately 6-fold higher than normal. DPM1, the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of Dol-P-Man synthase, was altered in both patients. One patient had a point mutation, C(274)G, causing an R(92)G change in the coding sequence.

Here, we report two new CDG Ie patients who present milder symptoms than the five other CDG Ie patients described to date. The clinical pictures of the patients MS and his sister MT are dominated by major ataxia, with no notable hepatic involvement. MS cells accumulate the immature DLO species Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5 and possess only residual Dol-P-Man synthase activity. One homozygous intronic mutation, g.IVS4-5T>A, was found in the DPM1 gene, leading to exon skipping and transcription of a shortened transcript. Moreover, DPM1 expression was reduced by more than 90% in MS cells, in a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)-independent manner.

The biochemical hallmark of CDG-I is a partial absence of complete N-glycans on transferrin. However, recent findings of a diagnostic N-tetrasaccharide for ALG1-CDG and increased high-mannose N-glycans for a few other CDG suggested the potential of glycan structural analysis for CDG-I gene discovery. We analyzed the relative abundance of total plasma N-glycans by high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in a large cohort of 111 CDG-I patients with known (nÂ =Â 75) or unsolved (nÂ =Â 36) genetic cause. We designed single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs) for sequencing of CDG-I candidate genes on the basis of specific N-glycan signatures. Glycomics profiling in patients with known defects revealed novel features such as the N-tetrasaccharide in ALG2-CDG patients and a novel fucosylated N-pentasaccharide as specific glycomarker for ALG1-CDG. Moreover, group-specific high-mannose N-glycan signatures were found in ALG3-, ALG9-, ALG11-, ALG12-, RFT1-, SRD5A3-, DOLK-, DPM1-, DPM3-, MPDU1-, ALG13-CDG, and hereditary fructose intolerance. Further differential analysis revealed high-mannose profiles, characteristic for ALG12- and ALG9-CDG. Prediction of candidate genes by glycomics profiling in 36 patients with thus far unsolved CDG-I and subsequent smMIPs sequencing led to a yield of solved cases of 78% (28/36). Combined plasma glycomics profiling and targeted smMIPs sequencing of candidate genes is a powerful approach to identify causative mutations in CDG-I patient cohorts.","dc:creator":"Abu Bakar N","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Synergistic use of glycomics and single-molecule molecular inversion probes for identification of congenital disorders of glycosylation type-1."}},{"id":"cggv:b2c0da47-9688-4487-846e-b72eb5a65485_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:63fc088f-6ff6-4c26-bfda-3219d432d589"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35279850"}],"rdfs:label":"P89_CDGIx"},{"id":"cggv:94f55604-dffc-4a72-b6ed-ae18c090d06a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94f55604-dffc-4a72-b6ed-ae18c090d06a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:b2c0da47-9688-4487-846e-b72eb5a65485","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b2c0da47-9688-4487-846e-b72eb5a65485_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7fde5de2-8326-49ee-960b-672b405e2552_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7fde5de2-8326-49ee-960b-672b405e2552","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:fd38b8a1-1963-46de-867a-95b0581b3e55"},{"id":"cggv:1d13b2e2-1df2-40bb-b565-7964aeaa8f68","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003859.3(DPM1):c.564-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA315296461"}}],"detectionMethod":"confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"paquigiria, Arterial hypertension, ovale foramen, ureterohydronephrosis, pielonephritis, Plaquetopenia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0003458","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0011123","obo:HP_0011344","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0003642","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0032118","obo:HP_0012444","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001928","obo:HP_0030084","obo:HP_0010553"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:0e785750-d774-441e-982f-42b4c155dedb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fd38b8a1-1963-46de-867a-95b0581b3e55"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653653","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are defects in glycoprotein and glycolipid glycan synthesis and attachment. They affect multiple organ/systems, but non-specific symptoms render the diagnosis of the different CDG very challenging. Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2)-CDG is the most common CDG, but advances in genetic analysis have shown others to occur more commonly than previously thought. The present work reports the clinical and mutational spectrum of 25 non-PMM2 CDG patients. The most common clinical symptoms were hypotonia (80%), motor or psychomotor disability (80%) and craniofacial dysmorphism (76%). Based on their serum transferrin isoform profile, 18 were classified as CDG-I and 7 as CDG-II. Pathogenic variations were found in 16 genes (ALG1, ALG6, ATP6V0A2, B4GALT1, CCDC115, COG7, DOLK, DPAGT1, DPM1, GFPT1, MPI, PGM1, RFT1, SLC35A2, SRD5A3, and SSR4). Overall, 27 variants were identified, 12 of which are novel. The results highlight the importance of combining genetic and biochemical analyses for the early diagnosis of this heterogeneous group of disorders.","dc:creator":"Medrano C","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Clinical and molecular diagnosis of non-phosphomannomutase 2 N-linked congenital disorders of glycosylation in Spain."}},{"id":"cggv:1f0dfbd3-676d-45b1-8122-ebe8e7201547_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1d13b2e2-1df2-40bb-b565-7964aeaa8f68"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653653"}],"rdfs:label":"p17"},{"id":"cggv:1f0dfbd3-676d-45b1-8122-ebe8e7201547","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f0dfbd3-676d-45b1-8122-ebe8e7201547_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"There are only 9 exons, the new stop codon will be in the final exon so NMD is not predicted and the variant should be downgraded"},{"id":"cggv:0e785750-d774-441e-982f-42b4c155dedb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e785750-d774-441e-982f-42b4c155dedb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0e785750-d774-441e-982f-42b4c155dedb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Yes, In Ardiccioni C, et al., 2016 (PMID: 26729507), functional analysis of DPM1 mutants was performed by injecting human DPM1 mRNA following DPM1 morpholino injection, and embryos were scored as normal or affected.

The present case is the first individual described with DPM1-CDG (CDG-Ie) to also have clinical and muscle biopsy findings consistent with dystroglycanopathy.","dc:creator":"Yang AC","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Congenital disorder of glycosylation due to DPM1 mutations presenting with dystroglycanopathy-type congenital muscular dystrophy."}},{"id":"cggv:4a42bef1-f146-4989-8c86-8fa3f961b3b7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1feb8bc0-a03f-421e-8e8d-59c7cc810965"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23856421"}],"rdfs:label":"Male infant"},{"id":"cggv:4a42bef1-f146-4989-8c86-8fa3f961b3b7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4a42bef1-f146-4989-8c86-8fa3f961b3b7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ae56e9d5-004b-4d06-81d1-2fe996d68a35","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae56e9d5-004b-4d06-81d1-2fe996d68a35_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ae56e9d5-004b-4d06-81d1-2fe996d68a35_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transfection of the p.Gly152Val variant plasmid into cultured human 293T cells was performed.

We reported previously that mammalian DPM synthase contains catalytic DPM1 and regulatory DPM2 subunits, and that DPM1 requires DPM2 for its stable expression in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report that human DPM synthase consists of three subunits. The third subunit, DPM3, comprises 92 amino acids associated with DPM1 via its C-terminal domain and with DPM2 via its N-terminal portion. The stability of DPM3 was dependent upon DPM2. However, overexpression of DPM3 in Lec15 cells, a null mutant of DPM2, restored the biosynthesis of DPM with an increase in DPM1, indicating that DPM3 directly stabilized DPM1. Therefore, DPM2 stabilizes DPM3 and DPM3 stabilizes DPM1. DPM synthase activity was 10 times higher in the presence of DPM2, indicating that DPM2 also plays a role in the enzymatic reaction. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has proteins that resemble three human subunits; S.pombe DPM3 restored biosynthesis of DPM in Lec15 cells, indicating its orthologous relationship to human DPM3.","dc:creator":"Maeda Y","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Human dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase consists of three subunits, DPM1, DPM2 and DPM3."},"rdfs:label":"Maeda et al.

At least 9 unique variants (such as missense, frameshift, or deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands from publications (PMIDs:15669674, 10642602, 10642597, 27481510, 16641202, 23856421, 30653653 and 35910228).  Patients have a range of symptoms, including severe developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, eye abnormalities (retinopathy, nystagmus, strabismus), and severe gastrointestinal involvement. No supporting segregation information is available. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of DPM1, which encodes the cytoplasmic catalytic subunit of dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase, an enzyme complex that synthesizes dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) from GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate (PMID: 10835346). DPM1 knockdown in a zebrafish model displayed features of congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1e (CDG1e) associated with DPM1 mutations, such as microcephaly, smaller eyes, kinked tail, and occasional vascular defects in the tail vein. In that same model, rescue of the phenotype was done and was restored. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.  A classification of DEFINITIVE was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on 10/4/23 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2a4d2b7f-1de8-4f6c-8136-b62b62e1c226"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
