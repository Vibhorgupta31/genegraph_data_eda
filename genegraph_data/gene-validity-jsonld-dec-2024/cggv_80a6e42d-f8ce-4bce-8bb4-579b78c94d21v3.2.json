However, the functional interactions between the corresponding proteins are only partly known. Here, we show that KDM5C, encoding a H3K4 demethylase, is at the intersection of transcriptional axes under the control of three regulatory proteins ARX, ZNF711 and PHF8. Interestingly, mutations in all four genes (KDM5C, ARX, ZNF711 and PHF8) are associated with X-linked NDDs comprising intellectual disability as a core feature. in vitro analysis of the KDM5C promoter revealed that ARX and ZNF711 function as antagonist transcription factors that activate KDM5C expression and compete for the recruitment of PHF8. Functional analysis of mutations in these genes showed a correlation between phenotype severity and the reduction in KDM5C transcriptional activity. The KDM5C decrease was associated with a lack of repression of downstream target genes Scn2a, Syn1 and Bdnf in the embryonic brain of Arx-null mice. Aiming to correct the faulty expression of KDM5C, we studied the effect of the FDA-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA). In Arx-KO murine ES-derived neurons, SAHA was able to rescue KDM5C depletion, recover H3K4me3 signalling and improve neuronal differentiation. Indeed, in ARX/alr-1-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans animals, SAHA was shown to counteract the defective KDM5C/rbr-2-H3K4me3 signalling, recover abnormal behavioural phenotype and ameliorate neuronal maturation. Overall, our studies indicate that KDM5C is a conserved and druggable effector molecule across a number of NDDs for whom the use of SAHA may be considered a potential therapeutic strategy.","dc:creator":"Poeta L","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Histone demethylase KDM5C is a SAHA-sensitive central hub at the crossroads of transcriptional axes involved in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders."},"rdfs:label":"Synergistic transactivation of KDM5C promoter"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Direct protein interaction also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation in Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al.

(PMID: 19377476) who reported a frameshift and nonsense variant transmitted within two large pedigrees with several affected males with intellectual disability and no other observable phenotypes. van der Werf et al. (2017, PMID: 27993705) reported two multigenerational families with X-linked complex NDD segregating with *ZNF711* variants (frameshift and missense). Four additional *ZNF711* variants have been reported by Wang et al. (2022, PMID: 34992252); 3 nonsense variants and one *de novo* missense variant observed in families or individual probands affected by X-linked complex NDD.  Segregation evidence from Tarpey et al. (2009), van der Werf et al. (2017), and Wang et al. (2022) resulted in 3 additional points. The maximum genetic evidence score (12 points) was reached. Of note, missense variants in individual probands were of unclear pathogenicity and were not scored (PMIDs: 25649377, 28135719). An additional novel variant (c.127_129delGTT, p.V43del, GRCh37/hg19) (ClinVar SCV:002030756.1) has been identified in a family affected by X-linked complex NDD enrolled in the Brain Gene Registry, but was not scored at this time.\n\n Experimental evidence implicates *ZNF711* in a regulatory network of syntenic, X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder-associated genes (*KDM5C, ARX, PHF8*) based on a series of studies demonstrating spatiotemporal expression patterns in developing human and mouse brains (PMID: 34356104), protein interactions (PMID: 31691806, PMID: 20346720), functional alteration in patient-derived cells (PMID: 34356104), and rescue experiments in cell culture models (PMID: 34356104 , PMID: 31691806) that are consistent with observed clinical phenotypes. Three points were given for the experimental evidence, bringing the total to 15 points.\n\nGiven supportive evidence from multiple publications over 13 years, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ZNF711* and X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nNote: This gene was originally curated by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/3/2020. It was reevaluated on 9/22/2022 (SOP 9). New genetic evidence described additional cases and families harboring ZNF711 variants and additional experimental evidence was added.
