The main phenotypic features include severe to profound developmental impairment, often with non-verbal and non-ambulatory presentations, severe hypotonia, infantile-onset seizures, and spastic quadriplegia. More variable features include congenital joint contractures, hyperkinetic movement disorders, macrocephaly, developmental regression, autism spectrum disorder, and early death. Five recurrent and/or functionally validated *de novo* missense variants reported in 12 individuals are included in this curation (PMIDs: 30343943, 33776624). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is gain of function (PMID: 30343943). *De novo* missense variants without functional evidence or truncating variants (PMIDs: 30343943, 34702355) were not scored. Additional evidence is needed to clarify the implication of these variants in this condition.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *CACNA1E* and  autosomal dominant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 6, 2023 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0cf0db0a-4af2-4e60-ab64-ce0115241caf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
