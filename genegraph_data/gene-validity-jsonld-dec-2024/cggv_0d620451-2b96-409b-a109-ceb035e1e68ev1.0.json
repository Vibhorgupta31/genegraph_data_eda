Cytochrome c1, the heme-containing component of complex III, mediates the transfer of electrons from the Rieske iron-sulfur protein to cytochrome c. Cytochrome c1 is present at reduced levels in the skeletal muscle and skin fibroblasts of affected individuals. Moreover, studies on yeast mutants and affected individuals' fibroblasts have shown that exogenous expression of wild-type CYC1 rescues complex III activity, demonstrating the deleterious effect of each mutation on cytochrome c1 stability and complex III activity.","dc:creator":"Gaignard P","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in CYC1, encoding cytochrome c1 subunit of respiratory chain complex III, cause insulin-responsive hyperglycemia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0d620451-2b96-409b-a109-ceb035e1e68e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1137341-1a2a-4144-857a-ad30db798394_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1137341-1a2a-4144-857a-ad30db798394","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:619b3d5e-340d-4404-8f42-ea1354bed7f3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001916.5(CYC1):c.949C>T (p.Arg317Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/870566"}},"detectionMethod":"Also conducted mitogenome which was negative ","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Recurrent Optic Neuritis and demyelinating disease, LHON","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:bdd7e1b5-0791-4332-8f4e-c1d27ab13606_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:619b3d5e-340d-4404-8f42-ea1354bed7f3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34252606","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Complex III (CIII) is the third out of five mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes residing at the mitochondrial inner membrane. The assembly of 10 subunits encoded by nuclear DNA and one by mitochondrial DNA result in the functional CIII which transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. Deficiencies of CIII are among the least investigated mitochondrial disorders and thus clinical spectrum of patients with mutations in CIII is not well defined. We report on a 10-year-old girl born to consanguineous Iranian parents presenting with recurrent visual loss episodes and optic nerve contrast enhancement in brain imaging reminiscent of an acquired demyelination syndrome (i.e. optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis), who was ultimately confirmed to have a novel homozygous missense variant of unknown significance, c.949C > T; p.(Arg317Trp) in the CYC1 gene, a nuclear DNA subunit of complex III of the mitochondrial chain. Sanger sequencing confirmed the segregation of this variant with disease in the family. The effect of this variant on the protein structure was shown in-silico. Our findings, not only expand the clinical spectrum due to defects in CYC1 gene but also highlight that mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders could be considered as a potential differential diagnosis in children who present with unusual patterns of acquired demyelination syndromes (ADS). In addition, our results support the hypothesis that mitochondrial disorders might have an overlapping presentation with ADS.","dc:creator":"Heidari E","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Defective complex III mitochondrial respiratory chain due to a novel variant in CYC1 gene masquerades acute demyelinating syndrome or Leber hereditary optic neuropathy."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 1 Heidari"},{"id":"cggv:bdd7e1b5-0791-4332-8f4e-c1d27ab13606","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdd7e1b5-0791-4332-8f4e-c1d27ab13606_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Did not score due to inconsistent phenotype overlap with previous reports and no functional studies to suggest complex III deficiency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:20cee3b1-6430-4e3a-b2bf-cc959db4234a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20cee3b1-6430-4e3a-b2bf-cc959db4234a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:6393cdfa-c583-4154-a037-bf4b06068c91","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001916.5(CYC1):c.288G>T (p.Trp96Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144825"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Ketoacidosis (pH 7.04) precipitated by febrile illness\nLactate (13mmol.L)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0005979","obo:HP_0001987","obo:HP_0004897"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"BCS1L, UQCRB, TTC19 (genes previously associated with CIII defects), and UQCR10 was negative\n\nOf note, it does not mention MT-CYB was tested for this patient","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c7f5e1ec-8d49-45dd-b86b-990d7ec81d0f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6393cdfa-c583-4154-a037-bf4b06068c91"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23910460"},"rdfs:label":"P1- Gaignard"},{"id":"cggv:c7f5e1ec-8d49-45dd-b86b-990d7ec81d0f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7f5e1ec-8d49-45dd-b86b-990d7ec81d0f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c7f5e1ec-8d49-45dd-b86b-990d7ec81d0f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Variant YEAST STUDIES"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.1 + 0.4 (Immunoblot in Yeast W76C (ortholog position) showed near complete absence of Cyt C1 and CIII- Fig 2E) + 0.4 (Patient FCL with lentiviral construct roughly double complex III activity)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c25fa4ab-28c8-4766-9ccf-e0055a6d3980_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c25fa4ab-28c8-4766-9ccf-e0055a6d3980","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:57212b85-8488-41a0-8e2a-2f4173449396","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001916.5(CYC1):c.643C>T (p.Leu215Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144827"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Insulin responsive hyerpglycemia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001987","obo:HP_0001942","obo:HP_0001562","obo:HP_0004897","obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0003074"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"aCGH","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:d8935efe-2751-44f8-9c0c-ba5a0ee64363_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:57212b85-8488-41a0-8e2a-2f4173449396"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27074787","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hyperglycemia is a rare presenting symptom of mitochondrial disorders.

The *CYC1* gene encodes a subunit of complex III and plays an important role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain by transferring electrons from the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1) to cytochrome *c*. \n\nThe *CYC1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID:23910460). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *CYC1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the CYC1 phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two unique missense variants identified in three cases from two publications (PMIDs: 23910460, 27074787). The Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel reviewed scoring guidance for homozygous variants in cases with consanguinity and decided that no scoring alteration was needed in these cases given (1) comprehensive analyses (exome sequencing) were performed, (2) homozygous variants are a common cause of mitochondrial disease, and (3) biochemical evidence in these cases supported a complex III defect. Individuals with *CYC1*-related mitochondrial disease reported in the literature had neonatal insulin-responsive hyperglycemia, stress/infection-induced metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonemia with or without hepatic failure (PMID: 27074787).  A fourth case was reported with a homozygous missense variant in *CYC1*, and this individual had recurrent optic neuritis. However, this case was not included for scoring in this gene-disease curation as this individual had a markedly different phenotype to that reported in other affected individuals with *CYC1* variants and there was no evidence of complex III deficiency and/or other evidence to support the impact of the variant (PMID: 34252606). This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue models in patient cells (PMIDs: 23910460, 28844695). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 21, 2022 (SOP Version 8).
