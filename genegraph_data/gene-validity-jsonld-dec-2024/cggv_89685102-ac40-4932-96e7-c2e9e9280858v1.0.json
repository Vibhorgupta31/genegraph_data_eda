These findings position aberrant mTOR activation at the nexus of these germline neoplastic conditions and suggest the use of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","dc:creator":"Shaw RJ","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"The LKB1 tumor suppressor negatively regulates mTOR signaling."},"rdfs:label":"Non-patient cells 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Editing this down to 0.25, to be added to additional experiment showing mTOR activation for another 0.25, for a total of 0.5 points this paper."},{"id":"cggv:e22f4b56-56d5-48c1-ba9b-3e81654dd203","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf20c31f-e4d0-4d5d-bb8f-d71ec6a6272a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"mTor signalling still active under low ATP conditions (Figure 1).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15261145","rdfs:label":"Non-patient cells 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Editing this down to 0.25, to be added to subsequent experiment showing mTOR activation for another 0.25, for a total of 0.5 points this paper."},{"id":"cggv:1d3ca312-fa52-44e3-b759-a9b5a61c1f93","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e90508bc-18c6-45af-94ec-e5c76e129b37","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Confirmed using Western blot in HeLa cells that these variants cause a marked decrease of autophosphorylation activity compared to wild-type. these specifically impair the AMPK pathway known to be involved in tumorigenesis and PJS phenotype.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15800014","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Germline mutations of the LKB1 gene are responsible for the cancer-prone Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). LKB1 encodes a serine-threonine kinase that acts as a regulator of cell cycle, metabolism and cell polarity. The majority of PJS missense mutations abolish LKB1 enzymatic activity and thereby impair all functions assigned to LKB1. Here, we have investigated the functional consequences of recurrent missense mutations identified in PJS and in sporadic tumors which map in the LKB1 C-terminal non-catalytic region. We report that these C-terminal mutations neither disrupt LKB1 kinase activity nor interfere with LKB1-induced growth arrest. However, these naturally occuring mutations lessened LKB1-mediated activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and impaired downstream signaling. Furthermore, C-terminal mutations compromise LKB1 ability to establish and maintain polarity of both intestinal epithelial cells and migrating astrocytes. Consistent with these findings, mutational analysis reveals that the LKB1 tail exerts an essential function in the control of cell polarity. Overall, our results ascribe a crucial regulatory role to the LKB1 C-terminal region. Our findings further indicate that LKB1 tumor suppressor activity is likely to depend on the regulation of AMPK signaling and cell polarization.","dc:creator":"Forcet C","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Functional analysis of Peutz-Jeghers mutations reveals that the LKB1 C-terminal region exerts a crucial role in regulating both the AMPK pathway and the cell polarity."},"rdfs:label":"In vitro assay Western Blot analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:89685102-ac40-4932-96e7-c2e9e9280858_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:75e6cff3-0054-4a95-ad8b-001967569295","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47bea40e-7f57-4a9e-a539-3f7a73972a80","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Loss of Stk11 in mammary glands caused the formation of mammary tumors in mice with histopathological features similar to that of breast tumors in humans with PJS.

PJS polyps are unusual neoplasms characterized by marked epithelial and stromal overgrowth but have limited malignant potential. Here we show that Lkb1(+/-) mice develop intestinal polyps identical to those seen in individuals affected with PJS. Consistent with this in vivo tumour suppressor function, Lkb1 deficiency prevents culture-induced senescence without loss of Ink4a/Arf or p53. Despite compromised mortality, Lkb1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts show resistance to transformation by activated Ha-Ras either alone or with immortalizing oncogenes. This phenotype is in agreement with the paucity of mutations in Ras seen in PJS polyps and suggests that loss of Lkb1 function as an early neoplastic event renders cells resistant to subsequent oncogene-induced transformation. In addition, the Lkb1 transcriptome shows modulation of factors linked to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, cell adhesion and inhibition of Ras transformation. Together, our data rationalize several features of PJS polyposis--notably its peculiar histopathological presentation and limited malignant potential--and place Lkb1 in a distinct class of tumour suppressors.","dc:creator":"Bardeesy N","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Loss of the Lkb1 tumour suppressor provokes intestinal polyposis but resistance to transformation."},"rdfs:label":"Bardeesy 2002 Animal Model 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7271,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:48f788db-a9ae-4fc0-b1b4-4c1aebdceb3e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008280","gene":"hgnc:11389","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*STK11* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) in 1998 (Jenne et al. and Hemmiki et al., PMIDs 9425897 and 9428765). PJS is characterized by the development of gastrointestinal (GI) PJS-type hamartomatous polyps and mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation, which most often presents in childhood and fades by puberty. GI polyps present a significant clinical burden and can cause chronic bleeding and intussusception in individuals with PJS. Individuals with PJS have been reported to have an increased cumulative lifetime risk for various cancers, including female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, small bowel cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, non-epithelial sex cord tumors of the ovary, and Sertoli cell testicular tumors. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the described phenotypic manifestations and tumor spectrum has been lumped into one disease entity: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (OMIM: 175200). Fourteen variants (missense, in-frame deletions/insertions, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangements) that have been reported in 14 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 9425897, 9428765, 12865922, 15121768, 30689838) were included in this curation. Variants reported are largely truncations and gross deletions, and additional evidence of familial co-segregation supports their association with PJS. Furthermore, large-scale meta analyses and case control analyses show the association of cancer susceptibility in individuals with PJS (PMIDs: 23415580, 11113065, 16707622). Data from these studies is largely from highly-ascertained cohorts and may overestimate cancer risks. At least one large-scale population-based study contradicts the high risk of breast cancer reported in the literature (PMID: 33471991). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (6 points, PMIDs: 15800014, 10441497, 15261145, 19681070, 12226664, 15987703, 9425897). In non-patient cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), deleterious effects such as hyperactivated mTOR signaling was observed when *Stk11* was lost. Mouse models of loss of *Stk11* replicating the human phenotype including mammary tumors and small intestine hamartomatous polyps. In summary, *STK11* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive on 2/22/2017 by Colon Cancer GCEP. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 5/26/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:89685102-ac40-4932-96e7-c2e9e9280858"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
