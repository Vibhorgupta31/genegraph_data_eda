To analyze the functions of one such holoenzyme in vivo, we generated mice lacking PR61/B'δ (B56δ), a subunit highly expressed in neural tissues. In PR61/B'δ-null mice the microtubule-associated protein tau becomes progressively phosphorylated at pathological epitopes in restricted brain areas, with marked immunoreactivity for the misfolded MC1-conformation but without neurofibrillary tangle formation. Behavioral tests indicated impaired sensorimotor but normal cognitive functions. These phenotypical characteristics were further underscored in PR61/B'δ-null mice mildly overexpressing human tau. PR61/B'δ-containing PP2A (PP2A(T61δ)) poorly dephosphorylates tau in vitro, arguing against a direct dephosphorylation defect. Rather, the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, a major tau kinase, was found increased, with decreased phosphorylation of Ser-9, a putative cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) target. Accordingly, CDK5 activity is decreased, and its cellular activator p35, strikingly absent in the affected brain areas. As opposed to tau, p35 is an excellent PP2A(T61δ) substrate. Our data imply a nonredundant function for PR61/B'δ in phospho-tau homeostasis via an unexpected spatially restricted mechanism preventing p35 hyperphosphorylation and its subsequent degradation.","dc:creator":"Louis JV","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Mice lacking phosphatase PP2A subunit PR61/B'delta (Ppp2r5d) develop spatially restricted tauopathy by deregulation of CDK5 and GSK3beta."},"rdfs:label":"Louis et al.

The product of this gene belongs to the phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B family. It is implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. Variants in the PPP2R5D gene were first implicated in intellectual disability in 2015, when a Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study (PMID:25533962) reported a two de novo missense variants in the gene. At least eight variants (i.e. missense variants) have been reported in individuals with ID across five publications (PMID: 25533962, 26168268, 25972378, 26576547 and 33628804). \u000b\nThe relationship between PPP2R5D and syndromic ID is supported by knock out models using brain stem and spinal cord of PR61/B’δ KO mice. Louis et al. (2011) (PMID: 21482799) showed that Ppp2r5d-null mice developed a progressive increase in phosphorylated tau in the brainstem and spinal cord compared to wildtype mice. These changes were associated with progressive sensorimotor deficits, but not cognitive dysfunction.\n\nAfter assessing the case level and experimental data, the group concluded that there was definitive evidence for the relationship between PPP2R5D and syndromic ID. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability/Autism GCEP on the meeting date 8/26/21 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4b43ff91-1ea4-475b-97d9-6fbda924ea16"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
