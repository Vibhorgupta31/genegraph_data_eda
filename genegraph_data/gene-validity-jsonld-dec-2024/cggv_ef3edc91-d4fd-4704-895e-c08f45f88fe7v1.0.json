This condition is characterized by myoclonic tremor onset in the second to third decade of life, followed by onset of seizures, with considerable phenotypic variability (PMID: 31664034). Originally, in 2001, genome-wide linkage analysis was used to identify a region spanning 2p11.1-q12.2 (PMID: 11701600). In 2014, within that region, an indel in *ADRA2B* was found to segregate with disease in two families (PMID: 24114805). Subsequently (in 2019), a variant in a different gene (intronic ATTTC expansions in *STARD7*) within the linkage region was found to segregate with disease in 158 individuals from 22 families, including the originally reported families (PMID: 31664034). Therefore, the originally reported *ADRA2B* variant was no longer considered to be causative for the familiesâ€™ epilepsy. No additional variants in *ADRA2B* have been reported in individuals with epilepsy. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *ADRA2B* and autosomal dominant epilepsy has been refuted and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date June 18, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\nAn alternative genetic cause of disease (intronic ATTTC expansions in STARD7) was identified for all reported individuals with ADRA2B variants and epilepsy. No valid evidence remains to support the relationship between ADRA2B and epilepsy.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ef3edc91-d4fd-4704-895e-c08f45f88fe7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
