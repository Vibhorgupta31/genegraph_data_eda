Class III myosins are hybrid motor-signaling molecules, with an N-terminal kinase domain, highly conserved head and neck domains, and a class III-specific tail domain. In Drosophila rhabdomeres, NINAC interacts with actin filaments and with a PDZ scaffolding protein to organize the phototransduction machinery into a signaling complex. Recessive null mutations in Drosophila NINAC delay termination of the photoreceptor response and lead to progressive retinal degeneration. Here, we show that normal hearing in humans requires myosin IIIA, the human homolog of NINAC. In an extended Israeli family, nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss is caused by three different recessive, loss-of-function mutations in myosin IIIA. Of 18 affected relatives in Family N, 7 are homozygous and 11 are compound heterozygous for pairs of mutant alleles. Expression of mammalian myosin IIIA is highly restricted, with the strongest expression in retina and cochlea. The involvement of homologous class III myosins in both Drosophila vision and human hearing is an evolutionary link between these sensory systems.","dc:creator":"Walsh T","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"From flies' eyes to our ears: mutations in a human class III myosin cause progressive nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNB30."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8fa3d7b-73a2-43a3-8f13-7dac3fd27737_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8fa3d7b-73a2-43a3-8f13-7dac3fd27737_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:556196e7-bbd7-4c23-b984-e5e03844529e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8042f43-5d3c-46a1-b205-1700237bfac8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In situ hybridization showed myosin IIIA expression in the inner and outer hair cells of mouse cochlea.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12032315","rdfs:label":"Walsh 2002 Function 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a8fa3d7b-73a2-43a3-8f13-7dac3fd27737_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ad5740f-2ff6-4823-8a47-e6f64604444f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bab3482e-5273-45c0-a7a1-7b4bfdc69e78","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"At 8 days, 6 months, and 8.5 months scanning electron microscopy showed normally shaped, well-organized sterocilia hair bundles.

This knowledge deficit is ultimately affecting the development of genetic diagnoses. We used whole exome sequencing to investigate gene variants, pathways of interactive genes and the fractions of ancestral overderived alleles for 159 HI genes among 18 Cameroonian patients with non-syndromic HI (NSHI) and 129 ethnically matched controls. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic (PLP) variants were found in MYO3A, MYO15A and COL9A3, with a resolution rate of 50% (9/18 patients). The study identified significant genetic differentiation in novel population-specific gene variants at FOXD4L2, DHRS2L6, RPL3L and VTN between HI patients and controls. These gene variants are found in functional/co-expressed interactive networks with other known HI-associated genes and in the same pathways with VTN being a hub protein, that is, focal adhesion pathway and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (P-values <0.05). The results suggest that these novel population-specific gene variants are possible modifiers of the HI phenotypes. We found a high proportion of ancestral allele versus derived at low HI patients-specific minor allele frequency in the range of 0.0-0.1. The results showed a relatively low pickup rate of PLP variants in known genes in this group of Cameroonian patients with NSHI. In addition, findings may signal an evolutionary enrichment of some variants of HI genes in patients, as the result of polygenic adaptation, and suggest the possibility of multigenic influence on the phenotype of congenital HI, which deserves further investigations.","dc:creator":"Wonkam A","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Whole exome sequencing reveals pathogenic variants in MYO3A, MYO15A and COL9A3 and differential frequencies in ancestral alleles in hearing impairment genes among individuals from Cameroon."}},"rdfs:label":"Wonkam proband "},{"id":"cggv:e6d1677b-87b2-465a-81b1-2ddf27ae2d23","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e6d1677b-87b2-465a-81b1-2ddf27ae2d23_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"gnomAD MAF too high"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ad87fc17-5a2a-40e9-a937-655ae98d4cdb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad87fc17-5a2a-40e9-a937-655ae98d4cdb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":52,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:d9538872-d10e-403c-ad86-984f10ef15ba","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017433.5(MYO3A):c.1588dup (p.Tyr530LeufsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658653639"}},{"id":"cggv:e6d637f6-cde7-4b62-8017-991cffc3d3ed","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017433.5(MYO3A):c.580C>A (p.Pro194Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5444356"}}],"detectionMethod":"Targeted exome sequencing of 80 NSHL genes ","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000365","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:050a4a62-2f28-4980-b304-a7907f318a35_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d9538872-d10e-403c-ad86-984f10ef15ba"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23990876","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Identification of causative genes for hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is important to decide treatment modalities and to counsel the patients. Due to the genetic heterogeneity in sensorineural genetic disorders, the high-throughput method can be adapted for the efficient diagnosis. To this end, we designed a new diagnostic pipeline to screen all the reported candidate genes for NSHL. For validation of the diagnostic pipeline, we focused upon familial NSHL cases that are most likely to be genetic, rather than to be infectious or environmental. Among the 32 familial NSHL cases, we were able to make a molecular genetic diagnosis from 12 probands (37.5%) in the first stage by their clinical features, characteristic inheritance pattern and further candidate gene sequencing of GJB2, SLC26A4, POU3F4 or mitochondrial DNA. Next we applied targeted resequencing on 80 NSHL genes in the remaining 20 probands. Each proband carried 4.8 variants that were not synonymous and had the occurring frequency of less than three among the 20 probands. These variants were then filtered out with the inheritance pattern of the family, allele frequency in normal hearing 80 control subjects, clinical features. Finally NSHL-causing candidate mutations were identified in 13(65%) of the 20 probands of multiplex families, bringing the total solve rate (or detection rate) in our familial cases to be 78.1% (25/32) Damaging mutations discovered by the targeted resequencing were distributed in nine genes such as WFS1, COCH, EYA4, MYO6, GJB3, COL11A2, OTOF, STRC and MYO3A, most of which were private.

As this is seen as inadequate, there is a need for high-throughput diagnostic methods to detect disease-causing variations, including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (Indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). In this study, a targeted resequencing panel for hearing loss was developed including 79 genes for NSHL and selected forms of syndromic hearing loss. One-hundred thirty one presumed autosomal-recessive NSHL (arNSHL) patients of Western-European ethnicity were analyzed for SNVs, Indels, and CNVs. In addition, we established a straightforward variant classification system to deal with the large number of variants encountered. We estimate that combining prescreening of GJB2 with our panel leads to a diagnosis in 25%-30% of patients. Our data show that after GJB2, the most commonly mutated genes in a Western-European population are TMC1, MYO15A, and MYO7A (3.1%). CNV analysis resulted in the identification of causative variants in two patients in OTOA and STRC. One of the major challenges for diagnostic gene panels is assigning pathogenicity for variants. A collaborative database collecting all identified variants from multiple centers could be a valuable resource for hearing loss diagnostics.","dc:creator":"Sommen M","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"DNA Diagnostics of Hereditary Hearing Loss: A Targeted Resequencing Approach Combined with a Mutation Classification System."}},{"id":"cggv:f10dd1bd-a96c-45c4-b08e-2c8e6c619821_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9c71042a-8db1-4440-a6a9-f41edd03c1be"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27068579"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 7"},{"id":"cggv:e1c92726-0ebf-4d09-87c3-ccd6010bd7e7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e1c92726-0ebf-4d09-87c3-ccd6010bd7e7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:f10dd1bd-a96c-45c4-b08e-2c8e6c619821","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f10dd1bd-a96c-45c4-b08e-2c8e6c619821_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a8fa3d7b-73a2-43a3-8f13-7dac3fd27737_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.9},{"id":"cggv:50bf1f04-0291-419e-872e-f0a7b73ad04a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50bf1f04-0291-419e-872e-f0a7b73ad04a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":55,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ae4cf60c-f0de-46b1-9c3b-64d27986adbd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017433.5(MYO3A):c.1370_1371del (p.Arg457fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/655296"}},"detectionMethod":"OtoSCOPE-negative families from a targeted gene panel covering deafness-associated genes were screened by exome sequencing","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012715","obo:HP_0001730"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"all patients underwent genetic screening for pathogenic variants in GJB2 using Sanger sequencing","secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:08600daf-0376-4a72-9568-ca997797da29_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ae4cf60c-f0de-46b1-9c3b-64d27986adbd"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33713422","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common sensory defects affecting more than 466 million individuals worldwide. It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous with over 120 genes causing non-syndromic HL identified to date. Here, we performed exome sequencing (ES) on a cohort of Iranian families with no disease-causing variants in known deafness-associated genes after screening with a targeted gene panel. We identified likely causal variants in 20 out of 71 families screened. Fifteen families segregated variants in known deafness-associated genes. Eight families segregated variants in novel candidate genes for HL: DBH, TOP3A, COX18, USP31, TCF19, SCP2, TENM1, and CARMIL1. In the three of these families, intrafamilial locus heterogeneity was observed with variants in both known and novel candidate genes. In aggregate, we were able to identify the underlying genetic cause of HL in nearly 30% of our study cohort using ES. This study corroborates the observation that high-throughput DNA sequencing in populations with high rates of consanguineous marriages represents a more appropriate strategy to elucidate the genetic etiology of heterogeneous conditions such as HL.","dc:creator":"Mohseni M","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Exome sequencing utility in defining the genetic landscape of hearing loss and novel-gene discovery in Iran."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband V:2"},{"id":"cggv:08600daf-0376-4a72-9568-ca997797da29","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08600daf-0376-4a72-9568-ca997797da29_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity and homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:37042376-ecd8-4a42-83c5-5f55f7440fa2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37042376-ecd8-4a42-83c5-5f55f7440fa2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":57,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7ee2d239-eb8a-439d-9779-085a705036c7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017433.5(MYO3A):c.3129T>G (p.Tyr1043Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252973"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequencing coding regions and splice sites of all candidate genes.

At least 10 variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense) have been reported in 7 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 12032315, 23990876, 27063751, 27068579, 30682115, 34423747, 33713422). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 19 additional members of one family (PMID: 12032315). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, functional alteration studies, and two mouse models, a knock-out and a knock-in mouse model that harbors a patient variant that have both provided significant evidence for the gene-disease relationship (PMIDs: 12032315, 21165622, 26754646).  In summary, *MYO3A* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally classified as Strong by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 11/15/2017 as per SOP v6. It was reevaluated on 6/1/2023 as per SOP v9. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Strong to Definitive with the addition of a new case level evidence from new literature published (PMIDs: 27068579, 30682115, 34423747, 33713422).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a8fa3d7b-73a2-43a3-8f13-7dac3fd27737"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
