Dermal cultured fibroblasts from the proband were shown to produce both normal and heavily overmodified type-I collagen. The mutation introduced a local conformational perturbation, which causes abnormal exposure of arginine residues; the triple helical domain was susceptible to trypsin digestion even at 30 degrees C. The chains bearing the point mutation were poorly secreted and short-term pulse experiments showed that the extensive intracellular retention of mutant trimers also impaired the secretion of normal chains. The molecular defect was localized in a COL1A1 allele by cloning and sequencing a cDNA region corresponding to the CB6 peptide. A G to C transversion which causes the substitution in the triple helical region of Gly910 with alanine was found. The mutation also causes the disappearance of a MspI-recognition site at nucleotide 3263 of the pro alpha 1 (I) coding sequence.

Normal and mutant alpha 1(I) CB8 cyanogen bromide peptides, from the helical part of the alpha 1(I) chains, were purified from bone. Amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from the mutant alpha 1(I) CB8 peptide showed that the glycine residue at position 391 of the alpha 1(I) chain had been replaced by an arginine residue. This substitution accounted for the more basic charged form of this peptide that was observed on two-dimensional electrophoresis of the collagen peptides obtained from the tissues. The substitution was associated with increased enzymatic hydroxylation of lysine residues in the alpha 1(I) CB8 and the adjoining CB3 peptides but not in the carboxyl-terminal CB6 and CB7 peptides. This finding suggested that the sequence abnormality had interfered with the propagation of the triple helix across the mutant region. The abnormal collagen was not incorporated into the more insoluble fraction of bone collagen. The baby appeared to be heterozygous for the sequence abnormality and as the parents did not show any evidence of the defect it is likely that the baby had a new mutation of one allele of the pro-alpha 1(I) gene.

One case with OI IIC and the sibs had novel heterozygous mutations in the C-propeptide region of COL1A1, while the second patient with clear-cut OI IIC had no mutation in this region. Histological examination in the two sporadic cases showed a network of broad, interconnected cartilaginous trabeculae with thin osseous seams in the metaphyses.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in clinical phenotypic presentation and molecular mechanism between OI Types I-IV. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split: OI Type I (OMIM: 166200), OI Type II (OMIM: 166210), OI Type III (OMIM: 259420), and OI Type IV (OMIM: 166220). OI Type II is also known as lethal OI, and is characterized by bone fragility, perinatal fractures, severe bowing of long bones, blue sclerae in some cases, undermineralization, and death in the perinatal period due to respiratory insufficiency (Sillence et al. 1979; PMID: 458828). COL1A1 variants associated with OI Type II are not always 100% predictive of the disease because of genetic modifiers, and therefore long term survival and involvement in other types of OI can be seen with certain variants implicated in this disease. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. At least 18 unique variants (missense, in-frame deletions and duplications, and one frameshift variant not predicted to cause NMD) have been identified in OI Type II patients in 10 publications (PMIDs: 21834035, 3016737, 3108247, 7679635, 8100209, 7487936, 22795119, 25958000, 11668615, 25289482). This gene-disease association is also supported by a mouse model that is compatible with the disease phenotypes, but is not a definitive model due to its use of transgene methodology (PMID: 2450280). In summary, COL1A1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type II. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) on 3/3/2021.\nGene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) - Version 8.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0b093295-1c7c-4526-90eb-d6a9fff1cc75"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
