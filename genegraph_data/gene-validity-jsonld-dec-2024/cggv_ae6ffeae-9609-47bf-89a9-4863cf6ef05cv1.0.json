Here, we describe an isoform of KIF1B, KIF1Bbeta, that is distinct from KIF1B in its cargo binding domain. KIF1B knockout mice die at birth from apnea due to nervous system defects. Death of knockout neurons in culture can be rescued by expression of the beta isoform. The KIF1B heterozygotes have a defect in transporting synaptic vesicle precursors and suffer from progressive muscle weakness similar to human neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A was previously mapped to an interval containing KIF1B. We show that CMT2A patients contain a loss-of-function mutation in the motor domain of the KIF1B gene.

KIF1Bβ mutations have previously been reported in a limited number of pedigrees of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) neuropathy. However, the gene responsible for CMT2A is still controversial, and the mechanism of pathogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R is a new direct binding partner of KIF1Bβ, and its binding and transport is specifically impaired by the Y1087C mutation of KIF1Bβ, which we detected in hereditary neuropathic patients. The axonal outgrowth and IGF-I signaling of Kif1b-/- neurons were significantly impaired, consistent with decreased surface IGF1R expression. The complementary capacity of KIF1Bβ-Y1087C of these phenotypes was significantly impaired, but the binding capacity to synaptic vesicle precursors was not affected. These data have supported the relevance of KIF1Bβ in IGF1R transport, which may give new clue to the neuropathic pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Xu F","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"KIF1Bβ mutations detected in hereditary neuropathy impair IGF1R transport and axon growth."},"rdfs:label":"Fluorescent micrograph of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ae6ffeae-9609-47bf-89a9-4863cf6ef05c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:075c0922-5738-4e0b-90bb-efd73237fd1e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:acc9afce-aafc-4b0b-928c-ca8289481763","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Immunofluorescence of Vero cells showed a disturbed accumulation of KIF1B protein for the mutant: Due to its motility toward the plus ends of the microtubules, overexpressed wild-type KIF1Bβ protein accumulated at the cell periphery.

We observe the ectopic appearance of myelin-like membrane in kif1b mutants, coincident with the ectopic localization of myelin proteins in kif1b mutant oligodendrocyte cell bodies. These observations suggest that oligodendrocytes localize certain mRNA molecules, namely those encoding small basic proteins such as MBP, to prevent aberrant effects of these proteins elsewhere in the cell. We also find that Kif1b is required for outgrowth of some of the longest axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems.
