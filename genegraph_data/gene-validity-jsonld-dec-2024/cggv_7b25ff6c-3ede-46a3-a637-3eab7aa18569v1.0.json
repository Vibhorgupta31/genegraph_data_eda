ES cell lines engineered to express a wild-type (MLC2vGFP) or a mutated form (R58QMLC2vGFP) of ventricular myosin light chain 2 (MLC2v) fused to GFP were differentiated into cardiomyocytes within embryoid bodies (EBs).

The aim of the present study was to search for mutations in the ventricular regulatory myosin light chain gene (MYL2), located on chromosome 12q23q24.3, in a panel of 42 probands presenting a classical phenotype of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis was used to search for mutations in the coding segments of the MYL2 gene, and the abnormal products were sequenced. Two novel missense mutations, Phe18Leu in exon 2 and Arg58Gln in exon 4 were identified in three unrelated families. None of the affected patients had hypertrophy localized only at the level of the papillary muscle with mid left ventricular obstruction. By analysis of genetic recombinations, one of these mutations identified in a large family allowed us to refine the localization of the MYL2 gene on the genetic map, in an interval of 6 cM containing six informative microsatellite markers. In conclusion, we show that mutations in the MYL2 gene may be involved in familial and classical forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and we provide new tools for the genetic analysis of patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","dc:creator":"Flavigny J","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Identification of two novel mutations in the ventricular regulatory myosin light chain gene (MYL2) associated with familial and classical forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9535554","rdfs:label":"Family 701 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"NM_000432.4(MYL2):c.173G>A (p.Arg58Gln), Transgenic mouse model showed change in force and Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase with this variant."},{"id":"cggv:b3fae030-e638-4dab-9f9d-d25f1971a00e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd87b1e0-78f1-460e-871a-a4ab1b06868a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of translated exons with flanking intron sequences was performed in MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNI3, TNNT2, MYL2 and MYL3.","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:b3fae030-e638-4dab-9f9d-d25f1971a00e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:1426c0f4-fc1f-4e6b-8789-905a884b52d7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000432.4(MYL2):c.119G>A (p.Arg40Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA009847"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24111713","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) became available in Norway in 2003.

In contrast to other HCM disease genes, only a few studies describing disease-associated mutations in the myosin light chain genes have been published. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic screening for mutations in the ventricular myosin light chain genes in a group of clinically well-characterised HCM patients. Further, we assessed whether the detected mutations are associated with malignant or benign phenotype in the respective families. We analysed 186 unrelated individuals with HCM for the human ventricular myosin regulatory (MYL2) and essential light chain genes (MYL3) using polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and automated sequencing. We found eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in exonic and adjacent intronic regions of MYL2 and MYL3. Two MYL2 missense mutations were identified in two Caucasian families while no mutation was found in MYL3. The mutation Glu22Lys was associated with moderate septal hypertrophy, a late onset of clinical manifestation, and benign disease course and prognosis. The mutation Arg58Gln showed also moderate septal hypertrophy, but, in contrast, it was associated with an early onset of clinical manifestation and premature sudden cardiac death.

The aim of this study was to identify the genotypes and associated phenotypes related to HCM in northern Sweden. In 46 unrelated individuals with familial or sporadic HCM, mutation analysis of eight sarcomeric protein genes was performed; the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, cardiac myosin-binding protein C, cardiac troponin T, alpha-tropomyosin, cardiac essential and regulatory myosin light chains, cardiac troponin I and cardiac alpha-actin. A total of 11 mutations, of which six were novel ones, were found in 13 individuals. Seven mutations were located in the myosin-binding protein C gene, two in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene and one in the regulatory myosin light chain and troponin I genes, respectively. This is the first Swedish study, where a population with HCM has been genotyped. Mutations in the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene were the most common ones found in northern Sweden, whereas mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene were less frequent than previously described. There are differences in the phenotypes mediated by these genes characterised by a more late-onset disease for the myosin-binding protein C gene mutations. This should be taken into consideration, when evaluating clinical findings in the diagnosis of the disease, especially in young adults in families with HCM, where penetrance can be expected to be incomplete in the presence of a myosin-binding protein C gene mutation.","dc:creator":"Mörner S","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Identification of the genotypes causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in northern Sweden."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12818575","rdfs:label":"XII"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"NM_000432.4(MYL2):c.173G>A (p.Arg58Gln), Transgenic mouse model showed change in force and Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase with this variant.

More than 8 unique variants (missense, splice site, nonsense, frameshift) have been identified in humans, and convincing segregation data has been reported (Flavigny et al, 1998, PMID 9535554). In addition, at least 8 missense VUSs in MYL2 have been reported in patients with HCM. MYL2 was first associated with HCM in humans in 1996 (Poetter et al, 1996, PMID 8673105). The MYL2 gene was significantly enriched for missense variants in Walsh et al, 2016 (PMID 27532257) with and odds ratio of 6.74 (95% CI 4.69-9.70) for non-truncating variants and 3.10 (95% CI 0.89-10.7) for truncating variants. This gene-disease association is supported by expression data (Price et al, 1980, PMID 7236212), interaction with other known HCM gene products (MYH7, MYL3) (Rayment et al, 1993, PMID 8316857), and animal models (Szczesna-Cordary et al, 2005, PMID 16076902; Wang et al, 2006, 16837010; Kerrick et al, 2009, PMID 18987303).  In summary, MYL2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant HCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 7th, 2017 using SOP version 4. It was reevaluated on July 7th, 2021. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.
