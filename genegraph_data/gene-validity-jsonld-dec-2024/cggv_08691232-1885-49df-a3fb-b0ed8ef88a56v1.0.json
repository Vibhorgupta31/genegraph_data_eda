Linkage analysis of this family (BDCS1) identified five regions homozygous by descent with a maximum LOD score of 1.75. Linkage analysis of the family that originally defined BDCS (BDCS3) identified an overlapping linkage peak at chromosome 5q35.1. Sequence analysis identified two different homozygous mutations in BDCS1 and BDCS3, affecting the gene encoding the protein SH3 and PX domains 2B (SH3PXD2B), which localizes to 5q35.1. Western blot analysis of patient fibroblasts derived from affected individuals in both families demonstrated complete loss of SH3PXD2B. Homozygosity mapping and sequence analysis in a second published BDCS family (BDCS2) excluded SH3PXD2B. SH3PXD2B is required for the formation of functional podosomes, and loss-of-function mutations in SH3PXD2B have recently been shown to underlie 7 of 13 families with Frank-Ter Haar syndrome (FTHS). FTHS and BDCS share some overlapping clinical features; therefore, our results demonstrate that a proportion of BDCS and FTHS cases are allelic.

We have conducted homozygosity mapping on patients representing 12 FTHS families. A locus on chromosome 5q35.1 was identified for which patients from nine families shared homozygosity. For one family, a homozygous deletion mapped exactly to the smallest region of overlapping homozygosity, which contains a single gene, SH3PXD2B. This gene encodes the TKS4 protein, a phox homology (PX) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing adaptor protein and Src substrate. This protein was recently shown to be involved in the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions called podosomes or invadopodia, which coordinate pericellular proteolysis with cell migration. Mice lacking Tks4 also showed pronounced skeletal, eye, and cardiac abnormalities and phenocopied the majority of the defects associated with FTHS. These findings establish a role for TKS4 in FTHS and embryonic development. Mutation analysis revealed five different homozygous mutations in SH3PXD2B in seven FTHS families. No SH3PXD2B mutations were detected in six other FTHS families, demonstrating the genetic heterogeneity of this condition. Interestingly however, dermal fibroblasts from one of the individuals without an SH3PXD2B mutation nevertheless expressed lower levels of the TKS4 protein, suggesting a common mechanism underlying disease causation.","dc:creator":"Iqbal Z","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Disruption of the podosome adaptor protein TKS4 (SH3PXD2B) causes the skeletal dysplasia, eye, and cardiac abnormalities of Frank-Ter Haar Syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Family 12-1"},{"id":"cggv:1a5aae5d-62cb-42d1-9cb2-4f51e93b0615","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a5aae5d-62cb-42d1-9cb2-4f51e93b0615_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1a5aae5d-62cb-42d1-9cb2-4f51e93b0615_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Arg43Trp disrupts a highly conserved amino acid within the phox homology (PX) domain of the protein, which is predicted to abolish binding to phosphoinositides."}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The SD-GCEP decided to downgrade this variant due to consanguinity and homozygosity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5faef7b1-b3d7-46f7-b657-709d893f53bb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5faef7b1-b3d7-46f7-b657-709d893f53bb","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:98686602-d319-4411-9851-47c23ab9d997","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001017995.3(SH3PXD2B):c.147dup (p.Asp50Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114027"}},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide homozygosity mapping was carried out with the Affymetrix mapping 250K SNP array, on DNA fragments in the 200 to 1100 bp size range amplified from 250 ng genomic DNA.

Invasiveness can be correlated with the presence of dynamic actin-rich membrane structures called podosomes or invadopodia. We showed previously that the adaptor protein tyrosine kinase substrate with five Src homology 3 domains (Tks5)/Fish is required for podosome/invadopodia formation, degradation of ECM, and cancer cell invasion in vivo and in vitro. Here, we describe Tks4, a novel protein that is closely related to Tks5. This protein contains an amino-terminal Phox homology domain, four SH3 domains, and several proline-rich motifs. In Src-transformed fibroblasts, Tks4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and predominantly localized to rosettes of podosomes. We used both short hairpin RNA knockdown and mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking Tks4 to investigate its role in podosome formation. We found that lack of Tks4 resulted in incomplete podosome formation and inhibited ECM degradation. Both phenotypes were rescued by reintroduction of Tks4, whereas only podosome formation, but not ECM degradation, was rescued by overexpression of Tks5. The tyrosine phosphorylation sites of Tks4 were required for efficient rescue. Furthermore, in the absence of Tks4, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) was not recruited to the incomplete podosomes. These findings suggest that Tks4 and Tks5 have overlapping, but not identical, functions, and implicate Tks4 in MT1-MMP recruitment and ECM degradation.","dc:creator":"Buschman MD","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"The novel adaptor protein Tks4 (SH3PXD2B) is required for functional podosome formation."},"rdfs:label":"Buschman Rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:eb704e82-8b17-4993-a14e-db68cfcce649","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04bdd46a-8c26-47de-8a51-9ada06f22da6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Similar to FTHS patients, Sh3pxd2b null mice showed suture agenesis, wormian bones, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, high palate, dentition abnormalities, micrognathia, increased thoracic kyphosis, pelvic abnormalities, glaucoma, megalocornea, buphthalmos, ventricular defects, and growth delay.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20137777","rdfs:label":"Iqbal Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6301,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f394eea8-c732-4f9a-ac30-b4252107edd5","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009579","gene":"hgnc:29242","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The SH3PXD2B gene is located on chromosome 5 at 5q35.1 and encodes SH3 and PX domains-containing protein 2B, which is an adapter protein involved in invadopodia and podosome formation and extracellular matrix degradation. SH3PXD2B was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Frank-ter Haar syndrome (FTHS) in 2010 (Iqbal et al., 2010, PMID: 20137777). FTHS is a syndromic disorder characterized by brachycephaly, wide fontanels, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, prominent eyes, macrocornea with or without glaucoma, full cheeks, small chin, bowing of the long bones, and flexion deformity of the fingers. At least two nonsense, three frameshift, one missense, one exonic deletion, and one splice site variants that have been reported in seven probands in three publications (PMID: 20137777; Wilson et al., 2014, PMID: 24105366, Zrhidri et al., 2017, PMID: 28694206) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a mouse model, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in cell culture experiments (PMID: 20137777; Buschman et al., 2009, PMID: 19144821). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SH3PXD2B and autosomal recessive Frank-ter Haar syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 02.01.2023 (SOP Version 9).
