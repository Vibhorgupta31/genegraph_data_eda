However, functional workup is essential for precise phenotype definition and to understand the underlying disease mechanisms. Using whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in four independent families with hypotonia, neurodevelopmental delay, facial dysmorphism, loss of white matter, and thinning of the corpus callosum, we identified four previously unreported homozygous truncating PPP1R21 alleles: c.347delT p.(Ile116Lysfs*25), c.2170_2171insGGTA p.(Ile724Argfs*8), c.1607dupT p.(Leu536Phefs*7), c.2063delA p.(Lys688Serfs*26) and found that PPP1R21 was absent in fibroblasts of an affected individual, supporting the allele's loss of function effect. PPP1R21 function had not been studied except that a large scale affinity proteomics approach suggested an interaction with PIBF1 defective in Joubert syndrome. Our co-immunoprecipitation studies did not confirm this but in contrast defined the localization of PPP1R21 to the early endosome. Consistent with the subcellular expression pattern and the clinical phenotype exhibiting features of storage diseases, we found patient fibroblasts exhibited a delay in clearance of transferrin-488 while uptake was normal. In summary, we delineate a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by biallelic PPP1R21 loss of function variants, and suggest a role of PPP1R21 within the endosomal sorting process or endosome maturation pathway.","dc:creator":"Rehman AU","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Biallelic loss of function variants in PPP1R21 cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome with impaired endocytic function."}},"rdfs:label":"Rehman_Family 3_V-4"},{"id":"cggv:cbe92533-a72a-4ab3-a7e8-a2db5225f65e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cbe92533-a72a-4ab3-a7e8-a2db5225f65e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cbe92533-a72a-4ab3-a7e8-a2db5225f65e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"qPCR analyses revealed that PPP1R21 mRNA levels are greatly reduced, but not completely absent in patient fibroblast (Supp. Fig S7).

acts as a co-factor for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), an important serine/threonine phosphatase known to be essential for cell division, control of glycogen metabolism, protein synthesis, and muscle contractility. Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in PPP1R21 were linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, facial dysmorphism, and brain abnormalities (NEDHFBA) with pediatric onset. Functional studies unraveled impaired vesicular transport as being part of PPP1R21-related pathomechanism. To decipher further the pathophysiological processes leading to the clinical manifestation of NEDHFBA, we investigated the proteomic signature of fibroblasts derived from the first NEDHFBA patient harboring a splice-site mutation in PPP1R21 and presenting with a milder phenotype. Proteomic findings and further functional studies demonstrate a profound activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system with presence of protein aggregates and impact on cellular fitness and moreover suggest a cross-link between activation of the proteolytic system and cytoskeletal architecture (including filopodia) as exemplified on paradigmatic proteins including actin, thus extending the pathophysiological spectrum of the disease. In addition, the proteomic signature of PPP1R21-mutant fibroblasts displayed a dysregulation of a variety of proteins of neurological relevance. This includes increase proteins which might act toward antagonization of cellular stress burden in terms of pro-survival, a molecular finding which might accord with the presentation of a milder phenotype of our NEDHFBA patient.","dc:creator":"Hentschel A","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"A Homozygous PPP1R21 Splice Variant Associated with Severe Developmental Delay, Absence of Speech, and Muscle Weakness Leads to Activated Proteasome Function."}},"rdfs:label":"Hentschel_Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:c9e182c8-1cb6-40e4-be5c-9c7c0fb7d616","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c9e182c8-1cb6-40e4-be5c-9c7c0fb7d616_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c9e182c8-1cb6-40e4-be5c-9c7c0fb7d616_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Immunoblotting showed complete loss of protein expression in patient fibroblasts compared to matched control (Fig 2C)"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:d8743574-2fe2-4819-a7bd-40e94d20065e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d8743574-2fe2-4819-a7bd-40e94d20065e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec51e1be-c991-4110-8b50-576f815768b1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a59bbfc7-1b28-4ac6-9d3f-4d0062cbed00","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Since other PP1 subunits have been linked to disease, the GCEP has elected to score this as biochemical evidence.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36692708","rdfs:label":"Hentschel_Biochemical Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d8743574-2fe2-4819-a7bd-40e94d20065e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf2d444a-8380-41bc-b7b0-84664d9f16c3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4a6dfe1f-452e-4afd-963e-4343b4a16828","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Immunofluorescence analysis showed that PP1R21 consistently co-localized with early endosome marker EEA1 (Fig 2A).

Exploring genetic variants associated with PBC is essential to understand the pathogenesis of PBC. Here we identify a zebrafish balloon dog (blg) mutant with intrahepatic bile duct branching defects, exhibiting several key pathological PBC-like features, including immunodominant autoantigen PDC-E2 production, cholangiocyte apoptosis, immune cell infiltration, inflammatory activation, and liver fibrosis. blg encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 21 (Ppp1r21), which is enriched in the liver and its peripheral tissues and plays a vital role in the early intrahepatic bile duct formation stage. Further studies show an excessive activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the hepatic tissues in the mutant, while treatment with the pathway inhibitor LY294002 and rapamycin partially rescues intrahepatic bile duct branching defects and alleviates the PBC-like symptoms. These findings implicate the potential role of the Ppp1r21-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the pathophysiology of PBC.","dc:creator":"Wu C","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Zebrafish ppp1r21 mutant as a model for the study of primary biliary cholangitis."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of intrahepatic bile duct anomalies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"phenotype not rescue by wild-type and phenotype of gene alteration is not consistent with human phenotype "},{"id":"cggv:f0ba6a8c-8b56-4621-9fbe-226719f09052","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:626c0810-1b54-4342-bdd8-4a1e1ea7c861","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Autoimmune cholestatic liver disease is not reported in NEDHFBA so far","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37271428","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish blg mutant "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Autoimmune cholestatic liver disease is not reported in NEDHFBA so far"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Strong","sequence":7691,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":12.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7f03f576-b44e-456b-9e95-c7ae21c0103e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0859165","gene":"hgnc:30595","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The PPP1R21 gene is located on chromosome 2p16.3 and encodes the Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 21. PPP1R21 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, facial dysmorphism and brain abnormalities (NEDHFBA) in 2018 Rehman et al. (PMID: 30520571). NEDHFBA is characterized by distinct facial dysmorphisms, intellectual disability, hypotonia, severe developmental delay and brain abnormalities. To date, 9 variants (including 3 nonsense, 5 frameshift and 1 splicing variants) have been reported in 9 probands in four publications and are included in this curation (PMID 29808498; 30520571; 32985083; 36692708). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. Currently, there is limited experimental evidence to support the gene-disease association but other PP1 subunits have been linked to disease. In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between PPP1R21 and autosomal recessive NEDHFBA.
