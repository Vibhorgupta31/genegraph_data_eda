There was no cancer predisposition in heterozygotes; nor was there bowel cancer in any individual. However, autozygosity mapping indicated linkage to a region of 7p22 surrounding the PMS2 mismatch-repair gene. Sequencing of genomic PCR products initially failed to identify a PMS2 mutation. Genome searches then revealed a previously unrecognized PMS2 pseudogene, corresponding to exons 9-15, within a 100-kb inverted duplication situated 600 kb centromeric from PMS2 itself. This information allowed a redesigned sequence analysis, identifying a homozygous mutation (R802X) in PMS2 exon 14. Furthermore, in the family with Turcot syndrome, in which the first inherited PMS2 mutation (R134X) was described, a further truncating mutation was identified on the other allele, in exon 13. Further whole-genome analysis shows that the complexity of PMS2 pseudogenes is greater than appreciated and may have hindered previous mutation studies. Several previously reported PMS2 polymorphisms are, in fact, pseudogene sequence variants. Although PMS2 mutations may be rare in colorectal cancer, they appear, for the most part, to behave as recessive traits. For technical reasons, their involvement in childhood cancer, particularly in primitive neuroectodermal tumor, may have been underestimated.","dc:creator":"De Vos M","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Novel PMS2 pseudogenes can conceal recessive mutations causing a distinctive childhood cancer syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"V-2"},{"id":"cggv:15f59eff-3ce4-4a62-8efa-d8e6717a0254","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:15f59eff-3ce4-4a62-8efa-d8e6717a0254_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"A homozygous 2428C-to-T transition in exon 14 of the PMS2 gene, resulting in an arg802-to-ter (R802X) substitution.

We report a Turcot family with no parental consanguinity, in which two affected sisters, with no history of tumors in their parents, died of a brain tumor and of a colorectal tumor, respectively, at a very early age. The proband had a severe microsatellite instability (MIN) phenotype in both tumor and normal colon mucosa, and mutations in the TGFbeta-RII and APC genes in the colorectal tumor. We identified two germline mutations within the PMS2 gene: a G deletion (1221delG) in exon 11 and a four-base-pair deletion (2361delCTTC) in exon 14, both of which were inherited from the patient's unaffected parents. These results represent the first evidence that two germline frameshift mutations in PMS2, an MMR gene which is only rarely involved in HNPCC, are not pathogenic per se, but become so when occurring together in a compound heterozygote. The compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the PMS2 gene has implications for the role of protein PMS2 in the mismatch repair mechanism, as well as for the presymptomatic molecular diagnosis of at-risk family members.

Four mammalian homologues of Escherichia coli MutL heterodimerize to form three distinct complexes: MLH1/PMS2, MLH1/MLH3, and MLH1/PMS1. Although MLH1/PMS2 is generally thought to have the major MutL activity, the precise contributions of each MutL heterodimer to mismatch repair functions are poorly understood. Here, we show that Mlh3 contributes to mechanisms of tumor suppression in the mouse. Mlh3 deficiency alone causes microsatellite instability, impaired DNA-damage response, and increased gastrointestinal tumor susceptibility. Furthermore, Mlh3;Pms2 double-deficient mice have tumor susceptibility, shorter life span, microsatellite instability, and DNA-damage response phenotypes that are indistinguishable from Mlh1-deficient mice. Our data support previous results from budding yeast that show partial functional redundancy between MLH3 and PMS2 orthologues for mutation avoidance and show a role for Mlh3 in gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal tumor suppression. The data also suggest a mechanistic basis for the more severe mismatch repair-related phenotypes and cancer susceptibility in Mlh1- versus Mlh3- or Pms2-deficient mice. Contributions by both MLH1/MLH3 and MLH1/PMS2 complexes to mechanisms of mismatch repair-mediated tumor suppression, therefore, provide an explanation why, among MutL homologues, only germ line mutations in MLH1 are common in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer.","dc:creator":"Chen PC","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Contributions by MutL homologues Mlh3 and Pms2 to DNA mismatch repair and tumor suppression in the mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Pms2 -/- mice develops lymphomas."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1f1e7480-5dc2-4718-b032-f86b86497de8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5653748d-cc39-4828-baf4-46f285d4d8de","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Pms2 -/- mice develops lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9500552","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Germline mutations in the human MSH2, MLH1, PMS2 and PMS1 DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene homologues appear to be responsible for most cases of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; refs 1-5).

A broader role for MMR deficiency in human tumorigenesis is implicated by microsatellite instability in a fraction of sporadic tumours, including gastric, endometrial and colorectal malignancies. To better define the role of individual MMR genes in cancer susceptibility and MMR functions, we have generated mice deficient for the murine homologues of the human genes MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2. Surprisingly, we find that these mice show different tumour susceptibilities, most notably, to intestinal adenomas and adenocarcinomas, and different mutational spectra. Our results suggest that a general increase in replication errors may not be sufficient for intestinal tumour formation and that these genes share overlapping, but not identical functions.","dc:creator":"Prolla TA","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Tumour susceptibility and spontaneous mutation in mice deficient in Mlh1, Pms1 and Pms2 DNA mismatch repair."},"rdfs:label":"Tumour susceptibility in Pms2 deficient mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5611,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:409fc24a-1912-49b8-b2c8-85ead95b492a","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010159","gene":"hgnc:9122","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"\\PMS2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome in 2000 (De Rosa et al. PMID: 10763829). Other mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 also cause CMMRD syndrome. CMMRD syndrome is a rare disease that greatly increases the risk of developing childhood cancer(s) such as colorectal cancers, glioblastoma, leukemia or lymphoma. Other phenotypes of CMMRD include café-au-lait spots or hypopigmentation. Note that PMS2 related cMMRD is also associated with a significant B cell-intrinsic class switch recombination defect. Three patients with MMR phenotypes have been reported with variable hypogammaglobulinemia, two of whom also have hyper-IgM syndrome  (PMID: 18824584). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability in terms of cancer spectrum and age of onset between CMMRD and Lynch syndrome. Therefore, this curation focuses on CMMRD and Lynch syndrome is curated separately. 9 variants (2 missense, 2 nonsense, and 5 frameshift) have been reported in 6 probands with biallelic variants in 5 publications (PMIDs: 10763829, 15077197, 14574005, 17557300, 18030674) are included in this curation.  IHC and western blot show absence of PMS2 protein in non-malignant patient tissues. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays (6.5 points. PMIDs: 9500552, 9927034, 11809679, 15340263, 16204034, 17557300, 18030674). Multiple PMS2 deficient mouse models have been established to show consistent phenotypes with cMMRD patients by developing lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma.  In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PMS2 and autosomal recessive CMMRD syndrome . This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
