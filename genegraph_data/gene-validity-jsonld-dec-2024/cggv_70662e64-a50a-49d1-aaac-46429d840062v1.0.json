VPS33A is a core component of the class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) and the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complexes, which have essential functions in the endocytic pathway. Here we show that cultured fibroblasts from patients with this disorder have morphological changes: vacuolation with disordered endosomal/lysosomal compartments and-common to sphingolipid diseases-abnormal endocytic trafficking of lactosylceramide. Urine glycosaminoglycan studies revealed a pathological excess of sialylated conjugates as well as dermatan and heparan sulphate. Lipidomic screening showed elevated β-D-galactosylsphingosine with unimpaired activity of cognate lysosomal hydrolases. The 3D crystal structure of human VPS33A predicts that replacement of arginine 498 by tryptophan will de-stabilize VPS33A folding. We observed that the missense mutation reduced the abundance of full-length VPS33A and other components of the HOPS and CORVET complexes. Treatment of HeLa cells stably expressing the mutant VPS33A with a proteasome inhibitor rescued the mutant protein from degradation. We propose that the disease is due to diminished intracellular abundance of intact VPS33A. Exposure of patient-derived fibroblasts to the clinically approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, or inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis with eliglustat, partially corrected the impaired lactosylceramide trafficking defect and immediately suggest therapeutic avenues to explore in this fatal orphan disease.","dc:creator":"Pavlova EV","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"The lysosomal disease caused by mutant VPS33A."}},"rdfs:label":"Pavlova_2019: P5"},{"id":"cggv:10ff0f8f-aa66-4139-a45a-0ee5b5784478","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:10ff0f8f-aa66-4139-a45a-0ee5b5784478_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:10ff0f8f-aa66-4139-a45a-0ee5b5784478_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Based on crystal structure, the variant is predicted to disrupt the salt bridge/hydrogen bond network and weaken the interaction between domains 2 and 3b of VPS33A, leading to de-stabilization of the protein.

We identified several Yakut patients showing typical manifestations of MPS: coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory problems, mental retardation, and excess secretion of urinary GAG. However, these patients could not be diagnosed enzymatically as MPS. They showed extremely high levels of plasma heparan sulphate (HS, one of GAG); 60 times the normal reference range and 6 times that of MPS patients. Additionally, most patients developed heart, kidney, and hematopoietic disorders, which are not typical symptoms for conventional MPS, leading to a fatal outcome between 1 and 2-years old. Using whole exome and Sanger sequencing, we identified homozygous c.1492C > T (p.Arg498Trp) mutations in the VPS33A gene of 13 patients. VPS33A is involved in endocytic and autophagic pathways, but the identified mutation did not affect either of these pathways. Lysosomal over-acidification and HS accumulation were detected in patient-derived and VPS33A-depleted cells, suggesting a novel role of this gene in lysosomal functions.

Whole exome sequencing identified a novel VPS33A mutation in a patient suffering from a variant form of mucopolysaccharidosis. Electron and confocal microscopy, immunoblotting, and glycosphingolipid trafficking experiments were undertaken to investigate the effects of the mutant VPS33A in patient-derived skin fibroblasts. We describe an attenuated juvenile form of VPS33A-related syndrome-mucopolysaccharidosis plus in a man who is homozygous for a hitherto unknown missense mutation (NM_022916.4: c.599 G>C; NP_075067.2:p. Arg200Pro) in a conserved region of the VPS33A gene. Urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) analysis revealed increased heparan, dermatan sulphates, and hyaluronic acid. We showed decreased abundance of VPS33A in patient derived fibroblasts and provided evidence that the p.Arg200Pro mutation leads to destablization of the protein and proteasomal degradation. As in the infantile form of mucopolysaccharidosis plus, the endocytic compartment in the fibroblasts also expanded-a phenomenon accompanied by increased endolysosomal acidification and impaired intracellular glycosphingolipid trafficking. Experimental treatment of the patient's cultured fibroblasts with the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, or exposure to an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis, eliglustat, improved glycosphingolipid trafficking. To our knowledge this is the first report of an attenuated juvenile form of VPS33A insufficiency characterized by appreciable residual endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and a milder mucopolysaccharidosis plus than the disease in infants. Our findings expand the proof of concept of redeploying clinically approved drugs for therapeutic exploitation in patients with juvenile as well as infantile forms of mucopolysaccharidosis plus disease.","dc:creator":"Pavlova EV","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Juvenile mucopolysaccharidosis plus disease caused by a missense mutation in VPS33A."}},"rdfs:label":"Pavlova_2022: Attenuated MPS plus case report (P6)"},{"id":"cggv:b80c81a6-4ecc-424f-a01a-acfb3bf92398","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b80c81a6-4ecc-424f-a01a-acfb3bf92398_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b80c81a6-4ecc-424f-a01a-acfb3bf92398_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Based on the crystal structure of VPS33A, the variant was predicted to destabilize the protein.

Importantly, the endocytic and autophagic pathways have been shown to be normal in fibroblasts of patients with biallelic variants in VPS33A (Kondo et al, Vasilev et al).

Individuals with this condition have been reported to have features typically associated with mucopolysaccharidosis, including coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory problems, and intellectual disability, along with features not typically found in individuals with MPS, such as heart defects, and renal, and hematopoietic disorders. Most patients die by around 2 years of age. While these patients have elevated urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), typically found in the MPS disorders, the activity of lysosomal enzymes associated with MPS are normal. Other features include increased vacuolation observed in cells, increased lysosomal acidity, and normal endocytic and autophagocytic pathway in fibroblasts (Kondo et al, PMID: 28013294; Kondo et al, PMID: 28013294). Mucopolysaccharidosis-like syndrome with congenital heart defects and hematopoietic disorders (also known as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome, MPSPS) is the only condition known to have been asserted to be caused by variants in VPS33A.\n\nOnly two variants, both of them missense, have been reported in individuals with MPSPS. One of the variants, c.1492C>T (p.Arg498Trp), has been identified in at least 16 probands from the Yakut population of Eastern Siberia and in siblings from Turkey (Dursun et al, 2017, PMID: 27547915; Kondo et al, 2017, PMID: 28013294; Pavlova et al, 2019, PMID: 31070736; Vasilev et al, 2020, PMID: 31936524; Faraguna et al, 2022, PMID: 35327996; Sofronova et al, 2023, PMID: 37628632). The other variant, c.599G>C (p.Arg200Pro), which was identified in homozygous individuals from Poland and the Mediterranean region, appears to cause an attenuated phenotype (Lipinski et al, 2022, PMID: 36232726; Pavlova et al, 2022, PMID: 36153662). To our knowledge, no additional variants have been reported in the literature. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function based on evidence that the variant results in decreased stability of the gene product.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. VPS33A is a core subunit of the CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering) and HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) complexes. CORVET and HPOS are intracellular, hexameric, membrane‐tethering, protein complexes involved in the endocytic and autophagocytic pathways pathway. The biochemical function of the protein is consistent with the features of lysosomal disease observed in patients (PMID: 25783203). A natural mouse model, the buff mouse, has been reported but the features do not mimic those found in patients, likely due to an alternative disease mechanism, but this is not considered to be conflicting evidence for the gene-disease relationship.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between VPS33A and mucopolysaccharidosis-like syndrome with congenital heart defects and hematopoietic disorders (also known as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome, MPSPS), an autosomal recessive condition. While the evidence is borderline for a definitive classification, the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel felt that a Moderate classification was more appropriate based on the identification of only two different missense variants in the gene in patients with symptoms of MPSPS. The group notes that there is considerable evidence for the role of the c.1492C>T (p.Arg498Trp) variant in this condition in individuals of Turkic/Yakut ancestry. \nClassification approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on October 3, 2023).\n\nWhile the evidence is borderline for a definitive classification, the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel felt that a Moderate classification was more appropriate based on the identification of only two different missense variants in the gene in patients with symptoms of MPSPS.
