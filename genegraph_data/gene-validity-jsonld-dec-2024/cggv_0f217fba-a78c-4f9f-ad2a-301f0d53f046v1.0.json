However, the frequency of many clinical features has never been determined. We retrospectively investigated the clinical, radiological, and genotypic data in a group of 93 patients with molecularly confirmed SEDC or a related disorder. The majority of the patients (80/93) had short stature, with radiological features of SEDC (n = 64), others having SEMD (n = 5), Kniest dysplasia (n = 7), spondyloperipheral dysplasia (n = 2), or Torrance-like dysplasia (n = 2). The remaining 13 patients had normal stature with mild SED, Stickler-like syndrome or multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Over 50% of the patients had undergone orthopedic surgery, usually for scoliosis, femoral osteotomy or hip replacement. Odontoid hypoplasia was present in 56% (95% CI 38-74) and a correlation between odontoid hypoplasia and short stature was observed. Atlanto-axial instability, was observed in 5 of the 18 patients (28%, 95% CI 10-54) in whom flexion-extension films of the cervical spine were available; however, it was rarely accompanied by myelopathy. Myopia was found in 45% (95% CI 35-56), and retinal detachment had occurred in 12% (95% CI 6-21; median age 14 years; youngest age 3.5 years). Thirty-two patients complained of hearing loss (37%, 95% CI 27-48) of whom 17 required hearing aids. The ophthalmological features and possibly also hearing loss are often relatively frequent and severe in patients with splicing mutations. Based on clinical findings, age at onset and genotype-phenotype correlations in this cohort, we propose guidelines for the management and follow-up in this group of disorders.","dc:creator":"Terhal PA","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"A study of the clinical and radiological features in a cohort of 93 patients with a COL2A1 mutation causing spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita or a related phenotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25604898","rdfs:label":"Patient 98"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"missense variant in the triple helix, published radiographs"},{"id":"cggv:525e56f4-319b-4164-a017-1651477b1ea6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:045986ee-1616-44a7-a3d3-04e6ee06881b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000926","obo:HP_0001288","obo:HP_0003026","obo:HP_0003300","obo:HP_0009826","obo:HP_0003307"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:525e56f4-319b-4164-a017-1651477b1ea6_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:25df1ef6-2c72-4f06-9146-10945213d82e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001844.5(COL2A1):c.2965C>T (p.Arg989Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA250676"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25735649","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Silveira KC","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Six additional cases of SEDC due to the same and recurrent R989C mutation in the COL2A1 gene--the clinical and radiological follow-up."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25735649","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"missense variant, radiographs, supporting functional evidence"},{"id":"cggv:73653bfc-08a0-4a92-b67b-9a293e6f45c2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:030b300e-1917-4349-8f44-b5f1c34d1d94","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002673","obo:HP_0008833","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001591","obo:HP_0009107","obo:HP_0100555"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:73653bfc-08a0-4a92-b67b-9a293e6f45c2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:be565a09-db22-410e-807c-af14d2b7e37e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001844.5(COL2A1):c.1609G>A (p.Gly537Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA384551683"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30733658","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"A boy and his father with severe short stature, progressively evolving body asymmetry, and skeletal abnormalities are presented.

PSACH results from mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene, while SEDC is caused by mutations in the gene for type II procollagen (COL2A1). We report a child with a distinct skeletal dysplasia due to the combined phenotypes of PSACH and SEDC. The proband's mother had PSACH and his father had SEDC. The child was suspected of having both phenotypes on the basis of the severity of his clinical and radiographic findings, and this was confirmed by molecular analysis. The COMP gene mutation (C348R), while not previously published, is typical of those in PSACH patients, whereas the COL2A1 mutation (T1370M) is somewhat atypical, as it predicts an amino acid change within the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. Both mutations segregated with their respective phenotypes within this family. The description and natural history of the double heterozygote phenotype may be useful in counseling families regarding risk and prognosis.","dc:creator":"Unger S","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Double heterozygosity for pseudoachondroplasia and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11746045","rdfs:label":"Patient 1 (twin)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Variant arose de novo in affected father, radiographs published.

The self-assembly of collagen molecules into fibrils is a spontaneous process that depends on site-specific binding between specific domains belonging to interacting molecules. These interactions can be altered by mutations in the COL2A1 gene found in patients with a variety of heritable cartilage disorders known as chondrodysplasias. Employing recombinant procollagen II, we studied the effects of R75C or R789C mutations on fibril formation. We determined that both R75C and R789C mutants were incorporated into collagen assemblies. The effects of the R75C and R789C substitutions on fibril formation differed significantly. The R75C substitution located in the thermolabile region of collagen II had no major effect on the fibril formation process or the morphology of fibrils. In contrast, the R789C substitution located in the thermostable region of collagen II caused profound changes in the morphology of collagen assemblies.

The condition is characterized by \"disproportionate short stature, abnormal epiphyses, and flattened vertebral bodies. Skeletal features are manifested at birth and evolve with time. Other features include myopia and/or retinal degeneration with retinal detachment and cleft palate\" (PMID:1971141). Evidence supporting this gene disease relationship includes case level and experimental evidence. Notably the c.2965C>T (p.Arg989Cys) variant (legacy name Arg789Cys) in COL2A1 has been identified repeatedly in patients with SEDC. Pathogenicity of this variant is supported by functional evidence and a mouse model. The p.Arg989Cys variant was scored 3 times in this curation in unrelated probands, although more occurrences are available in the literature. More cases supporting the gene-disease relationship between COL2A1 and SEDC have been published, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. At least ten unique missense variants have been described across numerous publications. COL2A1 has been definitively associated with Achondrogenesis type 2-hypochondrogenesis, platyspondylic dysplasia, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Stanescu type, and Spondylometaphseal dysplasia with marked metaphyseal changes after curation by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP. This gene has also been associated with Kniest dysplasia, Spondyloperipheral dysplasia, SED with metatarsal shortening (Czech dysplasia), Stickler syndrome type I, Dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses), which will be assessed separately (PMID: 31633310).  In summary, COL2A1 is definitively associated with Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/7/2021 (SOP version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0f217fba-a78c-4f9f-ad2a-301f0d53f046"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
