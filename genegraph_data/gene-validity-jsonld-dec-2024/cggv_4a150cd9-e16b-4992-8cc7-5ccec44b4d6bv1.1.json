repolarizing the cardiac action potential and consists of the assembly of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits. Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes produce the long-QT syndrome, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Here, we show that long-QT mutations located in the KCNQ1 C terminus impair calmodulin (CaM) binding, which affects both channel gating and assembly. The mutations produce a voltage-dependent macroscopic inactivation and dramatically alter channel assembly. KCNE1 forms a ternary complex with wild-type KCNQ1 and Ca(2+)-CaM that prevents inactivation, facilitates channel assembly, and mediates a Ca(2+)-sensitive increase of IKS-current, with a considerable Ca(2+)-dependent left-shift of the voltage-dependence of activation. Coexpression of KCNQ1 or IKS channels with a Ca(2+)-insensitive CaM mutant markedly suppresses the currents and produces a right shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation. KCNE1 association to KCNQ1 long-QT mutants significantly improves mutant channel expression and prevents macroscopic inactivation. However, the marked right shift in channel activation and the subsequent decrease in current amplitude cannot restore normal levels of IKS channel activity. Our data indicate that in healthy individuals, CaM binding to KCNQ1 is essential for correct channel folding and assembly and for conferring Ca(2+)-sensitive IKS-current stimulation, which increases the cardiac repolarization reserve and hence prevents the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.","dc:creator":"Shamgar L","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Calmodulin is essential for cardiac IKS channel gating and assembly: impaired function in long-QT mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Multiple"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:4a150cd9-e16b-4992-8cc7-5ccec44b4d6b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42e21bd3-0223-42c3-a8d1-eaa7499923bc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0435a446-b006-487c-871a-d9688c79f7b6","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"CALM1 mutations (D130G and F142L) caused both increased action potential duration (APD) and heightened Ca2+ transients.

To date, however, no experimental evidence has established these mutations as directly causative of LQTS substrates, nor have the molecular targets of CaM mutants been identified. Here, therefore, we test whether expression of CaM mutants in adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (aGPVM) induces action-potential prolongation, and whether affiliated alterations in the Ca(2+) regulation of L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC) might contribute to such prolongation. In particular, we first overexpressed CaM mutants in aGPVMs, and observed both increased action potential duration (APD) and heightened Ca(2+) transients. Next, we demonstrated that all LQTS CaM mutants have the potential to strongly suppress Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent inactivation (CDI) of LTCCs, whether channels were heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, or present in native form within myocytes. This attenuation of CDI is predicted to promote action-potential prolongation and boost Ca(2+) influx. Finally, we demonstrated how a small fraction of LQTS CaM mutants (as in heterozygous patients) would nonetheless suffice to substantially diminish CDI, and derange electrical and Ca(2+) profiles. In all, these results highlight LTCCs as a molecular locus for understanding and treating CaM-related LQTS in this group of patients.

An exactly identical calmodulin protein is encoded by 3 separate genes, CALM1-3, located on different chromosomes (14, 2 and 19, respectively). \nIn 2013 Crotti et al. were the first to identify de-novo missense variants in CALM1 and CALM2 in 2 patients with a unique phenotype (PMID 23388215). Both were infants presenting with marked QT prolongation, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and intermittent AV block. Subsequent studies identified multiple similar cases with de-novo variants in one of the 3 CALM genes. Based on this evidence the Expert Panel classified all calmoudulin genes (CALM1-3) as having a 'Definitive' level of evidence for disease causation of LQTS with atypical features presenting in childhood. \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams were reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Expert Panel.
