The most severe cases are termed Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), while the less aggressive forms are usually considered juvenile retinitis pigmentosa. Recently, mutations in the retinal-specific guanylate cyclase gene were found in patients with LCA. Disease genes implicated in other forms of arCSRD are expected to encode proteins present in the neuroretina or in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The RPE, a monolayer of cells separating the vascular-rich choroid and the neuroretina, is in intimate contact with the outer segments of rods and cones via the microvilli surrounding the photoreceptors. The RPE expresses a tissue-specific and evolutionarily highly conserved 61 kD protein (RPE65) present at high levels in vivo. Although the function of RPE65 is not yet known, an important role in the RPE/photoreceptor vitamin-A cycle is suggested by the fact that RPE65 associates both with serum retinol-binding protein and with the RPE-specific 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase, an enzyme active in the synthesis of the visual pigment chromophore 11-cis retinal. Here we report that the analysis of RPE65 in a collection of about 100 unselected retinal-dystrophy patients of different ethnic origin revealed five that are likely to be pathogenic mutations, including a missense mutation (Pro363Thr), two point mutations affecting splicing (912 + 1G-->T and 65 + 5G-->A) and two small re-arrangements (ins144T and 831del8) on a total of nine alleles of five patients with arCSRD. In contrast to other genes whose defects have been implicated in degenerative retinopathies, RPE65 is the first disease gene in this group of inherited disorders that is expressed exclusively in the RPE, and may play a role in vitamin-A metabolism of the retina.","dc:creator":"Gu SM","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutations in RPE65 cause autosomal recessive childhood-onset severe retinal dystrophy."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9326927","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Marlhens F","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutations in RPE65 cause Leber's congenital amaurosis."}],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:375ffa04-a8d9-427e-8948-f913bc8ff68d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08d7b464-cb43-4e44-a1b3-ff824762a040_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08d7b464-cb43-4e44-a1b3-ff824762a040","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:7ff0fcf5-c407-44b8-93c9-3451110a13bd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.370C>T (p.Arg124Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA226545"}},{"id":"cggv:7671811b-e8c5-4ab2-8b47-92beed8d3cc1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.962dup (p.Asn321fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA226596"}}],"detectionMethod":"PCR-amplified exons identified by SSCA as candidates to harbor variants were subjected to Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","phenotypeFreeText":"While specific phenotypes are not provided, the initial diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis indicates that the proband was either born blind or lost vision within a period of months after birth.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000546","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"All 14 RPE65 exons and flanking sequences were PCR-amplified and subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCA).","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:8bea1760-8b32-43df-81d1-e82f519592b6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7ff0fcf5-c407-44b8-93c9-3451110a13bd"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9501220","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"RPE65 is a protein of unknown function expressed specifically by the retinal pigment epithelium.

Sequence anomalies that were likely to be pathogenic were found in two patients with recessive RP, in one patient with isolate RP recategorized as recessive, and in seven patients with LCA. Cosegregation analysis in each available family showed that all affected individuals were either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes and that all unaffected individuals were either heterozygote carriers or homozygous wild type. In one family, there was one instance of a new mutation not present in either parent of the affected individual. In another family, affected members with recessive RP in three branches (i.e., three distinct pairs of parents) were compound heterozygotes for the same two mutations or homozygous for one of them. Based on our results, mutations in the RPE65 gene appear to account for approximately 2% of cases of recessive RP and approximately 16% of cases of LCA.","dc:creator":"Morimura H","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutations in the RPE65 gene in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa or leber congenital amaurosis."}},{"id":"cggv:68cd16a7-a8f4-4b77-9731-58c884c302c5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7671811b-e8c5-4ab2-8b47-92beed8d3cc1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9501220"}],"rdfs:label":"Morimura_1998_Family_9190_Patient_II-1"},{"id":"cggv:68cd16a7-a8f4-4b77-9731-58c884c302c5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:68cd16a7-a8f4-4b77-9731-58c884c302c5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:68cd16a7-a8f4-4b77-9731-58c884c302c5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.962dup (p.Asn321fs) is a maternal frameshift variant predicted to either trigger NMD or truncate 40% of the protein product."}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.962dup (p.Asn321fs) is a maternal frameshift variant predicted to either trigger NMD or truncate 40% of the protein product, indicating a likely null effect on gene function."},{"id":"cggv:8bea1760-8b32-43df-81d1-e82f519592b6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8bea1760-8b32-43df-81d1-e82f519592b6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8bea1760-8b32-43df-81d1-e82f519592b6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.370C>T (p.Arg124Ter) is a paternal nonsense variant predicted to either trigger NMD or truncate 77% of the protein product."}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.370C>T (p.Arg124Ter) is a paternal nonsense variant predicted to either trigger NMD or truncate 77% of the protein product, indicating a likely null effect on the gene function."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f4ec6d40-041a-4799-a0fb-fef03d8ae2bd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f4ec6d40-041a-4799-a0fb-fef03d8ae2bd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":20,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:9a2fc78b-2e94-4717-8f20-d26627a967e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.1067del (p.Asn356fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA226477"}},{"id":"cggv:e46631b9-2697-4e4b-b49f-33a31402f6ca","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.700C>T (p.Arg234Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA226577"}}],"detectionMethod":"All 14 exons of RPE65 were PCR-amplified and subjected to Sanger sequencing.

Although some of these functions are well documented, molecular data are still scarce. Using the RPE-specific monoclonal antibody RPE9, raised against human RPE cells, we have identified a novel 65 kD protein, conserved in mammals, birds, and frogs. This RPE-specific protein was found to be nonglycosylated. It was most effectively solubilized in the presence of detergent suggesting that it is associated with the RPE cell membranes. Its partitioning in the detergent phase of Triton X-114 and its solubilization in 0.75 M and 1.0 M KCl suggest that it interacts with the membrane either through a polypeptide anchor or charged amino acids. Cell fractionation by differential solubilization and differential centrifugation demonstrated that the protein was preferentially associated with the microsomal membrane fraction, where it is the major protein. Developmental expression of this 65 kD protein was examined in neonatal rats. Morphologically well-differentiated RPE cells did not express the 65 kD protein at birth. However, expression was detectable at postnatal day 4, that is, one to two days before the photoreceptors develop their outer segments, suggesting that the expression of the 65 kD protein may be coordinated with other developmental events in the intact retina. This is further supported by the fact that RPE cells in confluent culture lose the expression of this protein within two weeks, while they maintain their characteristic epithelial morphology. Because of its specificity, its evolutionary conservation, and its timing of expression, it is possible that this protein may be involved in one of the key roles of RPE and as such is an important molecular marker for RPE differentiation.","dc:creator":"Hamel CP","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"A developmentally regulated microsomal protein specific for the pigment epithelium of the vertebrate retina."},"rdfs:label":"Retinal pigment epithelium-specific RPE65 expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The experiment was up-scored from the default level due to the high degree of tissue specificity of RPE65 expression, which closely matches the retina-specific phenotypes characteristic of the disease."},{"id":"cggv:cfdddfcf-5cc8-4877-a909-ee681500776b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:94c7e786-40f9-40bb-9f16-9a169ea4f512","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Maintenance of vision is dependent upon the visual retinoid cycle to enzymatically regenerate 11-cis retinal following the light-induced isomerization of this pigment to all-trans retinal.

In addition, these mice were bred to retinal pigment epithelial protein 65 (Rpe65(-/-))-deficient mice to study the role of RPE65.","dc:creator":"Wenzel A","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"RPE65 is essential for the function of cone photoreceptors in NRL-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Rpe65 homozygous knockout triggers loss of cone responses"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"While this model has already been scored in the original publication (PMID: 9843205), this study complements it by revealing that Rpe65 loss in mice triggers defects not only in the function of rod photoreceptors, but in cone photoreceptors as well."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4477,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6e14e6fb-aef7-4c97-9e06-a60e6ffcf64b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100368","gene":"hgnc:10294","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"The *RPE65* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cases of Leber congenital amaurosis or Retinitis pigmentosa in 1997 (Gu et al., PMID: 9326941, Marlhens et al., PMID: 9326927). Affected individuals have since been identified in a number of other publications (PMID: 9501220, PMID: 14962443, PMID: 11786058, PMID: 12960219, PMID: 15557452), with causal biallelic variants in *RPE65* specifically diagnostic for either Leber congenital amaurosis 2 (more severe) or Retinitis pigmentosa 20 (later onset). Both disease entities are completely penetrant, however, patients with Leber congenital amaurosis 2 present with severe visual impairment before the age of 5 (usually during the first year of life) while their counterparts with Retinitis pigmentosa 20 present with either severe visual impairment or nyctalopia between the ages of 3 and 7 and exhibit onset of severe vision loss between 3 and 40 years of age. While Leber congenital amaurosis 2 progresses to complete vision loss by the 3rd or 4th decade of life, the timing of this event is delayed in most patients with Retinitis pigmentosa 20. Patients with Leber congenital amaurosis 2 or Retinitis pigmentosa 20 also exhibit other eye-specific features, including nystagmus and sometimes chorioretinal atrophy. While electroretinogram (ERG) response is nondetectable in Leber congenital amaurosis patients, ERG responses can be either nondetectable or reduced in those with Retinitis pigmentosa 20. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the *RPE65* gene product) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients diagnosed with either Leber congenital amaurosis 2 or Retinitis pigmentosa 20, while the phenotypic variability between them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases of Leber congenital amaurosis 2 or Retinitis pigmentosa 20 have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as recessive RPE65 retinopathy.  An additional disease entity, Retinitis pigmentosa 87 with choroidal involvement, was asserted in relation to a monoallelic variant in *RPE65*, specifically a substitution at codon 477 that encodes glycine rather than aspartic acid (PMID: 21654732, PMID: 27307694, PMID: 30628748, PMID: 29659842, PMID: 28041994, PMID: 29947567). While this disease entity is characterized by similar phenotypes with delayed onset (severe vision loss between ages 40 and 80), its different mode of inheritance and unique variant suggested a different mechanism of pathogenesis. Thus, *RPE65* was separately curated for its relationship to this disease entity, referred to as dominant *RPE65* retinopathy. Seventeen suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (two nonsense, four frameshift, nine missense, and two disrupting splicing), which have been collectively reported in thirteen probands in three publications (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9326927, PMID: 9501220). Four probands were homozygous for their respective variants (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9501220), and one was reported to have consanguineous parents (PMID: 9326941). The nine other probands were compound heterozygotes within the *RPE65* locus (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9326927, PMID: 9501220). Two families with segregation evidence were available in these publications (PMID: 9501220, PMID: 9326941), and contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. A third family with segregation evidence exhibited one inconsistent (heterozygous affected) individual and was not scored (PMID: 9326941). More case-level data was available (PMID: 14962443, PMID: 11786058, PMID: 12960219, PMID: 15557452), but was not scored as part of this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in a case-control study in which biallelic *RPE65* variants were found to be enriched in the case group relative to ethnicity-matched controls at the aggregate variant level (PMID: 30996589). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by frameshift or nonsense variants predicted to trigger a decrease in the amount of the gene product (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9326927, PMID: 9501220). All probands found for this curation harbored two variant alleles within the *RPE65* locus. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *RPE65* expression is highly specific to the retinal pigment epithelium at both the mRNA level (PMID: 30239781) and protein level (PMID: 8474143). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that *RPE65* encodes the human isomerohydrolase enzyme, a critical component of the visual retinoid cycle that regenerates 11-cis retinal following the light-induced isomerization of this pigment to all-trans retinal (PMID: 16116091). This explains why homozygous *Rpe65* knockout mice exhibit accumulation of retinal esters in the retinal pigment epithelium (PMID: 9843205), photoreceptor outer segment loss (PMID: 9843205), lack of rod photoreceptor function (PMID: 9843205), and moderate defects in cone photoreceptor function (PMID: 9843205, PMID: 17251447). Swedish Briard / Briard Beagle dogs harbor a homozygous frameshift variant in the *RPE65* locus and recapitulate additional features of the human patients, including severe vision loss (PMID: 2804031), abnormal electroretinogram (PMID: 2804031), and structural abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium (PMID: 7851218). In summary, *RPE65* is definitively associated with recessive *RPE65* retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:375ffa04-a8d9-427e-8948-f913bc8ff68d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
