A pseudogene copy (SBDSP) with 97% nucleotide sequence identity resides in a locally duplicated genomic segment of 305 kb.

SDBS is a member of a highly conserved protein family of unknown function with putative orthologs in diverse species including archaea and eukaryotes.

SBDS migrates together with the 60S large ribosomal subunit in sucrose gradients and coprecipitates with 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Loss of SBDS is not associated with a discrete block in rRNA maturation or with decreased levels of the 60S ribosomal subunit.

The complete abrogation of Sbds expression in these models results in severe cellular and lethal physiologic abnormalities that differ from the human disease phenotype. Because human SDS cells are characterized by partial rather than complete loss of SBDS expression, we interrogated SDS patient cells for defects in ribosomal assembly. SDS patient cells exhibit altered ribosomal profiles and impaired association of the 40S and 60S subunits. Introduction of a wild-type SBDS cDNA into SDS patient cells corrected the ribosomal association defect, while patient-derived SBDS point mutants only partially improved subunit association. Knockdown of eIF6 expression improved ribosomal subunit association but did not correct the hematopoietic defect of SBDS-deficient cells.

It is unknown, however, whether these findings are applicable to other ethnic groups. To address this question, we examined SBDS mutations in six Japanese families with SDS by direct sequencing. We identified compound heterozygous mutations in four families: two were recurrent (96-97insA, 258+2T>C), and three were novel [292-295delAAAG, (183-184TA>CT +201A>G), (141C>T+183-184TA>CT+201A>G)] mutations.

in SBDS gene have been reported in more than 350 individuals with autosomal recessive (AR) Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome since the first publication in 2003 (Boocock GR et al; PMID: 12496757). Biallelic inheritance of more than 20 unique variants that are predicted to result in a hypomorphic protein have been reported in >90% of the individuals with clinical diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. SBDS is reported to play an essential role in ribosome biogenesis. Two of the recurring variants, as well as some others, arise from a gene-conversion event between SBDS and its pseudogene SBDSP1, and they are found in 60% and 90% of the affected individuals with pathogenic SBDS variants either together or with another variant, respectively. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, rescue experiments, and functional experiments. In summary, SBDS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7c2a84f0-e42d-487f-a2af-5b536a30d30c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
