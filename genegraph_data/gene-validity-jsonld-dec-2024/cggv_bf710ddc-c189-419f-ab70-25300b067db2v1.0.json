The recently characterized pyrolysin-like subtilase SKI-1 cleaves proproteins at nonbasic residues.

Biosynthetic and microsequencing analyses of WT and mutant enzyme revealed that human and mouse pro-NARC-1 are autocatalytically and intramolecularly processed into NARC-1 at the (Y,I)VV(V,L)(L,M) downward arrow motif, a site that is representative of its enzymic specificity. In vitro peptide processing studies andor Ala substitutions of the P1-P5 sites suggested that hydrophobicaliphatic residues are more critical at P1, P3, and P5 than at P2 or P4. NARC-1 expression is highest in neuroepithelioma SK-N-MCIXC, hepatic BRL-3A, and in colon carcinoma LoVo-C5 cell lines. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses of NARC-1 expression during development in the adult and after partial hepatectomy revealed that it is expressed in cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate. These include hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons. Accordingly, transfection of NARC-1 in primary cultures of embryonic day 13.5 telencephalon cells led to enhanced recruitment of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells into the neuronal lineage, suggesting that NARC-1 is implicated in the differentiation of cortical neurons.","dc:creator":"Seidah NG","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"The secretory proprotein convertase neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1): liver regeneration and neuronal differentiation."},"rdfs:label":"Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a9f7d830-93ad-4d42-822c-e8e51d52dc51","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31b2417f-b6b5-400f-b757-d9a14b0f193c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"CO-IP with wild type or mutant (D374Y) PCSK9 and LDLR were carried out in HepG2 cells.

Transgenic mice overexpressing human PCSK9 in liver secreted large amounts of the protein into plasma, which increased plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations to levels similar to those of LDLR-knockout mice. To determine whether PCSK9 was active in plasma, transgenic PCSK9 mice were parabiosed with wild-type littermates.

The PCSK9-induced degradation of the LDLR was not affected by inhibitors of the proteasome, lysosomal cysteine proteases, aspartic acid proteases, or metalloproteases.

The discovery of the LDL receptor as one of the causative genes of FH enabled us to understand the pathophysiology of FH and paved the way for developing statins. Similar to LDL receptor, discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) also created an opportunity for developing its inhibitors. Since PCSK9 degrades LDL receptor protein, inhibiting PCSK9 will be an effective strategy. Evolocumab and alirocumab, anti-PCSK9 antibodies that inhibit binding between PCSK9 and LDL receptors, are now available in Japan. Adding an anti-PCSK9 antibody to standard therapy with statin alone or statin combined with ezetimibe further reduced serum LDL cholesterol levels by around 60% and they significantly decrease cardiovascular event incidence as compared with placebo. Additionally, the strong LDL cholesterol lowering effect of anti-PCSK9 antibody therapies has reportedly enabled the frequency of lipoprotein apheresis to be reduced or to be discontinued. As alternative strategies against PCSK9, antisense oligonucleotide agents that inhibit PCSK9 protein synthesis as well as a small interfering (or short interference) RNA (siRNA) for PCSK9 are also being developed. While relatively high cost can be given as a problem, PCSK9 inhibitors are able to reduce LDL cholesterol dramatically even in FH patients who could not achieve targets until now. To ensure that these drugs are given to the patients who really need them, it is necessary to raise the diagnosis rate and family screening has to be more actively conducted. Finally, it has been reported that PCSK9 is expressed not only in hepatocytes but also in other cells such as epithelial cells in small intestine and vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaque.

Pcsk9 expression is down-regulated by dietary cholesterol, and mutations in Pcsk9 have been associated with a form of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. To study the function of Pcsk9 in mice, an adenovirus constitutively expressing murine Pcsk9 (Pcsk9-Ad) was used. Pcsk9 overexpression in wild-type mice caused a 2-fold increase in plasma total cholesterol and a 5-fold increase in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, with no increase in HDL cholesterol, as compared with mice infected with a control adenovirus. Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis showed that the increase in non-HDL cholesterol was due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This effect appeared to depend on the LDL receptor (LDLR) because LDLR knockout mice infected with Pcsk9-Ad had no change in plasma cholesterol levels as compared with knockout mice infected with a control adenovirus. Furthermore, whereas overexpression of Pcsk9 had no effect on LDLR mRNA levels, there was a near absence of LDLR protein in animals overexpressing Pcsk9. These results were confirmed in vitro by the demonstration that transfection of Pcsk9 in McA-RH7777 cells caused a reduction in LDLR protein and LDL binding. In summary, these results indicate that overexpression of Pcsk9 interferes with LDLR-mediated LDL cholesterol uptake.

The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","dc:creator":"Di Taranto MD","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29127338","rdfs:label":"FH-7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Functional assays show no effect on protein function."},{"id":"cggv:7fcd1f6d-522f-4e4a-ada4-f3e389d3a0ac_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf8890c1-fa3f-434e-aa54-165b105046be","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

Variants in PCSK9 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Abifadel et al., PMID: 12730697). At least 15 variants (missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 12730697, 15772090, 22683120, 26541928, 29127338, 20006333). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 31 family members. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function (Maxwell et al., 2005; PMID: 16577715), while heterozygous loss of function variants are associated with low levels of LDL cholesterol (Cohen et al., 2005, PMID: 15654334). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PCSK9 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
