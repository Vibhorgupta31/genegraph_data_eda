In his late forties progressive neurologic symptoms emerged, which included intellectual decline, mild chorea and ataxia, and marked cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Such neurologic abnormalities are very unusual in XP-F. Similar symptoms have been described in only one of 17 other XP-F individuals. His approximately 5-fold reduced activity of nucleotide excision repair in cultured cells, combined with moderately affected cell survival and DNA replication after UV exposure, are typical of XP-F. The recent cloning of the XPF gene allowed a molecular genetic analysis of this unusual patient. XP42RO, representing the second case studied in this respect, turned out to be homozygous for a point mutation in the XPF gene, causing an R788-->W substitution in the encoded protein. Surprisingly, this mutation had also been found in one allele of the other unrelated Caucasian XP-F case. The amount of mutated XPF protein is strongly reduced in cells from XP42RO, presumably due to a conformational change.

Since this repair pathway is responsible for removing UV irradiation-induced damage to DNA, XP patients are hypersensitive to sunlight and are prone to develop skin cancer. Based on the underlying genetic defect, the disease can be divided into the seven complementation groups XPA through XPG. XPF, in association with ERCC1, constitutes a structure-specific endonuclease that makes an incision 5' to the photodamage. XPF-ERCC1 has also been implicated in both removal of interstrand DNA cross-links and homology-mediated recombination and in immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). To study the function of XPF in vivo, we inactivated the XPF gene in mice. XPF-deficient mice showed a severe postnatal growth defect and died approximately 3 weeks after birth. Histological examination revealed that the liver of mutant animals contained abnormal cells with enlarged nuclei. Furthermore, embryonic fibroblasts defective in XPF are hypersensitive to UV irradiation and mitomycin C treatment. No defect in CSR was detected, suggesting that the nuclease is dispensable for this recombination process. These phenotypes are identical to those exhibited by the ERCC1-deficient mice, consistent with the functional association of the two proteins. The complex phenotype suggests that XPF-ERCC1 is involved in multiple DNA repair processes.","dc:creator":"Tian M","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Growth retardation, early death, and DNA repair defects in mice deficient for the nucleotide excision repair enzyme XPF."},"rdfs:label":"Growth Retardation, DNA Repair Defects in XPF Deficient Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:89544dc5-2d3b-4b7f-b835-3fec714bf7a5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89544dc5-2d3b-4b7f-b835-3fec714bf7a5_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dded4c28-01b5-4d5a-b6f2-ef54837a1408_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be39794d-3105-4e7c-b370-b5e6e7b1a52f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":62,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000992","obo:HP_0008069"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"SSCP","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:dded4c28-01b5-4d5a-b6f2-ef54837a1408_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:a8655a0c-b2b3-4a9c-bb3c-5b655d62cdd4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000016.10:g.13948051A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA394823910"}},{"id":"cggv:641ab733-31df-4e8f-b0dd-c2d2a8c81525","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000016.10:g.13944755del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA891841744"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9580660","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group F was first reported in Japan and most XP-F patients reported to date are Japanese. The clinical features of XP-F patients are rather mild, including late onset of skin cancer. Recently a cDNA that corrects the repair deficiency of cultured XP-F cells was isolated. The XPF protein forms a tight complex with ERCC1 and this complex functions as a structure-specific endonuclease responsible for the 5' incision during DNA excision repair. Here we have identified XPF mRNA mutations and examined levels of the mRNA and protein expression in seven primary cell strains from Japanese XP-F patients. The XP-F cell strains were classified into three types in terms of the effect of the mutation on the predicted protein; (i) XPF proteins with amino acid substitutions; (ii) amino acid substituted and truncated XPF proteins; and (iii) truncated XPF protein only. A normal level of expression of XPF mRNA was observed in XP-F cells but XPF protein was extremely low. These results indicate that the detected mutations lead to unstable XPF protein, resulting in a decrease in formation of the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease complex. Slow excision repair of UV-induced DNA damage due to low residual endonuclease activity provides a plausible explanation for the typical mild phenotype of XP-F patients.","dc:creator":"Matsumura

pigmentosum (XP) is a rare DNA repair disorder characterized by increased susceptibility to UV radiation (UVR)-induced skin pigmentation, skin cancers, ocular surface disease, and, in some patients, sunburn and neurological degeneration. Genetically, it is assigned to eight complementation groups (XP-A to -G and variant). For the last 5 y, the UK national multidisciplinary XP service has provided follow-up for 89 XP patients, representing most of the XP patients in the United Kingdom. Causative mutations, DNA repair levels, and more than 60 clinical variables relating to dermatology, ophthalmology, and neurology have been measured, using scoring systems to categorize disease severity. This deep phenotyping has revealed unanticipated heterogeneity of clinical features, between and within complementation groups. Skin cancer is most common in XP-C, XP-E, and XP-V patients, previously considered to be the milder groups based on cellular analyses. These patients have normal sunburn reactions and are therefore diagnosed later and are less likely to adhere to UVR protection. XP-C patients are specifically hypersensitive to ocular damage, and XP-F and XP-G patients appear to be much less susceptible to skin cancer than other XP groups. Within XP groups, different mutations confer susceptibility or resistance to neurological damage. Our findings on this large cohort of XP patients under long-term follow-up reveal that XP is more heterogeneous than has previously been appreciated. Our data now enable provision of personalized prognostic information and management advice for each XP patient, as well as providing new insights into the functions of the XP proteins.

We isolated a human gene homologous to yeast Rad1 and found that it corrects the repair defects of XP group F as well as rodent groups 4 and 11. Causative mutations and strongly reduced levels of encoded protein were identified in XP-F patients. The XPF protein was purified from mammalian cells in a tight complex with ERCC1. This complex is a structure-specific endonuclease responsible for the 5' incision during repair. These results demonstrate that the XPF, ERCC4, and ERCC11 genes are equivalent, complete the isolation of the XP genes that form the core nucleotide excision repair system, and solve the catalytic function of the XPF-containing complex.","dc:creator":"Sijbers AM","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Xeroderma pigmentosum group F caused by a defect in a structure-specific DNA repair endonuclease."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8797827","rdfs:label":"XP126LO"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Compound heterozygote with a 4-nucleotide deletion, TCTC, in a repetitive sequence at position 2281 of the XPF gene.

(1996). Multiple case level studies have been performed with XPF patients that have variants in the ERCC4 gene. 8 complementation groups genes (XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, XPG, and XP variant (XPV)) in Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway were reported to cause Xeroderma Pigmentosum. Studies of patient-derived cells showed reduced nucleotide excision repair activity in GG-NER and TC-NER pathways. An XPF deficient mouse model has been established to show consistent phenotypes with XPF patients including growth retardation and DNA repair defects. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the ERCC4 gene and xeroderma pigmentosum group F.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:89544dc5-2d3b-4b7f-b835-3fec714bf7a5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
