Many IDRs contain short linear motifs (SLiMs) that mediate protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which can be regulated by post-translational modifications like phosphorylation. 20% of pathogenic missense mutations are found in IDRs, and understanding how such mutations affect PPIs is essential for unraveling disease mechanisms. Here, we employ peptide-based interaction proteomics to investigate 36 disease-associated mutations affecting phosphorylation sites. Our results unveil significant differences in interactomes between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides, often due to disrupted phosphorylation-dependent SLiMs. We focused on a mutation of a serine phosphorylation site in the transcription factor GATAD1, which causes dilated cardiomyopathy. We find that this phosphorylation site mediates interaction with 14-3-3 family proteins. Follow-up experiments reveal the structural basis of this interaction and suggest that 14-3-3 binding affects GATAD1 nucleocytoplasmic transport by masking a nuclear localisation signal. Our results demonstrate that pathogenic mutations of human phosphorylation sites can significantly impact protein-protein interactions, offering insights into potential molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Rrustemi T","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"Pathogenic mutations of human phosphorylation sites affect protein-protein interactions."},"rdfs:label":"isothermal titration calorimetry and 14-3-3 proteins"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The group of proteins (14-3-3) which this protein-protein interaction focuses on have not definitively been implicated in cardiomyopathy.

However, the disease phenotype may be delayed due to age-dependent penetrance. For this reason, we generated an adult zebrafish model, which is a simpler vertebrate model with higher throughput than rodents. Specifically, we studied the zebrafish homologue of GATAD1, a recently identified gene for adult-onset autosomal recessive DCM. We showed cardiac expression of gatad1 transcripts, by whole mount in situ hybridization in zebrafish embryos, and demonstrated nuclear and sarcomeric I-band subcellular localization of Gatad1 protein in cardiomyocytes, by injecting a Tol2 plasmid encoding fluorescently-tagged Gatad1. We next generated gatad1 knock-out fish lines by TALEN technology and a transgenic fish line that expresses the human DCM GATAD1-S102P mutation in cardiomyocytes. Under stress conditions, longitudinal studies uncovered heart failure (HF)-like phenotypes in stable KO mutants and a tendency toward HF phenotypes in transgenic lines. Based on these efforts of studying a gene-based inherited cardiomyopathy model, we discuss the strengths and bottlenecks of adult zebrafish as a new vertebrate model for assessing candidate cardiomyopathy genes.","dc:creator":"Yang J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Modeling GATAD1-Associated Dilated Cardiomyopathy in Adult Zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"Zebra fish Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:37fb260c-190d-421d-b920-a23568b20fbb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa80cf56-e130-4af0-b047-b84452f0109d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"FLAG immunoprecipitation showed protein interaction with HAT1, RBBP4, PHF12, RBBP7, KDM5A, SIN3B\n ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38605029","rdfs:label":"FLAG Immunoprecipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Proteins with proven interaction have not been shown to cause cardiomyopathy"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:56933afb-863f-46f5-884d-17522adb31a8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:347c546a-44eb-4196-a264-4763e991c3ce","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:50a39a06-c0f8-4908-9980-c193cacb0ef8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The mutant zebrafish survived to adulthood without any signs of heart failure until the authors imposed stress by feeding a 4% cholesterol diet.

GATAD1 was originally evaluated for DCM by the ClinGen DCM GCEP on September 27, 2019. Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on June 28, 2024. As a result, the classification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data. The human genetic level evidence remains limited to one paper (Theis et al, 2011, PMID: 21965549) which reports on a consanguineous family with adult-onset DCM. A homozygous missense variant in GATAD1 was reported in three affected siblings. Segregation data gave a LOD score of 3.1. In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by animal models and expression studies. The missense variant reported by Theis et al (2011, PMID 21965549) was shown to affect expression in cardiac tissue. Yang et al (2016, PMID: 28955713) report on a knockout zebrafish model and a model with the missense variant previously reported. The knockout zebrafish only developed a phenotype consistent with DCM when exposed to stressors, and only 1 out of 6 transgenic fish with the mutant allele developed a significantly increased heart size. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of GATAD1 with autosomal recessive DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group June 28, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:56933afb-863f-46f5-884d-17522adb31a8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
