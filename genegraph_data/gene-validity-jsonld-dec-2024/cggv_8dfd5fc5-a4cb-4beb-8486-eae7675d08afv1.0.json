Although mutations in the bone morphogenetic receptor 2 (BMPR2) are found in 80% of heritable and ∼15% of patients with IPAH, their low penetrance (∼20%) suggests that other unidentified genetic modifiers are required for manifestation of the disease phenotype. Use of whole-exome sequencing (WES) has recently led to the discovery of novel susceptibility genes in heritable PAH, but whether WES can also accelerate gene discovery in IPAH remains unknown.","dc:creator":"de Jesus Perez VA","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing reveals TopBP1 as a novel gene in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension."},"rdfs:label":"reduced expression of TOPBP1 in PAH tissues/cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ce486ac-d904-48d3-8828-dfea4f3161e1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e53f911f-2a25-4c32-897f-639d16cc39ae","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Restoration of TOPBP1 resulted in improved tube formation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24702692","rdfs:label":"tube formation assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":5361,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":1,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0d292e89-a552-4513-b503-ca928f42ac46","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015924","gene":"hgnc:17008","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*TOPBP1* (topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 ) encodes protein which is involved in DNA replication, especially in DNA damage repair (PMID:20012580). *TOPBP1* was first suggested in connection with autosomal dominant PAH in 2014 after 3 variants (rs55633281, rs17301766 and rs10935070) were identified in a cohort of 12 IPAH patients (Perez et al., PMID: 24702692). These variants are common (allele frequency >5% in multiple populations), and therefore were not scored as a part of this curation. There have been other case-control studies performed, all of which do not show a significant difference in the frequency of the previously mentioned *TOPBP1* variants (PMID:30084161) or other rare variants (PMID:29650961) between PAH patients and controls. Functionally, expression of *TOPBP1* was shown to be reduced in PAH patient cells. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of *TOPB1* in control cells resulted in altered tube formation in PMVECs (pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells) in vitro. Subsequently, overexpression of *TOPBP1* rescued the tube malformations in PAH patient PMVECs (PMID:24702692). \n\nIn summary, due to. the. lack. of genetic. evidence, *TOPBP1* has no known disease relationship with autosomal dominant PAH.
