We studied a human Kv10.2 channel mutation (R327H) recently identified in a child with epileptic encephalopathy and autistic features. Using multistate structural modeling, we demonstrate that the Arg327 residue in the S4 helix of voltage-sensing domain has strong ionic interactions with negatively charged residues within the S1-S3 helices in the resting (closed) and early-activation state but not in the late-activation and fully-activated (open) state. The R327H mutation weakens ionic interactions between residue 327 and these negatively charged residues, thus favoring channel opening. Voltage-clamp analysis showed a strong hyperpolarizing (âˆ¼70 mV) shift of voltage dependence of activation and an acceleration of activation. Our results demonstrate the critical role of the Arg327 residue in stabilizing the channel closed state and explicate for the first time the structural and functional change of a Kv10.2 channel mutation associated with neurological disease.

The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv10.2 (KCNH5) is widely expressed in the brain. However, the inherent relationship between Kv10.2 and autism is still unclear. Herein, a rat valproic acid (VPA)-induced autism spectrum disorder model was established. The expression level of Kv10.2 was obviously decreased in the hippocampus of VPA rats. Kv10.2 was mainly localized in neurons. Subsequently, a recombinant lentivirus expressing Kv10.2 was used to upregulate the expression of Kv10.2 in the hippocampus of VPA-exposed rats. The results were promising as injection of the Kv10.2 lentivirus in the hippocampus relieved anxiety and stereotypical behavior, and improved the social and exploratory abilities of rats that were prenatally exposed to VPA. In addition, spectral analysis of electroencephalogram data revealed that animals exposed to VPA exhibited increased high-frequency activity compared with the control rats, and this activity recovered to a certain extent after upregulation of Kv10.2 expression by lentivirus injection. These results suggest that changes in Kv10.2 may play an important role in the etiology of autism, thus providing a promising direction for further research on autism.","dc:creator":"Wang J","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Increased Expression of Kv10.2 in the Hippocampus Attenuates Valproic Acid-Induced Autism-Like Behaviors in Rats."},"rdfs:label":"Recombinant lentivirus  to upregulate Kv10.2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0525cfa6-b3ea-4df6-80d7-1563d59fa744","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a926bdf-acab-4f74-beec-95d9cf549b61","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Rat-fetuses exposed in valproic acid (VPA) represent an induced autism spectrum disorder.\nThe phenotypes observed in the model iclude anxiety and stereotypical behavior which were improved after upregulation and  overexpression of Kv10.2 \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31728858","rdfs:label":"Rat-fetuses exposed in valproic acid (VPA)-induced ASD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6157,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f3fed555-2ec1-44af-919a-0103b1860aa3","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100207","gene":"hgnc:6254","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Variants in *KCNH5* were first reported in an individual with mild motor delay, severe language delay, and epileptic encephalopathy in 2013 (Veeramah et al., PMID: 23647072). Since that time, numerous other individuals with variants in this gene have been reported with features such as intellectual disability, language and developmental delays, and a variety of seizure types. While severity of intellectual disability and developmental delays have been reported to vary across probands, seizures onset in the first year of life across all cases that were reviewed. For this reason, the Epilepsy GCEP has decided to curate this information under the disease term infantile-onset epilepsy (MONDO:0100207).\n\nSeven missense variants were reported in 19 probands across four publications (PMIDs: 23647072, 32725632, 35874597, 36307226) and one splice site in one proband (PMID:35874597). Two recurrent missense variants, p.Arg327His and p.Arg333His, were recorded in 10 and 4 patients respectively. Most of the observed variants were characterized as de novo in the probands, although there is one case of inheritance from an affected mother. Of note, genotype-phenotype correlations were described in one paper (PMID:36307226). Functional studies for one recurrent missense variant, p.Arg327His, demonstrate a gain of function effect, though these types of studies have not been performed to confirm the mechanism of other variants. The gene-disease relationship is further supported by animal model and rescue studies (PMID:31728858). Additional experimental evidence is also available in the literature (PMID 32222671).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *KCNH5* and autosomal dominant infantile-onset epilepsy (MONDO:0100207). This has been repeatedly demonstrated and has been upheld over time. This was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on November 15th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c1794f26-8bc9-4e76-bc1e-4dfb6aab53ff"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
