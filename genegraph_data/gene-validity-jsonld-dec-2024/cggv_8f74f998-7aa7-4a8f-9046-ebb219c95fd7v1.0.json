The present study describes the cellular, sub-cellular and functional characterization of the novel proteins, MKS1 and meckelin, encoded by these genes. In situ hybridization studies for MKS3 in early human embryos showed transcript localizations in agreement with the tissue phenotype of MKS patients. Both MKS proteins predominantly localized to epithelial cells, including proximal renal tubules and biliary epithelial cells. MKS1 localized to basal bodies, while meckelin localized both to the primary cilium and to the plasma membrane in ciliated cell-lines and primary cells. Meckelin protein with the Q376P missense mutation was unable to localize at the cell membrane. siRNA-mediated reduction of Mks1 and Mks3 expression in a ciliated epithelial cell-line blocked centriole migration to the apical membrane and consequent formation of the primary cilium. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that wild-type meckelin and MKS1 interact and, in three-dimensional tissue culture assays, epithelial branching morphogenesis was severely impaired.

Nodal cilia are not detected at e7.5 in Mks1krc mutants (data not shown), but by e8.5 sparse nodal cilia of variable length and morphology are present (Fig. 4G and H).

The gene mutated in type 1 MKS encodes a protein associated with the base of the cilium in vertebrates and nematodes. However, shRNA knockdown studies in cell culture have reported conflicting results on the role of Mks1 in ciliogenesis. Here we show that loss of function of mouse Mks1 results in an accurate model of human MKS, with structural abnormalities in the neural tube, biliary duct, limb patterning, bone development and the kidney that mirror the human syndrome. In contrast to cell culture studies, loss of Mks1 in vivo does not interfere with apical localization of epithelial basal bodies but rather leads to defective cilia formation in most, but not all, tissues. Analysis of patterning in the neural tube and the limb demonstrates altered Hedgehog (Hh) pathway signaling underlies some MKS defects, although both tissues show an expansion of the domain of response to Shh signaling, unlike the phenotypes seen in other mutants with cilia loss. Other defects in the skull, lung, rib cage and long bones are likely to be the result of the disruption of Hh signaling, and the basis of defects in the liver and kidney require further analysis. Thus the disruption of Hh signaling can explain many, but not all, of the defects caused by loss of Mks1.","dc:creator":"Weatherbee SD","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"A mouse model for Meckel syndrome reveals Mks1 is required for ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling."},"rdfs:label":"Weatherbee_KOmice_CiliaryFunction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:8f74f998-7aa7-4a8f-9046-ebb219c95fd7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:841c5d48-e453-4b8b-b513-14eb2015d486","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1377cb3-5d84-4f12-b07f-5d6904e840e3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Although penetrance is different for some of the MKS features compared to the human condition, the authors were able to largely recapitulate the primary MKS features in their MKS1 knockout mice.

TOPFlash Wnt reporter assays in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed general de-regulated high levels of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling in Mks1(-/-) cells. In addition to these signalling defects, we also observed ectopic high proliferation in the brain and kidney of mutant animals at mid- to late-gestation. The specific role of Mks1 in regulating cell proliferation was confirmed in Mks1 siRNA knockdown experiments which showed increased levels of proliferation after knockdown, an effect not seen after knockdown of other ciliopathy genes. We suggest that this is a result of the de-regulation of multiple signalling pathways (Wnt, mTOR and Hh) in the absence of functional Mks1.

Five of six families with both MKS1 and BBS mutations manifested seizures, a feature that is not a typical component of either syndrome. Functional studies in zebrafish showed that mks1 is necessary for gastrulation movements and that it interacts genetically with known bbs genes. Similarly, we found two families with missense or splice mutations in MKS3, in one of which the affected individual also bears a homozygous nonsense mutation in CEP290 that is likely to truncate the C terminus of the protein. These data extend the genetic stratification of ciliopathies and suggest that BBS and MKS, although distinct clinically, are allelic forms of the same molecular spectrum.","dc:creator":"Leitch CC","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Hypomorphic mutations in syndromic encephalocele genes are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:19e0ed35-0b69-4a1c-9a62-2bccfb1dde66_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2d58310a-6c18-424d-98c5-6e4ddff4015e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18327255"}],"rdfs:label":"Leitch _PB215-04"},{"id":"cggv:19e0ed35-0b69-4a1c-9a62-2bccfb1dde66","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:19e0ed35-0b69-4a1c-9a62-2bccfb1dde66_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:8ac7db04-7f49-4a24-9430-af5cee055696","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ac7db04-7f49-4a24-9430-af5cee055696_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:12bc2e2a-786d-4832-a8a5-9d76a022be1f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:12bc2e2a-786d-4832-a8a5-9d76a022be1f","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:1cd9a036-5d54-45cf-bd87-9298a7c5d111","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017777.4(MKS1):c.1382A>G (p.Tyr461Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA273751"}},{"id":"cggv:5aea1b50-f62c-4bd6-b82f-0081a3384281","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017777.4(MKS1):c.1601G>A (p.Arg534Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA273756"}}],"detectionMethod":"Five typical BBS patients were recruited and screened for mutations in a total of 144 known genes responsible for inherited retinal diseases, a hallmark symptom of BBS.

Currently, BBS is diagnosed by direct DNA sequencing for mutations in these genes, which because of the large genomic screening region is both time-consuming and expensive. In order to develop a practical method for the clinic diagnosis of BBS, we have developed a high-throughput targeted exome sequencing (TES) for genetic diagnosis. Five typical BBS patients were recruited and screened for mutations in a total of 144 known genes responsible for inherited retinal diseases, a hallmark symptom of BBS. The genomic DNA of these patients and their families were subjected to high-throughput DNA re-sequencing. Deep bioinformatics analysis was carried out to filter the massive sequencing data, which were further confirmed through co-segregation analysis. TES successfully revealed mutations in BBS genes in each patient and family member. Six pathological mutations, including five novel mutations, were revealed in the genes BBS2, MKKS, ARL6, MKS1. This study represents the first report of targeted exome sequencing in BBS patients and demonstrates that high-throughput TES is an accurate and rapid method for the genetic diagnosis of

Additionally, *MKS1* was initially associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) in 2008 (Leitch et al., PMID: 18327255) and with Joubert Syndrome (JS) in 2014 (Romani et al., PMID: 24886560). Typical features of MS include cystic kidneys, occipital encephalocele, and polydactyly. BBS patients also commonly present with polydactyly, while also showing obesity and retinitis pigmentosa. Finally, JS is characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, cystic kidney disease, liver fibrosis, polydactyly, and/or retinal dystrophy. Each of these diseases is considered a ciliopathy, as pathogenic mutations in *MKS1* cause primary cilia dysfunction in affected individuals. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern between these three disorders, and phenotypic variability between them was considered to be consistent with a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, Meckel syndrome 1 (MIM#: 249000), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 13 (MIM#: 615990) and Joubert syndrome 28 (MIM#: 617121) have been lumped into a single curation under the name MKS1-related ciliopathy.\n\nFifteen variants (four splicing, three nonsense, five missense, two in-frame deletions, and one frameshift deletion) that have been reported in ten probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 24886560, 33193692, 34359301, 26490104, 18327255, 24608809, 17397051) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Although unclear, the mechanism of pathogenicity may be a spectrum, with biallelic truncating mutations in *MKS1* leading to MS and less damaging mutations causing BBS or JS. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by an expression study showing that MKS1 protein localizes to the basal body of cilia, supporting the role of *MKS1* in ciliary function. These authors also conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing that the MKS1 protein interacts with TMEM67, a protein previously associated with Meckel Syndrome. Finally, using RNAi to silence *MKS1* expression, this group shows that ciliary formation and cilia length were significantly decreased in targeted cells when compared to control cells (PMID: 17185389). Confirming these results, Weatherbee et. al. show that primary cilia formation is reduced in mesenchymal and epithelial tissues of *MKS1*-knockout mice. This publication goes on to provide evidence that mutant mice recapitulate the main features seen in human Meckel Syndrome patients, including polydactyly, cystic kidneys, and occipital encephalocele (PMID: 19776033). A second *MKS1*-null mouse model similarly recapitulates these primary human MKS features (PMID: 23454480).\n\nIn summary, *MKS1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MKS1-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence.
