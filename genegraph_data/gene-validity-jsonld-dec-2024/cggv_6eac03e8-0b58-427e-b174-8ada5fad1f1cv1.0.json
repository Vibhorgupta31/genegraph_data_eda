Identification of mutations in genes causing SRNS has improved our understanding of disease mechanisms and highlighted defects in the podocyte, a highly specialized glomerular epithelial cell, as major factors in disease pathogenesis. By exome sequencing, we identified missense mutations in TBC1D8B in two families with an X-linked early-onset SRNS with FSGS. TBC1D8B is an uncharacterized Rab-GTPase-activating protein likely involved in endocytic and recycling pathways. Immunofluorescence studies revealed TBC1D8B presence in human glomeruli, and affected individual podocytes displayed architectural changes associated with migration defects commonly found in FSGS. In zebrafish we demonstrated that both knockdown and knockout of the unique TBC1D8B ortholog-induced proteinuria and that this phenotype was rescued by human TBC1D8B mRNA injection, but not by either of the two mutated mRNAs. We also showed an interaction between TBC1D8B and Rab11b, a key protein in vesicular recycling in cells. Interestingly, both internalization and recycling processes were dramatically decreased in affected individuals' podocytes and fibroblasts, confirming the crucial role of TBC1D8B in the cellular recycling processes, probably as a Rab11b GTPase-activating protein. Altogether, these results confirmed that pathogenic variations in TBC1D8B are involved in X-linked podocytopathy and points to alterations in recycling processes as a mechanism of SRNS.","dc:creator":"Dorval G","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"TBC1D8B Loss-of-Function Mutations Lead to X-Linked Nephrotic Syndrome via Defective Trafficking Pathways."},"rdfs:label":"TBC1D8B staining in human kidney "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fb6a5f13-3bd4-492c-a0f2-77b870659ef8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2828f316-ce9e-40ee-85fa-3d2de511b5d8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Murine Tbc1d8b cDNA constructs that reflect the mutations from patients with nephrotic syndrome exhibit reduced binding affinity toward nephrin","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31732614","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in about 50 genes have been identified as monogenic causes of nephrotic syndrome, a frequent cause of CKD.

The preferred disease name suggested for this disorder is ‘Nephrotic syndrome - *TBC1D8B*’. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. Nephrotic syndrome - *TBC1D8B*  is characterized in existing literature by significant protein loss in the urine causing generalized edema with variable age of onset ranging from the first few months of life to 19 years. \n\nNine variants (frameshift, nonsense and missense) have been reported in 8 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 30661770, 31732614, 35970429) and are included in this curation. A total of 6.3/12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached, considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and rescue assays. TBC1D8B is expressed on mature human glomeruli (PMID 30661770), interacts with nephrin which is reduced in mutant TBC1D8B (PMID 31732614), and TBC1D8B mutation in vitro increased podocyte motility, increased cell adhesion, and impaired vesicular trafficking (PMID 30661770). TBC1D8B knockout in zebrafish caused glomerular proteinuria, podocyte foot process effacement and pericardial edema (PMID 30661770). Lastly, TBC1D8B knockdown in zebrafish could be rescued using wild-type mRNA (PMID 30661770). A total of 5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between TBC1D8B and X-linked Nephrotic syndrome.\n\nUpon full curation with expert panel. Deemed more appropriate to round score of 11.3 to 11, consistent with moderate clinical validity classification","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6eac03e8-0b58-427e-b174-8ada5fad1f1c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
