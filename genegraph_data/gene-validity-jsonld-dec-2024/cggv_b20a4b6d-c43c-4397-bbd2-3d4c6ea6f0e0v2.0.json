One is tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (hTDO), and the other is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (hIDO), both of which catalyze the oxidative degradation of Trp to N-formyl kynurenine. Although hTDO and hIDO catalyze the same reaction, they engage in distinct physiological functions. The molecular properties of hTDO, unlike hIDO, have never been explored in the past. Here, we report the first structural and functional characterization of hTDO with resonance Raman and optical absorption spectroscopies. We show that the proximal Fe-His stretching frequency of hTDO is 229 cm(-1), 7 cm(-1) lower than that of hIDO, indicating its weaker imidazolate character as compared to hIDO. In the CO derivative of the L-Trp-bound enzyme, the Fe-CO stretching and C-O stretching frequencies are 488 and 1972 cm(-1), respectively, suggesting that L-Trp binds to the distal pocket with its C2-C3 double bond facing the heme-bound ligand, in contrast to hIDO, in which the indole NH group forms an H-bond with the heme-bound ligand. Moreover, the Km values of hTDO for D-Trp and L-Trp are similar, but the kcat value for D-Trp is 10-fold lower than that for L-Trp. In contrast, in hIDO, the Km value for D-Trp is 700-fold higher than L-Trp, whereas the kcat values are comparable for the two stereoisomers. Taken together, the data indicate that the initial deprotonation reaction of the indole NH group in hTDO is carried out by the evolutionarily conserved distal His, whereas that in hIDO is performed by the heme-bound dioxygen; in addition, the stereospecificity of hTDO is determined by the efficiency of the dioxygen chemistry, whereas that in hIDO is controlled by the substrate affinity.","dc:creator":"Batabyal D","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Human tryptophan dioxygenase: a comparison to indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase."},"rdfs:label":"L-Tryptophan metabolism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"To quantify the activity of TDO, L-Trp the formation of N-formylkynurenine from L-Trp was followed by optical absorption spectroscopy."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:b20a4b6d-c43c-4397-bbd2-3d4c6ea6f0e0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:33a0352c-1449-4f5f-b35c-8e67ca3beb88","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a27555e-4156-4423-b4f9-9237db3ac8ba","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Trp levels in plasma were 9.3-fold higher in Tdo-/- than Tdo+/+ mice.

Unbiased ascertainment by newborn screening strongly suggests that this is a benign biochemical variant of no clinical significance (PMIDs: 28285122). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Two unique variants (missense and frameshift) have been reported in the single human case (PMID: 28285122). This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function in tryptophan metabolism (PMID: 18027945) and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 19323847). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 07/10/2020.
