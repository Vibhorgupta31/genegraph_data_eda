These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.

SOS is inactive unless Ras is bound to an allosteric site on SOS, and the Dbl homology (DH) and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of SOS (the DH-PH unit) block allosteric Ras binding. We showed previously that the activity of SOS at the membrane increases with the density of PIP(2) and the local concentration of Ras-GTP, which synergize to release the DH-PH unit. Here we present a new crystal structure of SOS that contains the N-terminal histone domain in addition to the DH-PH unit and the catalytic unit (SOS(HDFC), residues 1-1049). The structure reveals that the histone domain plays a dual role in occluding the allosteric site and in stabilizing the autoinhibitory conformation of the DH-PH unit. Additional insight is provided by kinetic analysis of the activation of membrane-bound Ras by mutant forms of SOS that contain mutations in the histone and the PH domains (E108K, C441Y, and E433K) that are associated with Noonan syndrome, a disease caused by hyperactive Ras signaling. Our results indicate that the histone domain and the DH-PH unit are conformationally coupled, and that the simultaneous engagement of the membrane by a PH domain PIP(2)-binding interaction and electrostatic interactions between a conserved positively charged patch on the histone domain and the negatively charged membrane coincides with a productive reorientation of SOS at the membrane and increased accessibility of both Ras binding sites on SOS.","dc:creator":"Gureasko J","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Role of the histone domain in the autoinhibition and activation of the Ras activator Son of Sevenless."},"rdfs:label":"crystal structure of SOS1 protein w/ assays on several varia"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"variant pathogenicity not specific to CFC"},{"id":"cggv:38fc059f-aee8-407f-97df-db10607398fd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b28fc59-e68d-4b08-ac6e-341a6b24fcc9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The variant caused a significant increase in the activation of ERK in the presence of EGF.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25712082","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic condition characterized by congenital heart defects, short stature and characteristic facial features.

After a comparison between the sequence of SOS1 cDNA from peripheral blood and SOS1 genomic DNA, we showed for the first time a differential allelic expression of the SOS1 gene in healthy individuals, thus occurring as a physiologic condition. Interestingly, we found that the mutated allele C was 50% more expressed than the wild-type allele T in all familial carriers. The comparable amount of SOS1 mRNA between mutated individuals and the controls indicates that the variant does not affect SOS1 expression.
