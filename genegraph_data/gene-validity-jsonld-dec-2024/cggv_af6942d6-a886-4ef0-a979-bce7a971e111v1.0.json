Here we identify the SEMA4A p.Val78Met germline mutation in an Austrian kindred with FCCTX, using an integrative genomics strategy. Compared with wild-type protein, SEMA4A(V78M) demonstrates significantly increased MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signalling as well as cell cycle progression of SEMA4A-deficient HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells. In a cohort of 53 patients with FCCTX, we depict two further SEMA4A mutations, p.Gly484Ala and p.Ser326Phe and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) p.Pro682Ser. This SNP is highly associated with the FCCTX phenotype exhibiting increased risk for colorectal cancer (OR 6.79, 95% CI 2.63 to 17.52). Our study shows previously unidentified germline variants in SEMA4A predisposing to FCCTX, which has implications for surveillance strategies of patients and their families.","dc:creator":"Schulz E","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Germline variants in the SEMA4A gene predispose to familial colorectal cancer type X."},"rdfs:label":"SEMA4A Pro682Ser association study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlSingleVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"SNP rs76381440 is the SNP of interest\n\nThis association was refuted in PMID: 26961734\n\nThere was a response by original author defending the association (PMID:26960273) but insufficient to warrant scoring.\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dfbb6b6a-b83e-47df-bfac-a5baed4ecb09","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c5cd50b9-39de-48fd-9509-86188986dfc3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"GTEx data show SEMA4A is widely expressed including normal colonic tissue","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25307848","rdfs:label":"mRNA expression of SEMA4A in different human tissues"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not a colon tissue-specific protein.

Although there is no disease associated with SEMA4 in OMIM, there was an early assertion of association with Lynch syndrome (Schulz et al. PMID: 25307848). This curation will focus on this disorder. In 2014, Schulz and co-workers first proposed the association of germline SEMA4 variants in autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome by reporting a missense variant (splice site and missense) in a family with Lynch syndrome. This study also found that this variant is associated with colorectal cancer by a case-control analysis. However, in 2016, Kinnersley et al reported a well-powered study showing no statistical significance between this variant and colorectal cancer. The pedigree from the family with colorectal cancer also showed incomplete segregation. Hence Kinnersley et al concluded that there is an issue of type 1 error in Schulz et al. paper. Considering the lack of substantial association in genetic and experimental studies, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role SEMA4A plays in autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Colon Cancer GCEP on 11/13/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 3/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\nConsidering the lack of substantial association in genetic and experimental studies, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association.
