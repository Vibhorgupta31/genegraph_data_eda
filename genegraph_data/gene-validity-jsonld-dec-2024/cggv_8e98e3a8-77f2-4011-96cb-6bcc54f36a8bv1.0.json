It has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide that is proteolytically processed after import into the mitochondrial matrix, where it forms a homotrimeric complex organized in a doughnut-shaped structure. Although C1QBP has been reported to exert pleiotropic effects on many cellular processes, we report here four individuals from unrelated families where biallelic mutations in C1QBP cause a defect in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Infants presented with cardiomyopathy accompanied by multisystemic involvement (liver, kidney, and brain), and children and adults presented with myopathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Multiple mitochondrial respiratory-chain defects, associated with the accumulation of multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA in the later-onset myopathic cases, were identified in all affected individuals.

Both siblings had profound cardiac failure with ventricular arrhythmia. One child died suddenly. The second sibling survived resuscitation but required extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support and died shortly afterward. On cardiac autopsy, the left ventricle was hypertrophied in both children. Histological examination revealed prominent cardiomyocyte cytoplasmic clearing, and electron microscopy confirmed abnormal mitochondrial structure within cardiomyocytes. DNA sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants in C1QBP (p.Thr40Asnfs*45 and p.Phe204Leu) in both children. Family segregation analysis demonstrated each variant was inherited from an unaffected, heterozygous parent. Inherited loss of C1QBP/p32 is associated with recessive cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death in early life. Ultrastructural mitochondrial evaluation in the second child was similar to findings in engineered C1qbp-deficient mice.

Mitochondrial p32/C1qbp, which functions as an RNA and protein chaperone, interacts with mitochondrial mRNA and is indispensable for mitochondrial function through its regulation of mitochondrial translation in cultured cell lines. However, the precise role of p32/C1qbp in vivo is poorly understood because of embryonic lethality in the systemic p32-deficient mouse. The goal of this study was to examine the physiological function of mitochondrial p32/C1qbp in the heart.","dc:creator":"Saito T","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Cardiomyocyte-specific loss of mitochondrial p32/C1qbp causes cardiomyopathy and activates stress responses."},"rdfs:label":"Saito_Cardiomyocyte-specific KO mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"recapitulation of phenotype (0.5); biochemical defect (0.5)"},{"id":"cggv:08b5d846-89a8-4dac-9e7f-f6130397ffe0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8570c412-6673-49c7-ab65-1a1c8db9e593","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Severe depletion of the mtDNA encoded proteins, mt-CoxI, CoxIII and of nuclear encoded Ndufa9 and CoxVα present in p32cKO nerves compared with controls; significantly reduced activities of complexes I and IV in p32cKO brain mitochondria, while the activities of complex II and III were unchanged (Fig. 2f).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29123152","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical step in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases.

The *C1QBP* gene encodes complement component C1q-binding protein. This protein is a multifunctional chaperone predicted to have roles in inflammation and infection processes, mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, regulation of apoptosis, regulation of nuclear transcription, and mitochondrial homeostasis. \n\nThe *C1QBP* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2017 (PMID: 28942965). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *C1QBP*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *C1QBP* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 10 unique variants (seven missense variants, one in-frame deletion, one frameshift, and one deletion) identified in 11 probands (14 cases total) from seven publications (PMIDs: 28942965, 32652806, 33344382, 33977026, 34419324, 34003581, 35119291).   Age of onset in affected individuals varied from in utero to the sixth decade, and outcomes similarly varied from stillbirth/death in first days of life to alive at more than 60 years of age. Features included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (not seen in all; one case had a successful heart transplant), ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, intrauterine growth restriction, and oligohydramnios. There were no commonalities on imaging. Tissue biopsies identified multiple large scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle and heart; ragged red fibers, ragged blue fibers, and decreased COX histochemical activity in muscle; aggregates of a large number of mitochondria of varying size, altered cristae, parking lot inclusions, unusual triangular crystalline inclusion in muscle; and lipid droplets in liver. Mitochondrial DNA content was increased at 250% of controls in muscle and 600% in liver. Lab values showed lactic acidosis, metabolic acidosis, and elevated CK. Some affected individuals had normal mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities while others had decreased activities of complexes I, III, and IV in muscle and liver. Complex I, IV, V intact steady-state levels were decreased in muscle by BN-PAGE. These levels were normal in some subjects’ cultured fibroblasts and others showed decreased CI and CIV in cultured fibroblasts. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 35310974, 28498888, 9305894, 22904065, 29123152).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 15, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
