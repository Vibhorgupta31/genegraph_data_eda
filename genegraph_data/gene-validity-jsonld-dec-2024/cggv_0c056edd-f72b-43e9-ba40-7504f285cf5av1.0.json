Since the mechanism in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is through autosomal dominantly acting germline variants, the curations were split instead of lumped. TET2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in 2020 (Potus et al., PMID: 32192357). Out of a cohort of 2572 cases from the PAH biobank, 6 rare predicted deleterious likely germline variants including missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants were identified in 6 unrelated individuals. The relationship between TET2 and PAH is also supported by experimental evidence including tissue expression in controls and patients, biochemical function as a negative regulator of a proinflammatory response, and knock out TET2 mice exhibiting a PH phenotype. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PH Gene Curation Expert Panel on 4/6/2022.
