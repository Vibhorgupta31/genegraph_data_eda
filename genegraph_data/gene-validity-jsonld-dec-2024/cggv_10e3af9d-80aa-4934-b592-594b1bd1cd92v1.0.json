By contrast, no cosegregating PROS1 mutation has been found in any of the six families with only type III phenotypes.

In an attempt to overcome these problems, a reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mutation screening procedure was developed. However, the application of this mRNA-based strategy to the detection of gene lesions causing heterozygous type I protein S deficiency appears limited owing to the high proportion of patients exhibiting absence of mRNA derived from the mutation-bearing allele (\"allelic exclusion\"). Nevertheless, this strategy remains extremely effective for rapid mutation detection in type II/III protein S deficiency. Using the RT-PCR technique, a G-to-A transition was detected at position +1 of the exon IV donor splice site, which was associated with type I deficiency and resulted in both exon skipping and cryptic splice site utilization. No abnormal protein S was detected in plasma from this patient. A missense mutation (Asn 217 to Ser), which may interfere with calcium binding, was also detected in exon VIII in a patient with type III protein S deficiency. A further three PROS gene lesions were detected in three patients with type I deficiency by direct sequencing of exon-containing genomic PCR fragments: a single base-pair (bp) deletion in exon XIV, a 2-bp deletion in exon VIII, and a G0to-A transition at position -1 of the exon X donor splice site all resulted in the absence of mRNA expressed from the disease allele. Thus, the RT-PCR methodology proved effective for further analysis of the resulting protein S-deficient phenotypes. A missense mutation (Met570 to Thr) in exon XIV of a further type III-deficient proband was subsequently detected in this patient's cDNA.

Western blotting using the polyclonal anti-protein S antibody showed that approximately half of the patient's protein S appeared to be the variant with a higher molecular weight than normal protein S. The partially purified variant protein S bound neither to the monoclonal antibody recognizing calcium-dependent conformation of protein S nor to the antibody recognizing the thrombin-sensitive domain of protein S. Among the exons from II to XV of the patient's protein S gene encoding from the NH2-terminal end to the COOH-terminal end of protein S, only one missense mutation (A to G) was found in exon VI of the protein S alpha-gene, which results in amino acid substitution of Glu(GAG) for Lys-155(AAG) in the second epidermal growth factor-like domain of protein S. The recombinant protein S Tokushima expressed in BHK cells had a slightly higher molecular weight than the recombinant normal one, did not bind to the antibody specific for the thrombin-sensitive domain, and did not show the cofactor activity.

Over 400 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, splicing and frameshift variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 18 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 8298131, 10063989, 7545463, 20484936, 10447256). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 33 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function as a cofactor for Protein C (PMID: 6892911), and both heterozygous and null mouse models which recapitulate phenotypes observed in humans (PMID: 19567881). In summary, PROS1 is definitively associated with semidominant hereditary thrombophilia due to congenital protein S deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:10e3af9d-80aa-4934-b592-594b1bd1cd92"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
