In humans, mutations in NYX and GRM6 have been shown to cause the condition. Through the analysis of a consanguineous family and screening of nine additional pedigrees, we have identified three families with recessive mutations in the gene TRPM1 encoding transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 1, also known as melastatin. A number of other variants of unknown significance were found. All patients had myopia, reduced central vision, nystagmus, and electroretinographic evidence of ON bipolar cell dysfunction. None had abnormalities of skin pigmentation, although other skin conditions were reported. RNA derived from human retina and skin was analyzed and alternate 5' exons were determined. The most 5' exon is likely to harbor an initiation codon, and the protein sequence is highly conserved across vertebrate species. These findings suggest an important role of this specific cation channel for the normal function of ON bipolar cells in the human retina.","dc:creator":"Li Z","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Recessive mutations of the gene TRPM1 abrogate ON bipolar cell function and cause complete congenital stationary night blindness in humans."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ecc95d2-f47b-4238-9475-2bd96f4b92db_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ecc95d2-f47b-4238-9475-2bd96f4b92db_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:613713ab-0afe-4fbe-be77-97e23150bc50","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:958faa38-a510-407b-b7a0-459264a5de3e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"- Used LP genotype (directly associated with CSNB, inferred by coat pattern) and CSNB diagnosis (categorized by ocular examination, which included. neurophthalmic examination, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and electroretinography) to confirm CSNB in appaloosa horses.

Homozygosity for LP (LP/LP) is directly associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in Appaloosa horses. LP maps to a 6-cM region on ECA1. We investigated the relative expression of two functional candidate genes located in this LP candidate region (TRPM1 and OCA2), as well as three other linked loci (TJP1, MTMR10, and OTUD7A) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. No large differences were found for expression levels of TJP1, MTMR10, OTUD7A, and OCA2. However, TRPM1 (Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel, Subfamily M, Member 1) expression in the retina of homozygous appaloosa horses was 0.05% the level found in non-appaloosa horses (R = 0.0005). This constitutes a >1800-fold change (FC) decrease in TRPM1 gene expression in the retina (FC = -1870.637, P = 0.001) of CSNB-affected (LP/LP) horses. TRPM1 was also downregulated in LP/LP pigmented skin (R = 0.005, FC = -193.963, P = 0.001) and in LP/LP unpigmented skin (R = 0.003, FC = -288.686, P = 0.001) and was downregulated to a lesser extent in LP/lp unpigmented skin (R = 0.027, FC = -36.583, P = 0.001). TRP proteins are thought to have a role in controlling intracellular Ca(2+) concentration.

We localized TRPM1 in human retina to the ON bipolar cell dendrites in the outer plexifom layer.

Photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light and reduce the rate of glutamate release, which in turn causes the depolarization of ON-bipolar cells. This ON-bipolar cell response is mediated by the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR6, which controls the activity of a depolarizing current. Despite intensive research over the past two decades, the molecular identity of the channel that generates this depolarizing current has remained elusive. Here, we present evidence indicating that TRPM1 is necessary for the depolarizing light response of ON-bipolar cells, and further that TRPM1 is a component of the channel that generates this light response. Gene expression profiling revealed that TRPM1 is highly enriched in ON-bipolar cells. In situ hybridization experiments confirmed that TRPM1 mRNA is found in cells of the retinal inner nuclear layer, and immunofluorescent confocal microscopy showed that TRPM1 is localized in the dendrites of ON-bipolar cells in both mouse and macaque retina. The electroretinogram (ERG) of TRPM1-deficient (TRPM1(-/-)) mice had a normal a-wave, but no b-wave, indicating a loss of bipolar cell response. Finally, whole-cell patch-clamp recording from ON-bipolar cells in mouse retinal slices demonstrated that genetic deletion of TRPM1 abolished chemically simulated light responses from rod bipolar cells and dramatically altered the responses of cone ON-bipolar cells. Identification of TRPM1 as a mGluR6-coupled cation channel reveals a key step in vision, expands the role of the TRP channel family in sensory perception, and presents insights into the evolution of vertebrate vision.","dc:creator":"Morgans CW","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"TRPM1 is required for the depolarizing light response in retinal ON-bipolar cells."},"rdfs:label":"Morgans_MouseModel"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"Due to the extensive work that Morgans et al. did in their TRPM1 null mouse model, I scored it at 2 points.

Mutations in the genes NYX and GRM6, expressed in ON bipolar cells, lead to a disruption of the ON bipolar cell response. This dysfunction is present in patients with complete X-linked and autosomal-recessive congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) and can be assessed by standard full-field electroretinography (ERG), showing severely reduced rod b-wave amplitude and slightly altered cone responses. Although many cases of complete CSNB (cCSNB) are caused by mutations in NYX and GRM6, in approximately 60% of the patients the gene defect remains unknown. Animal models of human diseases are a good source for candidate genes, and we noted that a cCSNB phenotype present in homozygous Appaloosa horses is associated with downregulation of TRPM1. TRPM1, belonging to the family of transient receptor potential channels, is expressed in ON bipolar cells and therefore qualifies as an excellent candidate. Indeed, mutation analysis of 38 patients with CSNB identified ten unrelated cCSNB patients with 14 different mutations in this gene. The mutation spectrum comprises missense, splice-site, deletion, and nonsense mutations. We propose that the cCSNB phenotype in these patients is due to the absence of functional TRPM1 in retinal ON bipolar cells.","dc:creator":"Audo I","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"TRPM1 is mutated in patients with autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness."}},{"id":"cggv:59a4c075-0b2d-4157-af5f-dc3c7f0b48bc_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:be3ce75b-2cf9-4108-95b7-6c0a047fd42c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19896113"}],"rdfs:label":"Audo_4497"},{"id":"cggv:59a4c075-0b2d-4157-af5f-dc3c7f0b48bc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59a4c075-0b2d-4157-af5f-dc3c7f0b48bc_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"WES not used for genotyping (-0.5)\nNo previous testing (-0.5)\n\n"},{"id":"cggv:f172b235-65e5-4b15-a403-9a656ebe49f7","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f172b235-65e5-4b15-a403-9a656ebe49f7_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"CA118069 variant in case # 4497 is present in the European (non-Finnish) population at a frequency of 0.0002564 (33/128694 alleles).

The hallmark CSNB phenotype is night blindness from birth or early childhood with a severely reduced or completely absent scotopic b-wave in an ERG, but normal or mildly affected a-wave. Patients also commonly present with myopia, nystagmus and/or strabismus. Because of the broad spectrum of potential phenotypes, these cases with causal variants in *TRPM1* have been curated under the inclusive disease name *TRPM1*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800402).\n \nTwelve variants (four nonsense, three missense, two frameshift, and three intronic) that have been reported in eight probands in five publications (PMIDs: 35633130, 19896113, 20300565, 19896109, 19878917) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *TRPM1* exhibits its highest expression levels in retina tissue (PMID: 19878917). Additionally, expression of TRPM1 in the retina of horses with a CSNB phenotype is 0.05% of the level found in horses with normal vision (PMID: 18660533). Immunolocalization shows that TRPM1 is localized to ON bipolar cell dendrites in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the retina (PMID: 19896109). The ERG b-wave is absent (a defining phenotype of CSNB) in a *Trpm1 (-/-)* knockout mouse (PMID: 20300565). These ERG results have been replicated in another *Trpm1* null mutant mouse experiment (PMID: 19861548). Furthermore, this group has also found that TRPM1 immuno-staining is absent in the OPL layer of retinal cells in *Trpm1(−/−)* mice. They go on to show that OKR response is reduced in knockout mice. Finally, these authors show that cell response is absent (in rod cells) or highly altered (in cone cells) in *Trpm1 (-/-)* mice (PMID: 19861548).\n\nIn summary, *TRPM1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of *TRPM1*-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification according to the ClinGen template. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on October 6, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5ecc95d2-f47b-4238-9475-2bd96f4b92db"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
