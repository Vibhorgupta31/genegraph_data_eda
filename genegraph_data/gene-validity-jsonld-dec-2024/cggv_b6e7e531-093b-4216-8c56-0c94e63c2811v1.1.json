All neuroligins contain an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence with the characteristics of a cleaved signal peptide followed by a large esterase homology domain, a highly conserved single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain. The three neuroligins are alternatively spliced at the same position and are expressed at high levels only in brain. Binding studies demonstrate that all three neuroligins bind to beta-neurexins both as native brain proteins and as recombinant proteins. Tight binding of the three neuroligins to beta-neurexins is observed only for beta-neurexins lacking an insert in splice site 4. Thus, neuroligins constitute a multigene family of brain-specific proteins with distinct isoforms that may have overlapping functions in mediating recognition processes between neurons.","dc:creator":"Ichtchenko K","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Structures, alternative splicing, and neurexin binding of multiple neuroligins."},"rdfs:label":"Affinity chromatography"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:30af40a3-509c-4565-acbc-947805cb31cd","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42ae19a1-b023-403c-8f6f-5a7663ef9a92","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"SHANK3 lies within a multi-genic region on chromosome 22 that is deleted in Phelan-McDermid syndrome, a disorder which is frequently accompanied by ASD.

The strong interconnectivity between the protein components is mediated by a limited number of interaction modes. Particularly abundant are PDZ domain-mediated interactions. An obstacle in understanding the fidelity of postsynaptic processes involving PDZ domains is the high degree of overlap with respect to their binding specificities. Focussing on transsynaptic adhesion molecules, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to obtain an overview of the binding specificities of selected C-terminal PDZ binding motifs. Neuroligin, a postsynaptic cell surface protein that spans the synaptic cleft and interacts with beta-neurexin, served as a starting point. Neuroligin binds to the PDZ domain-containing proteins PSD95, SAP102, Chapsyn110, S-SCAM, Magi1 and 3, Shank1 and 3, Pick1, GOPC, SPAR, Semcap3 and PDZ-RGS3. Next, we examined the relationship between neuroligin and synaptic cell adhesion molecules or glutamate receptor subunits with respect to PDZ-mediated interactions. We found a limited overlap in the PDZ-domain binding specificities of neuroligin with those of Sidekick2 and Ephrin-B2. In contrast, Syndecan2 and IgSF4 show no overlap with the PDZ-domain specificity of neuroligin, instead, they bind to GRIP and syntenin. The AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 interacts with Semcap3 and PDZ-RGS3, whereas the kainate receptor subunits GluR5 and GluR6 show weak interactions with PSD95. In summary, we can sketch a complex pattern of overlap in the binding specificities of synaptic cell surface proteins towards PDZ-domain proteins.","dc:creator":"Meyer G","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"The complexity of PDZ domain-mediated interactions at glutamatergic synapses: a case study on neuroligin."},"rdfs:label":"Yeast two-hybrid screen"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:b6e7e531-093b-4216-8c56-0c94e63c2811_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa006b62-a197-4b94-9501-0760774282f6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48bd8e6b-98b0-40af-898e-16e85dfcf926","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"R451C variant results in ER retention of the mutant NLGN3 protein.

We also show altered interactions of the mutant proteins with chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum and arrest of transport along the secretory pathway with diversion to the proteasome. Time-controlled expression of a fluorescently tagged neuroligin in hippocampal neurons shows that these mutations compromise neuronal trafficking of the protein, with the R451C mutation reducing and the G221R mutation virtually abolishing the export of NLGN3 from the soma to the dendritic spines. Although the R451C mutation causes a local folding defect, the G221R mutation appears responsible for more global misfolding of the protein, reflecting their sequence positions in the structure of the protein.

Over-expression of wild-type NL3 and NL4 proteins in hippocampal neurons stimulates the formation of presynaptic terminals, whereas the disease-associated mutations result in a loss of this synaptic function.

Here, we confirm that NL3(R451C) mutant mice behaviorally exhibit social interaction deficits and electrophysiologically display increased synaptic inhibition in the somatosensory cortex. Unexpectedly, however, we find that the NL3(R451C) mutation produced a strikingly different phenotype in the hippocampus. Specifically, in the hippocampal CA1 region, the NL3(R451C) mutation caused an â¼1.5-fold increase in AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission, dramatically altered the kinetics of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic responses, induced an approximately twofold up-regulation of NMDA receptors containing NR2B subunits, and enhanced long-term potentiation almost twofold. NL3 KO mice did not exhibit any of these changes. Quantitative light microscopy and EM revealed that the NL3(R451C) mutation increased dendritic branching and altered the structure of synapses in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus. Thus, in NL3(R451C) mutant mice, a single point mutation in a synaptic cell adhesion molecule causes context-dependent changes in synaptic transmission; these changes are consistent with the broad impact of this mutation on murine and human behaviors, suggesting that NL3 controls excitatory and inhibitory synapse properties in a region- and circuit-specific manner.","dc:creator":"Etherton M","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Autism-linked neuroligin-3 R451C mutation differentially alters hippocampal and cortical synaptic function."},"rdfs:label":"Electrophysiology"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Decide to give a total of 3 points for this specific KI mouse model."},{"id":"cggv:83876e89-d41c-4309-ab00-fca0746b211f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e6f16b8-278a-45e0-b3fc-393e68416b98","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Hyperactivity is one symptom in ADHD.

Although recent work on genetic mutations in ASD has shed light on the pathophysiology of the disease, classifying it essentially as a synaptopathy, no treatments are available to date. To develop and test novel ASD treatment approaches, validated and informative animal models are required. Of particular interest, in this context are loss-of-function mutations in the postsynaptic cell adhesion protein neuroligin-4 and point mutations in its homologue neuroligin-3 (NL-3) that were found to cause certain forms of monogenic heritable ASD in humans. Here, we show that NL-3-deficient mice display a behavioral phenotype reminiscent of the lead symptoms of ASD: reduced ultrasound vocalization and a lack of social novelty preference. The latter may be related to an olfactory deficiency observed in the NL-3 mutants. Interestingly, such olfactory phenotype is also present in a subgroup of human ASD patients. Tests for learning and memory showed no gross abnormalities in NL-3 mutants. Also, no alterations were found in time spent in social interaction, prepulse inhibition, seizure propensity and sucrose preference. As often seen in adult ASD patients, total brain volume of NL-3 mutant mice was slightly reduced as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
