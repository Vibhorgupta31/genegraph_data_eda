Most of the currently known HCM disease genes encode sarcomeric proteins. Previous studies have shown an association between CSRP3 missense mutations and either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or HCM, but all these studies were unable to provide comprehensive genetic evidence for a causative role of CSRP3 mutations. We used linkage analysis and identified a CSRP3 missense mutation in a large German family affected by HCM. We confirmed CSRP3 as an HCM disease gene. Furthermore, CSRP3 missense mutations segregating with HCM were identified in four other families. We used a newly designed monoclonal antibody to show that muscle LIM protein (MLP), the protein encoded by CSRP3, is mainly a cytosolic component of cardiomyocytes and not tightly anchored to sarcomeric structures. Our functional data from both in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that at least one of MLP's mutated forms seems to be destabilized in the heart of HCM patients harbouring a CSRP3 missense mutation. We also present evidence for mild skeletal muscle disease in affected persons. Our results support the view that HCM is not exclusively a sarcomeric disease and also suggest that impaired mechano-sensory stress signalling might be involved in the pathogenesis of HCM.","dc:creator":"Geier C","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Beyond the sarcomere: CSRP3 mutations cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"H7 proband II-2"},{"id":"cggv:ff28d8b9-b295-4577-9162-ed0d79a3d7ca","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff28d8b9-b295-4577-9162-ed0d79a3d7ca_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Segregation analyses in this family ruled out p.W4R as the causative variant because \"the cosegregation assumption would require us to presuppose an implausibly low penetrance.\""}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d3fe5022-0a3d-4c99-aa9b-3c6e40c187d5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d3fe5022-0a3d-4c99-aa9b-3c6e40c187d5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":48,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f62b4aa0-6f11-4116-ad26-888fbe671501","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003476.5(CSRP3):c.449G>A (p.Cys150Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA348182"}},"detectionMethod":"NGS - 219 genes related to cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death (Supplementary Table 1); all first-degree family members of probands with CSRP3 variant were offered clinical, echocardiographic and genetic studies to test for cosegregation of the variant with disease","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0100749","obo:HP_0001639"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:75e21b02-a132-4398-a496-ba6302711c5e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f62b4aa0-6f11-4116-ad26-888fbe671501"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33035702","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Up to 50% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) show no disease-causing variants in genetic studies.

With the improvement in genetic testing over time, double-heterozygous mutations are more often found by coincidence in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Double heterozygosity can be a cause of the wellknown clinical diversity within HCM families.Methods and results. We describe a family in which members carry either a single mutation or are double heterozygous for mutations in myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) and cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3). The described family emphasises the idea of a more severe clinical phenotype with double-heterozygous mutations. It also highlights the importance of cardiological screening where NT-proBNP may serve as an added diagnostic tool.Conclusion. With a more severe inexplicable phenotype of HCM within a family, one should consider the possibility of double-heterozygous mutations. This implies that in such families, even when one disease-causing mutation is found, all the family members still have an implication for cardiological screening parallel to extended genetic screening.

We assessed the outcome of family screening combining clinical evaluation and screening for sarcomere gene mutations in a cohort of 90 Danish HCM patients and their close relatives, in all 451 persons. Index patients were screened for mutations in all coding regions of 10 sarcomere genes (MYH7, MYL3, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC, CSRP3, TCAP, and TNNC1) and five exons of TTN. Relatives were screened for presence of minor or major diagnostic criteria for HCM and tracking of DNA variants was performed. In total, 297 adult relatives (>18 years) (51.2%) fulfilled one or more criteria for HCM. A total of 38 HCM-causing mutations were detected in 32 index patients. Six patients carried two disease-associated mutations. Twenty-two mutations have only been identified in the present cohort. The genetic diagnostic yield was almost twice as high in familial HCM (53%) vs. HCM of sporadic or unclear inheritance (19%). The yield was highest in families with an additional history of HCM-related clinical events. In relatives, 29.9% of mutation carriers did not fulfil any clinical diagnostic criterion, and in 37.5% of relatives without a mutation, one or more criteria was fulfilled.

cardiomyopathy is a progressive and often lethal disorder and the most common cause of heart failure in children. Despite their severe outcomes, their genetic etiology is still poorly characterised. The current study aimed at uncovering the genetic background of idiopathic primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a cohort of Egyptian children using targeted next-generation sequencing. The study included 24 patients (15 males and 9 females) presented to the cardiomyopathy clinic of Cairo University Children's Hospital with a median age of 2.75 (0.5-14) years. Consanguinity was positive in 62.5% of patients. A family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was present in 20.8% of patients. Ten rare variants were detected in eight patients; two pathogenic variants (8.3%) in MBPC3 and MYH7, and eight variants of uncertain significance in MYBPC3, TTN, VCL, MYL2, CSRP3, and RBM20.Here, we report on the first national study in Egypt that analysed sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric variants in a cohort of idiopathic paediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients using next-generation sequencing. The current pilot study suggests that paediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Egypt might have a particular genetic background, especially with the high burden of consanguinity. Including the genetic testing in the routine diagnostic service is important for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, proper patient management, and at-risk detection. Genome-wide tests (whole exome/genome sequencing) might be better than the targeted sequencing approach to test primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients in addition to its ability for the identification of novel genetic causes.","dc:creator":"Darwish RK","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Genetic study of pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Egypt."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 247"},{"id":"cggv:ad6022d2-e452-4424-a79b-d9809de0ce9e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad6022d2-e452-4424-a79b-d9809de0ce9e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"gnomAD: MAF = 0.0001385 (Other population); https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/11-19207812-C-T.

More than 40 genes have been reported to cause HCM. Among them, CSRP3 is usually included on HCM gene panels used for molecular diagnosis by next-generation sequencing (NGS). To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a NGS workflow based on a panel of 48 cardiomyopathies-causing genes was analyzed on a cohort of 542 HCM patients. As expected, this molecular approach led to identify most pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants into prevalent HCM-causing genes: MYBPC3 (123/542; 22.7%), MYH7 (48/542; 8.9%), TNNT2 (12/542; 2.2%), and TNNI3 (10/542; 1.8%). Among MYBPC3 variants, 96 led to a premature stop codon (78%). More surprisingly, our molecular study led also to detect, for the first time, homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants in two unrelated HCM probands. Meta-analysis of rare previously reported CSRP3 variants on HCM probands using ACMG guidelines indicate that only one variation (p.Cys58Gly) could be considered as likely pathogen. By combining meta-analysis results and identification of two unrelated HCM patients with homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants, we suggest that the association of CSRP3 as a validated HCM-causing gene require additional studies and those CSRP3 variants could result in HCM with an autosomal recessive inheritance rather than with an autosomal dominant transmission as usually reported on HCM (OMIM 612124).","dc:creator":"Janin A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"First identification of homozygous truncating CSRP3 variants in two unrelated cases with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Case 2"},{"id":"cggv:1c83bb28-5adc-4bab-b8a5-480352f5a830","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c83bb28-5adc-4bab-b8a5-480352f5a830_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Patient has consanguineous parents and is HOMOZYGOUS for a truncating variant. gnomad MAF=0.0001630 in the Other population with 1/6136 alleles and 0 homozygotes.

Missense mutations in human MLP or its ablation in transgenic mice promotes cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The exact function(s) of MLP in the cytoplasmic compartment and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that MLP autonomously binds to, stabilizes, and bundles actin filaments (AFs) independently of calcium and pH. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we have shown how MLP cross-links actin filaments into both unipolar and mixed-polarity bundles. Quantitative analysis of the actin cytoskeleton configuration confirmed that MLP substantially promotes actin bundling in live myoblasts. In addition, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed MLP self-association. Remarkably, BiFC complexes mostly localize along actin filament-rich structures, such as stress fibers and sarcomeres, supporting a functional link between MLP self-association and actin cross-linking. Finally, we have demonstrated that MLP self-associates through its N-terminal LIM domain, whereas it binds to AFs through its C-terminal LIM domain. Together our data support that MLP contributes to the maintenance of cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture by a mechanism involving its self-association and actin filament cross-linking.

In order to gain an insight into the molecular basis of the disease phenotype, we analysed the binding characteristics of wild-type MLP and of the (C58G) mutant MLP that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We show that MLP can form a ternary complex with two of its previously documented myofibrillar ligand proteins, N-RAP and alpha-actinin, which indicates the presence of distinct, non-overlapping binding sites. Our data also show that, in comparison to wild-type MLP, the capacity of the mutated MLP protein to bind both N-RAP and alpha-actinin is significantly decreased. In addition, this single point mutation prevents zinc coordination and proper folding of the second zinc-finger in the first LIM domain, which consequently renders the protein less stable and more susceptible to proteolysis. The molecular basis for HCM-causing mutations in the MLP gene might therefore be an alteration in the equilibrium of interactions of the ternary complex MLP-N-RAP-alpha-actinin. This assumption is supported by the previous observation that in the pathological situation accompanied by MLP down regulation, cardiomyocytes try to compensate for the decreased stability of MLP protein by increasing the expression of its ligand N-RAP, which might finally result in the development of myocyte disarray that is characteristic of this disease.","dc:creator":"Gehmlich K","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Decreased interactions of mutant muscle LIM protein (MLP) with N-RAP and alpha-actinin and their implication for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Gehmlich Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Altered expression of variant protein in expression cultures"},{"id":"cggv:9a0790a9-c4c7-4789-a3f8-44615f313224","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:82316916-2f04-49be-8829-d8b2148c06f8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Physically interacts with TCAP by Y2H and pull-downs.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15582318","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We sought to explore the relationship between a Tcap gene (TCAP) abnormality and cardiomyopathy.","dc:creator":"Hayashi T","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Tcap gene mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Hayashi Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"TCAP is curated at a DISPUTED classification for HCM."},{"id":"cggv:6a0c40e9-872e-4ed7-8cef-c4c3f4e36029","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:71694ec0-1793-4183-b9e7-1f9c04ed16a6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"CSRP3 is also expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscle myocytes (Arber 1994). 15% of HCM cases are associated with mild skeletal myopathy (Karandreas et al 2000). 3/5 patients with the C58G mutation had mild myopathy.

To gain insight into the disease mechanisms involved, we generated a knock-in mouse (KI) model, carrying the well documented HCM-causing CSRP3 mutation C58G. In vivo phenotyping of homozygous KI/KI mice revealed a robust cardiomyopathy phenotype with diastolic and systolic left ventricular dysfunction, which was supported by increased heart weight measurements. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq identified activation of pro-fibrotic signalling, induction of the fetal gene programme and activation of markers of hypertrophic signalling in these hearts. Further ex vivo analyses validated the activation of these pathways at transcript and protein level. Intriguingly, the abundance of MLP decreased in KI/KI mice by 80% and in KI/+ mice by 50%. Protein depletion was also observed in cellular studies for two further HCM-causing CSRP3 mutations (L44P and S54R/E55G). We show that MLP depletion is caused by proteasome action. Moreover, MLP C58G interacts with Bag3 and results in a proteotoxic response in the homozygous knock-in mice, as shown by induction of Bag3 and associated heat shock proteins.

Twenty-five unique variants (16 missense, 4 frameshift, 2 nonsense, 2 canonical splice site, and 1 indel) that have been reported in humans (PMIDs: 16352453, 18505755, 15781201, 23396983, 26656175, 21425739, 12642359, 19035361, 25351510, 23861362, 20087448, 30012424, 34558151, 33035702, 31919335, 33012304, 37431535) are included in this curation. CSRP3 was first associated with this disease in humans in 2003 (Geier et al., PMID 12642359).
