Bi-allelic functional variants in VARS2, encoding the mitochondrial valyl tRNA-synthetase, were first reported in a patient with psychomotor delay and epilepsia partialis continua associated with an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) Complex I defect, before being described in a patient with a neonatal form of encephalocardiomyopathy. Here we provide a detailed genetic, clinical, and biochemical description of 13 patients, from nine unrelated families, harboring VARS2 mutations. All patients except one, who manifested with a less severe disease course, presented at birth exhibiting severe encephalomyopathy and cardiomyopathy. Features included hypotonia, psychomotor delay, seizures, feeding difficulty, abnormal cranial MRI, and elevated lactate. The biochemical phenotype comprised a combined Complex I and Complex IV OXPHOS defect in muscle, with patient fibroblasts displaying normal OXPHOS activity. Homology modeling supported the pathogenicity of VARS2 missense variants. The detailed description of this cohort further delineates our understanding of the clinical presentation associated with pathogenic VARS2 variants and we recommend that this gene should be considered in early-onset mitochondrial encephalomyopathies or encephalocardiomyopathies.","dc:creator":"Bruni F","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Clinical, biochemical, and genetic features associated with VARS2-related mitochondrial disease."}},{"id":"cggv:c7da0c01-5b2d-4dc4-9d21-5aed08bfa633_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b64fc5bc-50b4-4f58-a710-18746c11d212"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29314548"}],"rdfs:label":"P2"},{"id":"cggv:c945721f-d5fd-482b-aa34-bf81de8e7e1f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c945721f-d5fd-482b-aa34-bf81de8e7e1f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c945721f-d5fd-482b-aa34-bf81de8e7e1f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"This sequence change affects an acceptor splice site in intron 25 (25/29 introns) of the VARS2 gene.

Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.","dc:creator":"Boczonadi V","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial DNA transcription and translation: clinical syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Review of mitochondrial translation disorders "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10+ genes with mitochondrial disease association implicated in mitochondrial translation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ca9dc1e7-f79c-472e-b6ea-5d38aaf61bea_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4743ef29-397e-41d7-b061-6d2c39f1693b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:849c80ef-1769-4fe5-84c5-31dbc657d657","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Additionally, decreased protein levels for NDUFB8, representing Complex I, and MTCOII, representing Complex IV, were noted in P1 lymphoblasts. \n\nFigure 3B","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29314548","rdfs:label":"P1 Lymphoblast WB complex I and IV defect"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ccdc65f9-d73b-4457-a0a5-ca37475bb6eb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9716fbea-7908-449a-b474-65f429412dff","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Complex I activity reduced when normalized for CS and for complex II (24%, 10% of control, respectively)\nComplex IV reduced when normalized for complex II (36%) but not CS\nUpregulation of II+III","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33937156","rdfs:label":"Respiratory Chain Activity in Msk of Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ca9dc1e7-f79c-472e-b6ea-5d38aaf61bea_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a01835c-17ad-448e-98d4-749372d1c272","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:264459cc-a34c-4d47-a8e0-84b6b7a2e2cd","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Found a clear decrease in the maximal respiration rate in both P1 (VARS2) immortalized cells compared to immortalized control fibroblasts.

The *VARS2* gene encodes mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe *VARS2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2014 (PMIDs: 25058219, 24827421). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *VARS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *VARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine unique variants, including eight missense variants and one splice-site variant. A nonsense variant has been reported, but parental testing was not performed to confirm compound heterozygous state so this proband was not included in the curation (PMID: 29314548). Of note, there are two commonly referenced transcripts for this gene, NM_020442.6 and NM_001167734, which result in alternative variant nomenclature, (i.e NM_001167734.1:c.1100C>T, p.Thr367Ile; and NM_020442.6:c.1010C>T, p.Thr337Ile). The c.1010C>T (p.Thr337Ile) is a recurrent variant seen in multiple probands in either the homozygous or compound heterozygous state. It has been reported in individuals from a multitude of ethnic backgrounds (Portuguese, Polish, Italian - N. Sardinia, Afghan, and Greek). More than 12 probands were reported between 2014-2021 (PMIDs: 25058219, 24827421, 29314548, 27502409, 33937156). *VARS2*-related disorders were first described in a 10-year-old male with ataxia, myopathy, and ophthalmoplegia; and an 8-year-old male with refractory epilepsy, developmental delay, and microcephaly, both of whom had muscle biopsy findings supportive of a mitochondrial translation defect (PMIDs: 25058219, 24827421). Subsequent publications have shown the *VARS2* phenotype is predominantly an infantile-onset, neurodegenerative disorder with microcephaly, developmental delay, refractory epilepsy, spasticity, global brain atrophy, and cardiomyopathy. The most common cause of fatality is cardiopulmonary failure. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, patient cell data showing profound respiratory chain deficiencies and mis-assembly, yeast model studies incorporating the orthologous variant to p.Thr337Ile which showed respiratory growth defects, and rescue of respiration in patient fibroblast cells (PMIDs: 24827421, 29980628, 29314548, 33937156). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 19, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ca9dc1e7-f79c-472e-b6ea-5d38aaf61bea"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
