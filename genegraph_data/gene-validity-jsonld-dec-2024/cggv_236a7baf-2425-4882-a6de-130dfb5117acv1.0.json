Whilst some of the essential pathways have a well understood function, such as bile biosynthesis and transport, the role of the others is not known. Here we report the findings of a clinical, biochemical and molecular study of a family with three patients affected with a severe infantile cholestatic disease. A novel homozygous frameshift germline mutation (c.587delG) in the AKR1D1 gene; which encodes the enzyme Δ 4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase that is required for synthesis of primary bile acids and is crucial for establishment of normal bile flow, was found in all 3 patients. Although the initial bile acid analysis was inconclusive, subsequent testing confirmed the diagnosis of a bile acid biogenesis disorder. An additional novel homozygous frameshift mutation (c.3391delC) was detected in SKIV2L in one of the patients. SKIV2L encodes a homologue of a yeast ski2 protein proposed to be involved in RNA processing and mutations in SKIV2L were recently described in patients with Tricohepatoenteric syndrome (THES). A combination of autozygosity mapping and whole-exome-sequencing allowed the identification of causal mutations in this family with a complex liver phenotype. Although the initial 2 affected cousins died in the first year of life, accurate diagnosis and management of the youngest patient led to successful treatment of the liver disease and disease-free survival.","dc:creator":"Morgan NV","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A combination of mutations in AKR1D1 and SKIV2L in a family with severe infantile liver disease."}},"rdfs:label":"Morgan et. al (2013) - V:4 (P1)"},{"id":"cggv:17fa45ab-cd0d-4751-8c57-8c204fd5dcd1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17fa45ab-cd0d-4751-8c57-8c204fd5dcd1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9fe00974-9377-46e8-a93f-20c656010ec3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9fe00974-9377-46e8-a93f-20c656010ec3","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6bd0ebf3-fe1e-4299-9f30-08b7c21e21af","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005989.4(AKR1D1):c.797G>A (p.Arg266Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4502829"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c6f4bff5-73e4-4e30-ace9-98909ed34799_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6bd0ebf3-fe1e-4299-9f30-08b7c21e21af"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35758383"},"rdfs:label":"Anh-Hoa Nguyen Pham et.al (2022) : Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:c6f4bff5-73e4-4e30-ace9-98909ed34799","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6f4bff5-73e4-4e30-ace9-98909ed34799_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8c1b7063-ee6b-4ac5-a324-27ae41c7f1ab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c1b7063-ee6b-4ac5-a324-27ae41c7f1ab","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:6bd0ebf3-fe1e-4299-9f30-08b7c21e21af"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:7e0ea8ca-af6c-4243-a417-43c1d55f297b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6bd0ebf3-fe1e-4299-9f30-08b7c21e21af"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35758383"},"rdfs:label":"Anh-Hoa Nguyen Pham et.al (2022) : Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:7e0ea8ca-af6c-4243-a417-43c1d55f297b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7e0ea8ca-af6c-4243-a417-43c1d55f297b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:236a7baf-2425-4882-a6de-130dfb5117ac_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10.2},{"id":"cggv:bef5f1a5-1a9c-43c8-8812-3bcfe96d9e02_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bef5f1a5-1a9c-43c8-8812-3bcfe96d9e02","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:6bd0ebf3-fe1e-4299-9f30-08b7c21e21af"},{"id":"cggv:19ef4180-d26c-4fc6-bf4f-ca6088390156","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005989.4(AKR1D1):c.396C>A (p.Tyr132del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA369360433"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:7800a045-5718-4819-9317-fab7fb87da9c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6bd0ebf3-fe1e-4299-9f30-08b7c21e21af"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23323017","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Aldo-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1) deficiency, a rare but life-threatening form of bile acid deficiency, has not been previously described in China.

AKR1D1 (aldo-keto reductase 1D1) is the only known human enzyme that stereo-specifically reduces the Delta(4) double bond in 3-keto steroids and sterols to yield the 5beta-hydrogenated product. Analysis of the AKR1D1 gene in five patients with 5beta-reductase deficiency revealed five different mutations resulting in an amino acid substitution in the protein. To investigate a causal role for these observed point mutations in AKR1D1 in 5beta-reductase deficiency, we characterized their effect on enzymatic properties. Attempts to purify mutant enzymes by overexpression in Escherichia coli only yielded sufficient amounts of the P133R mutant for further characterization. This enzyme displayed a highly reduced K(m) and V(max) reminiscent of uncompetitive kinetics with 4-cholesten-7alpha-ol-3-one as substrate. In addition, this mutant displayed no change in cofactor affinity but was more thermolabile in the absence of NADPH as judged by CD spectroscopy. All mutants were compared following expression in HEK 293 cells. Although these enzymes were equally expressed based on mRNA levels, protein expression and functional activity were dramatically reduced. Cycloheximide treatment also revealed that several of the expressed mutants were less stable. Our findings show that the reported mutations in AKR1D1 in patients with 5beta-reductase lead to significantly decreased levels of active enzyme and could be causal in the development of bile acid deficiency syndrome.","dc:creator":"Drury JE","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Characterization of disease-related 5beta-reductase (AKR1D1) mutations reveals their potential to cause bile acid deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"AKR1D1 : Biochemical Function "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:236a7baf-2425-4882-a6de-130dfb5117ac_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f431351-96ea-4758-9f05-8d3decdc809a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37c44400-ab1b-4c82-b287-e0fe120cf584","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The study of the AKR1D1 gene in mice is similar to human phenotypes because it highlights the role of this gene in regulating bile acid synthesis and glucocorticoid clearance, both of which are crucial for metabolism. In humans, defects in bile acid synthesis can lead to metabolic disorders, similar to the findings in Akr1d1-/- mice. The sex-specific metabolic responses observed in the mice, such as differences in insulin tolerance and fat accumulation, may also reflect similar variations seen in human populations. Understanding these mechanisms in mice can provide insights into how alterations in the AKR1D1 gene might affect human health, particularly regarding metabolic diseases and conditions related to bile acid metabolism.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35318963","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Steroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) plays important role in hepatic bile acid synthesis and glucocorticoid clearance. Bile acids and glucocorticoids are potent metabolic regulators, but whether AKR1D1 controls metabolic phenotype in vivo is unknown. Akr1d1-/- mice were generated on a C57BL/6 background. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to determine effects on glucocorticoid and bile acid homeostasis. Metabolic phenotypes including body weight and composition, lipid homeostasis, glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were evaluated. Molecular changes were assessed by RNA-Seq and Western blotting. Male Akr1d1-/- mice were challenged with a high fat diet (60% kcal from fat) for 20 weeks. Akr1d1-/- mice had a sex-specific metabolic phenotype. At 30 weeks of age, male, but not female, Akr1d1-/- mice were more insulin tolerant and had reduced lipid accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue yet had hypertriglyceridemia and increased intramuscular triacylglycerol. This phenotype was associated with sexually dimorphic changes in bile acid metabolism and composition but without overt effects on circulating glucocorticoid levels or glucocorticoid-regulated gene expression in the liver. Male Akr1d1-/- mice were not protected against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In conclusion, this study shows that AKR1D1 controls bile acid homeostasis in vivo and that altering its activity can affect insulin tolerance and lipid homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner.","dc:creator":"Gathercole LL","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"AKR1D1 knockout mice develop a sex-dependent metabolic phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"AKR1D1 KNOCKOUT MICE MODEL "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9197,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":12.7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c1f66f39-fca7-4b6e-b0f4-4a0651420062","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009339","gene":"hgnc:388","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The gene *AKR1D1* has been definitively associated with the disease Congenital Bile Acid Synthesis Defect 2 according to the gene–disease association criteria of the ACMG (SOP version 11). This disease results from an anomaly of bile acid synthesis and is characterized by severe and rapidly progressive cholestatic liver disease, and malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the AKR1D1 gene cause this disease.\n\nMutations in *AKR1D1* cause congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2 by impairing the enzyme 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase. This enzyme, crucial for bile acid production, is responsible for the NADPH-dependent conversion of 5beta-cholestan-3-one to cholest-4-en-3-one. Impaired conversion leads to abnormal bile acids, cholesterol buildup, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (PMID: 30809085). The AKR1D1 enzyme's biochemical disruptions were initially identified using FAB-MS, revealing high 3-oxo-Δ4 bile acids and low normal bile acid conjugates in urine (PMID: 1735522). Affected infants present with symptoms of jaundice, failure to thrive, and steatorrhea. Timely diagnosis is vital because the liver disease associated with this condition can be life-threatening (it can lead to cirrhosis and death), yet it can be managed with oral primary bile acid replacement (PMID: 30809085).\n\n**Summary of Case Level Data (10.2 points)**: 10 probands were scored with 7 variants (2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 5 missense) from 4 publications (PMID: 23679950, 35758383, 12970144, 23323017).\n\n**Summary of Experimental Evidence (2.5 points)**: AKR1D1 knockout mice indicated sex-specific metabolic alterations. Male knockout mice had enhanced insulin sensitivity and decreased lipid buildup in the liver and adipose tissue, but had higher triglyceride levels and intramuscular triacylglycerol. These findings underline AKR1D1's important function in regulating bile acid synthesis and metabolic balance in a sex-specific way.  (PMID: 35318963). Another study characterized AKR1D1 mutations. Clinically relevant mutants showed reduced activity, decreased stability, and heightened thermolability. One mutant (P133R) exhibited uncompetitive kinetics and lower catalytic efficiency, compromising bile acid synthesis and leading to potential bile acid deficiency syndromes ​(PMID: 20522910).\n\nIn summary, experimental and clinical evidence consistently supports a definitive gene-disease association between AKR1D1 and autosomal recessive congenital bile acid synthesis defect due to AKR1D1. This classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP on September 22, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n\n\nThe role of AKR1D1 in Congenital Bile Acid Synthesis Defect 2 has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:236a7baf-2425-4882-a6de-130dfb5117ac"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
