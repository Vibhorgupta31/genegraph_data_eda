Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.","dc:creator":"Boczonadi V","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial DNA transcription and translation: clinical syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Review of mitochondrial translation disorders "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10+ genes with mitochondrial disease association implicated in mitochondrial translation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:583e237c-18f6-4427-a04f-82ea0f020daf_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:43f91d77-d85e-4283-b1fd-350134ca98a7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ccde733-ec51-4310-bf45-fd4e89c257ed","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":" In P1, the Gomori trichrome stain and succinate dehy\u0002drogenase reaction of a skeletal muscle biopsy were normal, whereas the histochemical reaction to cyto\u0002chrome c oxidase was diffusely reduced (figure 1A).

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common cause of this group of diseases, but the underlying gene defects have been characterized in only a minority of cases, because tissue specificity of the manifestation hampers functional cloning and the heterogeneity of causative factors hinders collection of informative family materials. We sequenced the exome of a patient who died at the age of 10 months of hypertrophic mitochondrial cardiomyopathy with combined cardiac respiratory chain complex I and IV deficiency. Rigorous data analysis allowed us to identify a homozygous missense mutation in AARS2, which we showed to encode the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtAlaRS). Two siblings from another family, both of whom died perinatally of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, had the same mutation, compound heterozygous with another missense mutation. Protein structure modeling of mtAlaRS suggested that one of the mutations affected a unique tRNA recognition site in the editing domain, leading to incorrect tRNA aminoacylation, whereas the second mutation severely disturbed the catalytic function, preventing tRNA aminoacylation. We show here that mutations in AARS2 cause perinatal or infantile cardiomyopathy with near-total combined mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in the heart. Our results indicate that exome sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying mutations in single patients and allows recognition of the genetic background in single-gene disorders of variable clinical manifestation and tissue-specific disease. Furthermore, we show that mitochondrial disorders extend to prenatal life and are an important cause of early infantile cardiac failure.","dc:creator":"Götz A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Exome

relationship between *AARS2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 18, 2022. The *AARS2* gene encodes mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe *AARS2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2011 (PMID: 21549344). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *AARS2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *AARS2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 11 unique variants, including two nonsense, one frameshift, one in-frame deletion, and seven missense variants. Multi-exon deletions are also reported in the literature (PMID: 30285085). Of note, the c.1774C>T (p.Arg592Trp) variant is a founder variant frequently observed in European populations (PMID: 25705216). Additional recurrent variants include c.149T>G (p.Phe50Cys) and c.595C>T (p.Arg199Cys); and some missense variants have been shown to have similar function to null alleles (PMID: 24808023). There are at least 20 probands from seven publications in 2011-2020 reported with pathogenic variants in this gene (PMIDs: 21549344, 24808023, 31099476, 30285085, 31705293, 25705216). The first individuals described were of Finnish descent and had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, weakness, and lactic acidosis which was ultimately fatal. Subsequent publications have expanded the phenotype and there now appear to be two main categories: an infantile-onset, rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy with weakness and metabolic abnormalities (PMID: 25705216) or childhood to young adult-onset ovarian failure and leukoencephalopathy (PMID: 24808023). There have also been some patients reported without leukoencephalopathy but with clear cerebellar disease (PMID: 31705293). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, patient cell studies showing profound respiratory chain deficiencies and mis-assembly, and E. Coli and mouse models (PMIDs: 29228266, 30285085, 24808023, 29980628). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 18, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:583e237c-18f6-4427-a04f-82ea0f020daf"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
