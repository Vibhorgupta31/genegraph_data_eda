We have identified a glucosidase I defect in a neonate with severe generalized hypotonia and dysmorphic features.

Glucosidase I activities in cultured skin fibroblasts from both parents were found to be 50% of those of controls. Tissues from the patient subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting revealed strongly decreased amounts of glucosidase I protein in the homogenate of the liver, and a less-severe decrease in cultured skin fibroblasts. Molecular studies showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for two missense mutations in the glucosidase I gene: (1) one allele harbored a G-->C transition at nucleotide (nt) 1587, resulting in the substitution of Arg at position 486 by Thr (R486T), and (2) on the other allele a T-->C transition at nt 2085 resulted in the substitution of Phe at position 652 by Leu (F652L). The mother was heterozygous for the G-->C transition, whereas the father was heterozygous for the T-->C transition. These base changes were not seen in 100 control DNA samples.

A human hippocampus cDNA library was screened against oligonucleotide probes, generated by PCR using primers derived from the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of pig liver glucosidase I. Two independent lambda clones were isolated which allowed the construction of a full-length glucosidase I cDNA of 2881 bp. This cDNA construct encodes, in a single open reading frame, a polypeptide of 834 amino acids corresponding to a molecular mass of 92 kDa. The 92-kDa protein contains a single N-glycosylation site of the Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser type at Asn655, as well as a strongly hydrophobic sequence close to its N-terminus (amino acids 38-58) which, most likely, functions as a transmembrane anchor. The amino acid sequences of all tryptic peptides of the pig liver enzyme were found, with little deviation, within the coding sequence. This demonstrates the authenticity of the cDNA construct and the close evolutionary relationship between the enzymes from human hippocampus and pig liver. In contrast, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence revealed no homology with other processing enzymes cloned so far. Transfection of COS 1 cells with the glucosidase I cDNA construct resulted in overexpression (about fourfold) of enzymic activity, which was inhibited strongly by 1-deoxynojirimycin or N,N-dimethyl-deoxynojirimycin. The expressed enzyme, with a molecular mass of 95 kDa, is degraded by endoglycosidase H to a 93-kDa form, indicating that it carries a high-mannose oligosaccharide chain at Asn655. The presence of this glycan is in line with the localization of glucosidase I in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. The hydrophobicity profile as well as the removal by trypsin of an approximately 4-kDa polypeptide from the membrane-associated glucosidase I in intact microsomal structures, supports the view that the enzyme is a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein, which contains a short cytosolic tail of approximately 37 amino acids, followed by a single transmembrane domain and a large C-terminal catalytic domain located on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.","dc:creator":"Kalz-Füller B","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Cloning and expression of glucosidase I from human hippocampus."},"rdfs:label":"glucosidase activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The role of MOGS in N-linked glycosylation is well established in the molecular mechanism of CDG as reviewed in GeneReviews (PMID: 20301507)."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:5a628248-c2f9-4d31-b614-e082e3f83416_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d36e2d4f-96e1-40b5-bb10-fcfdc46841fa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa2625c9-b496-40e9-a48a-673297acc0be","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"PMID: 1660460 used the [3H]Glc2Man9GlcNAc substrate to show that Lec23 CHO cells are specifically defective in alpha-glucosidase I activity.

Lec23 mutant cells have been shown to alter lectin binding and to synthesize predominantly oligomannosyl N-glycans on endogenous glycoproteins. A single point mutation (TCC to TTC; Ser to Phe) was identified in Lec23 Gcs1 cDNA and genomic DNA. Serine at the analogous position is highly conserved in all GCS1 gene homologues.

The enzyme cleaves the alpha1,2-glucose residue from the asparagine-linked Glc(3)-Man(9)-GlcNAc(2) precursor, which is crucial for oligosaccharide maturation. The patient suffering from this disease was compound-heterozygous for two mutations in the glucosidase I gene, a T-->C transition in the paternal allele and a G-->C transition in the maternal allele. This gives rise in the glucosidase I polypeptide to the substitution of Arg486 by Thr and Phe652 by Leu, respectively. Kinetic studies using detergent extracts from cultured fibroblasts showed that the glucosidase I activity in the patient's cells was < 1% of the control level, with intermediate values in the parental cells. No significant differences in the activities of other processing enzymes, including oligosaccharyltransferase, glucosidase II, and Man(9)-mannosidase, were observed. By contrast, the patient's fibroblasts displayed a two- to threefold higher endo-alpha1,2-mannosidase activity, associated with an increased level of enzyme-specific mRNA-transcripts. This points to the lack of glucosidase I activity being compensated for, to some extent, by increase in the activity of the pathway involving endo-alpha1,2-mannosidase; this would also explain the marked urinary excretion of Glc(3)-Man. Comparative analysis of [(3)H]mannose-labeled N-glycoproteins showed that, despite the dramatically reduced glucosidase I activity, the bulk of the N-linked carbohydrate chains (>80%) in the patient's fibroblasts appeared to have been processed correctly, with only approximately 16% of the N-glycans being arrested at the Glc(3)-Man(9-7)-GlcNAc(2) stage. These structural and enzymatic data provide a reasonable basis for the observation that the sialotransferrin pattern, which frequently depends on the type of glycosylation disorder, appears to be normal in the patient. The human glucosidase I gene contains four exons separated by three introns with exon-4 encoding for the large 64-kDa catalytic domain of the enzyme. The two base mutations giving rise to substitution of Arg486 by Thr and Phe652 by Leu both reside in exon-4, consistent with their deleterious effect on enzyme activity. Incorporation of either mutation into wild-type glucosidase I resulted in the overexpression of enzyme mutants in COS 1 cells displaying no measurable catalytic activity. The Phe652Leu but not the Arg486Thr protein mutant showed a weak binding to a glucosidase I-specific affinity resin, indicating that the two amino acids affect polypeptide folding and active site formation differently.","dc:creator":"Völker C","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Processing of N-linked carbohydrate chains in a patient with glucosidase I deficiency (CDG type IIb)."},"rdfs:label":"Decreased glucosidase I activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5a628248-c2f9-4d31-b614-e082e3f83416_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f3dd4da-5f7f-460c-8459-1947703f1f9f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d699ec49-202e-4833-b378-92943b891b51","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"While the agl-1(RNAi) model shows none of the morphological phenotypes of the human patients, it shares features with them at both the molecular and organismal levels.

This reaction is critical to the subsequent processing of N-glycans and thus defects in α-glucosidase I gene in human cause congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type IIb. We identified the Caenorhabditis elegans α-glucosidase I gene (F13H10.4, designated agl-1) that encodes a polypeptide with 36% identity to human α-glucosidase I. The agl-1 cDNA restored the expression of complex-type N-glycans on the cell surface of α-glucosidase I-defective Chinese hamster ovary Lec23 cells. RNAi knockdown of agl-1 [agl-1(RNAi)] produced worms that were visibly similar to wild-type, but lifespan was reduced to about half of the control. Analyses of N-glycosylation in agl-1(RNAi) animals by western blotting and mass spectrometry showed reduction of paucimannose and complex-type glycans and dramatic increase of glucosylated oligomannose glycans. In addition, a significant amount of unusual terminally fucosylated N-glycans were found in agl-1(RNAi) animals. ER stress response was also provoked, leading to the accumulation of large amounts of triglucosylated free oligosaccharides (FOSs) (Glc3Man4-5GlcNAc1-2) in agl-1(RNAi) animals. Acceleration of ER-associated degradation in response to the accumulation of unfolded glycoproteins and insufficient interaction with calnexin/calreticulin in the ER lumen likely accounts for the increase of FOSs. Taken together, these studies in C. elegans demonstrate that decreased ER α-glucosidase I affects the entire N-glycan profile and induces chronic ER stress, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of CDG-IIb in humans.

This inherited disorder is caused by variants that decrease or abolish the expression or function of the MOGS enzyme, which normally functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to catalyze a cleavage step in the processing of oligosaccharides for N-linked attachment to nascent glycoproteins. MOGS loss-of-function results in the accumulation of abnormal N-linked glycoproteins and oligosaccharides, as well as ER stress. These molecular events trigger a variety of phenotypes in affected individuals that span a range of categories from morphological to neuromuscular and immunological ((PMID: 24716661). This curation includes fifteen variants (ten missense, four nonsense, and one single amino acid deletion) from nine probands reported in eight publications (PMID:32246563, PMID:10788335, PMID:24716661, PMID:29235540, PMID:30587846, PMID:31925597, PMID:33058492, and PMID:33261925). Two of the nonsense variants and the single amino acid deletion have been found to recur in multiple probands (PMID:32246563, PMID:33261925, PMID:29235540). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. All genotyped patients were compound heterozygotes within the MOGS locus. This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence showing that the function of the MOGS enzyme is consistent with disease phenotypes (PMID:7635146) which is disrupted in patient cells (PMID:12145188) and non-patient cells (PMID: 15383536). Experimental evidence also includes C. elegans and S. pombe models that disrupt orthologs of MOGS and recapitulate some of the features of the affected patients (PMID:23836288, PMID:30389790). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for functional evidence (6 points) has been reached. In summary, MOGS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MOGS-CDG. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without emergence of contradictory evidence.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5a628248-c2f9-4d31-b614-e082e3f83416"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
