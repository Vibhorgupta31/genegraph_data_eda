But the data from different studies have been conflicting. Here we attempted to systematically summarize and clarify the association between the SNP and sports-related tendon and ligament injuries risk. Six eligible studies including 933 cases and 1,381 controls were acquired from PubMed, Web Of Science and Cochrane library databases. Significant association was identified in homozygote model (TT versus GG: OR=0.17, 95%CI 0.08-0.35, PH=0.00) and recessive model (TT versus GT/GG: OR=0.21, 95%CI 0.10-0.44, PH=0.00). Our results indicated that COL1A1 rs1800012 polymorphism may be associated with the reduced risk of sports-related tendon or ligament injuries, especially in ACL injuries, and that rare TT may played as a protective role.","dc:creator":"Wang C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Association of polymorphisms rs1800012 in COL1A1 with sports-related tendon and ligament injuries: a meta-analysis."},"rdfs:label":"COL1A1 expression in tendons and ligaments"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8236b691-d799-4d0a-8531-4862556c39cb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:648463e9-facb-4ecc-8b73-1b586146fd4d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"It is widely accepted that COL1A1 is expressed throughout skeletal tissue.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19669491","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bone collagen structure in normal and pathological tissues is presented using techniques of thin section transmission electron microscopy and morphometry.

Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized by skin hyperextensibility, abnormal wound healing, and joint hypermobility. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, osteogenesis imperfecta, type I (OMIM:166200), osteogenesis imperfecta, type II (OMIM:166210), osteogenesis imperfecta, type III (OMIM:259420), osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV (OMIM:166220), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 1 (OMIM:130060), combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 1 (OMIM:619115), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, classic type, 1 (not associated with *COL1A1* in OMIM), and Caffey disease (OMIM:114000). The split curations have been curated separately. One missense variant, c.934C>T (p.R312C), has been reported in 14 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 10739762, 17211858, 25597651, 28102596, 31323331, 31531849, 32736638, 34265140) is included in this curation. The exact mechanism of pathogenicity is currently unknown, although Ehlder-Danlos syndrome classic type 1 is generally associated with the c.934C>T (p.R312C) variant. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression evidence in skeletal, ligament, and tendon tissue (PMIDs: 19669491, 28206959). In summary, *COL1A1* is moderately associated with autosomal dominant Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic type, 1. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 10/3/22 (SOP version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:35866dc4-e7a2-42c8-801c-019214666e8f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
