Chromatin regulatory mechanisms maintain cellular identity and function, where misregulation may lead to developmental defects. Here, we report pathogenic variations in MSL3, which encodes a member of the chromatin-associated male-specific lethal (MSL) complex responsible for bulk histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) in flies and mammals. These variants cause an X-linked syndrome affecting both sexes. Clinical features of the syndrome include global developmental delay, progressive gait disturbance, and recognizable facial dysmorphism. MSL3 mutations affect MSL complex assembly and activity, accompanied by a pronounced loss of H4K16ac levels in vivo. Patient-derived cells display global transcriptome alterations of pathways involved in morphogenesis and cell migration. Finally, we use histone deacetylase inhibitors to rebalance acetylation levels, alleviating some of the molecular and cellular phenotypes of patient cells. Taken together, we characterize a syndrome that allowed us to decipher the developmental importance of MSL3 in humans.","dc:creator":"Basilicata MF","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"De novo mutations in MSL3 cause an X-linked syndrome marked by impaired histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation."},"rdfs:label":"Transcriptome deregulation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1bd97a13-3778-498a-adf3-c8c72ab9227c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:feca808c-f2fc-4dbd-ba78-dbf9c2331e66","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"WT MSL3 showed robust interaction with MSL1 and MOF, all three mutants lost the interaction with MOF \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30224647","rdfs:label":"Compromised MSL complex integrity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:f700593e-b7c1-4149-810d-7e71fbea61d0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f04b58fe-244a-41cb-812a-a7353d3235be","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a06b7e5-aeb3-4d1e-af82-ec80c1c0e6b6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30224647","rdfs:label":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)-mediated alleviation "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4359,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:851d361e-5cad-4a44-bd0a-868b01e52998","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0026730","gene":"hgnc:7370","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"*MSL3*, located on chromosome Xp22.2, encodes chromatin-associated male specific lethal (MSL) complex subunit 3, which is responsible for bulk histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) in flies and mammals. MSL3 protein plays a critical role in a dosage-compensation pathway, equalizing X-linked gene expression in males and females.\n\n*MSL3* variants have been detected in unrelated patients with global developmental delay (PMID: 28135719), and further specifically identified to cause Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome (PMIDs: 30224647, 33173220). \n\nClinical features of the syndrome include progressive gait disturbance, recognizable facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, feeding difficulties in early infancy, global delay in the acquisition of major milestones including walking and speech, and intellectual disability.\n\n*MSL3* variants lead to a heterogeneous pattern in patient cells compared to homogeneous intensity in control cells. Cells lacking functional MSL3 displayed a severe decrease in H4K16ac. In general, MSL3 causes an acute downregulation of numerous biologically relevant genes, including key developmental regulators. Some of the transcriptional and cellular phenotypes in patient cells are rescued by histone decetylase inhibitors (PMID: 30224647).\n\nBased on the consistent phenotypes in a high number of unrelated patients harboring *MSL3* variants reported across studies (PMIDs: 30224647, 33173220), and clear experimental evidence of the role of MSL3 in developmental processes, *MSL3* is definitively associated with Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome.
