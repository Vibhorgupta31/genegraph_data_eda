","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6644819","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The structure of human oxyhaemoglobin was determined by single crystal X-ray analysis at 2.1 A resolution. Data were collected on an Arndt-Wonacott camera at -2 degrees C. The structure was refined to an R factor of 0.223 by the Jack-Levitt method, starting from Baldwin's model of human carbon monoxide haemoglobin. The active sites in the alpha and beta subunit are distinct. The iron atoms are 0.16(8) A and 0.00(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin carbons and nitrogens (0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A from the mean plane of the porphyrin nitrogens) in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively, in correlation with the orientation of HisF8 relative to the porphyrin nitrogens. The haem group appears to be nearly planar in the alpha subunit but ruffled in the beta subunit. The Fe-O(1)-O(2) angles are 153(7) degrees and 159(12) degrees in the alpha and beta subunit, respectively. The oxygen molecule forms a hydrogen bond to N epsilon of HisE7 in the alpha, but either none or a weak one in the beta subunit. The following bond lengths were found: Fe-N epsilon (HisF8) = 1.94(9) A (alpha) and 2.07(9) A (beta); Fe-O(1) = 1.66(8) A (alpha) and 1.87(13) A (beta); Fe-Nporph (mean = 1.99(5) A (alpha) and 1.96(6) A (beta). These dimensions agree with the values obtained in oxymyoglobin and model compounds. The C-terminal residues, ArgHC3(141 alpha) and HisHC3(146 beta), are relatively delocalized, and their positions do not enable them to form the intersubunit salt bridges in which they are involved in deoxyhaemoglobin. The penultimate tyrosine residues, TyrHC2 140 alpha and 145 beta, are relatively localized and maintain the hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of ValFG5 (93 alpha and 98 beta), with only minor variations compared to their geometry in deoxyhaemoglobin. TyrHC2(145 beta), however, alternates between a major and a minor site, in conjunction with CysF9(93 beta), both sharing the internal pocket between the F and H helices while in the major conformation. This suggests that the role of the penultimate tyrosines in the allosteric mechanism may differ from that previously proposed by Perutz. The overall quaternary structure of oxyhaemoglobin is identical, within experimental error, to that of carbon monoxide haemoglobin, and thus confirms the applicability of the allosteric mechanisms proposed by Perutz and Baldwin & Chothia to the process of oxygen binding.","dc:creator":"Shaanan B","dc:date":"1983","dc:title":"Structure of human oxyhaemoglobin at 2.1 A resolution."},"rdfs:label":"HBA1 gene product physically interacts with HBB."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3c125879-9353-4c1a-add2-ec2d59a23080","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a4d02a4c-d0d6-458b-85fe-728442a9b2c5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"The article provides an example of the function of HBA1/HBA2 as a component of an oxygen-carrying complex (hemoglobin) that is central to the ability of red blood cells to oxygenate the body.\n\nHemoglobin M variants are amino acid substitutions in the heme binding pocket, causing structural alterations which stabilize the ferric state, resulting in extremely low oxygen affinity and resistance to reduction.

Chemical characterizations of hemoglobin M (Hb M) were described in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Gerald (PMIDs: 13572451, 13897827), who reported that Hbs M are poorly, or not at all, separable electrophoretically from normal adult hemoglobin unless the hemolysate has been treated with oxidizing agents and the isolated methemoglobins M differ in the spectral absorption curves. These chemical differences result in the methemoglobinemia known as Hemoglobin M disease, in which more than 1% of hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin, a type of hemoglobin that contains the ferric form of iron, and patients are cyanotic but otherwise asymptomatic. The first variant specifically attributed to *HBA1* was HbM-Iwate, which was genetically confirmed in 1999 (PMID: 10477710) in relation to autosomal dominant methemoglobineamia, alpha type. This variant occurs in the conserved proximal histidine residue, and is replaced by tyrosine. This type of amino acid substitution in the heme binding pocket causes structural alterations which stabilize the ferric state, resulting in extremely low oxygen affinity and resistance to reduction. This missense variant has been reported in 2 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 10477710, 25931326). Hemoglobin M variants have altered function, suggesting a neomorphic mechanism of pathogenicity, due to increased stabilization of the ferric state. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, the high specificity of expression within the whole blood (PMID: 23715323) and its well-established function in carrying oxygen, as part of the hemoglobin structure (PMID: 11747442). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *HBA1* and autosomal dominant methemoglobineamia, alpha type. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing  evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. The classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on the meeting date July, 26, 2023 (SOP version 9).\n\nOf note, *HBA1* is also related to alpha-thalassemia, erythrocytosis, Heinz body anemia, and Hemoglobin H disease, however per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group we found differences in that the molecular mechanism (missense variants which stabilize the ferric state) and phenotype (benign cyanosis) were unique to the Hemoglobin M disease entity, which is therefore curated separately from the additional disease entities.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:599e57aa-17fd-40f4-9e13-a1968e57e9ed"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
