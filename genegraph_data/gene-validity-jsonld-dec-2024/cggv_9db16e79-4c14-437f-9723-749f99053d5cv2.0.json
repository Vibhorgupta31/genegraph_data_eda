A homozygous missense mutation ([c.637G>T; p.Val213Phe]) is the underlying cause of nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB94) and compound heterozygous mutations ([c.969T>A; p.Tyr323*] + [c.1142A>G; p.Asn381Ser]) result in mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency and Leigh syndrome, which is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by symmetric, bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. The severity of the genetic lesions and their effects on NARS2 protein structure cosegregate with the phenotype. A hypothetical truncated NARS2 protein, secondary to the Leigh syndrome mutation p.Tyr323* is not detectable and p.Asn381Ser further decreases NARS2 protein levels in patient fibroblasts. p.Asn381Ser also disrupts dimerization of NARS2, while the hearing loss p.Val213Phe variant has no effect on NARS2 oligomerization. Additionally we demonstrate decreased steady-state levels of mt-tRNAAsn in fibroblasts from the Leigh syndrome patients. In these cells we show that a decrease in oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and electron transport chain (ETC) activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type NARS2. However, overexpression of the hearing loss associated p.Val213Phe mutant protein in these fibroblasts cannot complement the OCR and ETC defects. Our findings establish lesions in NARS2 as a new cause for nonsyndromic hearing loss and Leigh syndrome.

Of note, this gene has also been associated with Leigh syndrome (Simon 2015), Alpers syndrome (Sofou 2015), and mitochondrial disorder (Vanlander 2015, Wang 2016) and Perrault syndrome in the family described in Simon et al. 2015 could not be ruled out. The split curation for autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome has been curated separately. Two missense variants that have been reported in one proband in one publication is included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional family members (PMID: 25807530). The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies in human and mouse cochlea.  (PMID: 25807530). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 12/19/2017. It was reevaluated on 11/17/2021using SOP v8. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change as no new information was published.
