As no long-term effective treatment is available, distinction from other treatable diseases, such as molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) type A, should be made. We reviewed 47 patients (45 previously reported in the literature). Cases were reviewed for consanguinity, sex, age at onset, death, clinical findings (including spasticity, seizures, psychomotor retardation, feeding difficulties, ectopia lentis, microcephaly), laboratory findings [urinary sulfite, S-sulfocysteine (in plasma and urine), plasma cystine, total homocysteine, uric acid, and oxypurines in urine] and radiological findings (including cerebral/cerebellar atrophy, cystic white matter changes, ventriculomegaly). We also aligned the published SUOX gene mutations to the reference sequence NM_000456.2. Onset occurred mostly during the first 72 h of life (57%) and within the first year of life in all but two patients (96%). All patients presented with neurological abnormalities, such as neonatal axial hypotonia and/or peripheral hypertonia (100%), (pharmacoresistant) seizures (84%), or developmental delay (97%). Feeding problems were also common. As found in our review, measurement of homocysteine in plasma, amino acids in plasma/urine, and sulfite in fresh urine supports the diagnosis of ISOD. Analysis of uric acid (plasma) and oxypurines (urine) is useful to rule out MoCD. In all patients in whom brain magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) was performed, brain abnormalities were found. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a thorough overview of clinical, neuroimaging, biochemical, and genetic findings of patients with ISOD.","dc:creator":"Claerhout H","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Biochemical Function Review"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:be1ff294-4444-4d39-a507-a2115bcdcd58_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be1ff294-4444-4d39-a507-a2115bcdcd58_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:32aaaba9-d70e-4df4-98b9-84bdc7592333_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08dcf276-3b0b-4054-aba3-490ccdaae55b","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"mRNA or total RNA isolated from skin fibroblasts used as a template for cDNA amplification using primers spanning the entire coding region of SUOX.

The eighth, a C>T transition, predicts an R319C substitution, which could affect the binding of the molybdenum cofactor and thus severely reduce sulfite oxidase activity.

Genetic deficiency of sulfite oxidase results in neurological abnormalities and often leads to death at an early age. The mutation in the sulfite oxidase gene responsible for sulfite oxidase deficiency in a 5-year-old girl was identified by sequence analysis of cDNA obtained from fibroblast mRNA to be a guanine to adenine transition at nucleotide 479 resulting in the amino acid substitution of Arg-160 to Gln. Recombinant protein containing the R160Q mutation was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The mutant protein contained its full complement of molybdenum and heme, but exhibited 2% of native activity under standard assay conditions. Absorption spectroscopy of the isolated molybdenum domains of native sulfite oxidase and of the R160Q mutant showed significant differences in the 480- and 350-nm absorption bands, suggestive of altered geometry at the molybdenum center. Kinetic analysis of the R160Q protein showed an increase in Km for sulfite combined with a decrease in kcat resulting in a decrease of nearly 1,000-fold in the apparent second-order rate constant kcat/Km. Kinetic parameters for the in vitro generated R160K mutant were found to be intermediate in value between those of the native protein and the R160Q mutant. Native sulfite oxidase was rapidly inactivated by phenylglyoxal, yielding a modified protein with kinetic parameters mimicking those of the R160Q mutant.

We report the identification of the first Arab mutation in SUOX, the gene for sulfite oxidase enzyme, in the ascertained family. The newly identified Arab mutation in the SUOX gene (a single nucleotide deletion, del G1244) is predicted to cause a frame shift at amino acid 117 of the translated protein with the generation of a stop codon and total truncation of the molybdo-pterin- and the dimerizing-domain(s) of SUOX protein expressed from the mutant allele. The identification of this new Arab SUOX mutation should facilitate pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and selection of unaffected embryos for future pregnancy in the ascertained family with the mutation and related families with the same mutation.","dc:creator":"Seidahmed MZ","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Total truncation of the molybdopterin/dimerization domains of SUOX protein in an Arab family with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15952210","rdfs:label":"Seidahmed 2005 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Consanguineous parents.

The data from this patient and previously published patients with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency and molybdenum cofactor deficiency are summarized to characterize this rare disorder. The patient presented neonatally with intractable seizures and did not progress developmentally beyond the neonatal stage. Dislocated lenses were apparent at 2 months. There was increased urine excretion of sulfite and S-sulfocysteine and a decreased concentration of plasma cystine. A lactic acidemia was present for 6 months. Liver sulfite oxidase activity was not detectable but xanthine dehydrogenase activity was normal. The boy died of respiratory failure at 32 months.

Variants in SUOX were ﬁrst reported in humans with this disease as early as 1996 (Rupar et al., PMID 9050047). At least  31 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) in 47 patients have been reported in the literature (Claerhout et al., 2018; PMID 28980090). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical assays. In summary, SUOX is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 22nd, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:be1ff294-4444-4d39-a507-a2115bcdcd58"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
