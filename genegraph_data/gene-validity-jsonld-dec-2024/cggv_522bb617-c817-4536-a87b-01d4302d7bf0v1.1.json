Our knowledge of the physiology of Mg(2+) (re)absorption, particularly the luminal uptake of Mg(2+) along the nephron, has benefitted from positional cloning approaches in families with Mg(2+) reabsorption disorders; however, basolateral Mg(2+) transport and its regulation are still poorly understood. Here, by using a candidate screening approach, we identified CNNM2 as a gene involved in renal Mg(2+) handling in patients of two unrelated families with unexplained dominant hypomagnesemia. In the kidney, CNNM2 was predominantly found along the basolateral membrane of distal tubular segments involved in Mg(2+) reabsorption. The basolateral localization of endogenous and recombinant CNNM2 was confirmed in epithelial kidney cell lines. Electrophysiological analysis showed that CNNM2 mediated Mg(2+)-sensitive Na(+) currents that were significantly diminished in mutant protein and were blocked by increased extracellular Mg(2+) concentrations. Our data support the findings of a recent genome-wide association study showing the CNNM2 locus to be associated with serum Mg(2+) concentrations. The mutations found in CNNM2, its observed sensitivity to extracellular Mg(2+), and its basolateral localization signify a critical role for CNNM2 in epithelial Mg(2+) transport.","dc:creator":"Stuiver M","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"CNNM2, encoding a basolateral protein required for renal Mg2+ handling, is mutated in dominant hypomagnesemia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:522bb617-c817-4536-a87b-01d4302d7bf0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:522bb617-c817-4536-a87b-01d4302d7bf0_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f270175-f775-4f4d-bbe5-0ea8721e092c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba05c8c3-2438-4645-9a6b-cddbd5327ff3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In view of the low serum Mg2+ levels detected in both families, the inappropriately normal level of urinary Mg2+ excretion pointed to a renal defect in Mg2+ reabsorption. To determine the renal localization of CNNM2, a polyclonal antibody was generated against a CNNM2-specific peptide. Subsequent immunohistochemistry on human kidney sections revealed that CNNM2 is expressed in both the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop, as indicated by codistribution with uromodulin/Tamm-Horsfall protein, and distal convoluted tubule (DCT), as shown by codistribution with parvalbumin and the thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC). Similar results were obtained for mouse tissue sections by using antibodies against uromodulin and NCC as markers for TAL and DCT, respectively.

However, to find the genetic origin of intellectual disability and seizures often remains challenging because of considerable genetic heterogeneity and clinical variability. In this study, we have identified new mutations in CNNM2 in five families suffering from mental retardation, seizures, and hypomagnesemia. For the first time, a recessive mode of inheritance of CNNM2 mutations was observed. Importantly, patients with recessive CNNM2 mutations suffer from brain malformations and severe intellectual disability. Additionally, three patients with moderate mental disability were shown to carry de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the CNNM2 gene. To elucidate the physiological role of CNNM2 and explain the pathomechanisms of disease, we studied CNNM2 function combining in vitro activity assays and the zebrafish knockdown model system. Using stable Mg(2+) isotopes, we demonstrated that CNNM2 increases cellular Mg2+ uptake in HEK293 cells and that this process occurs through regulation of the Mg(2+)-permeable cation channel TRPM7. In contrast, cells expressing mutated CNNM2 proteins did not show increased Mg(2+) uptake. Knockdown of cnnm2 isoforms in zebrafish resulted in disturbed brain development including neurodevelopmental impairments such as increased embryonic spontaneous contractions and weak touch-evoked escape behaviour, and reduced body Mg content, indicative of impaired renal Mg(2+) absorption. These phenotypes were rescued by injection of mammalian wild-type Cnnm2 cRNA, whereas mammalian mutant Cnnm2 cRNA did not improve the zebrafish knockdown phenotypes. We therefore concluded that CNNM2 is fundamental for brain development, neurological functioning and Mg(2+) homeostasis. By establishing the loss-of-function zebrafish model for CNNM2 genetic disease, we provide a unique system for testing therapeutic drugs targeting CNNM2 and for monitoring their effects on the brain and kidney phenotype.","dc:creator":"Arjona FJ","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"CNNM2 mutations cause impaired brain development and seizures in patients with hypomagnesemia."},"rdfs:label":"Cellular Mg2+ uptake in HEK293 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:522bb617-c817-4536-a87b-01d4302d7bf0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f1f5180-6ba0-4151-8442-87ece09312d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf537978-8682-49cc-8337-e81cbc20e86b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Knockdown of CNNM2 orthologues in zebrafish results in impaired development of the brain, abnormal neurodevelopmental phenotypes manifested as altered locomotor and touch-evoke escape behaviours, and reduced body Mg content, indicative of impaired renal Mg2+ absorption.

It is expressed throughout the kidney, with specific expression in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Multiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism or phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: renal hypomagnesemia 6 (OMIM:613882) and hypomagnesemia, seizures, and impaired intellectual development 1 (OMIM:616418). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is hypomagnesemia with or without seizures and intellectual disability. *CNNM2* was first reported in relation to semi-dominant hypomagnesemia with or without seizures and intellectual disability in 2011 (Stuiver et al., PMID: 21397062). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. Patients with this disorder present with hypomagnesemia, sometimes with variable seizures and/or intellectual disability among other syndromic disorders more frequently seen in more severe biallelic homozygous or compound heterozygous cases. Fourteen variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in 14 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 21397062, 24699222, 30026055, 33600043 included in this curation). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, in vitro assays in non-patient cells, and animal models. Immunohistochemistry on human kidney sections revealed that *CNNM2* is expressed in both the TAL of Henle's loop, as indicated by and the DCT (PMID: 21397062). Additionally, where wildtype HEK293 cells showed increased Mg2+ uptake, HEK293 cells expressing mutated *CNNM2* proteins did not, demonstrating a causative mechanism of hypomagnesemia (PMID: 24699222). Furthermore, knockdown of *CNNM2* orthologues in zebrafish results in impaired development of the brain, abnormal neurodevelopmental phenotypes manifesting as altered locomotor and touch-evoke escape behaviours, and reduced body Mg content, indicative of impaired renal Mg2+ absorption (PMID: 24699222). Finally, homozygous and heterozygous *Cnnm2* knock out mice presented with hypomagnesemia (PMID: 33600043). A total of 5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CNNM2* and semi-dominant hypomagnesemia with or without seizures and intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Tubulopathy GCEP on the meeting date February 15, 2024 (SOP Version 10.1).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:522bb617-c817-4536-a87b-01d4302d7bf0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
