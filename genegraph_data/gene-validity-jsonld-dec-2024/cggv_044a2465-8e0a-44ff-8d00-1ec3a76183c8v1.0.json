Patients have slowly progressive distal (100%) and proximal (13%) weakness in lower limbs (100%), mild lower limbs sensory involvement (31%), foot deformities (73%), progressive distal upper limb weakness (29%), mildly raised serum creatine kinase levels (100%), and central nervous system involvement (9%). We identified 12 HSPB1 and four HSPB8 mutations, including five and three not previously reported. Transmission was either dominant (78%), recessive (3%), or de novo (19%). Three missense mutations in HSPB1 (Pro7Ser, Gly53Asp, and Gln128Arg) cause hyperphosphorylation of neurofilaments, whereas the C-terminal mutant Ser187Leu triggers protein aggregation. Two frameshift mutations (Leu58fs and Ala61fs) create a premature stop codon leading to proteasomal degradation. Two mutations in HSPB8 (Lys141Met/Asn) exhibited increased binding to Bag3.

In the present study, we examined a Korean axonal CMT patient who presented distal limb atrophy, sensory loss, areflexia, and axonal loss of large myelinated fibers. Whole exome sequencing identified a novel missense mutation c.422A>C (p.Lys141Thr) in HSPB8 as the underlying cause of the CMT2 patient. The mutation was regarded as a de novo case because both unaffected parents have no such mutation. The patient with HSPB8 mutation is the first case in Koreans. Clinical heterogeneities have been revealed in patients with Lys141 mutation; the present patient revealed similar phenotype of CMT2L. In addition, the lower limb MRI revealed a similarity between our HSPB8 and HSPB1 patients.

This family consists of four members: Cadm4/Necl4 and Cadm1/Necl2 are found in both glia and axons, whereas Cadm2/Necl3 and Cadm3/Necl1 are expressed by sensory and motor neurons. By generating mice lacking each of the Cadm genes, we now demonstrate that Cadm4 plays a role in the establishment of the myelin unit in the peripheral nervous system. Mice lacking Cadm4 (PGK-Cre/Cadm4(fl/fl)), but not Cadm1, Cadm2, or Cadm3, develop focal hypermyelination characterized by tomacula and myelin outfoldings, which are the hallmark of several Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies. The absence of Cadm4 also resulted in abnormal axon-glial contact and redistribution of ion channels along the axon. These neuropathological features were also found in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Cadm4 lacking its cytoplasmic domain in myelinating glia Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT), as well as in mice lacking Cadm4 specifically in Schwann cells (DHH-Cre/Cadm4(fl/fl)).

We previously demonstrated that overexpression of HspB8 in cultured cells prevents the accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins such as the polyglutamine protein Htt43Q. Here we report that HspB8 forms a stable complex with Bag3 in cells and that the formation of this complex is essential for the activity of HspB8. Bag3 overexpression resulted in the accelerated degradation of Htt43Q, whereas Bag3 knockdown prevented HspB8-induced Htt43Q degradation. Additionally, depleting Bag3 caused a reduction in the endogenous levels of LC3-II, a key molecule involved in macroautophagy, whereas overexpressing Bag3 or HspB8 stimulated the formation LC3-II. These results suggested that the HspB8-Bag3 complex might stimulate the degradation of Htt43Q by macroautophagy. This was confirmed by the observation that treatments with macroautophagy inhibitors significantly decreased HspB8- and Bag3-induced degradation of Htt43Q. We conclude that the HspB8 activity is intrinsically dependent on Bag3, a protein that may facilitate the disposal of doomed proteins by stimulating macroautophagy.","dc:creator":"Carra S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"HspB8 chaperone activity toward poly(Q)-containing proteins depends on its association with Bag3, a stimulator of macroautophagy."},"rdfs:label":"Co-immunoprcipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:044a2465-8e0a-44ff-8d00-1ec3a76183c8_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:813babf3-0bc7-4bde-b7d2-e05b4ecadc5b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:618c821c-14ec-4e30-84be-8ae7cbeb6ec4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"HSPB8 overexpression inhibited the accumulation of the aggregates in cells expressing Htt43Q.

Though many sHsp have demonstrated molecular chaperone activity in vitro in cell-free conditions, their activity in vivo in the normal cellular context remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of the sHsp, HspB8/Hsp22, to prevent protein aggregation in the cells using the polyglutamine protein Htt43Q as a model. In control conditions, Htt43Q accumulated in perinuclear inclusions composed of SDS-insoluble aggregates. Co-transfected with Htt43Q, HspB8 became occasionally trapped within the inclusions; however, in most cells, HspB8 blocked inclusion formation. Biochemical analyses indicated that HspB8 inhibited the accumulation of SDS-insoluble Htt43Q as efficiently as Hsp40 which was taken as a positive control. Htt43Q then accumulated in the SDS-soluble fraction, provided that protein degradation was blocked by proteasome and autophagy inhibitors. In contrast, the other sHsp Hsp27/HspB1 and alphaB-crystallin/HspB5 had no effect. This suggested that HspB8 functions as a molecular chaperone, maintaining Htt43Q in a soluble state competent for rapid degradation. Analyses of Hsp27-HspB8 chimeric proteins indicated that the C-terminal domain of HspB8 contains the specific sequence necessary for chaperone activity. Missense mutations in this domain at lysine 141, which are found in human motor neuropathies, significantly reduced the chaperone activity of the protein. A decrease in the HspB8 chaperone activity may therefore contribute to the development of these diseases.","dc:creator":"Carra S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"HspB8, a small heat shock protein mutated in human neuromuscular disorders, has in vivo chaperone activity in cultured cells."},"rdfs:label":"Chaperone activity analysis of HSPB8 mutants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:bd9928f9-926f-4afa-a17a-636c27626180","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3fd222b3-559c-4ffc-9dfc-991c912f8b80","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Decreased neurite length and number and APP accumulation indicates axonal degeneration.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20538880","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Missense mutations (K141N and K141E) in the alpha-crystallin domain of the small heat shock protein HSPB8 (HSP22) cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy (distal HMN) or Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2L (CMT2L). The mechanism through which mutant HSPB8 leads to a specific motor neuron disease phenotype is currently unknown. To address this question, we compared the effect of mutant HSPB8 in primary neuronal and glial cell cultures. In motor neurons, expression of both HSPB8 K141N and K141E mutations clearly resulted in neurite degeneration, as manifested by a reduction in number of neurites per cell, as well as in a reduction in average length of the neurites. Furthermore, expression of the K141E (and to a lesser extent, K141N) mutation also induced spheroids in the neurites. We did not detect any signs of apoptosis in motor neurons, showing that mutant HSPB8 resulted in neurite degeneration without inducing neuronal death. While overt in motor neurons, these phenotypes were only very mildly present in sensory neurons and completely absent in cortical neurons. Also glial cells did not show an altered phenotype upon expression of mutant HSPB8.

It is so far not clear how mutant HSPB8 induces the neuronal and muscular phenotypes and if a common pathogenesis lies behind these diseases. Growing evidence points towards a role of HSPB8 in chaperone-associated autophagy, which has been shown to be a determinant for the clearance of poly-glutamine aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases but also for the maintenance of skeletal muscle myofibrils. To test this hypothesis and better dissect the pathomechanism of mutant HSPB8, we generated a new transgenic mouse model leading to the expression of the mutant protein (knock-in lines) or the loss-of-function (functional knock-out lines) of the endogenous protein Hspb8. While the homozygous knock-in mice developed motor deficits associated with degeneration of peripheral nerves and severe muscle atrophy corroborating patient data, homozygous knock-out mice had locomotor performances equivalent to those of wild-type animals. The distal skeletal muscles of the post-symptomatic homozygous knock-in displayed Z-disk disorganisation, granulofilamentous material accumulation along with Hspb8, αB-crystallin (HSPB5/CRYAB), and desmin aggregates. The presence of the aggregates correlated with reduced markers of effective autophagy. The sciatic nerve of the homozygous knock-in mice was characterized by low autophagy potential in pre-symptomatic and Hspb8 aggregates in post-symptomatic animals. On the other hand, the sciatic nerve of the homozygous knock-out mice presented a normal morphology and their distal muscle displayed accumulation of abnormal mitochondria but intact myofiber and Z-line organisation. Our data, therefore, suggest that toxic gain-of-function of mutant Hspb8 aggregates is a major contributor to the peripheral neuropathy and the myopathy. In addition, mutant Hspb8 induces impairments in autophagy that may aggravate the phenotype.","dc:creator":"Bouhy D","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"A knock-in/knock-out mouse model of HSPB8-associated distal hereditary motor neuropathy and myopathy reveals toxic gain-of-function of mutant Hspb8."},"rdfs:label":"HSPB8 K141N knock-in mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score was downgraded because the described model was homozygous, instead of heterozygous like the patients."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2443,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14.75,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5e767ad8-84f6-47f5-81c3-ced9417d3924","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015362","gene":"hgnc:30171","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"HSPB8 mutations are predominantly associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) type 2; however, it can also cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2) (Nakhro et at. 2013. PMID: 23796487), although sensory involvement is less common. HSPB8 encodes for the heat-shock 22-kDa protein 8, which is a member of the small heat shock protein family. Its main function is the delivery of misfolded proteins to the protein degradation pathway. It participates in the chaperone-selective induced autophagy (CASA) together with BAG3, another known CMT gene. HSPB8 mutations are predominantly located at the conserved alpha-crystallin domain, which is essential for the structure and function of the protein. A mutational hot-spot has been identified at the K141 residue. Four different mutations have been reported at this residue. The K141 residue lies on a constraint coding region of the gene based on gnomAD, which is above the 90th percentile for constraint, which supports pathogenicity for the mutations.  HSPB8 was first identified as a disease gene by linkage analysis in two large autosomal dominant families with dHMN type 2 (Irobi et at. 2004. PMID: 1512225). Families shared the same variant, K141N. The same locus was also identified in a large Chinese family; however, CMT was the described phenotype and not dHMN as previously reported (Tang et at. 2005. PMID: 15565283). HSPB8 has also been reported in families with distal myopathy with motor neuropathy (Ghaoui et at. 2016. PMID: 26718575). HSPB8 is highly expressed in the peripheral nerve and it interacts with two known CMT genes, BAG3 and HSPB1. Expression of the HSPB8 mutants, K141N and K141E resulted in the accumulation of toxic aggregates in cells and reduced cell viability (Irobi et at. 2004. PMID: 15122253). Mutations also resulted in reduced chaperone activity of the protein (Carra et al., 2005; PMID: 15879436). Expression of mutants in rat motor neurons resulted in abnormal formation of beaded-like structures and reduced neurite length and number (Irobi et al., 2010; PMID: 20538880). A knock-in mouse model carrying the K141E mutation developed progressive motor deficits, including declined locomotor performance, decreased CMAP amplitude and decreased muscle strength. Sciatic nerve from mice showed several axonal degeneration and HSPB8 protein aggregation.
