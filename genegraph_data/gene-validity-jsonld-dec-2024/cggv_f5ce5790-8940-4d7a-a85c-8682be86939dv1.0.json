DCM patients can experience CCD at the same time. In recent research, some disease-causing genes and variants have been identified in patients with DCM and CCD, such as Alpha-Actinin-2 and TNNI3 Interacting Kinase (TNNI3K). In this study, we employed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to explore the potential causative genes in a Chinese family with DCM and CCD. A novel splice site mutation (c.333 + 2 T > C) of TNNI3K was identified and co-segregated with the affected family members. This novel mutation was also absent in 200 healthy local controls and predicted to be disease-causing by Mutationtaster. The splice site mutation (c.333 + 2 T > C) may result in a premature stop codon in exon 4 of the TNNI3K gene and can induce nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Real-time qPCR also confirmed that the level of TNNI3K mRNA expression was decreased significantly compared with the controls, which may lead to myocardial structural disorder and arrhythmia. In this study we reported the third novel mutation of TNNI3K in DCM and CCD patients which further supported the important role of TNNI3K in heart development and expanded the spectrum of TNNI3K mutations.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) provides a powerful new tool for familial disease gene discovery. Here, synergistic application of these genomic strategies identified the pathogenic mutation in a familial syndrome of atrial tachyarrhythmia, conduction system disease (CSD), and DCM vulnerability. Seven members of a three-generation family exhibited the variably expressed phenotype, three of whom manifested CSD and clinically significant arrhythmia in childhood. Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped two equally plausible loci to chromosomes 1p3 and 13q12. Variants from WES of two affected cousins were filtered for rare, predicted-deleterious, positional variants, revealing an unreported heterozygous missense mutation disrupting the highly conserved kinase domain in TNNI3K. The G526D substitution in troponin I interacting kinase, with the most deleterious SIFT and Polyphen2 scores possible, resulted in abnormal peptide aggregation in vitro and in silico docking models predicted altered yet energetically favorable wild-type mutant dimerization. Ventricular tissue from a mutation carrier displayed histopathological hallmarks of DCM and reduced TNNI3K protein staining with unique amorphous nuclear and sarcoplasmic inclusions. In conclusion, mutation of TNNI3K, encoding a heart-specific kinase previously shown to modulate cardiac conduction and myocardial function in mice, underlies a familial syndrome of electrical and myopathic heart disease. The identified substitution causes a TNNI3K aggregation defect and protein deficiency, implicating a dominant-negative loss of function disease mechanism.

While there is human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship, genetic data published so far supports cardiac conduction disease with or without DCM, including several segregation studies. Out of all of reviewed studies, there was only one individual, from Fan et al (2018, PMID: 29355681), who had an isolated DCM and harbored the familial variant. Of note, the proband’s daughter also had DCM and the variant but authors noted that no ECG was done for her. This gene-disease association is supported by model systems using transgenic mouse lines expressing WT human TNNI3K. TNNI3K expression alone did not result in overt cardiomyopathy or decreased survival. Transgenic mice showed greater diastolic and systolic dysfunction and significantly reduced fractional shortening compared to the control mice after undergoing transthoracic aortic constriction (TAC). Double transgenic mice were created (Calsequestrin (Csq) and TNNI3K WT). In the CSQ mouse, cardiac-specific overexpression of the CSQ protein leads to DCM, recapitulating many of the hallmarks of human DCM. The double transgenic mice had profoundly premature death, significantly decreased fractional shortening, larger heart size and histological staining showing obvious chamber dilation, suggesting that TNNI3K modifies disease progression (Tang et al, 2013, PMID: 23085512; Wheeler et al, 2009, PMID: 19763165). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of TTNI3K and autosomal dominant DCM.
