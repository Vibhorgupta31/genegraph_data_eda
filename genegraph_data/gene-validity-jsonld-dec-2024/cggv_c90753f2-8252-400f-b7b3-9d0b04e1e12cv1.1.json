A subgroup of these disorders is caused by mutations in the dystrophin-associated sarcoglycan complex. Truncating mutations in the 43 kDa beta-sarcoglycan gene (LGMD 2E) were originally identified in a sporadic case of Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy, and a common missense mutation (T151R) was identified independently in Indiana Amish pedigrees with a milder form of LGMD. To facilitate mutational analysis of larger numbers of patients directly from genomic DNA, as opposed to reverse transcribed RNA from muscle biopsies, we have determined the genomic structure of the beta-sarcoglycan gene. The open reading frame of the beta-sarcoglycan coding region extends over six exons. Primers were designed for PCR amplification of single exons from genomic DNA and subsequent single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We screened 15 patients from the Brazilian LGMD patient population, 13 of whom followed a severe course. Most of the patients had been assessed previously for deficiency of alpha-sarcoglycan immunofluorescence on muscle biopsy sections as a marker for disease of the sarcoglycan complex. Novel mutations in two familial and two sporadic cases of severe childhood-onset LGMD were identified. Only one of these patients carried a truncating mutation (homozygous 2 bp deletion, FS164TER), while the other three carried missense mutations (homozygous R91P, homozygous M100K, heterozygous recessive L108R; only one allele could be identified in this family). All three missense mutations occurred in exon 3, coding for the immediate extracellular domain. Complete absence for all three of the known sarcoglycans was noted by immunohistochemistry on muscle biopsy sections of the patients.","dc:creator":"Bönnemann CG","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Genomic screening for beta-sarcoglycan gene mutations: missense mutations may cause severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2E (LGMD 2E)."}},"rdfs:label":"Bonnemann_Patient 4"},{"id":"cggv:1f8ee3fc-f6bd-4960-a914-f113385354b9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f8ee3fc-f6bd-4960-a914-f113385354b9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"NMD expected, downgraded for homozygosity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b404705f-5f78-4e79-a247-5a40943e2f2f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b404705f-5f78-4e79-a247-5a40943e2f2f","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:7767a753-bea8-469a-9a80-7844b74ba7be","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000004.12:g.52033428_52033431del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658822651"}},{"id":"cggv:4f771ca9-9669-4906-b4c6-f80cd31f754e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000232.4(SGCB):c.377_384dup (p.Gly129GlnfsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2918420"}}],"detectionMethod":"In a blood sample from the patient, all exons and intron-exon boundaries of SGCB were amplified and sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Disease onset was at 4y.

Genetic analysis showed that they were compound heterozygotes for mutations in the beta sarcoglycan gene. One of these mutations, an 8 bp duplication in exon 3, was common to both patients. The second mutation in patient 2 was a 4 bp deletion at the splice donor site of intron 2, not reported previously. Patient 2 had more severe heart and skeletal muscle defects with faster deterioration; no sarcoglycans were detected in his skeletal muscle. The second mutation in patient 1, inferred because the unaffected father carries the 8 bp duplication, was not found. In patient 1, both heart and skeletal muscle were analysed and showed reduction of all sarcoglycans in both tissues and incorrect localisation of alpha and gamma sarcoglycans in heart. Therefore mutations in one sarcoglycan gene can disrupt the entire sarcoglycan complex in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Differing expression patterns of sarcoglycan components in heart and skeletal muscle could be the result of alternatively spliced transcripts in these tissues. By sequencing an alternative transcript, highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle of patient 1, we found an 87 bp cryptic exon not previously reported. Although cardiomyopathy can result from mutations in alpha and gamma sarcoglycans, we show for the first time that the condition can also be caused by mutations in the beta sarcoglycan gene. This report therefore expands the phenotype of sarcoglycanopathies and suggests that cardiac function in LGMD patients with defective sarcoglycan expression should be monitored.","dc:creator":"Barresi R","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Disruption of heart sarcoglycan complex and severe cardiomyopathy caused by beta sarcoglycan mutations."}},{"id":"cggv:a932ca3a-2c43-42d5-a2d6-a3fb142c86dc_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7767a753-bea8-469a-9a80-7844b74ba7be"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10662809"}],"rdfs:label":"Barresi_Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:a932ca3a-2c43-42d5-a2d6-a3fb142c86dc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a932ca3a-2c43-42d5-a2d6-a3fb142c86dc_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a932ca3a-2c43-42d5-a2d6-a3fb142c86dc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"4-bp deletion in the intron 2 splice donor region, results in the insertion of 6-bp from intron 2 at the beginning of exon 3 in the cDNA of the proband, indicating that the variant causes aberrant splicing"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"splice region with demonstrated splice effect"},{"id":"cggv:3905a03a-953a-4f9e-9242-7ddad6c17318","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3905a03a-953a-4f9e-9242-7ddad6c17318_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"NMD expected"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:58dcc455-8769-410f-a267-5912ebc2c50c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58dcc455-8769-410f-a267-5912ebc2c50c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:cb2dd811-de00-4dda-8eec-32f481cc9bba","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000232.4(SGCB):c.214_215del (p.Leu72ValfsTer26)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915940547"}},"detectionMethod":"SGCB gene was screened for mutations using PCR and direct sequencing in whole blood or muscle.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Proband lost ability to walk at 5y of age.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003325","obo:HP_0003701","obo:HP_0008994","obo:HP_0008997","obo:HP_0006957","obo:HP_0003236"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Serum creatine kinase level was 33266 IU/L (nv <145 IU/L).

Although frequencies of mutations in these genes are different among populations, mutations in SGCA and SGCD, respectively, have the highest and lowest frequencies in most populations. Here, we report the proportion of mutations in SGC genes among a group of Iranian SGCs patients. Clinical features and results of SGC genes screening of 25 SGCs probands are presented. Large deletion mutations are confirmed with MLPA assays. In total, 15 candidate disease causing mutations were observed in the SGCA, SGCB, SGCG and SGCD genes; ten were novel. Fourteen (56%), seven (28%), three (12%) and one (4%) patient, respectively, carried mutations in SGCB, SGCG, SGCD and SGCA. The findings suggest that LGMD2E is the most common form of SGCs in the Iranian population and that LGMD2D is the rarest. Twelve LGMD2E cases carried the same mutation. To the best of knowledge, the mutation spectrum in SGCs is being reported for the first time in Iranian population.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data.  The SGCB gene is located on chromosome 4q12, 4.4 kb long with 6 exons encoding a 318-amino acid protein. At least 15 pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive LGMD are recorded in ClinVar, ranging from small deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing to missense variants. Limb girdle muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, mostly in the proximal muscles and affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdle, accompanied by an elevated serum creatine kinase and the loss of the ability to walk before the age of 20. Cardiomyopathy is also an accompanying feature in some individuals. SGCB has been reported in association with autosomal recessive LGMD as early as 1995 by Lim et al and Bonnemann et al (PMIDs: 7581449, 7581448). Summary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 13 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 30919934, 25862795, 8968749, 28687063, 10662809, 7581449, 7581448). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 6 additional family members. At least two founder variants have been reported in this gene in the Southern Indiana Amish (Thr151Arg) and the Dutch (Ser114Phe) populations. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for disease has been reported to be biallelic loss of function. Summary of Experimental Data (5.5 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, functional assays and rescue evidence. SGCB encodes β-sarcoglycan, a subunit of the sarcoglycan complex, which is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex stabilizing the sarcolemma (PMID: 7581448). β-sarcoglycan is ubiquitously expressed but is most strongly expressed in the striated muscle, heart and smooth muscle (PMID: 7581448). β-sarcoglycan interacts with δ-Sarcoglycan, encoded by SGCD, to form the core and initiate assembly of the sarcoglycan complex (PMID: 9864373). Sgcb-null mice recapitulate the human phenotype, displaying elevated creatine kinase levels and histopathological features of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy (PMID: 10678176, 10441321). AAV-mediated delivery of the human SGCB transgene resulted in lowering of creatine kinase levels, partial correction of cardiac functional deficits and recovery of the diaphragm muscle (PMID: 28284983). In summary, the SGCB-autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on February 11, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nThis gene curation was re-approved and published on 11/14/24 by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP to reflect the change in the panel's name from LGMD GCEP to MDM GCEP.
