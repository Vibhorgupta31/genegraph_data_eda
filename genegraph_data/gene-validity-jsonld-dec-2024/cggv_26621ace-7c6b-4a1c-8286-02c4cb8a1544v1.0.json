Here, we report a case of two Japanese siblings with HIBCH deficiency carrying a new homozygous missense mutation (c.287C > A, [p.A96D]) at the substrate-binding site. A transfection study using HIBCH expression vectors harboring wild type or 4 reported mutations, including the newly identified mutation (p.A96D, p.Y122C, p.G317E, and p.K74Lfs*13), revealed a correlation between residual HIBCH activities and the severity of the disease. All HIBCH mutants, except p.K74Lfs*13, showed residual enzyme activity and only the patient with p.K74Lfs*13 had congenital anomalies. p.G317E showed only low enzyme activity (~ 3%) of that of wild-type HIBCH. Although p.A96D had approximately 7 times higher enzyme activity than p.G317E, patients with p.A96D died during childhood. These findings are essential for clinical management, genetic counseling, and specific meal and concomitant drug considerations as part of the treatment for patients with HIBCH deficiency.","dc:creator":"Yamada K","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Clinical and biochemical characterization of 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) deficiency that causes Leigh-like disease and ketoacidosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896122","rdfs:label":"II-2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This proband has both ample phenotypic evidence concurrent with the diagnosis of HIBCH deficiency and a parental confirmed missense variant in HICBH with variant level evidence (Western blot analysis showed significantly lower protein amounts in HEK293 cells compared to controls in a similar amount to a known null mutation, patient shows a relative HICBH activity of 22% of wildtype).

We report a female patient who presented at the age of 5months with hypotonia, developmental delay and cerebral atrophy on MRI. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency was initially suspected and decreased activity was shown in fibroblasts. Urine tandem mass spectrometry screening showed large increases in the cysteine conjugate of methacrylate previously described in HIBCHD. 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase activity in fibroblasts was below the limit of detection of the enzymatic assay and two novel HIBCH mutations were identified (c.[129dupA];[1033G>A]). Urine metabolite investigations also showed increases in 3-hydroxyisobutyryl carnitine, 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyrate and several metabolites indicating accumulation and subsequent metabolism of methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA. The metabolites derived from acryloyl-CoA were also increased in patients with inborn errors of propionyl-CoA metabolism, indicating the involvement of a secondary propionyl-CoA pathway utilising 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase. With the exception of 3-hydroxyisobutyryl carnitine, the metabolite abnormalities were essentially the same as those observed in patients with ECHS1 mutations, a recently described disorder that also affects valine metabolism. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of urine tandem mass spectrometry screening for diagnosing HIBCH and ECHS1 defects and that propionate metabolism may play a role in their pathogenesis. These disorders should be considered during the differential diagnosis of Leigh like-diseases and hypotonia.

At least 12 variants (e.g. missense, frameshift, and splice-site) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes predominantly case-level data with some experimental data.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 7 publications (24299452, 30847210, 17160907, 26163321, 26026795, 29703962, 27896122). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function, with the loss of HIBCH causing Methacrylyl-CoA and its conjugates to build up in the brain and other tissues and disrupt mitochondrial function. This gene-disease association is also supported by two pieces of biochemical function evidence, but with no models or functional evidence being available.\n\nIn summary, HIBCH is definitively associated with autosomal recessive 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase deficiency. Although there is the maximum amount of genetic evidence, further experimental evidence would be valuable to better understand this gene-disease relationship.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:26621ace-7c6b-4a1c-8286-02c4cb8a1544"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
