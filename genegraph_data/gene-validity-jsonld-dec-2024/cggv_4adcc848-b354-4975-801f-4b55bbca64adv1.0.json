All patients were born from consanguineous marriages and displayed FX:C levels below 2%.

Though one genotype could not be characterized, we were able to confirm the inherited nature of the defect using familial studies. As the copy number variations were ruled out, we hypothesized the presence of deep intronic mutants that might have escaped detection from sequencing or abnormalities in epigenetic regulation. Three patients presented with severe clinical symptoms, in the early days of life, whereas two presented only with trauma-provoked bleeds and bruises later in life. Those patients with milder forms bore the p.Gly406Ser at the homozygous state and F10 unknown alleles, respectively. F10 mutation spectrum in Pakistan is heterogeneous as seen in other populations.

Genotype data were combined to evaluate the number, type, and novelty of the F10 mutations identified. Genotype data were available for 24 of 27 individuals with mild (n = 2), moderate (n = 2), or severe (n = 20) FXD. Analyses identified 22 separate mutations, including 15 missense mutations, 2 deletions, 4 splice site mutations, and 1 nonsense mutation. Sixteen individuals had homozygous mutations; 8 had compound heterozygous mutations. Eleven unique novel mutations (all compound heterozygous) were identified in seven individuals: six missense mutations, three splice site mutations, one exon deletion, and one nonsense mutation.

We hypothesized that the mutation might prevent cleavage by the signal peptidase which in turn would impair proper secretion of the FX protein. To test this hypothesis, we compared the expression of wild type and mutant FX cDNA in a human kidney cell line. Wild type and mutant constructs in the expression vector pCMV4 were introduced into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 by calcium phosphate transfection. FX antigen levels in the supernatant of the cells harboring the wild type construct were 2.4 micrograms/10(7) cells per 24 h, whereas antigen levels in media from cells containing the FXSanto Domingo construct were undetectable. No FX antigen was detected in the cell lysates of cells transfected with the mutant construct. To insure that the difference in protein levels was not due to a difference in steady state levels of mRNA, Northern analysis was performed on RNA from the cell lysates of both constructs. The results showed a transcript of the same size, present in roughly equal amounts, in both cases. Thus, the defect in the signal sequence of FXSanto Domingo exerts its effect posttranscriptionally. FXSanto Domingo is the first described example of a bleeding diathesis due to a mutation in the signal sequence.","dc:creator":"Watzke HH","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Factor XSanto Domingo.

Two genetic changes in factor X have been observed in this patient. The patient is most likely a compound heterozygote since there is only 14% activity associated with factor X. A point mutation that resulted in the substitution of cysteine (TGC) for arginine (CGC) at amino acid 366 was found in exon VIII of one allele of the factor X gene. This mutation, which occurs in the catalytic domain, can affect the formation of a disulfide bridge and thus could result in a reduction in factor X activity. Sequencing all the regions revealed a second mutation: a deletion of one nucleotide (TCCT to TCT) in exon VII that would cause a frame shift at amino acid 272 followed by termination. We have also shown that the point mutation in exon VIII creates an ApaL1 restriction site and destroys the HinP1 site.

Each exon was amplified from genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the plasmid pUC19. The amplified DNA inserts were subjected to direct sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method with forward and reverse oligonucleotide sequencing primers. A point mutation (C to T transition at nucleotide position 19,297) that results in coding for serine (TCC) in place of proline (CCC) at amino acid position 343 was found. This substitution involves a highly conserved proline residue oriented spatially close to both the cleavage site of the zymogen and the active site of the enzyme and explains the previous observations of discrete biochemical and functional differences between factor XFriuli and normal factor X. The mutation abolished an HgiCI restriction site present in the normal factor X gene, and this change constitutes the basis for a convenient method for screening individuals carrying this molecular defect.

To investigate the molecular basis of severe FX deficiency in a mildly hemorrhagic patient, variants of the F10 gene were detected by sequencing. A missense mutation was analysed by in vitro expression and modelling analysis, and a splice mutation using ectopic transcript analysis. The levels of activity of FX (FX:C) were <1% in both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway assays and 1.71% in chromogenic assay, the level of FX antigen (FX:Ag) was 53.36% in the proband. Two novel heterozygous mutations (IVS5+1G>A and Asp409del) were identified in the F10 gene. Ectopic transcript expression combined with informative marker (heterozygous Asp409del) analysis of the splice mutation (IVS5+1G>A) revealed and confirmed that the transcript from the mutated allele was absent, likely caused by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. In vitro expression analysis showed that the Asp409del mutant led to a loss of enzymatic activity rather than impaired expression. Molecular modelling analysis confirmed that the Asp409del mutant dramatically altered the conformation of the 185-189 loop and impaired binding of the loop to sodium ions (Na(+) ), diminishing the enzymatic activity of FXa. This is the first report to clarify the molecular mechanisms of two naturally occurring F10 gene variants that cause severe FX deficiency.","dc:creator":"Zhou JW","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Molecular defects in the factor X gene caused by novel heterozygous mutations IVS5+1G>A and Asp409del."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22931370","rdfs:label":"Zhou_Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The proband was compound heterozygous for a donor splice site variant, , and a 3-bp deletion that results in Asp408del.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 100 variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from deletions, duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital Factor X deficiency is characterized by a bleeding diathesis, diagnosed by a prolonged aPTT and PT and reduced Factor X activity levels. Mutations in F10 were first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1989 by Reddy et al. (PMID: 2790181).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 14 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 30036279, 1985698, 10746568, 30507709, 2790181, 1939653, 22931370). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be biallelic loss of function, although a number of individuals with heterozygous variants showing mild to moderate FX deficiency are reported in the literature (PMID: 10746568). Some of these occurrences are noted in the genetic evidence, but not scored. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4.5 points): FX activates prothrombin to thrombin in the blood coagulation pathway (PMID: 3286010). Mouse models that have the F10 gene knocked out show embryonic and perinatal lethality (PMID: 27626380, 10739370, 18036190); however, the mouse model with a missense variant, FX Friuli recapitulates FX deficiency in humans. The evidence from the mouse models parallel that seen in humans, where a complete loss of FX activity has not been reported in any patients.   \n\nIn summary, the F10-Congenital FX deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on Nov 27, 2019.
