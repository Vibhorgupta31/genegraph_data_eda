Here, we demonstrate regulation of postnatal bone homeostasis by Hh-Ptch1 signaling. Ptch1-deficient (Ptch1+/-) mice and patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome showed high bone mass in adults. In culture, Ptch1+/- cells showed accelerated osteoblast differentiation, enhanced responsiveness to the runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and reduced generation of the repressor form of Gli3 (Gli3rep). Gli3rep inhibited DNA binding by Runx2 in vitro, suggesting a mechanism that could contribute to the bone phenotypes seen in the Ptch1 heterozygotes. Moreover, systemic administration of the Hh signaling inhibitor cyclopamine decreased bone mass in adult mice. These data provide evidence that Hh-Ptch1 signaling plays a crucial role in postnatal bone homeostasis and point to Hh-Ptch1 signaling as a potential molecular target for the treatment of osteoporosis.","dc:creator":"Ohba S","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Patched1 haploinsufficiency increases adult bone mass and modulates Gli3 repressor activity."},"rdfs:label":"Ptch1+/- mice and patients with NBCCS showed high bone mass"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Only showed the involvement of Ptch1 in bone formation and postnatal bone homeostasis but not other phenotypes."},{"id":"cggv:185a3c7d-bdb8-416d-be25-e8b0beccdbe0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4ef77490-cb6b-483f-b1c8-d4d75f75e78e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"9/30 patients had early-onset unilateral visual reduction as a direct result of a structural ocular abnormality that could be attributed to BCNS.

The basis for the underlying patterning problems in Hh-dependent tissues in BCNS and their long-term consequences on tissue homeostasis are, however, not known. Hh signaling is required for normal growth and organization of the mammalian retina and we show that PtchlacZ+/- mice exhibit vitreoretinal abnormalities resembling those found in BCNS patients. The retinas of PtchlacZ+/- mice exhibit abnormal cell cycle regulation, which culminates in photoreceptor dysplasia and Müller cell-derived gliosis. In BCNS, the intraretinal glial response results in epiretinal membrane (ERM) formation, a proliferative and contractile response on the retinal surface. ERMs are a cause of significant visual loss in the general, especially elderly, population. We hypothesize that alteration of Müller cell Hh signaling may play a role in the pathogenesis of such age-related 'idiopathic' ERMs.","dc:creator":"Black GC","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Abnormalities of the vitreoretinal interface caused by dysregulated Hedgehog signaling during retinal development."},"rdfs:label":"Retinal abnormalities similar between BCNS patient and mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Only showed the similarities in the retinal abnormalities between BCNS patients and PtchlacZ +/-􏰀 mice but not other phenotypes."},{"id":"cggv:d9a9bce0-7ba9-487d-ba98-a19bb0c01b70","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a524f013-8c48-4f39-a7ce-661baed43198","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Untreated Ptch+/– mice have microscopic skin tumors.
