It is characterised by dysostosis multiplex, ligament laxity, mildly coarse facies and heart valve defects due to keratan sulphate accumulation, predominantly in the cartilage. Morquio B patients have normal neurological development, setting them apart from those with the more severe GM1 gangliosidosis. Morquio B disease, with an incidence of 1:250.000 to 1:1.000.000 live births, is very rare. Here we report the clinical-biochemical data of nine patients. High amounts of keratan sulfate were detected using LC-MS/MS in the patients' urinary samples, while electrophoresis, the standard procedure of qualitative glycosaminoglycans analysis, failed to identify this metabolite in any of the patients' samples. We performed molecular analyses at gene, gene expression and protein expression levels, for both isoforms of the GLB1 gene, lysosomal GLB1, and the cell-surface expressed Elastin Binding Protein. We characterised three novel GLB1 mutations [c.75 + 2 T > G, c.575A > G (p.Tyr192Cys) and c.2030 T > G (p.Val677Gly)] identified in three heterozygous patients. We also set up a copy number variation assay by quantitative PCR to evaluate the presence of deletions/ insertions in the GLB1 gene. We propose a diagnostic plan, setting out the specific clinical- biochemical and molecular features of Morquio B, in order to avoid misdiagnoses and improve patients' management.","dc:creator":"Caciotti A","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Morquio B disease: From pathophysiology towards diagnosis."}},{"id":"cggv:85d893cb-7b6a-4b07-8f85-ab46fd873cea_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7ab44963-8998-45b4-a772-84df332acd6f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33558080"}],"rdfs:label":"Caciotti_Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:6cc69b8e-a572-49dd-8739-04086275e207","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6cc69b8e-a572-49dd-8739-04086275e207_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"This variant affects the canonical splice site of intron 1 and is predicted to cause a frameshift and subsequent NMD.

Here we report the beta-galactosidase gene (GLB1) mutation analysis of 21 unrelated GM1 gangliosidosis patients, and of 4 Morquio B patients, of whom two are brothers. Clinical features of the patients were collected and compared with those in literature. In silico analyses were performed by standard alignments tools and by an improved version of GLB1 three-dimensional models. The analysed cohort includes remarkable cases. One patient with GM1 gangliosidosis had a triple X syndrome. One patient with juvenile GM1 gangliosidosis was homozygous for a mutation previously identified in Morquio type B. A patient with infantile GM1 gangliosidosis carried a complex GLB1 allele harbouring two genetic variants leading to p.R68W and p.R109W amino acid changes, in trans with the known p.R148C mutation. Molecular analysis showed 27 mutations, 9 of which are new: 5 missense, 3 microdeletions and a nonsense mutation. We also identified four new genetic variants with a predicted polymorphic nature that was further investigated by in silico analyses. Three-dimensional structural analysis of GLB1 homology models including the new missense mutations and the p.R68W and p.R109W amino acid changes showed that all the amino acid replacements affected the resulting protein structures in different ways, from changes in polarity to folding alterations. Genetic and clinical associations led us to undertake a critical review of the classifications of late-onset GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease.","dc:creator":"Caciotti A","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease: an update on genetic alterations and clinical findings."}},"rdfs:label":"Caciotti_23 M.T."},{"id":"cggv:a2dffabe-4b6a-4d2e-828e-00fb4c93770e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a2dffabe-4b6a-4d2e-828e-00fb4c93770e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a2dffabe-4b6a-4d2e-828e-00fb4c93770e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Hofer et al in PMID: 19472408 show through transient expression of the W273L variant in COS-1 cells that it results in a Beta-GAL activity of 1.9% of that of the wild-type."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This variant is a recurrent variant and is reported in several patients in homozygosity and compound heterozygosity and is likely a founder.

Three major clinical forms of GM1-gangliosidosis have been established on the basis of age of onset and severity of symptoms: infantile, late infantile/juvenile, and adult. We performed mutation analysis on 30 GM1-gangliosidosis and five Morquio B patients, mainly of Spanish origin, and all the causative mutations were identified. Thirty different mutations were found, 21 of which were novel. With the exception of two adults and one juvenile patient, all the GM1-gangliosidosis patients were affected by the infantile form. Clinical findings are presented for all patients. We report the association of the novel mutations p.T420K and p.L264S with the adult form and the juvenile form, respectively. In addition, the novel mutation p.Y83C was associated with Morquio B disease. Among the 30 GM1-gangliosidosis patients, 6 were of Gypsy origin (Roma). Moreover, those six Gypsy patients shared not only the same mutation (p.R59H) but also a common haplotype. This observation indicates a possible founder effect in this group and suggests that screening of the p.R59H mutation may be appropriate in GM1-gangliosidosis patients of Gypsy origin.

Morquio B disease), an autosomal recessive disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April, 2023. **GLB1** encodes two proteins by alternative splicing: the hydrolytic enzyme, beta-galactosidase (beta-GAL), and the elastin-binding protein (EBP). β-GAL cleaves β-linked galactose residues from the non-reducing end of glycan moieties found in various glycoconjugates. The primary role of EBP is to chaperone the deposition of elastin fibers in the extracellular matrix. Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB falls within the spectrum of GLB1-related disorders, but unlike GM1 gangliosidosis, the disease is less severe, with primarily skeletal features, absence of neurological features and accumulation of keratan sulfate. \n\n**GLB1** was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB in 1991 (Oshima et al, PMID: 1928092). At least 10 different missense, and a few nonsense, splice site and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nOMIM entities: \nGM1-gangliosidosis, type I (MIM: 230500); GM1-gangliosidosis, type II\t(MIM: 230600); GM1-gangliosidosis, type III (MIM: 230650); Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (Morquio) (MIM: 253010)\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, multiple disease assertions are made in the literature; while the GM1 gangiosidoses phenotypes fall on a spectrum, there are differences in phenotypic variability and potentially molecular mechanism(s) between the GM1 gangliosidosis and Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB. Therefore, the two entities have been split into separate curations.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 7 publication (PMID: 16941474, 19091613, 7586649, 1928092, 22371915, 33558080, 21497194). Several variants are reported to be recurrent in affected individuals, with the Trp273Leu the most common and likely a founder variant. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function.\n\nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional studies and model organisms evidence. Reduction in β-GAL activity leads to the accumulation of keratan sulfates (PMID: 34539759). **GLB1** interacts with **NEU1** and **CTSA** to form the lysosomal multienzyme complex (PMID: 33980489). A knock-in mouse model with the Trp273Leu variant recapitulates the enzyme deficiency but not the clinical phentypes.\n\nIn summary, **GLB1** is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on April 28, 2023.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9e170fda-e08a-4fd3-a3e5-f08c5c0d55b8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
