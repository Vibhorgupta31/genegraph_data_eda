In 22 cases, we found both pathogenic alleles. Sixteen patients exclusively carried either one or a combination of the two common mutations R208X and IVS5-1G > C. In the remaining cases, four missense mutations could be detected, of which R127Q, N286S, and T353P represent novel, previously not described alleles. A clinical performance score was developed by rating motor, visual, and verbal functions and the incidence of cerebral seizures in 3-month intervals during the course of the disease. A Total Disability Score was derived by summing up the single scores for motor, visual, and verbal functions. The 16 individuals with the two common mutations were grouped together (referred to as standard patients), and the 5th, 50th, and 95th centiles were calculated and graphically depicted over time. The scores for motor function and language ability dropped earliest and progressed very similarly in the standard patients. The performance curves of two children with the N286S mutation slightly diverged from the 95th centile. However, the performance curves of one patient with atypical LINCL carrying the R127Q mutation fell far beyond the 95th centile. The presented performance rating clearly and quantitatively delineates the disease course of the LINCL patients and hence offers a useful tool for clinical evaluation of future therapeutic interventions. In addition, the described performance score system can be applied to other types of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses and could be adapted to various other neurodegenerative diseases of childhood.","dc:creator":"Steinfeld R","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis: quantitative description of the clinical course in patients with CLN2 mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376936","rdfs:label":"SSp"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1bb0a1ec-0d29-42ea-b866-d63ab1a9abd2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a48553af-720a-439a-a90e-8c12cb9dc753","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing of each exons and splicing sites","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000505","obo:HP_0001268","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0003205"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:1bb0a1ec-0d29-42ea-b866-d63ab1a9abd2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:20210f24-852d-48b3-be7b-f6d6f2e1a8a8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000391.4(TPP1):c.1266G>C (p.Gln422His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA266181"}},{"id":"cggv:dd723523-727d-4251-bc08-1be07ee515e7"}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376936"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376936","rdfs:label":"KJp"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2426a0c3-32a7-486d-aeda-9b641550f729_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f8ad158d-a3d3-4a4b-bdc7-7f55f5c88929","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"detectionMethod":"TPP1 enzyme test on leukocytes and skin fibroblasts followed by Sanger sequencing of coding regions and splice junctions.

The underlying gene, CLN2, encodes the lysosomal soluble enzyme tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (TPP1). In a Portuguese patient with juvenile form of the disease, the histochemical study revealed the presence of curvilinear inclusions typical of LINCL. In vitro TPP1 activity was deficient in patient's cells. CLN2 gene analysis revealed the transition IVS7-10A>G (g.4196A>G) in both alleles. In silico analysis suggested that A-to-G change in the A-rich region of intron 7 could cause aberrant splicing of exon 8 by creating a novel acceptor splice site. However, because the wild-type acceptor of intron 7 is weak and it was not apparently affected, the severity of this mutation could not be established through sequencing data of gDNA. Normal level of spliced CLN2/mRNA was observed in patient's fibroblasts. In the cDNA, the 9-nt retention of intronic sequence (c.886_887ins9) was observed. The mutation is predicted to result in a protein with three extra amino acids between proline 295 and glycine 296. In patient's fibroblasts the level of mutant CLN2p was reduced to about 60% but the migration pattern was similar to the wild-type protein, suggesting that it was correctly targeted to the lysosomes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the first \"ag\" is selected for splicing and the mutant protein must retain some residual catalytic activity, thus explaining the late onset and the delayed progression of the disease.","dc:creator":"Bessa C","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"CLN2/TPP1 deficiency: the novel mutation IVS7-10A>G causes intron retention and is associated with a mild disease phenotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17959406","rdfs:label":"Bessap"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"High gnomAD frequency of the c.887-10A>G variant, especially 15 homozygous individual in this database is inconsistent with pathogenicity of this variant.

This disease is associated with a progressive neurodegenerative course beginning at the age of two years with developmental stagnation, finally leading to a complete loss of motor function, vision and speech by the age of 10 years. We analyzed the functional consequences of the mutations R127Q, R208X, N286S, I287N, T353P and Q422H, which were previously identified in patients with late infantile ceroid lipofuscinosis, with regard to enzymatic activity, stability, post-translational processing and intracellular localization of tripeptidyl-peptidase I. We could not detect any translational product for the mutant R208X. We found that four missense mutations, N286S, I287N, T353P and Q422H, which are located in conserved protein regions of tripeptidyl-peptidase I, decreased the enzymatic activity dramatically, blocked processing to mature size peptidase and led to protein retention in the endoplasmatic reticulum and rapid degradation in non-lysosomal compartments. We conclude that these amino-acid substitutions induce major misfolding of the precursor peptidase and hence prevent post-translational processing and lysosomal targeting of tripeptidyl-peptidase I. In contrast, the amino-acid substitution R127Q within a non-conserved protein region did not significantly affect enzymatic activity, stability, processing and lysosomal targeting of tripetidyl-peptidase I.

In this report, we provide the characterization of the first CLN2-targeted mouse model for cLINCL. CLN2-targeted mice were fertile and apparently healthy at birth despite an absence of detectable TPP I activity. At approximately 7 weeks of age, neurological deficiencies became evident with the onset of a tremor that became progressively more severe and was eventually accompanied by ataxia. Lifespan of the affected mice was greatly reduced (median survival, 138 d), and extensive neuronal pathology was observed including a prominent accumulation of cytoplasmic storage material within the lysosomal-endosomal compartment, a loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells, and widespread axonal degeneration. The CLN2-targeted mouse therefore recapitulates much of the pathology and clinical features of cLINCL and represents an animal model that should provide clues to the normal cellular function of TPP I and the pathogenic processes that underlie neuronal death in its absence.

We previously described a frame shift mutation of TPP1 in miniature long-haired Dachshunds which causes an early-onset form of NCL analogous to classical late-infantile onset NCL (CLN2) in children. Dogs homozygous for the TPP1 mutation exhibit progressive neurological signs similar to those exhibited by human patients. In order to establish biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of ongoing therapeutic studies in this canine model, we characterized phenotypic changes in 13 dogs through 9 months of age. Cognitive function was assessed using a T-maze reversal learning (RL) task. Cognitive dysfunction was detected in affected dogs as early as 6 months of age and worsened as the disease progressed. Physical and neurological examination, funduscopy and electroretinography (ERG) were performed at regular intervals. Only the changes in ERG responses showed signs of disease progression earlier than the RL task. In the later stages of the disease clinical signs of visual and motor deficits became evident. The visual and motor deficits were not severe enough to affect the performance of dogs in the T-maze.

The mutant zebrafish have significantly reduced median survival with death occurring 5 days post-fertilization. As in human patients with CLN2 disease, mutant zebrafish display storage of subunit c of mitochondrial ATP-synthase, hypertrophic lysosomes as well as localized apoptotic cell death in the retina, optic tectum and cerebellum. Further neuropathological phenotypes of these mutants provide novel insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis in CLN2 disease. Secondary neurogenesis in the retina, optic tectum and cerebellum is impaired and axon tracts within the spinal cord, optic nerve and the posterior commissure are disorganized, with the optic nerve failing to reach its target. This severe neurodegenerative phenotype eventually results in functional motor impairment, but this is preceded by a phase of hyperactivity that is consistent with seizures. Importantly, both of these locomotion phenotypes can be assayed in an automated manner suitable for high-throughput studies.

The unifying finding in NCL patients is the accumulation, in neurons and many other cell types, of autofluorescent storage material. There are 13 subtypes of NCLs that are categorized based on the particular gene that is mutated.  TPP1 is associated with autosomal recessive NCL2, with typical onset at age 2-4, and is  described as late infantile NCL (LINCL). Besides NCL, TPP1 has been associated with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia, characterized by progressive motor deficits and cerebellar atrophy. This gene-disease association was not curated, because it was only reported once in two Dutch families with the same compound heterozygous variants (c.509-1G>C/ p.Val466Gly; PMID: 23428007). Two other cases that were described as TPP1-associated spinocerebellar ataxia had questionable gene-disease association, because they had intellectual impairment (PMID: 26224725, 27217339). NCL2 was first reported to be associated with TPP1 in 1997 in a study that identified its product as a lysosomal protein absent in a patient with LINCL (Sleat et al. 1997 PMID: 9295267). Since then, 131 independent variants have been reported according to Gardner et al. 2019 (PMID: 31283065). Of the 131 variants, there were 63 missense, 21 frameshift, 17 nonsense, 22 splicing, and 8 other types of variants  (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ncl//mutation.shtml). While many of the variants were unique to each family, two variants, c.509-1G>C and c.622C>T (p.Arg208*) in NM_000391.3, collectively occurred in 60% of individuals reported and accounted for 50% of diseaseâassociated alleles (31283065). Fifteen symptomatic probands from 15 families with homozygous or compound heterozygous TPP1 variants reported by six studies were scored for genetic evidence (PMID: 10330339, 12376936, 17959406, 19793312, 27343025, 30541466). Six probands had two variants in trans that were not predicted/proven to be null, and were given scores ranging from 0 to 1. The remaining nine probands had at least one of the two variants in trans that were proven/predicted to be null, and were given scores ranging from 0 to 2. For ten probands, reduced TPP1 activity in patient cells was used to upgrade the points, whereas functional studies were used to upgrade the points for two probands in one study (12376936), because the results of TPP1 enzyme activity in patient cells were not available. No LOD scores could be calculated from these families, because only single affected individual was reported for each case. Supporting experimental evidence includes protein interaction with CLN5 (12134079), non-human model organisms (mouse: 15483130; dog: 16621647), and rescue in non-human model organisms  by adeno associated virus-mediated gene transfer (mouse: 17637720; dog: 26560358). Additional non-human model organism studies in dog (18344450, 21745338) and gene transfer studies mouse (16452657, 17180118, 18639872) were also reviewed as supporting evidence. Furthermore, enzyme replacement therapies on mouse (18362923, 21730969, 24394185, 24394185, 28345005), dog (21784683, 24938720, 24954537, 25257657), and human (29688815) were reviewed, although not scored. In summary, a score of 12 was given to genetic evidence, and 3.5 to experimental evidence, reaching 15.5 in total. TPP1âs association with NCL is upgraded from strong to definitive, because it has been replicated for more than two decades.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9b2f3b20-fb9a-4b5e-ad8e-e03be5ebb8e5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
