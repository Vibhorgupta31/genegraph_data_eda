However, it is not understood how SLX4 and its associated nucleases act in DNA crosslink repair. Here, we uncover consequences of mouse Slx4 deficiency and reveal its function in DNA crosslink repair. Slx4-deficient mice develop epithelial cancers and have a contracted hematopoietic stem cell pool. The N-terminal domain of SLX4 (mini-SLX4) that only binds to XPF-ERCC1 is sufficient to confer resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. Recombinant mini-SLX4 enhances XPF-ERCC1 nuclease activity up to 100-fold, directing specificity toward DNA forks. Mini-SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 also vigorously stimulates dual incisions around a DNA crosslink embedded in a synthetic replication fork, an essential step in the repair of this lesion. These observations define vertebrate SLX4 as a tumor suppressor, which activates XPF-ERCC1 nuclease specificity in DNA crosslink repair.","dc:creator":"Hodskinson MR","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mouse SLX4 is a tumor suppressor that stimulates the activity of the nuclease XPF-ERCC1 in DNA crosslink repair."},"rdfs:label":"Biochemical Function 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"The mouse model if for Fanconi anemia and is a homozygous knockout inconsistent with AD breast cancer.

Biallelic *SLX4* mutations are associated with Fanconi anemia, complementation group P. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed. We only focus on hereditary breast cancer in this curation. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data and experimental data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point**\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 2 case-control or meta-analysis studies at the aggregate variant level. In 2021, a large case-control study [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *SLX4* and breast cancer. Another meta-analysis study (PMID: 32488392) with smaller populations also did not show an association of *SLX4* variants with breast cancer. \n\n**Summary of Experimental Data: 0.25 points**\nWhile case control studies did not support the gene-disease association, Hodskinson et al. showed that mice with homozygous *SLX4* knockout developed epithelial cancers, suggesting the role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 24726326). \n\n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *SLX4* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 3/8//2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between SLX4 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4acc26ec-2174-4b21-bb02-965ae3539062"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
