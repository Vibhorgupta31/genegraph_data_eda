The aim of this study was to analyze whether cardiotrophin-1 is associated with left ventricular end-diastolic stress and myocardial fibrosis in hypertensive patients with heart failure. Endomyocardial biopsies from patients (n=31) and necropsies from 7 control subjects were studied. Myocardial cardiotrophin-1 protein and mRNA and the fraction of myocardial volume occupied by collagen were increased in patients compared with controls (P<0.001). Cardiotrophin-1 overexpression in patients was localized in cardiomyocytes. Cardiotrophin-1 protein was correlated with collagen type I and III mRNAs (r=0.653, P<0.001; r=0.541, P<0.01) and proteins (r=0.588, P<0.001; r=0.556, P<0.005) in all subjects and with left ventricular end-diastolic wall stress (r=0.450; P<0.05) in patients. Plasma cardiotrophin-1 and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and serum biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis (carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I and amino-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III) were increased (P<0.001) in patients compared with controls. Plasma cardiotrophin-1 was correlated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (r=0.386; P<0.005), carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (r=0.550; P<0.001), and amino-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III (r=0.267; P<0.05) in all subjects. In vitro, cardiotrophin-1 stimulated the differentiation of human cardiac fibroblast to myofibroblasts (P<0.05) and the expression of procollagen type I (P<0.05) and III (P<0.01) mRNAs. These findings show that an excess of cardiotrophin-1 is associated with increased collagen in the myocardium of hypertensive patients with heart failure. It is proposed that exaggerated cardiomyocyte production of cardiotrophin-1 in response to increased left ventricular end-diastolic stress may contribute to fibrosis through stimulation of fibroblasts in heart failure of hypertensive origin.

Cardiac and vascular functions were analyzed in vivo using M-mode echocardiography, Doppler, and echo tracking device and ex vivo using a scanning acoustic microscopy method. Cardiovascular and renal histomorphology were measured by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot. Kidney functional properties were assessed by serum creatinine and neutrophile gelatinase-associated lipocalin and microalbuminuria/creatininuria ratio. Without alterations in blood pressure levels, CT-1 treatment increased left ventricular volumes, reduced fractional shortening and ejection fraction, and induced myocardial dilatation and myocardial fibrosis. In the carotid artery of CT-1-treated rats, the circumferential wall stress-incremental elastic modulus curve was shifted leftward, and the acoustic speed of sound in the aorta was augmented, indicating increased arterial stiffness. Vascular media thickness, collagen, and fibronectin content were increased by CT-1 treatment. CT-1-treated rats presented unaltered serum creatinine concentrations but increased urinary and serum neutrophile gelatinase-associated lipocalin and microalbuminuria/creatininuria ratio.

Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on June 14 2024. As a result, the classification changed from limited to no known disease relationship. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein. CTF-1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy in 2000 (Erdmann J et al, PMID: 11058912). Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least 7 variants (6 missense and 1 spice site variant) have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 3 publications (Erdmann et al, 2000, PMID: 11058912; Pugh et al, 2014, PMID: 24503780; Akinrinade et al, 2015, PMID: 26084686). No segregation data has been reported. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least one case-control study at the single variant level (Erdmann et al, 2000, PMID: 11058912), however, this variant was subsequently found to be more commonly expressed in the population than would be expected to explain disease.  There is a lack of robust human genetic evidence demonstrating this gene-disease relationship in the literature. No new publications demonstrating CTF-1 variants in DCM were identified during re-curation. Evaluation of the previously identified variants found that all but one of the variants have subsequently been found at a frequency higher than would be expected for a monogenic, pathogenic effect in population reference data sets. This gene-disease association is supported by one animal model (rat) and expression studies (Pennica et al, 1995, PMID: 7862649; Pennica et al, 1996, PMID: 8833032; Zolk et al, 2002, PMID: 12234945; Lopez et al, 2014, PMID: 24366078; Robador et al, 2011, PMID: 21771897; Lopez-Andres et al, 2012, PMID: 22733458). Two additional human expression studies (Sharif et al, 2021, PMID: 34447655; RubiÅ et al, 2021, PMID: 34071085) were identified during re-curation. In summary, no convincing evidence for a causal role for CTF-1 and autosomal dominant DCM has been reported. Although this gene-disease assertion is supported by one animal model (rat) and multiple expression studies (human) no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans. Because of this, as well as the lack of new supporting evidence in the four year period since the previous curation, the expert panel has classified this gene as having No Known Disease Relationship for monogenic cause of DCM at this time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on June 14 2024 (SOP Version 10).\nNo convincing evidence for a casual role for CTF-1 and autosomal dominant DCM has been reported.
