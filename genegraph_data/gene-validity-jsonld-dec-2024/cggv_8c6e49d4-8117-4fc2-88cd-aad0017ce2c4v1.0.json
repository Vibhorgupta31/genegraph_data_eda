Genetic testing allows familial counseling and identifies subjects at high risk of malignancy (SDHB mutations) or significant multiorgan disease (RET, VHL, or NF1). However, conventional genetic testing for all loci is burdensome and costly. We performed immunohistochemistry for SDHB on 58 tumors with known SDH mutation status. We defined positive as granular cytoplasmic staining (a mitochondrial pattern), weak diffuse as a cytoplasmic blush lacking definite granularity, and negative as completely absent staining in the presence of an internal positive control. All 12 SDH mutated tumors (6 SDHB, 5 SDHD, and 1 SDHC) showed weak diffuse or negative staining. Nine of 10 tumors with known mutations of VHL, RET, or NF1 showed positive staining. One VHL associated tumor showed weak diffuse staining. Of 36 tumors without germline mutations, 34 showed positive staining. One paraganglioma with no known SDH mutation but clinical features suggesting familial disease was negative, and one showed weak diffuse staining. We also performed immunohistochemistry for SDHB on 143 consecutive unselected tumors of which 21 were weak diffuse or negative. As SDH mutations are virtually always germline, we conclude that approximately 15% of all pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas are associated with germline SDH mutation and that immunohistochemistry can be used to triage genetic testing. Completely absent staining is more commonly found with SDHB mutation, whereas weak diffuse staining often occurs with SDHD mutation.","dc:creator":"Gill AJ","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Immunohistochemistry for SDHB triages genetic testing of SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD in paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndromes."},"rdfs:label":"Immunohistochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4c3571ed-befd-4b66-ab30-7be55847399e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2403f2b6-b916-4d4b-830e-994d0e3372f7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Five SDHC germline variants (two different missense, one nonsense, and two exon deletions) mutant PCCs showed negative SDHB immunohistochemistry, and no","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19576851","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas are neuro-endocrine tumours that occur sporadically and in several hereditary tumour syndromes, including the phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome.

Clinically, the phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is often unrecognised, although 10-30% of apparently sporadic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas harbour germline SDH-gene mutations. Despite these figures, the screening of phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas for mutations in the SDH genes to detect phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is rarely done because of time and financial constraints.

The molecular mechanism is loss of function in one of the 4 genes comprising the succinate dehydrogenase and SDHAF gene for flavination of SDHA, as well as stabilization of the SDH complex. SDHC encodes one of the 4 subunits of SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), one of the two small integral membrane proteins in the mitochondrial complex II. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, this is a lumping Curation for SDHC and SDHC associated Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma syndromes (PGL/PCC) including autosomal dominant inherited Paraganglioma 3 (MIM: 605373) and Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (MIM: 606764). SDHC was first reported in relation to PGL/PCC in 2000 [Niemann and Muller et al., PMID: 11062460]. Three nonsense, two initiation codon, three missense, one splicing and one deletion variants are included in this curation [PMID: 11062460, 15342702, 29386252 and 16405730]. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. Absent expression of SDHB, the iron protein, catalytic component of mitochondrial complex II were reported in 5 PGL/PCC patients carrying SDHC germline variants [PMIDs: 19576851 and 20236688]. Loss of the complex II SDH (succinate dehydrogenase) and SQR (succinate coenzyme Q oxidoreductase) enzyme activities were shown in Hela cells and Chinese hamster B9 cells transfected with two SDHC mutants, His127Ala and His127Tyr. The absence of SDH and SDR activities in SDHC targeted shRNA Hela and B9 cells can be rescued by wt SDHC construct, but not by the constructs of the two SDHC mutants [PMID: 19332149]. Knockout mouse homolog of human SDHC is homozygous-lethal [PubMed: 27626380]. In summary, the SDHC gene is definitely associated with autosomal dominant PGL/PCC syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the genetic, and experimental, biochemical and functional studies, and has been upheld over time.
