MAT I/III deficiency is characterized by isolated persistent hypermethioninemia and, in some cases, unusual breath odor. Most individuals with isolated hypermethioninemia have been free of major clinical difficulties. Therefore a definitive diagnosis of MAT I/III deficiency, which requires hepatic biopsy, is not routinely made. However, two individuals with isolated hypermethioninemia have developed abnormal neurological problems, including brain demyelination, suggesting that MAT I/III deficiency can be deleterious. In the present study we have examined the MATA1 gene of eight hypermethioninemic individuals, including the two with demyelination of the brain. Mutations that abolish or reduce the MAT activity were detected in the MATA1 gene of all eight individuals. Both patients with demyelination are homozygous for mutations that alter the reading frame of the encoded protein such that the predicted MATalpha1 subunits are truncated and enzymatically inactive. The product of MAT, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), is the major methyl donor for a large number of biologically important compounds including the two major myelin phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Both are synthesized primarily in the liver. Our findings demonstrate that isolated persistent hypermethioninemia is a marker of MAT I/III deficiency, and that complete lack of MAT I/III activity can lead to neurological abnormalities. Therefore, a DNA-based diagnosis should be performed for individuals with isolated hypermethioninemia to assess if therapy aimed at the prevention of neurological manifestations is warranted.","dc:creator":"Chamberlin ME","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Demyelination of the brain is associated with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8770875","rdfs:label":"Patient 8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for a frameshift variant in MAT1A.

Based on a recent finding that 2 children with isolated hypermethioninemia and brain demyelination were homozygous for MAT1A mutations predicted to produce severely truncated proteins, and devoid of activity when expressed, it was concluded that complete lack of MAT I/III activity may be associated with neurological symptoms and demyelination. We now report that a 43-year-old man with persistent isolated hypermethioninemia, previously demonstrated to have deficient MAT activity in his liver, has normal brain myelination on MRI and normal neurological function, despite being homozygous for a 539 TG insertion in exon V of MAT1A, so that the gene is predicted to encode a protein of only 184 rather than the normal 395 amino acids. This patient's exon V mutation was demonstrated by SSCP analysis and verified by sequencing. Both parents are heterozygous for the same insertion. This suggests that MAT1A mutations producing severely truncated proteins do not necessarily produce brain demyelination. This finding has relevance to a previously reported 4-year-old girl who was also homozygous for the 539insTG mutation. Finally, our patient's 7% residual hepatic MAT activity, measured at 1 mM methionine, may reflect the hepatic activity of the more ubiquitous enzyme form, MAT II.","dc:creator":"Hazelwood S","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Normal brain myelination in a patient homozygous for a mutation that encodes a severely truncated methionine adenosyltransferase I/III."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9482646","rdfs:label":"Hazelwood case"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for a frameshift variant in MAT1A, and has deficient MAT activity in liver.

Mature liver expresses MAT1A, whereas MAT2A is expressed in extrahepatic tissues and is induced during liver growth and dedifferentiation. To examine the influence of MAT1A on hepatic growth, we studied the effects of a targeted disruption of the murine MAT1A gene. MAT1A mRNA and protein levels were absent in homozygous knockout mice. At 3 months, plasma methionine level increased 776% in knockouts. Hepatic AdoMet and glutathione levels were reduced by 74 and 40%, respectively, whereas S-adenosylhomocysteine, methylthioadenosine, and global DNA methylation were unchanged. The body weight of 3-month-old knockout mice was unchanged from wild-type littermates, but the liver weight was increased 40%. The Affymetrix genechip system and Northern and Western blot analyses were used to analyze differential expression of genes. The expression of many acute phase-response and inflammatory markers, including orosomucoid, amyloid, metallothionein, Fas antigen, and growth-related genes, including early growth response 1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, is increased in the knockout animal. At 3 months, knockout mice are more susceptible to choline-deficient diet-induced fatty liver. At 8 months, knockout mice developed spontaneous macrovesicular steatosis and predominantly periportal mononuclear cell infiltration. Thus, absence of MAT1A resulted in a liver that is more susceptible to injury, expresses markers of an acute phase response, and displays increased proliferation.","dc:creator":"Lu SC","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A knockout mice are predisposed to liver injury and exhibit increased expression of genes involved in proliferation."},"rdfs:label":"Mat1A knockout mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":851,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f9764cca-322e-4a51-ae9a-cde70c640f56","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009607","gene":"hgnc:6903","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The relationship between MAT1A and methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 15th, 2019. Methionine adenosyltransferase catalyzes a two-step reaction in which the adenosyl group of ATP is transferred to methionine to form S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl donor, and tripolyphosphate. Individuals with methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency present with persistently elevated levels of plasma methionine. Most patients with this condition are identified with hypermethioninemia on newborn screening. Follow up testing reveals normal or mildly elevated homocysteine, ruling out homocystinuria, and normal tyrosine, ruling out tyrosinemia. Most individuals with methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency have no symptoms, although some patients have developed demyelination of the brain and other abnormalities (Nashabat et al, 2018, PMID 29440907). Biallelic variants in MAT1A causing methionine adenosyltransferase were first reported by Ubagai et al in 1995 (PMID 7560086). Data from 17 patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for MAT1A variants were curated, including 21 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) from 8 publications (Ubagai et al, 1995, PMID 7560086; Chamberlin et al, 1996, PMID 8770875; Hazelwood et al, 1998, PMID 9482646; Linneback et al, 2005, PMID 16435220; Fernández-Irigoyen et al, 2010, PMID 20675163; Hirabayashi et al, 2013, PMID 23973726; Nagao et al, 2013, PMID 24231718; Kim et al, 2016, PMID 26933843). More data are available but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of methionine adenosyltransferase, which is consistent with the finding of persistently elevated methionine levels in patients with this condition (Cantoni, 1951, PMID 14832292; Mudd, 1962, PMID 14476836), and a knock out mouse model (Lu et al, 2001; PMID 11320206). In summary, MAT1A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 13th, 2019. Of note, while most individuals who are heterozygous for variants causing autosomal recessive methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency have normal methionine levels, some variants are reported to cause hypermethioninemia in the heterozygous state, although the level of methionine is lower than that seen in individuals who have biallelic variants in MAT1A (Kim et al, 2016; PMID 26933843). The most commonly reported variant, c.791G>A (p.Arg264His), has been shown to segregate with hypermethioninemia is an autosomal dominant manner. This variant disrupts the normal dimerization of methionine adenosyltransferase and therefore appears to act as a dominant-negative (Chamberlin et al, 1997, PMID 9042912).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:35cff382-98fe-4103-8edc-101f0c565a9e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
