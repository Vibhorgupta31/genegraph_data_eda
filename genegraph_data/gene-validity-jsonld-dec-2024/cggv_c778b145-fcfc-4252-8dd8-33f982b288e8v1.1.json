These include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane. We recently purified and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (Jones, L. R., Zhang, L., Sanborn, K., Jorgensen, A. O., and Kelley, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30787-30796). In the present study, we have examined the binding interactions between the cardiac forms of these four proteins with emphasis placed on the role of junctin. By a combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor. This binding interaction is localized to the lumenal domain of junctin, which is highly enriched in charged amino acids organized into \"KEKE\" motifs. KEKE repeats are also found in the common lumenal domain of triadin, which likewise is capable of binding to calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (Guo, W., and Campbell, K. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 9027-9030). It appears that junctin and triadin interact directly in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and stabilize a complex that anchors calsequestrin to the ryanodine receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that junctin, calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor form a quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of Ca2+ release.","dc:creator":"Zhang L","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Complex formation between junctin, triadin, calsequestrin, and the ryanodine receptor.

However, the specific contribution of Casq2 deficiency to the arrhythmia phenotype is difficult to assess because Casq2-/- mice also show significant reductions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins junctin and triadin-1 and increased SR volume. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether Casq2 regulates SR Ca2+ release directly or indirectly by buffering SR luminal Ca2+. To address both questions, we examined heterozygous (Casq2+/-) mice, which have a 25% reduction in Casq2 but no significant decrease in other SR proteins. Casq2+/- mice (n=35) challenged with isoproterenol displayed 3-fold higher rates of ventricular ectopy than Casq2+/+ mice (n=31; P<0.05). Programmed stimulation induced significantly more ventricular tachycardia in Casq2+/- mice than in Casq2+/+ mice. Field-stimulated Ca2+ transients, cell shortening, L-type Ca2+ current, and SR volume were not significantly different in Casq2+/- and Casq2+/+ myocytes. However, in the presence of isoproterenol, SR Ca2+ leak was significantly increased in Casq2+/- myocytes (Casq2+/- 0.18+/-0.02 F(ratio) versus Casq2+/+ 0.11+/-0.01 F(ratio), n=57, 60; P<0.01), resulting in a significantly higher rate of spontaneous SR Ca2+ releases and triggered beats. SR luminal Ca2+ measured using Mag-Fura-2 was not altered by Casq2 reduction. As a result, the relationship between SR Ca2+ leak and SR luminal Ca2+ was significantly different between Casq2+/- and Casq2+/+ myocytes (P<0.01). Thus, even modest reductions in Casq2 increase SR Ca2+ leak and cause ventricular tachycardia susceptibility under stress.

Biallelic loss-of-function variants in CASQ2 are definitively associated with autosomal recessive CPVT but some reports have also associated monoallelic or heterozygous CASQ2 variants with this condition. The main evidence for autosomal dominant CASQ2 association comes from a multi-centre study describing CPVT patients with CASQ2 variants (Ng et al, 2020, PMID:32693635). This study includes 12 probands with heterozygous variants in CASQ2, as well as an assessment of heterozygous relatives of probands with homozygous/compound heterozygous CASQ2 variants (8/37 of these heterozygous relatives had a positive CPVT phenotype). While this study provides a substantive body of evidence to support autosomal dominant CASQ2 association with CPVT, the expert panel believed the findings should be cautiously interpreted and the default scoring for these variants was downgraded for a number of reasons. The multi-centre nature of the study precluded standardised phenotyping of the probands and relatives and therefore we could not assume that every phenotype-positive individual had a definitive diagnosis of CPVT. Additionally, several of the variants described have a gnomAD population minor allele frequency that is incompatible with being a penetrant autosomal dominant variant for a disease with the prevalence of CPVT (MAF>1x10-5). The CASQ2 variants described in a heterozygous state in this study include truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice acceptor/donor), a splice region variant (c.738-3C>A) where the effect on splicing was not proven and missense variants (functional in vitro turbidity assays revealed that 6/7 missense variants exhibited filamentation defects but had dimerisation profiles similar to wildtype). In a separate study, the heterozygous p.Lys180Arg variant segregated with disease in a family (the published LOD score was 3.0 although there were only five meioses between genotype and phenotype positive individuals) (Gray et al, 2016, PMID:27157848). Additional functional evidence was observed in heterozygous null mice (catecholaminergic challenge and programmed stimulation induced significantly more ventricular ectopy in CASQ2+/- mice than in CASQ2+/+ mice) (Chopra et al, 2007, PMID:17656677). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to definitively establish the relationship of CASQ2 with autosomal dominant CPVT. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c778b145-fcfc-4252-8dd8-33f982b288e8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
