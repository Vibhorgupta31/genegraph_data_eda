Cathepsin K, a cysteine protease gene that is highly expressed in osteoclasts, localized to the pycnodysostosis region. Nonsense, missense, and stop codon mutations in the gene encoding cathepsin K were identified in patients. Transient expression of complementary DNA containing the stop codon mutation resulted in messenger RNA but no immunologically detectable protein. Thus, pycnodysostosis results from gene defects in a lysosomal protease with highest expression in osteoclasts. These findings suggest that cathepsin K is a major protease in bone resorption, providing a possible rationale for the treatment of disorders such as osteoporosis and certain forms of arthritis.","dc:creator":"Gelb BD","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Pycnodysostosis, a lysosomal disease caused by cathepsin K deficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8135617e-f334-4c22-aa9e-b1efd50e9326_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa64f369-e7ba-4675-8ea0-c8ea970762c0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa64f369-e7ba-4675-8ea0-c8ea970762c0","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:930c4462-5881-404f-b6da-1276dbba1026","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000396.4(CTSK):c.926T>C (p.Leu309Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA119615"}},{"id":"cggv:a5236b49-4f33-4d5a-9c22-a5727bf6da2c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000396.4(CTSK):c.236G>A (p.Gly79Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA119612"}}],"detectionMethod":"CTSK bidirectional sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Patients with pycnodysostosis were admitted to either the paediatric or the orthopaedic department mainly due to neonatal respiratory problems, retarded growth, dysmorphic features, or frequent and complicated bone fractures.

In three of the families patients were homozygous for 926T > C. In the remaining two families patients were heterozygous for 926T > C and 121-1G > A in one case, and for 926T > C and 236G > A in the other case. Assays using genomic DNA were developed for all three mutations. We tested 150 healthy control persons and observed the mutation frequencies: 0 to 300 for 121-1G > A and 236G > A and 1 to 150 for 926T > C. One patient from each family was haplotyped with eight microsatellite markers surrounding the cathepsin K gene on chromosome 1q21. A very rare, P = 1.8 x 10(-6) to P = 0.0004, and highly preserved area around the presumed disease locus was common to all the patients. This haplotype was found on seven chromosomes identical by state, IBS, out of the possible eight carrying the 926T > C mutation. Founder effect, locus homogeneity, and allele heterogeneity regarding pycnodysostosis within this population are discussed. Finally, the first pregnancy and delivery described in a patient with pycnodysostosis is reported.","dc:creator":"Haagerup A","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Cathepsin K gene mutations and 1q21 haplotypes in at patients with pycnodysostosis in an outbred population."}},{"id":"cggv:81b8c44d-5aa3-4019-a0a7-ca8aee1441d1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:930c4462-5881-404f-b6da-1276dbba1026"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10878663"}],"rdfs:label":"Haagerup II:5"},{"id":"cggv:1f2aadce-9611-4f8b-8a8e-9e5224db5a9f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1f2aadce-9611-4f8b-8a8e-9e5224db5a9f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1f2aadce-9611-4f8b-8a8e-9e5224db5a9f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"No detectable protease activity when analyzed by western blotting (PMID: 10074491)."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This proband has a missense variant, Gly79Glu on exon 3/8.

To investigate the nature of molecular lesions causing this disease, mutations in the cathepsin K gene from eight families were determined, identifying seven novel mutations (K52X, G79E, Q190X, Y212C, A277E, A277V, and R312G). Expression of the first pro region missense mutation in a cysteine protease, G79E, in Pichia pastoris resulted in an unstable precursor protein, consistent with misfolding of the proenzyme. Expression of five mature region missense defects revealed that G146R, A277E, A277V, and R312G precursors were unstable, and no mature proteins or protease activity were detected. The Y212C precursor was activated to its mature form in a manner similar to that of the wild-type cathepsin K. The mature Y212C enzyme retained its dipeptide substrate specificity and gelatinolytic activity, but it had markedly decreased activity toward type I collagen and a cathepsin K-specific tripeptide substrate, indicating that it was unable to bind collagen triple helix. These studies demonstrated the molecular heterogeneity of mutations causing pycnodysostosis, indicated that pro region conformation directs proper folding of the proenzyme, and suggested that the cathepsin K active site contains a critical collagen-binding domain.","dc:creator":"Hou WS","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Characterization of novel cathepsin K mutations in the pro and mature polypeptide regions causing pycnodysostosis."}},"rdfs:label":"Hou Family 2"},{"id":"cggv:f65a4553-d90e-429a-8223-4d88ee0c7beb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f65a4553-d90e-429a-8223-4d88ee0c7beb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This proband has a nonsense variant, Q190X on exon 5/8, which is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or NMD.

Furthermore, the expression of cathepsin K mRNA in giant cell tumor tissue appeared to be confined to the periphery of the osteoclast indicating a compartmentalization of the mRNA. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the specific localization of cathepsin K to the osteoclast. In actively resorbing osteoclasts, the immunostaining was localized at the ruffled border, whereas in osteoclasts in sections of giant cell tumor, staining was observed in lysosomal vacuoles, which in some cases were seen to fuse with the cell membrane. Other cells within the bone, such as osteoblasts and osteocytes, did not express either the cathepsin K transcript or protein.

CTSK encodes cathepsin K, a member of the papain family of cysteine proteinases, which plays an important role in osteoclast function. A deficiency of cathepsin K results in an increase of demineralized bone surrounding individual osteoclasts as they do not adequately degrade the organic matrix. Accumulation of bone matrix around the osteoclasts causes various symptoms including short stature, characteristic facial appearance (convex nasal ridge and small jaw with obtuse mandibular angle), osteosclerosis with increased bone fragility, acro-osteolysis of the distal phalanges, delayed closure of the cranial sutures, and dysplasia of the clavicle. The diagnosis of pycnodysostosis is established by characteristic clinical and radiographic features and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in CTSK identified by molecular genetic testing (Leblanc S, et al., 2020, PMID: 33151655). \n\nTen variants (5 missense, 1 splice site, 4 nonsense) that have been reported in nine probands in six publications (Gelb BD, et al., 1996, PMID: 8703060; Hou WS, et al., 1999, PMID: 10074491; Haagerup A, et al., 2000, PMID: 10878663; Markova TV, et al., 2022, PMID: 35315254; Arman A, et al., 2014, PMID: 24767306; Johnson MR, et al., 1996, PMID: 8938428), as well as one family with segregation information (Johnson MR, et al., 1996, PMID: 8938428), are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical function of cathepsin K, animal models systems, and expression data. Individuals with pycnodysostosis show decreased degradation of the bone matrix proteins, leading to increased bone density due to the absence of cathepsin K (Bossard MJ, et al., 1996, PMID: 8647860). Knockout mouse models recapitulate most of the ultrastructural, histological, and radiological abnormalities observed in humans with pycnodystosis including osteopetrosis, enhanced bone fragility, predisposition to bone fractures, reduced size of long bones (leading to short stature), bone marrow hypoplasia, splenomegaly (although rare in humans), and craniofacial anomalies (Saftig P, et al., 1998, PMID: 9811821; Gowen M, et al., 1999, PMID: 10491212). The cathepsin K mRNA and protein appeared to be compartmentalized toward the membrane as visualized by the localization of the in-situ hybridization signal and immunoreactivity in osteoclastic cells (Littlewood-Evans A, et al., 1997, PMID: 9028530).\n\nIn summary, CTSK is definitively associated with pycnodysostosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8135617e-f334-4c22-aa9e-b1efd50e9326"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
