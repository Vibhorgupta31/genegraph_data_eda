While basal ganglia dysfunction is observed in many neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders, congenital malformations are rare. In particular, dysplastic basal ganglia are part of the malformative spectrum of tubulinopathies and X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, but neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by basal ganglia agenesis are not known to date. We ascertained two unrelated children (both female) presenting with spastic tetraparesis, severe generalized dystonia and intellectual impairment, sharing a unique brain malformation characterized by agenesis of putamina and globi pallidi, dysgenesis of the caudate nuclei, olfactory bulbs hypoplasia, and anomaly of the diencephalic-mesencephalic junction with abnormal corticospinal tract course. Whole-exome sequencing identified two novel homozygous variants, c.26C>A; p.(S9*) and c.752A>G; p.(Q251R) in the GSX2 gene, a member of the family of homeobox transcription factors, which are key regulators of embryonic development. GSX2 is highly expressed in neural progenitors of the lateral and median ganglionic eminences, two protrusions of the ventral telencephalon from which the basal ganglia and olfactory tubercles originate, where it promotes neurogenesis while negatively regulating oligodendrogenesis. The truncating variant resulted in complete loss of protein expression, while the missense variant affected a highly conserved residue of the homeobox domain, was consistently predicted as pathogenic by bioinformatic tools, resulted in reduced protein expression and caused impaired structural stability of the homeobox domain and weaker interaction with DNA according to molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, the nuclear localization of the mutant protein in transfected cells was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type protein. Expression studies on both patients' fibroblasts demonstrated reduced expression of GSX2 itself, likely due to altered transcriptional self-regulation, as well as significant expression changes of related genes such as ASCL1 and PAX6. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed a global deregulation in genes implicated in apoptosis and immunity, two broad pathways known to be involved in brain development. This is the first report of the clinical phenotype and molecular basis associated to basal ganglia agenesis in humans.","dc:creator":"De Mori R","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Agenesis of the putamen and globus pallidus caused by recessive mutations in the homeobox gene GSX2."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:72a485f9-233a-407d-a372-c383d932e00d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72a485f9-233a-407d-a372-c383d932e00d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:fde53eb5-5900-427a-9339-d05726393bbf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_133267.3(GSX2):c.26C>A (p.Ser9Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA356953777"}},"detectionMethod":"The proband and her parents underwent whole-exome sequencing using Agilent SureSelectXT V4 51mb Exome with 100-bp paired-end read sequences generated on Illumina HiSeq2500.

Here we examine the developmental function of the Gsh-2 nonclustered homeobox gene. Whole-mount and serial section in situ hybridizations have been used to better define Gsh-2 expression domains within the developing forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Gsh-2 transcripts are shown to be particularly abundant in the hindbrain and within the developing ganglionic eminences of the forebrain. In addition, mice carrying a targeted mutation of Gsh-2 have been generated and characterized. Homozygous mutants uniformly failed to survive more than 1 day following birth. At the physiologic level the mutants experienced apnea and reduced levels of hemoglobin oxygenation. Histologically, the mutant brains had striking alterations of discrete components. In the forebrain the lateral ganglionic eminence was reduced in size. In the hindbrain, the area postrema, an important cardiorespiratory chemosensory center, was absent. The contiguous nucleus tractus solitarius, involved in integrating sensory input to maintain homeostasis, was also severely malformed in mutants. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the mutant brains for alterations in the distribution of markers specific for serotonergic and cholinergic neurons. In addition, in situ hybridizations were used to define expression patterns of the Dlx 2 and Nkx 2.1 homeobox genes in Gsh-2 mutant mice. The mutant lateral ganglionic eminences showed an abnormal absence of Dlx 2 expression. These results better define the genetic program of development of the mammalian brain, support neuromeric models of brain development, and further suggest similar patterning function for homeobox genes in phylogenetically diverse organisms.","dc:creator":"Szucsik JC","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Altered forebrain and hindbrain development in mice mutant for the Gsh-2 homeobox gene."},"rdfs:label":"Gsx2 KO mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":6253,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d1b7e146-b259-43f5-9a30-1026439fc6cd","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020762","gene":"hgnc:24959","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The *GSX2* gene encodes a transcription factor thought to be involved in brain development. *GSX2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Diencephalic-Mesencephalic Junction Dysplasia Syndrome 2 in 2019 (De Mori et al., PMID: 31412107). Phenotypes onset at birth and can include severe global developmental delay, spastic tetraplegia, abnormal basal ganglia morphology, dystonia, decreased thalamic volume, absent speech, feeding difficulties in infancy, inability to walk, and hypoplasia of the olfactory bulb. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship include case-level data and experimental data. The genetic evidence in this curation includes two variants, one nonsense and one missense, from two probands, reported in one publication (De Mori et al., PMID: 31412107). The mechanism of disease is presumed to be reduced or loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence.
