In addition, the homozygous Slc6a3 knockout mouse displays a hyperactivity phenotype. Here, we analyzed 2 unrelated consanguineous families with infantile parkinsonism-dystonia (IPD) syndrome and identified homozygous missense SLC6A3 mutations (p.L368Q and p.P395L) in both families. Functional studies demonstrated that both mutations were loss-of-function mutations that severely reduced levels of mature (85-kDa) DAT while having a differential effect on the apparent binding affinity of dopamine. Thus, in humans, loss-of-function SLC6A3 mutations that impair DAT-mediated dopamine transport activity are associated with an early-onset complex movement disorder. Identification of the molecular basis of IPD suggests SLC6A3 as a candidate susceptibility gene for other movement disorders associated with parkinsonism and/or dystonic features.","dc:creator":"Kurian MA","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the dopamine transporter are associated with infantile parkinsonism-dystonia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb7a8001-1bc9-4cdf-bb99-1979737bda79_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:747dc2a1-be7c-484c-99c8-33ca399623de_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:747dc2a1-be7c-484c-99c8-33ca399623de","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:63674788-ebe7-44a2-9f40-540973a03912","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000005.10:g.1402924_1406290del (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573131699"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR + sequencing as described in Kurian et al. 2009.

There are two main superfamilies of transporters, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) binding cassettes (ABCs) and solute carriers (SLCs). In the brain, SLC transporters are involved in transporting various solutes across the blood-brain barrier, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, astrocytes, neurons, and other brain cell types including oligodendrocytes and microglial cells. SLCs play an important role in maintaining normal brain function. Hence, mutations in the genes that encode SLC transporters can cause a variety of neurological disorders. We identified the following SLC gene variants in 25 patients in our cohort: SLC1A2, SLC2A1, SLC5A1, SLC6A3, SLC6A5, SLC6A8, SLC9A6, SLC9A9, SLC12A6, SLC13A5, SLC16A1, SLC17A5, SLC19A3, SLC25A12, SLC25A15, SLC27A4, SLC45A1, SLC46A1, and SLC52A3. Eight patients harbored pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations (SLC5A1, SLC9A6, SLC12A6, SLC16A1, SLC19A3, and SLC52A3), and 12 patients were found to have variants of unknown clinical significance (VOUS); these variants occurred in 11 genes (SLC1A2, SLC2A1, SLC6A3, SLC6A5, SLC6A8, SLC9A6, SLC9A9, SLC13A5, SLC25A12, SLC27A4, and SLC45A1). Five patients were excluded as they were carriers. In the remaining 20 patients with SLC gene variants, we identified 16 possible distinct neurological disorders. Based on the clinical presentation, we categorized them into genes causing intellectual delay (ID) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), those causing epilepsy, those causing vitamin-related disorders, and those causing other neurological diseases. Several variants were detected that indicated possible personalized therapies: SLC2A1 led to dystonia or epilepsy, which can be treated with a ketogenic diet; SLC6A3 led to infantile parkinsonism-dystonia 1, which can be treated with levodopa; SLC6A5 led to hyperekplexia 3, for which unnecessary treatment with antiepileptic drugs should be avoided; SLC6A8 led to creatine deficiency syndrome type 1, which can be treated with creatine monohydrate; SLC16A1 led to monocarboxylate transporter 1 deficiency, which causes seizures that should not be treated with a ketogenic diet; SLC19A3 led to biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease, which can be treated with biotin and thiamine; and SLC52A3 led to Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome 1, which can be treated with riboflavin. The present study examines the prevalence of SLC gene mutations in our cohort of children with epilepsy and other neurological disorders. It highlights the diverse phenotypes associated with mutations in this large family of SLC transporter proteins, and an opportunity for personalized genomics and personalized therapeutics.","dc:creator":"Mir A","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"SLC gene mutations and pediatric neurological disorders: diverse clinical phenotypes in a Saudi Arabian population."}},"rdfs:label":"Mir_2021_Patient_1"},{"id":"cggv:1df8a090-f5d1-4cc7-be44-dedf915c2b2c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1df8a090-f5d1-4cc7-be44-dedf915c2b2c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4cdd31d2-6f38-44f5-8e63-d45944ca65fe_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4cdd31d2-6f38-44f5-8e63-d45944ca65fe","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:36eae0ce-1567-42fc-b2d2-d419e8e2c3fc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001044.5(SLC6A3):c.1184C>T (p.Pro395Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA126862"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR amplification of microsatellite markers, followed by sequencing using ABI PRISM 3730 Genetic Analyzer and analyzed using GeneMapper software","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0032988","obo:HP_0002493","obo:HP_0034201","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0009800","obo:HP_0001332","obo:HP_0000737","obo:HP_0002067","obo:HP_0100738","obo:HP_0004673","obo:HP_0002063","obo:HP_0000617","obo:HP_0031931"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Genotyping","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:da470b8a-b2ac-4d0f-b2d6-c3c8c766997b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:36eae0ce-1567-42fc-b2d2-d419e8e2c3fc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19478460"},"rdfs:label":"Kurian_2009_Patient_3"},{"id":"cggv:da470b8a-b2ac-4d0f-b2d6-c3c8c766997b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da470b8a-b2ac-4d0f-b2d6-c3c8c766997b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:da470b8a-b2ac-4d0f-b2d6-c3c8c766997b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"HEK293 cells expressing this variant showed complete lack of dopamine uptake (Table 2).

In this study we have identified a new cohort of patients with dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome, including, most significantly, atypical presentation later in childhood with a milder disease course. We report the detailed clinical features, molecular genetic findings and in vitro functional investigations undertaken for adult and paediatric cases. Patients presenting with parkinsonism dystonia or a neurotransmitter profile characteristic of dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome were recruited for study. SLC6A3 mutational analysis was undertaken in all patients. The functional consequences of missense variants on the dopamine transporter were evaluated by determining the effect of mutant dopamine transporter on dopamine uptake, protein expression and amphetamine-mediated dopamine efflux using an in vitro cellular heterologous expression system. We identified eight new patients from five unrelated families with dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome. The median age at diagnosis was 13 years (range 1.5-34 years). Most significantly, the case series included three adolescent males with atypical dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome of juvenile onset (outside infancy) and progressive parkinsonism dystonia. The other five patients in the cohort presented with classical infantile-onset parkinsonism dystonia, with one surviving into adulthood (currently aged 34 years) and labelled as having 'juvenile parkinsonism'. All eight patients harboured homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in SLC6A3, of which the majority are previously unreported variants. In vitro studies of mutant dopamine transporter demonstrated multifaceted loss of dopamine transporter function. Impaired dopamine uptake was universally present, and more severely impacted in dopamine transporter mutants causing infantile-onset rather than juvenile-onset disease. Dopamine transporter mutants also showed diminished dopamine binding affinity, reduced cell surface transporter, loss of post-translational dopamine transporter glycosylation and failure of amphetamine-mediated dopamine efflux. Our data series expands the clinical phenotypic continuum of dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome and indicates that there is a phenotypic spectrum from infancy (early onset, rapidly progressive disease) to childhood/adolescence and adulthood (later onset, slower disease progression). Genotype-phenotype analysis in this cohort suggests that higher residual dopamine transporter activity is likely to contribute to postponing disease presentation in these later-onset adult cases. Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome remains under-recognized and our data highlights that dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome should be considered as a differential diagnosis for both infantile- and juvenile-onset movement disorders, including cerebral palsy and juvenile parkinsonism.

Dysregulation of hDAT has been reported to be associated with different neuropsychiatric disorders. Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (DTDS) is a complex disease caused by defects in dopamine uptake within the synaptic cleft and patients manifest parkinsonian features. The extracellular loops are crucial for DAT activity and defects in these regions disturb dopamine transport. In the present study, a 3.5-year-old female in a consanguineous Iranian family with an initial diagnosis of gait imbalance and speech delay has been identified. We utilized whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the possible genetic defect(s). WES identified a novel homozygous in-frame indel variant, c.1139_1150del; p.(Gly380_Lys384delinsGlu), in the SLC6A3 gene (NM_001044.4), as the most likely disease-susceptibility variant. This variant is located in extracellular loop 4 (EL4) of the DAT protein. Our study highlights the role of extracellular loops and shows the EL4 of hDAT as a critical region for the protein activity.

The neuronal death is associated with overactivation of dopaminergic signaling as evidenced by the robust up-regulation of striatal DeltaFosB, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and p35. Moreover, hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, a phenomenon associated with the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in several neurodegenerative disorders, is observed in symptomatic mice.

This complex neurological disorder is characterized by parkinsonism, dystonia, ocular flutter, rigidity, dyskinesia, and other neuromuscular phenotypes. Onset usually occurrs in the first year of life (classical DTDS), but the disease sometimes presents in childhood or adulthood (atypical DTDS). The severity of phenotypes increase over time, resulting in severe motor decline while cognitive function is relatively retained. The disease is most commonly identified by an increased ratio of homovanillic acid to 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HVA:HIAA) in the urine or cerebrospinal fluid, but many patients are misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy (PMID:19478460).\n\nEight variants (3 missense, 2 in-frame indels, 1 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splice site variant) that have been reported in 8 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 19478460, 34797406, 21112253, 24613933, 33015223, 32077500) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score of 12 pts for genetic evidence has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. 3 out of 8 variants included in this curation were located in or near the protein region designated as extracellular loop 4 (EL4) which appears to be a critical region for protein functioning. Through study of similar proteins, some have suggested that EL4 is important for the inward movement of the transmembrane regions (PMID:32077500). Overall, further studies are required to confirm the role of EL4 in DTDS. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical evidence, expression evidence, animal models, and genetic rescues in mice and patient cells (PMIDs: 1948034 23715323, 12958210, 28972153, 34011628). Shimada et al. (2009) confirmed the biochemical function of the *SLC6A3* gene product to be as a dopamine transporter by inserting the mRNA into Xenopus oocytes, which then showed 5x increased dopamine uptake (PMID:1948034). This is evidence for a relationship between *SLC6A3* and dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome because lack of dopamine uptake would lead to increased HVA concentration, a hallmark phenotype for the disease. Additional biochemical evidence includes disruption of the *SLC18A2* gene (which encodes a monoamine transporter) is implicated in a disease with a similar phenotype (infantile parkinsonism-dystonia 2) (PMID:23363473). Next, the GTEx database shows highly specific expression of *SLC6A3* in the substantia nigra, which contains dopaminergic neurons. Degradation of this region of the brain is one of the most prominent physical features of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PMID:15743669). In the fly model, replacement of the Drosophila ortholog of *SLC6A3* with a human variant resulted in hyperlocomotion, a comparable phenotype to hyperkinetic movements seen in affected humans (PMID:28972153). Finally, the mouse model demonstrates disease features such as gait disturbance and motor dysfunction, as well as decreased DA uptake and increased HVA concentration (PMID:12958210). The phenotypes seen in these mice were rescued using a wild-type copy of human *SLC6A3*. The rescue resulted in the knockout mice being behaviorally indistinguishable from the wild-type mice, with improved DA and HVA levels. Finally, DA and HVA levels in patient induced pluripotent stem cells were improved using CRISPR insertion of a wild-type version of human *SLC6A3* (PMID:34011628). \n\nIn summary, *SLC6A3* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive SLC6A3-related dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome. This has been repeated in clinical and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 09/09/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bb7a8001-1bc9-4cdf-bb99-1979737bda79"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
