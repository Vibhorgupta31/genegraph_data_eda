Here, by a combined approach of homozygozity mapping and exome ciliary sequencing, we identified truncating TCTN3 mutations as the cause of an extreme form of OFD associated with bone dysplasia, tibial defect, cystic kidneys, and brain anomalies (OFD IV, Mohr-Majewski syndrome). Analysis of 184 individuals with various ciliopathies (OFD, Meckel, Joubert, and short rib polydactyly syndromes) led us to identify four additional truncating TCTN3 mutations in unrelated fetal cases with overlapping Meckel and OFD IV syndromes and one homozygous missense mutation in a family with Joubert syndrome. By exploring roles of TCTN3 in human ciliary related functions, we found that TCTN3 is necessary for transduction of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, as revealed by abnormal processing of GLI3 in patient cells. These results are consistent with the suggested role of its murine ortholog, which forms a complex at the ciliary transition zone with TCTN1 and TCTN2, both of which are also implicated in the transduction of SHH signaling. Overall, our data show the involvement of the transition zone protein TCTN3 in the regulation of the key SHH signaling pathway and that its disruption causes a severe form of ciliopathy, combining features of Meckel and OFD IV syndromes.","dc:creator":"Thomas S","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"TCTN3 mutations cause Mohr-Majewski syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2d88e7f-2d6d-423f-8602-c89b76849bef_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2d88e7f-2d6d-423f-8602-c89b76849bef_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0d6b728c-119f-4383-abd2-32aa03e76dca","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d34b74f5-2962-4dfd-9a8d-1e1079062447","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fig.3","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28800946","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Tctn1, Tctn2, and Tctn3 are membrane proteins that localize at the transition zone of primary cilia. Tctn1 and Tctn2 mutations have been reported in both humans and mice, but Tctn3 mutations have been reported only in humans. It is also not clear whether the three Tctn proteins are functionally conserved with respect to ciliogenesis and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. In the present study, we report that loss of Tctn3 gene function in mice results in a decrease in ciliogenesis and Hh signaling. Consistent with this, Tctn3 mutant mice exhibit holoprosencephaly and randomized heart looping and lack the floor plate in the neural tube, the phenotypes similar to those of Tctn1 and Tctn2 mutants. We also show that overexpression of Tctn3, but not Tctn1 or Tctn2, can rescue ciliogenesis in Tctn3 mutant cells. Similarly, replacement of Tctn3 with Tctn1 or Tctn2 in the Tctn3 gene locus results in reduced ciliogenesis and Hh signaling, holoprosencephaly, and randomized heart looping. Surprisingly, however, the neural tube patterning and the proteolytic processing of Gli3 (a transcription regulator for Hh signaling) into a repressor, both of which are usually impaired in ciliary gene mutants, are normal. These results suggest that Tctn1, Tctn2, and Tctn3 are functionally divergent with respect to their role in ciliogenesis and Hh signaling but conserved in neural tube patterning and Gli3 processing.","dc:creator":"Wang C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Three Tctn proteins are functionally conserved in the regulation of neural tube patterning and Gli3 processing but not ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling in the mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Reduced ciliary trafficking-Fig.3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f2d88e7f-2d6d-423f-8602-c89b76849bef_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bd26c8a1-9f67-4a1f-9816-f5942321328d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fd4d4371-485a-4753-b5bf-90977dd22f3a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"WT tctn3 was able to partially increase the % of cells with primary cilia.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28800946","rdfs:label":"WT rescues ciliogenesis-Fig.5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a2798236-5909-497e-bfe2-21e06d666b85","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa0b9599-929c-427f-80cc-670124a80b5d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Human cells derived from ciliopathy patients also exhibit reduced cilia number.

Since then, biallelic alterations in *TCTN3* have been identified in patients presenting with abnormalities in several organ systems including kidneys (cystic), brain (corpus callosum agenesis, molar tooth sign, occipital encephalocele, hypotonia, ataxic gait, developmental delay, intellectual disability), limbs and digits (shortened limbs, polydactyly), liver (bile duct proliferation) and dysmorphic facies; many of which are part of the phenotypic spectrum of the above described ciliopathies (PMIDs: 22883145, 22118024, 34096782) . Given the heterogenous phenotypic manifestations of patients with biallelic variants in *TCTN3*, (highlighted in the first, Thomas et al., study (PMID: 22883145)), but no apparent differences in molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis, the gene disease association of *TCTN3* has been lumped to the ‘Ciliopathy’ term in adherence with criteria established by the Lumping and Splitting working group. Several other recent studies have also reported patients with biallelic *TCTN3* variants who present with similar symptoms (PMIDs: 26092869, 30629328, 32139166, 34411415, 35170189). Within these reports, many probands present with renal symptoms including cystic kidneys and imaging abnormalities among other clinical findings (PMIDs: 22883145, 26092869, 32139166, 34096782, 34411415). Overall, the genetic evidence included in the curation has reached the maximum of 12 points. \nEvidence supporting gene-disease relationship not only includes genetic case-level data but also experimental data using mouse models and cell lines derived from patients harboring *TCTN3* mutations. These animal models have recapitulated an array of defects observed in patients including cystic kidneys, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities (PMIDs: 28800946, 29725084). Further, the animal and cell-based studies have demonstrated that absence of Tctn3 results in aberrant Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling via improper modulation of GLI3 protein levels, a key component of Shh pathway and leads to reduced cilia formation, both of which can be rescued by overexpressing wild-type Tctn3 (PMID: 22883145, 28800946, 29725084). The experimental evidence was scored at a total of 4 points. Hence, biallelic pathogenic variants in *TCTN3* are “Definitely” associated with autosomal recessive ciliopathy. Importantly, the genetic and experimental evidence supporting gene-disease validity has been replicated over time in both research and clinical diagnostic settings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kideny Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders Expert Panel on the meeting date 11/10/2022 (SOP Version 8).\n\nBesides the studies scored under genetic evidence, several other recent studies have also reported patients with biallelic TCTN3 variants who present with similar symptoms (PMIDs: 26092869, 30629328, 32139166, 34411415, 35170189). Within these reports, many probands present with renal symptoms including cystic kidneys and imaging abnormalities among other clinical findings (PMIDs: 22883145, 26092869, 32139166, 34096782, 34411415). Therefore, the gene-disease validity appears to be strong and replicated over time, making it a definitive classification.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f2d88e7f-2d6d-423f-8602-c89b76849bef"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
