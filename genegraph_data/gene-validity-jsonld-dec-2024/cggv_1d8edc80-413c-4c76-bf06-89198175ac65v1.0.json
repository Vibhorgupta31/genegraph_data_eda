Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but about 10% are familial. Genes known to cause classic familial ALS (FALS) are superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), ANG encoding angiogenin, TARDP encoding transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ref. 4) and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS, also known as TLS). However, these genetic defects occur in only about 20-30% of cases of FALS, and most genes causing FALS are unknown. Here we show that there are mutations in the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN), earlier reported to be a causative gene of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), in patients with ALS. We found three types of mutation of OPTN: a homozygous deletion of exon 5, a homozygous Q398X nonsense mutation and a heterozygous E478G missense mutation within its ubiquitin-binding domain. Analysis of cell transfection showed that the nonsense and missense mutations of OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and the E478G mutation revealed a cytoplasmic distribution different from that of the wild type or a POAG mutation. A case with the E478G mutation showed OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP-43- or SOD1-positive inclusions of sporadic and SOD1 cases of ALS were also noticeably immunolabelled by anti-OPTN antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that OPTN is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. They also indicate that NF-kappaB inhibitors could be used to treat ALS and that transgenic mice bearing various mutations of OPTN will be relevant in developing new drugs for this disorder.","dc:creator":"Maruyama H","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations of optineurin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d8edc80-413c-4c76-bf06-89198175ac65_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1d8edc80-413c-4c76-bf06-89198175ac65_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30d7f6c9-ebec-4090-b5de-4cdab1c5b213","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81a0d10c-6698-410e-95c2-4807b7f0e4e4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Immunohistochemical staining of the spinal cord sections revealed OPTN-immunoreactive skein-like inclusions in some of the spared spinal anterior horn neurons from all 32 SALS cases and all 8 non SOD1 FALS cases. \n\nTo minimize the ppossibility of failing to detect OPTN in SOD1 positive cases due to the absence of inclusion-bearing neurons, 2 color confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using ubiquitin and OPTN antibodies was performed.\nJ-O 2 well characterized ALS transgenic murine models overexpressing ALS SOD1 mutations  -Ubiq+ while OPTN still negative\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21825243","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in optineurin have recently been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).","dc:creator":"Deng HX","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Differential involvement of optineurin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with or without SOD1 mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Differential involvement of OPTN +/- SOD1 mutants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fb9908d7-f409-45a2-857b-7d82f54e7e26","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f1081cb-ec0c-4d3a-9e99-44e97d233733","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Spinal cord with the E478 variant revealed loss of myelin from the corticospinal tract and of the anterior horn cells (AHCs).

Optineurin deletion mutations have also been described in ALS patients. However, the role of optineurin in mechanisms of protein aggregation remains unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that optineurin recognizes various protein aggregates via its C-terminal coiled-coil domain in a ubiquitin-independent manner. We also show that optineurin depletion significantly increases protein aggregation in HeLa cells and that morpholino-silencing of the optineurin ortholog in zebrafish causes the motor axonopathy phenotype similar to a zebrafish model of ALS. A more severe phenotype is observed when optineurin is depleted in zebrafish carrying ALS mutations. Furthermore, TANK1 binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is colocalized with optineurin on protein aggregates and is important in clearance of protein aggregates through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. TBK1 phosphorylates optineurin at serine 177 and regulates its ability to interact with autophagy modifiers.

Mutations in optineurin cause a small proportion of familial ALS cases, and wild-type (WT) optineurin is misfolded and forms inclusions in sporadic ALS patient motor neurons. However, it is unknown how optineurin mutation or misfolding leads to ALS. Optineurin acts an adaptor protein connecting the molecular motor myosin VI to secretory vesicles and autophagosomes. Here, we demonstrate that ALS-linked mutations p.Q398X and p.E478G disrupt the association of optineurin with myosin VI, leading to an abnormal diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, inhibition of secretory protein trafficking, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Golgi fragmentation in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells. We also provide further insight into the role of optineurin as an autophagy receptor. WT optineurin associated with lysosomes and promoted autophagosome fusion to lysosomes in neuronal cells, implying that it mediates trafficking of lysosomes during autophagy in association with myosin VI. However, either expression of ALS mutant optineurin or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous optineurin blocked lysosome fusion to autophagosomes, resulting in autophagosome accumulation. Together these results indicate that ALS-linked mutations in optineurin disrupt myosin VI-mediated intracellular trafficking processes. In addition, in control human patient tissues, optineurin displayed its normal vesicular localization, but in sporadic ALS patient tissues, vesicles were present in a significantly decreased proportion of motor neurons. Optineurin binding to myosin VI was also decreased in tissue lysates from sporadic ALS spinal cords. This study therefore links several previously described pathological mechanisms in ALS, including defects in autophagy, fragmentation of the Golgi and induction of ER stress, to disruption of optineurin function. These findings also indicate that optineurin-myosin VI dysfunction is a common feature of both sporadic and familial ALS.

Among these genes, optineurin (OPTN) is virtually the only gene that is considered to cause classical ALS by a loss-of-function mutation. Wild-type optineurin (OPTN(WT) ) suppresses nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity, but the ALS-causing mutant OPTN is unable to suppress NF-κB activity. Therefore, we knocked down OPTN in neuronal cells and examined the resulting NF-κB activity and phenotype. First, we confirmed the loss of the endogenous OPTN expression after siRNA treatment and found that NF-κB activity was increased in OPTN-knockdown cells. Next, we found that OPTN knockdown caused neuronal cell death. Then, overexpression of OPTN(WT) or OPTN(E) (50K) with intact NF-κB-suppressive activity, but not overexpression of ALS-related OPTN mutants, suppressed the neuronal death induced by OPTN knockdown. This neuronal cell death was inhibited by withaferin A, which selectively inhibits NF-κB activation. Lastly, involvement of the mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway was suggested for neuronal death induced by OPTN knockdown. Taken together, these results indicate that inappropriate NF-κB activation is the pathogenic mechanism underlying OPTN mutation-related ALS. Among the genes for typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) phenotypes, optineurin (OPTN) is virtually the only gene in which a loss-of-function mutation is considered as the principal disease mechanism.

Nine OPTN variants were identified, of which four were novel missense mutations: c.407C > T (p.A136V), c.1184A > G (p.K395R), c.1352T > C (p.I451T), and c.1546G > C (p.E516Q) (all heterozygous). The remaining five variants were already present in single nucleotide polymorphism databases. Patients with OPTN mutations were characterized by spinal onset, although they showed differences in disease progression. In conclusion, this study provides a genetic epidemiological characterization of OPTN mutations in Chinese patients, and our results are consistent with the proposition that such mutations are common in Asian populations.

Here, we screened German familial ALS cases for OPTN mutations to gain additional insight into the spectrum and pathogenic relevance of this gene for ALS. One hundred familial German ALS cases and 148 control subjects were screened for OPTN mutations by sequence analysis of the complete OPTN coding sequence, and phenotypes of OPTN mutant patients were described. We identified a novel heterozygous truncating OPTN mutation p.Lys440Asnfs*8 in 1 ALS family with an aggressive ALS disease phenotype. This mutation abolishes protein domains crucial for nuclear factor κB signaling. Moreover, we detected 3 different nonsynonymous sequence variants, which have been described previously as risk factors for primary retinal ganglion cell degeneration in normal tension glaucoma. Two of them were detected on the same allele in a family that also carries a p.Asn352Ser disease mutation in the ALS gene TARDBP. All OPTN mutant patients presented with typical spinal onset ALS. Taken together, we detected a novel truncating OPTN mutation associated with an aggressive form of ALS and confirmed that OPTN mutations are a rare cause of ALS. In addition our data suggest that in some cases plausibly more than 1 mutation in OPTN or another ALS gene might be needed to cause ALS. Finally, our findings show that motoneurons and retinal ganglion cells, which are both projecting central nervous system neurons, might share common susceptibility factors.","dc:creator":"Weishaupt JH","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A novel optineurin truncating mutation and three glaucoma-associated missense variants in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Germany."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"K440Nfs*8"},{"id":"cggv:8247982b-8d6c-446a-8dce-3337ba16828a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8247982b-8d6c-446a-8dce-3337ba16828a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"GnomADv2.1.1(non-neuro): 0.000008720 (2/229,370) Euro non Fin: 0.00001939 (2/103158)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:cb2cbf38-56e8-46b4-a991-636fd7f85ef1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb2cbf38-56e8-46b4-a991-636fd7f85ef1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":43,"allele":{"id":"cggv:eaba8cda-5a6d-40f1-8b2b-f2d5096c1204","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.11:g.(?_13116257)_(13116350_?)del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/831344"}},"detectionMethod":"15 TaqMan probes across the OPTN gene for qPCR","firstTestingMethod":"Other","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Screened for OPTN mutations","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:5623a2ed-9ff0-4fae-8b8f-ab9265a46eb1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:eaba8cda-5a6d-40f1-8b2b-f2d5096c1204"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22402017","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective motor neuron death in the brain and spinal cord. Many disease genes for ALS have been identified; however, each disease gene is responsible for very small fractions of ALS. Recently, mutations of the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN) are reported in familial and sporadic ALS. OPTN is also responsible for a small number of ALS, 3.8% of familial and 0.29% of sporadic ALS in Japanese. The low prevalence may be an underestimation due to incomplete screening of the mutation. To examine OPTN mutations more extensively, we screened the OPTN deletions using a quantitative PCR system. We examined 710 Japanese ALS subjects who had previously been found to have no OPTN mutations by a screening using a PCR-direct sequence strategy. We identified 3 kinds of deletions in 5 patients; one was homozygous, and the remaining were heterozygous. All deletions occurred due to the Alu-mediated recombination and are expected to result in null alleles. Our results suggest that the OPTN deletion mutation in ALS is not infrequent and the prevalence of the OPTN mutation in Japanese sporadic ALS is considerably high.","dc:creator":"Iida A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Novel deletion mutations of OPTN in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Japanese."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"exon 1-4 deletion"},{"id":"cggv:5623a2ed-9ff0-4fae-8b8f-ab9265a46eb1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5623a2ed-9ff0-4fae-8b8f-ab9265a46eb1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c8a2d89e-ab21-4abe-9a12-c55eebd493d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8a2d89e-ab21-4abe-9a12-c55eebd493d6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":58,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:780fd7bf-eab9-4dbf-9475-d5c5957e4865","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001008212.2(OPTN):c.785C>A (p.Ser262Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5410755"}},{"id":"cggv:1822c9fb-8955-4988-a400-ebd63e1f24a0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001008212.2(OPTN):c.1289_1290del (p.Leu430ArgfsTer16)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA592311806"}}],"detectionMethod":"Illumina WGS was performed; variants were Sanger confirmed.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the variable inheritance pattern associated with OPTN mutations have remained elusive. We identified that affected members of a consanguineous Middle Eastern ALS kindred possessed a novel homozygous p.S174X OPTN mutation. Analysis of these primary fibroblast lines from family members identified that the p.S174X mutation reduces OPTN mRNA expression in an allele-dependent fashion by nonsense mediated decay. Western blotting correlated a reduced expression in heterozygote carriers but a complete absence of OPTN protein in the homozygous carrier. This data suggests that the p.S174X truncation mutation causes recessive ALS through LoF. However, functional analysis detected a significant increase in mitophagy markers TOM20 and COXIV, and higher rates of mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels in heterozygous carriers only. This suggests that heterozygous LoF OPTN mutations may not be causative in a Mendelian manner but may potentially behave as contributory ALS risk factors.","dc:creator":"Gotkine M","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"A recessive S174X mutation in Optineurin causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through a loss of function via allele-specific nonsense-mediated decay."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"rdfs:label":"S174X"},{"id":"cggv:ccbdbf0c-4f46-4dfc-98ab-12cd715f2d13","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ccbdbf0c-4f46-4dfc-98ab-12cd715f2d13_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ccbdbf0c-4f46-4dfc-98ab-12cd715f2d13_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"qPCR reveals significant decrease in expression in OPTN; treated fibroblasts with heterozygous and homozygous mutant alleles with CHX to test if mutant allele goes through NMD.

Whole exome sequence data from 74 familial ALS cases were analysed for the presence of novel OPTN mutations. Pathogenicity was assessed by analysing effects on Golgi fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-linked CHOP activation, and cellular localization of optineurin in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing mutant optineurin. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation in OPTN (c.883G > T, p.Val295Phe) in a single familial ALS case. This mutation induced recognized cellular features of ALS pathogenesis including Golgi fragmentation and ER stress in NSC-34 cells.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons in the brain and lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, resulting in fatal paralysis. *OPTN* encodes for optineurin, a multiple domain protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, including the brain, skeletal muscle, and the eye. It plays important roles in vesicular trafficking, Golgi maintenance, secretion, receptor recycling, and as an autophagy receptor. It also influences the innate immune response by negatively regulating the NF-κB pathway. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in phenotypic variability and a difference in the types of variants seen in autosomal dominant open angle glaucoma and subtype normal tension glaucoma.  Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: ALS 12 (OMIM:613435), primary open angle glaucoma (OMIM: 137760) and susceptibility to normal tension glaucoma (OMIM:606657). 40 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletions) that have been reported in 43 probands in 19 publications (PMIDs: 2042814, 26203661, 29558868, 33727253, 34272080, 26740678, 21217154, 21074290, 21220178, 21802176, 21852022, 21613650, 22402017, 23062601, 25382069, 25588603, 26503823, 27534431, 31838784) are included in this curation.  The strongest evidence for optineurin’s role as a causative gene for ALS is recessive loss of function variants, which appear to result in a more severe phenotype; reported monoallelic loss of function and missense variants provide some evidence but may pose more of a risk to develop disease. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including expression studies (PMIDs: 20428114, 21825243), protein interaction (PMID: 23178947), functional alterations in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 25859013, 23178947, 34258561, 23721573, 30519240) animal models (PMIDs: 23178947, 27493188) and rescue experiments in vitro (PMID: 23721573). In summary, *OPTN* is definitively associated with semi-dominant ALS12. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld overtime. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on May 10, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1d8edc80-413c-4c76-bf06-89198175ac65"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
