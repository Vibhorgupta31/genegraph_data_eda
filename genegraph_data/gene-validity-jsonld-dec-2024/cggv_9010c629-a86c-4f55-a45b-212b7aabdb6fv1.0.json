We report the pathological, biochemical, histochemical and molecular genetic investigations of a male neonate who had left ventricular hypertrophy detected on antenatal scan and died on day one of life. Subsequent postmortem examination confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular non-compaction. Biochemical analysis of his skeletal muscle biopsy revealed evidence of a severe isolated complex II deficiency and candidate gene sequencing revealed a novel homozygous c.275A>G, p.(Asp92Gly) SDHD mutation which was shown to be recessively inherited through segregation studies. The affected amino acid has been reported as a Dutch founder mutation p.(Asp92Tyr) in families with hereditary head and neck paraganglioma. By introducing both mutations into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we were able to confirm that the p.(Asp92Gly) mutation causes a more severe oxidative growth phenotype than the p.(Asp92Tyr) mutant, and provides functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of the patient's SDHD mutation.

The *SDHD* gene encodes the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II) subunit D, an integral membrane protein that anchors the SDH enzyme to the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Defects of this protein lead to complex II deficiency. \n  \nThe* SDHD* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2014 (PMID: 24367056). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with autosomal recessive *SDHD*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease when inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Therefore, the *SDHD* phenotype has been split, with one disease entity being autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease, according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant hereditary pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma. This gene disease relationship has been assessed separately (https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/genes/HGNC:10683).  \nEvidence supporting the relationship between *SDHD* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two missense variants and one start-loss variant in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 24367056, 26008905). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease (PMID: 33162331). Mitochondrial dysfunction was recapitulated in a HEK293 knockout model (PMID: 34118887).  \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 4, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9010c629-a86c-4f55-a45b-212b7aabdb6f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
