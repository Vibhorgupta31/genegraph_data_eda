The consequent misexpression of the CDKL5 protein in the nervous system leads to a severe phenotype characterized by intellectual disability, motor impairment, visual deficits and early-onset epilepsy. No therapy is available for CDKL5 disorder. It has been reported that a protein transduction domain (TAT) is able to deliver macromolecules into cells and even into the brain when fused to a given protein. We demonstrate that TAT-CDKL5 fusion protein is efficiently internalized by target cells and retains CDKL5 activity. Intracerebroventricular infusion of TAT-CDKL5 restored hippocampal development, hippocampus-dependent memory and breathing pattern in Cdkl5-null mice. Notably, systemically administered TAT-CDKL5 protein passed the blood-brain-barrier, reached the CNS, and rescued various neuroanatomical and behavioral defects, including breathing pattern and visual responses. Our results suggest that CDKL5 protein therapy may be an effective clinical tool for the treatment of CDKL5 disorder.","dc:creator":"Trazzi S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"CDKL5 protein substitution therapy rescues neurological phenotypes of a mouse model of CDKL5 disorder."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue Trazzi"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:491c194c-f225-41a9-b808-1d8be7ae3d5a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f657e33-51cf-4857-b909-7f1c09bbed1c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This paper thoroughly phenotypes a previously published CDKL5 mouse model (Wang et al 2012, PMID 23236174).

While characterizing behavioral phenotypes in the mouse model of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) disorder, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding CDKL5, we found that these mice manifested behavioral phenotypes mimicking multiple key features of ASD, such as impaired social interaction and communication, as well as increased stereotypic digging behaviors. These mice also displayed hyper-locomotion, increased aggressiveness and impulsivity, plus deficits in motor and associative learning, resembling primary symptoms of ADHD. Through brain region-specific biochemical analysis, we uncovered that loss of CDKL5 disrupts dopamine synthesis and the expression of social communication-related key genes, such as forkhead-box P2 and mu-opioid receptor, in the corticostriatal circuit. Together, our findings support that CDKL5 plays a role in the comorbid features of autism and ADHD, and mice lacking CDKL5 may serve as an animal model to study the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying autism-ADHD comorbidity.","dc:creator":"Jhang CL","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mice lacking cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 manifest autistic and ADHD-like behaviors."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model Jhang"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Upgraded due to very strong mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:a80cd86d-b085-4f35-9379-12a53ef367e2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a80cd86d-b085-4f35-9379-12a53ef367e2_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:310fbf27-4c2b-409d-9643-055caf201348_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dee4cf9f-6b71-46f3-b0f0-2bf878e1f092","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"infantile spasms at 9 weeks, otherwise development was normal until 10 months.

A large degree of phenotypic variation has been observed in patients with RTT, both those with and without MECP2 mutations. We describe a family consisting of a proband with a phenotype that showed considerable overlap with that of RTT, her identical twin sister with autistic disorder and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a brother with profound intellectual disability and seizures. No pathogenic MECP2 mutations were found in this family, and the Xq28 region that contains the MECP2 gene was not shared by the affected siblings. Three other candidate regions were identified by microsatellite mapping, including 10.3 Mb at Xp22.31-pter between Xpter and DXS1135, 19.7 Mb at Xp22.12-p22.11 between DXS1135 and DXS1214, and 16.4 Mb at Xq21.33 between DXS1196 and DXS1191. The ARX and CDKL5 genes, both of which are located within the Xp22 region, were sequenced in the affected family members, and a deletion of nucleotide 183 of the coding sequence (c.183delT) was identified in CDKL5 in the affected family members. In a screen of 44 RTT cases, a single splice-site mutation, IVS13-1G-->A, was identified in a girl with a severe phenotype overlapping RTT. In the mouse brain, Cdkl5 expression overlaps--but is not identical to--that of Mecp2, and its expression is unaffected by the loss of Mecp2. These findings confirm CDKL5 as another locus associated with epilepsy and X-linked mental retardation. These results also suggest that mutations in CDKL5 can lead to a clinical phenotype that overlaps RTT. However, it remains to be determined whether CDKL5 mutations are more prevalent in specific clinical subgroups of RTT or in other clinical presentations.","dc:creator":"Weaving LS","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mutations of CDKL5 cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with infantile spasms and mental retardation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15492925","rdfs:label":"Family 1- Female"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Identical twins and deceased brother all carried variant (brother in hemizygosity).

Here, we report that de novo missense mutations in CDKL5 are associated with a severe phenotype of early-onset infantile spasms and clinical features that overlap those of other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome and Angelman syndrome. The mutations are located within the protein kinase domain and affect highly conserved amino acids; this strongly suggests that impaired CDKL5 catalytic activity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this neurodevelopmental disorder. In view of the overlapping phenotypic spectrum of CDKL5 and MECP2 mutations, it is tempting to speculate that these two genes play a role in a common pathogenic process.","dc:creator":"Tao J","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Mutations in the X-linked cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5/STK9) gene are associated with severe neurodevelopmental retardation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15499549","rdfs:label":"Family 1 - Female"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded half point because maternity and paternity were not confirmed"},{"id":"cggv:af9d4bde-709d-45c4-8253-73d4e3d2de20_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b434a20-e807-496b-8860-f7cf42e3b029","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Developed infantile spasms at 2 months, but disappeared at 6 months.

CDKL5 gene is associated with CDKL5 disorder, a disorder sometimes referred to as a Rett syndrome variant, but which can be considered a distinct condition. Individuals with CDKL5 disorder lack some of the distinctive clinical features of classical Rett syndrome such as the clear period of regression and the characteristic intense eye-gaze (PMID:21154482). Of note, normal development during the first 6 months of life commonly seen in Rett syndrome is rare in individuals with CDKL5 disorder. Heterozygous truncating as well as missense variants of CDKL5 cause CDKL5 disorder, almost exclusively arising de novo. Two mouse models of CDKL5 disorder have been characterized (Wang 2012, Amendola 2014), which recaputulate many of the autism-associated phenotypes of CDKL5 disorder. Notably, however, neither mouse model exhibited spontaneous seizures, challenging the usefulness of Cdkl5 KO mice in modeling the human phenotype. Most mice studied have also been hemizygous males, while CDKL5 disorder primarily affects heterozygous females. In summary, CDKL5 is definitively associated with CDKL5 disorder.  This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
