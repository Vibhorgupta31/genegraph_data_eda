Unlike other xeroderma pigmentosum cells (belonging to groups XP-A to XP-G), XP-V cells carry out normal nucleotide-excision repair processes but are defective in their replication of ultraviolet-damaged DNA. It has been suspected for some time that the XPV gene encodes a protein that is involved in trans-lesion DNA synthesis, but the gene product has never been isolated. Using an improved cell-free assay for trans-lesion DNA synthesis, we have recently isolated a DNA polymerase from HeLa cells that continues replication on damaged DNA by bypassing ultraviolet-induced thymine dimers in XP-V cell extracts. Here we show that this polymerase is a human homologue of the yeast Rad30 protein, recently identified as DNA polymerase eta. This polymerase and yeast Rad30 are members of a family of damage-bypass replication proteins which comprises the Escherichia coli proteins UmuC and DinB and the yeast Rev1 protein. We found that all XP-V cells examined carry mutations in their DNA polymerase eta gene. Recombinant human DNA polymerase eta corrects the inability of XP-V cell extracts to carry out DNA replication by bypassing thymine dimers on damaged DNA. Together, these results indicate that DNA polymerase eta could be the XPV gene product.","dc:creator":"Masutani C","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"The XPV (xeroderma pigmentosum variant) gene encodes human DNA polymerase eta."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10385124","rdfs:label":"XP2SA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"A G-to-T mutation at nucleotide 1153 which resulted in a glu306-to-ter mutation."},{"id":"cggv:009228db-3f31-472e-922a-53113e85ab3c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:22201d5a-f451-4527-8523-5364e669e58a","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000992","obo:HP_0008069"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:009228db-3f31-472e-922a-53113e85ab3c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f4d486c6-c6cf-4fb6-b3c1-fb8dd4e8f33a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006502.2(POLH):c.1117C>T (p.Gln373Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/5890"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10398605","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a high incidence of skin cancers.

Multiple case level studies have been performed with XPV patients that have variants in the POLH gene. 8 complementation groups genes (XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, XPG, and XP variant (XPV)) in Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway were reported to cause Xeroderma Pigmentosum. Multiple Polh deficient mouse models have been established to show consistent phenotypes with XPV patients, including highly susceptible to ultraviolet-induced carcinogenesis and the formation of epithelial and mesenchymal tumors. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the POLH gene and xeroderma pigmentosum variant type.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bdb29404-0c05-4519-b6ee-8591368ad1ff"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
