Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in genes for cytoskeleton proteins distributed in the Z-disc and/or intercalated discs of the cardiac muscle are major predictors of cardiomyopathy. However, as mutations in these genes can account for only a part of the patient population, there should be another disease-causing gene(s) for cardiomyopathy. Cypher/ZASP appears to be an ideal candidate for the cardiomyopathy causative gene, because Cypher/ZASP encodes a Z-disc associated protein, and recent studies have demonstrated that Cypher/ZASP knock-out mice develop cardiomyopathy. In this study, we searched for sequence variations in Cypher/ZASP in 96 unrelated Japanese patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. A D626N mutation located within the third LIM domain was identified in a familial case but not found in the unrelated controls. A family study of the patient showed that all affected siblings tested had the same mutation. Clinical information of the affected family members suggested that the mutation was associated with late onset cardiomyopathy. To reveal the biochemical changes due to the mutation, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and a pull-down assay. It was demonstrated by both assays that the D626N mutation of Cypher/ZASP increased the affinity of the LIM domain for protein kinase C, suggesting a novel biochemical mechanism of the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy.","dc:creator":"Arimura T","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A Cypher/ZASP mutation associated with dilated cardiomyopathy alters the binding affinity to protein kinase C."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14660611","rdfs:label":"II-6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Relatively high frequency within the Asian population (0.09%) and weak functional data."},{"id":"cggv:5e6cef24-d075-44cf-ae6a-84a39e5bac1d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97b175d9-4eaf-4e78-b078-78cbcbde4ce9","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"The proband and her sister had sequencing for TAZ, DTNA, SNTA1, FKBP1A, and\nLDB3.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0030682","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:5e6cef24-d075-44cf-ae6a-84a39e5bac1d_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:cb5b8845-c82a-400b-9b7b-9c80cba73c70"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16427346","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a cardiomyopathy characterized by numerous excessively trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of a new skeletal muscle protein containing a PDZ domain that binds to the COOH-terminal region of alpha-actinin-2. This novel 31-kD protein is specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. Using antibodies produced to a fragment of the protein, we can show its location in the sarcomere at the level of the Z-band by immunoelectron microscopy. At least two proteins, 32 kD and 78 kD, can be detected by Western blot analysis of both heart and skeletal muscle, suggesting the existence of alternative forms of the protein. In fact, several forms were found that appear to be the result of alternative splicing.

ZASP/Cypher also has a conserved sequence called the ZM-motif, and it is found in two alternatively spliced exons 4 and 6. We have shown earlier that the ZM-motif containing internal regions of two related proteins ALP and CLP36 interact with alpha-actinin rod region, and that the ZM-motif is important in targeting ALP to the alpha-actinin containing structures in cell. Here, we show that the ZASP/Cypher internal fragments containing either ZM exon 4 or 6 co-localized with alpha-actinin in cultured myoblasts and nonmuscle cells. Fragments of 130 residues around the ZM-consensus were sufficient for localization, which is similar to our previous results of ALP. Moreover, ZASP/Cypher protein interacted directly with the alpha-actinin rod and competed with ALP in binding to the rod. During the inhibition of stress fiber assembly ZASP/Cypher and alpha-actinin co-localization could be partially disturbed, suggesting that ZASP/Cypher is bound to alpha-actinin mainly when alpha-actinin is localizing in stress fibers. Many point mutations found in cardiomyopathy patients are located in the internal region of ZASP/Cypher.

Cypher/ZASP is a cytoskeletal protein localized in the sarcomeric Z-line. Mutations in its encoding gene have been identified in patients with isolated non-compaction of the left ventricular myocardium, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To explore the role of Cypher in myocardium and to better understand molecular mechanisms by which mutations in cypher cause cardiomyopathy, we utilized a conditional approach to knockout Cypher, specially in either developing or adult myocardium. Cardiac-specific Cypher knockout (CKO) mice developed a severe form of DCM with disrupted cardiomyocyte ultrastructure and decreased cardiac function, which eventually led to death before 23 weeks of age. A similar phenotype was observed in inducible cardiac-specific CKO mice in which Cypher was specifically ablated in adult myocardium. In both cardiac-specific CKO models, ERK and Stat3 signaling pathways were augmented. Finally, we demonstrate the specific binding of Cypher's PDZ domain to the C-terminal region of both calsarcin-1 and myotilin within the Z-line. In conclusion, our studies suggest that (i) Cypher plays a pivotal role in maintaining adult cardiac structure and cardiac function through protein-protein interactions with other Z-line proteins, (ii) myocardial ablation of Cypher results in DCM with premature death and (iii) specific signaling pathways participate in Cypher mutant-mediated dysfunction of the heart, and may in concert facilitate the progression to heart failure.","dc:creator":"Zheng M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Cardiac-specific ablation of Cypher leads to a severe form of dilated cardiomyopathy with premature death."},"rdfs:label":"immunoprecipitation MYOZ2 and MYOT"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a15301dd-df88-4155-b9ab-68f390ebda40","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:109b3f97-4016-438f-a5d9-e839d8ff6122","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The authors used both semi-quantitative RT-PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization to analyze where Cypher is expressed in zebrafish.

Targeted deletion of Cypher in mice is neonatal lethal possibly caused by myopathies. To further investigate the role of cypher in development, we have cloned the zebrafish orthologue. We present here the gene, domain structure, and expression pattern of zebrafish cypher during development. Cypher was not present as a maternal mRNA and was absent during early development. Cypher mRNA was first detected at the 3-somite stage in adaxial somites, and as somites matured, cypher expression gradually enveloped the whole somite. Later, cypher expression was also found in the heart, in head and jaw musculature, and in the brain. We further identified 13 alternative spliced forms of cypher from zebrafish heart and skeletal muscle tissue, among them a very short form containing the PDZ domain but lacking the ZM (ZASP-like) motif and the LIM domains. Targeted gene knock-down experiments using cypher antisense morpholinos led to severe defects, including truncation of the embryo, deformation of somites, dilatation of the pericardium, and thinning of the ventricular wall. The phenotype could be rescued by a cypher form, which contains the PDZ domain and the ZM motif, but lacks all three LIM domains. These findings indicate that a PDZ domain protein is important for normal somite formation and in normal heart development. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with cyclopamine, which disrupts hedgehog signaling, abolished cypher expression in 9 somite and 15-somite stage embryos. Taken together, our data suggest that cypher may play a role downstream of sonic hedgehog, in a late stage of somite development, when slow muscle fibers differentiate and migrate from the adaxial cells.","dc:creator":"van der Meer DL","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Zebrafish cypher is important for somite formation and heart development."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f20cf1a6-baea-4670-97a0-85576c763fc0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2b236491-5122-420e-a84a-33cbcc526fb0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"The authors introduced mutations within the PDZ domain via PCR-based mutagenesis.\n\"Mutant PDZ domains, and a control wild-type PDZ domain were fused to GST, and pull-down assays were performed to evaluate the interaction between mutant PDZ domains and -actinin 2.

To determine the specific role of Cypher isoforms in striated muscle, we generated two mouse lines in which either CypherS or CypherL isoforms were specifically deleted. Mice specifically, deficient in CypherS isoforms had no detectable muscle phenotype. In contrast, selective loss of CypherL isoforms resulted in partial neonatal lethality. Surviving mutants exhibited growth retardation and late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy, which was associated with cardiac fibrosis and calcification, leading to premature adult mortality.

Earlier onset of cardiac dilation relative to control wild-type mice was observed in young CypherL isoform knockout mice consequent to pressure overload, suggesting a greater susceptibility to the disease.

Therefore,  given the limitation with the animal models along with the limited amount of case-level evidence, we have modified the classification to \"Limited.\"","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7756e3c0-5a16-49b8-ac0f-220e79a4fa99"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
