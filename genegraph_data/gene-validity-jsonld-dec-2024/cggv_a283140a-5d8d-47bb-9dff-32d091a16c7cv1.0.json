Autosomal recessive inherited variants in SYNJ1 have previously been associated with two different neurological diseases: a recurrent homozygous missense variant (p.Arg258Gln) that abolishes Sac1 phosphatase activity was identified in three independent families with early onset parkinsonism, whereas a homozygous nonsense variant (p.Arg136*) causing a severe decrease of mRNA transcript was found in a single patient with intractable epilepsy and tau pathology. We performed whole exome or genome sequencing in three independent sib pairs with early onset refractory seizures and progressive neurological decline, and identified novel segregating recessive SYNJ1 defects. A homozygous missense variant resulting in an amino acid substitution (p.Tyr888Cys) was found to impair, but not abolish, the dual phosphatase activity of SYNJ1, whereas three premature stop variants (homozygote p.Trp843* and compound heterozygote p.Gln647Argfs*6/p.Ser1122Thrfs*3) almost completely abolished mRNA transcript production. A genetic follow-up screening in a large cohort of 543 patients with a wide phenotypical range of epilepsies and intellectual disability revealed no additional pathogenic variants, showing that SYNJ1 deficiency is rare and probably linked to a specific phenotype. While variants leading to early onset parkinsonism selectively abolish Sac1 function, our results provide evidence that a critical reduction of the dual phosphatase activity of SYNJ1 underlies a severe disorder with neonatal refractory epilepsy and a neurodegenerative disease course. These findings further expand the clinical spectrum of synaptic dysregulation in patients with severe epilepsy, and emphasize the importance of this biological pathway in seizure pathophysiology.","dc:creator":"Hardies K","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Loss of SYNJ1 dual phosphatase activity leads to early onset refractory seizures and progressive neurological decline."}},{"id":"cggv:36d1b5d0-19a4-4626-a1ae-7ce2fcf410ad_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a9e3fa20-6c99-493e-b312-a25fa17c4ce2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27435091"}],"rdfs:label":"D-1"},{"id":"cggv:36d1b5d0-19a4-4626-a1ae-7ce2fcf410ad","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36d1b5d0-19a4-4626-a1ae-7ce2fcf410ad_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Proteins carrying p.Met1020Ile/p.Tyr1057Ser variants had activity similar to WT."},{"id":"cggv:98d6fd1b-b098-4acd-b291-ac7f598211b0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:98d6fd1b-b098-4acd-b291-ac7f598211b0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"c.3060G>T (p.Met1020Ile) is present in gnomAD (0.07%).

One example of inbred populations is the Arab communities in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In the Palestinian Authority in particular, due to limited access to specialized medical care, most patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis and can therefore neither receive genetic counseling nor possibly specific treatment. We used whole-exome sequencing as a first-line diagnostic tool in 83 Palestinian and Israeli Arab families with suspected neurogenetic disorders and were able to establish a probable genetic diagnosis in 51% of the families (42 families). Pathogenic, likely pathogenic or highly suggestive candidate variants were found in the following genes extending and refining the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of these rare disorders: ACO2, ADAT3, ALS2, AMPD2, APTX, B4GALNT1, CAPN1, CLCN1, CNTNAP1, DNAJC6, GAMT, GPT2, KCNQ2, KIF11, LCA5, MCOLN1, MECP2, MFN2, MTMR2, NT5C2, NTRK1, PEX1, POLR3A, PRICKLE1, PRKN, PRX, SCAPER, SEPSECS, SGCG, SLC25A15, SPG11, SYNJ1, TMCO1, and TSEN54. Further, this cohort has proven to be ideal for prioritization of new disease genes. Two separately published candidate genes (WWOX and PAX7) were identified in this study. Analyzing the runs of homozygosity (ROHs) derived from the Exome sequencing data as a marker for the rate of inbreeding, revealed significantly longer ROHs in the included families compared with a German control cohort. The total length of ROHs correlated with the detection rate of recessive disease-causing variants. Identification of the disease-causing gene led to new therapeutic options in four families.","dc:creator":"Hengel H","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"First-line exome sequencing in Palestinian and Israeli Arabs with neurological disorders is efficient and facilitates disease gene discovery."}},"rdfs:label":"BE09-1"},{"id":"cggv:5e1c64cd-f936-4bdd-8aaf-d7f71e0181ce","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5e1c64cd-f936-4bdd-8aaf-d7f71e0181ce_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b77971de-a141-4e01-81ca-7e127f38a1fa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b77971de-a141-4e01-81ca-7e127f38a1fa","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9896d53d-38a3-4531-a2f9-b761e3045194","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_203446.3(SYNJ1):c.2411G>A (p.Trp804Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16609237"}},"detectionMethod":"Seven variants were homozygous in both affected sisters and an additional three compound heterozygotes were identified .

Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous truncating mutation in Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot experiments demonstrated diminished SYNJ1 messenger RNA and protein. Knockout Synj1(-/-) mice have convulsions and die early in life. More recently, homozygous missense mutations have been reported in 2 families with early-onset parkinsonism and seizures. Our findings broaden the spectrum of disease associated with alteration of SYNJ1 and further implicate defects in synaptic vesicle recycling in the tauopathies.

A polyphosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin 1, was identified as a major presynaptic protein associated with endocytic coated intermediates. We report here that synaptojanin 1-deficient mice exhibit neurological defects and die shortly after birth. In neurons of mutant animals, PI(4,5)P2 levels are increased, and clathrin-coated vesicles accumulate in the cytomatrix-rich area that surrounds the synaptic vesicle cluster in nerve endings. In cell-free assays, reduced phosphoinositide phosphatase activity correlated with increased association of clathrin coats with liposomes. Intracellular recording in hippocampal slices revealed enhanced synaptic depression during prolonged high-frequency stimulation followed by delayed recovery. These results provide genetic evidence for a crucial role of phosphoinositide metabolism in synaptic vesicle recycling.","dc:creator":"Cremona O","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Essential role of phosphoinositide metabolism in synaptic vesicle recycling."},"rdfs:label":"SYNJ1 knockout mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3973,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:9c186dcf-f767-4e96-8c4c-beef2395ea24","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100062","gene":"hgnc:11503","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"SYNJ1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE) in 2015 (Dyment et al. 2015 PMID: 25316601). Besides DEE, SYNJ1 has been associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease, early onset. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in phenotypes of these diseases. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM:617389) and Parkinson disease, early onset (OMIM:615530). The split curation for autosomal recessive Parkinson disease, early onset may be curated by Parkinson disease GCEP. Eight SYNJ1 variants that have been reported in seven probands in five publications have been included in this curation. Typical phenotypes of these probands were neonatal onset seizures, hypotonia, severe to profound global developmental delay, and quadriplegia. Of the seven reported families, five had biallelic loss-of-function variants, and the default point of 1.5 was awarded for each allele, resulting in 15 points. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by an animal model (PMID: 10535736). The SYNJ1 knockout mice with seizures, failure to thrive, and ataxia, which manifest immediately after birth was given 2 points. In summary, SYNJ1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive DEE. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a283140a-5d8d-47bb-9dff-32d091a16c7c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
