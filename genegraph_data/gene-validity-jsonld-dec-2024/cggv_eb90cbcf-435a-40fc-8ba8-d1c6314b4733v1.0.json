Complex I deficiency is the most commonly reported mitochondrial disorder presenting in childhood, but the molecular basis of most cases remains elusive. We describe a patient with complex I deficiency caused by mutation of the molecular chaperone FOXRED1. A combined homozygosity mapping and bioinformatics approach in a consanguineous Iranian-Jewish pedigree led to the identification of a homozygous mutation in FOXRED1 in a child who presented with infantile-onset encephalomyopathy. Silencing of FOXRED1 in human fibroblasts resulted in reduced complex I steady-state levels and activity, while lentiviral-mediated FOXRED1 transgene expression rescued complex I deficiency in the patient fibroblasts. This FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, which has never previously been associated with human disease, is now shown to be a complex I-specific molecular chaperone. The discovery of the c.1054C>T; p.R352W mutation in the FOXRED1 gene is a further contribution towards resolving the complex puzzle of the genetic basis of human mitochondrial disease.","dc:creator":"Fassone E","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"FOXRED1, encoding an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase complex-I-specific molecular chaperone, is mutated in infantile-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb90cbcf-435a-40fc-8ba8-d1c6314b4733_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eb90cbcf-435a-40fc-8ba8-d1c6314b4733_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e35cbde-598d-4046-aa9a-127fae543855","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b2f18a8f-1792-4581-a20b-645ef2cc6134","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"All genes are complex I subunits or assembly factors ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28797839","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial complex I is the primary entry point for electrons into the electron transport chain, required for the bulk of cellular ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. Complex I consists of 45 subunits, which are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Currently, at least 15 assembly factors are known to be required for the complete maturation of complex I. Mutations in the genes encoding subunits and assembly factors lead to complex I deficiency, which can manifest as mitochondrial disease. The current model of complex I assembly suggests that the enzyme is built by the association of a set of smaller intermediate modules containing specific conserved core subunits and additional accessory subunits. Each module must converge in a spatially and temporally orchestrated fashion to allow assembly of the mature holoenzyme to occur. This review outlines the current understanding of complex I biogenesis, with an emphasis on the assembly factors that facilitate the building of this architectural giant.","dc:creator":"Formosa LE","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Building a complex complex: Assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Numerous Complex I subunits and Assembly Factors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes involved in complex I assembly that can cause primary mitochondrial disease "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:eb90cbcf-435a-40fc-8ba8-d1c6314b4733_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9d69dbd-dd75-48a8-9b40-becb9f40ac01","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:35957854-320b-4e2f-863b-bf316a4396b3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Complex I deficiency <25% of control by spectrophotometry","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22200994","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is the most common cause of mitochondrial disease in childhood.

Complex I subunits are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) DNA and their assembly requires a number of additional proteins. FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain-containing protein 1 (FOXRED1) was recently identified as a putative assembly factor and FOXRED1 mutations in patients cause complex I deficiency; however, its role in assembly is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that FOXRED1 is involved in mid-late stages of complex I assembly. In a patient with FOXRED1 mutations, the levels of mature complex I were markedly decreased, and a smaller ∼475 kDa subcomplex was detected. In the absence of FOXRED1, mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits are still translated and transiently assembled into a late stage ∼815 kDa intermediate; but instead of transitioning further to the mature complex I, the intermediate breaks down to an ∼475 kDa complex. As the patient cells contained residual assembled complex I, we disrupted the FOXRED1 gene in HEK293T cells through TALEN-mediated gene editing. Cells lacking FOXRED1 had ∼10% complex I levels, reduced complex I activity, and were unable to grow on galactose media. Interestingly, overexpression of FOXRED1 containing the patient mutations was able to rescue complex I assembly. In addition, FOXRED1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with a number of complex I subunits. Our studies reveal that FOXRED1 is a crucial component in the productive assembly of complex I and that mutations in FOXRED1 leading to partial loss of function cause defects in complex I biogenesis.

We report a strategy of focused candidate gene prediction, high-throughput sequencing and experimental validation to uncover the molecular basis of mitochondrial complex I disorders. We created seven pools of DNA from a cohort of 103 cases and 42 healthy controls and then performed deep sequencing of 103 candidate genes to identify 151 rare variants that were predicted to affect protein function. We established genetic diagnoses in 13 of 60 previously unsolved cases using confirmatory experiments, including cDNA complementation to show that mutations in NUBPL and FOXRED1 can cause complex I deficiency. Our study illustrates how large-scale sequencing, coupled with functional prediction and experimental validation, can be used to identify causal mutations in individual cases.","dc:creator":"Calvo SE","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"High-throughput, pooled sequencing identifies mutations in NUBPL and FOXRED1 in human complex I deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:a93e60e0-1a71-4e51-b0f7-b6859e9942c4_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:20614174-6861-4845-8a62-95b1676e0d05"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20818383"}],"rdfs:label":"Calvo et al 2010 DT22"},{"id":"cggv:78e2c7df-f1df-4f44-9747-f76c2544cf4d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78e2c7df-f1df-4f44-9747-f76c2544cf4d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:78e2c7df-f1df-4f44-9747-f76c2544cf4d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (default rare missense variant)\n0.5 (complex I deficiency 10% in fibroblasts)\n0.5  (specific rescue when complemented with FOXRED1 to WT levels)\n"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.1 (default rare missense variant)\n0.5 (complex I deficiency 10% in fibroblasts)\n0.5  (specific rescue when complemented with FOXRED1 to WT levels)\n"},{"id":"cggv:a93e60e0-1a71-4e51-b0f7-b6859e9942c4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a93e60e0-1a71-4e51-b0f7-b6859e9942c4_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a93e60e0-1a71-4e51-b0f7-b6859e9942c4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"1.5 (default rare null variant\n0.5 (complex I deficiency 10% in fibroblasts)\n0.5  (specific rescue when complemented with FOXRED1 to WT levels)\n"}],"strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"1.5 (default rare null variant\n0.5 (complex I deficiency 10% in fibroblasts)\n0.5  (specific rescue when complemented with FOXRED1 to WT levels)\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:4e8f3b5e-50e8-437c-8409-59409e546275_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e8f3b5e-50e8-437c-8409-59409e546275","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3e1691aa-45c3-412e-98f8-c7aa92a487b0"},"detectionMethod":"mtDNA subunits, 7 structural subunits tested and excluded\n\nHomozygosity mapping which 5 healthy siblings did not share \n\n338 genes identified, only 12 involved in mito fxn, including NDUFV2 (neg.)\n\nHomozygous\nFOXRED1: c.1054C>T;

Other associated features have been reported over time. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *FOXRED1*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *FOXRED1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *FOXRED1* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on October 14, 2019 (SOP v7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique variants (four nonsense and frameshift variants resulting in truncation, four missense variants) in five probands across four publications (PMIDs: 20858599, 20818383, 30723688, 33613441). Features in affected individuals include LSS, cystic leukoencephalopathy, epilepsy, hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, renal tubular acidosis, and optic atrophy. Lactic acidosis is also seen.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function shared with other complex I subunits and assembly factors, functional alteration in patient cells, siRNA knockdown in mouse neurons, and rescue of complex I assembly in HEK293T cells (PMIDs: 25678554, 28797839, 30392038, 22200994). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *FOXRED1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
