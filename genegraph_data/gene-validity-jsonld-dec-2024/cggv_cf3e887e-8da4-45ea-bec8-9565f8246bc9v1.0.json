Recently, ANKRD11 was identified as a gene that is responsible for the disease. In addition, microdeletion of 16q24.3, including ANKRD11, has been reported to result in the KBG syndrome phenotype. Herein, we discuss a Korean family with KBG syndrome, as identified by ANKRD11 gene mutation. The patients included a nine-month-old boy and his 21-month-old sister who failed to thrive and have delayed development. Chromosomal microarray was performed to identify the underlying genetic cause, but the results showed no abnormalities. However, the mother of the children was found to have features similar to her children. Therefore, we strongly suspected an autosomal-dominant inherited disease and performed whole exome sequencing. A mutation of ANKRD11 gene was found in all patients, and the frameshift variant c.2395-2398delAAAG was confirmed. Clinical manifestations of the patients were consistent with KBG syndrome. We reviewed all reported cases with confirmed ANKRD11 mutation or 16q24.3 microdeletion including ANKRD11. As a result, we conclude that severe short stature, intellectual disability, and macrodontia are the main characteristics in KBG syndrome related to ANKRD11 mutation.

We present the largest cohort of KBG syndrome cases confirmed by ANKRD11 variants reported so far, consisting of 20 patients from 13 families. Sixteen patients were molecularly diagnosed by Sanger sequencing of ANKRD11, one familial case and three sporadic patients were diagnosed through whole-exome sequencing and one patient was identified through genomewide array analysis. All patients were evaluated by a clinical geneticist. Detailed orofacial phenotyping, including orthodontic evaluation, intra-oral photographs and orthopantomograms, was performed in 10 patients and revealed besides the hallmark feature of macrodontia of central upper incisors, several additional dental anomalies as oligodontia, talon cusps and macrodontia of other teeth. Three-dimensional (3D) stereophotogrammetry was performed in 14 patients and 3D analysis of patients compared with controls showed consistent facial dysmorphisms comprising a bulbous nasal tip, upturned nose with a broad base and a round or triangular face. Many patients exhibited neurobehavioural problems, such as autism spectrum disorder or hyperactivity. One-third of patients presented with (conductive) hearing loss. Congenital heart defects, velopharyngeal insufficiency and hip anomalies were less frequent. On the basis of our observations, we recommend cardiac assessment in children and regular hearing tests in all individuals with a molecular diagnosis of KBG syndrome.

We describe the clinical manifestations in a male currently 13 years of age, who exhibited symptoms including epilepsy, severe developmental delay, distinct facial features, and hand anomalies, without a positive genetic diagnosis. Subsequent exome sequencing identified a novel de novo heterozygous single base pair duplication (c.6015dupA) in ANKRD11, which was validated by Sanger sequencing.

Before molecular diagnosis, this syndrome was not recognized in the proband, as several key features of the disorder were mild and were not recognized by clinicians, further supporting the concept of variable expressivity in many disorders.

We report a clinical and molecular study of 39 patients affected by KBG syndrome. Among them, 19 were diagnosed after the detection of a 16q24.3 deletion encompassing the ANKRD11 gene by array CGH. In the 20 remaining patients, the clinical suspicion was confirmed by the identification of an ANKRD11 mutation by direct sequencing. We present arguments to modulate the previously reported diagnostic criteria. Macrodontia should no longer be considered a mandatory feature. KBG syndrome is compatible with autonomous life in adulthood. Autism is less frequent than previously reported. We also describe new clinical findings with a potential impact on the follow-up of patients, such as precocious puberty and a case of malignancy. Most deletions remove the 5'end or the entire coding region but never extend toward 16q telomere suggesting that distal 16q deletion could be lethal. Although ANKRD11 appears to be a major gene associated with intellectual disability, KBG syndrome remains under-diagnosed. NGS-based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of point mutations in this gene.

Similar cellular phenotypes and aberrant ASD-like behaviors were observed in Yoda mice carrying a point mutation in the Ankrd11 HDAC-binding domain. Consistent with a role for Ankrd11 in histone acetylation, Ankrd11 was associated with chromatin and colocalized with HDAC3, and expression and histone acetylation of Ankrd11 target genes were altered in Yoda neural precursors. Moreover, the Ankrd11 knockdown-mediated decrease in precursor proliferation was rescued by inhibiting histone acetyltransferase activity or expressing HDAC3. Thus, Ankrd11 is a crucial chromatin regulator that controls histone acetylation and gene expression during neural development, thereby providing a likely explanation for its association with cognitive dysfunction and ASD.","dc:creator":"Gallagher D","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Ankrd11 is a chromatin regulator involved in autism that is essential for neural development."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in developing murine cortex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e4e58f39-882f-430b-8175-50d433476ff5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:853139ce-3c4e-4e03-ba21-32681ab3bbbb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"nonquantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that ANKRD11 is expressed in the adult human brain.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21782149","rdfs:label":"RT-PCR of adult human brain cDNA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not counted because expression was not in a specific cell type."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:cf3e887e-8da4-45ea-bec8-9565f8246bc9_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:12529a3f-487f-4ed0-afdf-caa72930160d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:242f588e-f3d7-411c-aa68-58bdbef2f58b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Knockdown decreased EGFP-positive, Ki67-positive proliferating precursors as well as EGFP-positive, beta III-tubulin-positive newborn neurons.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25556659","rdfs:label":"Knockdown in human forebrain precursors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b74f0f6a-49a6-4f13-8582-35021df2cbc9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5f8393b-1f46-4828-90bf-65407b7527ac","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Ankrd11 knockdown affected neural precursor cell proliferation, which was measured using Ki67 immunoreactivity and immunostaining for BrdU.

As an effort toward identifying novel genes involved in regulation of bone mass, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in mice has been utilized. Here we describe a mouse mutant termed Yoda that was identified in an ENU mutagenesis screen for dominantly acting mutations. Mice heterozygous for the Yoda mutation exhibit craniofacial abnormalities: shortened snouts, wider skulls, and deformed nasal bones, underlined by altered morphology of frontonasal sutures and failure of interfrontal suture to close. A major feature of the mutant is reduced bone mineral density. Homozygosity for the mutation results in embryonic lethality. Positional cloning of the locus identified a missense mutation in a highly conserved region of the ankyrin repeat domain 11 gene (Ankrd11).

KBG syndrome is characterized by phenotypes including neurological involvement, characteristic facial dysmorphisms, macrodontia, short stature, and hand anomalies. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. More than 100 affected individuals have been described in the literature; however, only 9 probands (across 8 publications: 21782149, 25543316, 30088855, 27900361, 27605097, 25424714, 25464108, 28449295) are documented here, as these probands are enough to maximize the genetic evidence score in this rubric. Eight of these probands presented with mild to moderate intellectual disability, two had formal diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, and 1 additional proband displayed autistic behavior. Six probands had developmental delay ranging from mild to severe; however, it is possible that not all patients were evaluated for this phenotype. While the majority of cases of KBG syndrome occur de novo, variants in ANKRD11 segregated with disease in 8 additional individuals in 3 of these families (PMID: 21782149, 25424714, 25464108). The proposed mechanism of disease is dominant-negative (Walz et al. 2015, PMID: 25413698). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, ANKRD11 is definitely associated with autosomal dominant KBG syndrome.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cf3e887e-8da4-45ea-bec8-9565f8246bc9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
