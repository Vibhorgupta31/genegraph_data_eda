This disorder is due to a signal transmission defect from rod photoreceptors to adjacent bipolar cells in the retina. Two forms can be distinguished clinically, complete CSNB (cCSNB) or incomplete CSNB; the two forms are distinguished on the basis of the affected signaling pathway. Mutations in NYX, GRM6, and TRPM1, expressed in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) lead to disruption of the ON-bipolar cell response and have been seen in patients with cCSNB. Whole-exome sequencing in cCSNB patients lacking mutations in the known genes led to the identification of a homozygous missense mutation (c.1807C>T [p.His603Tyr]) in one consanguineous autosomal-recessive cCSNB family and a homozygous frameshift mutation in GPR179 (c.278delC [p.Pro93Glnfs(∗)57]) in a simplex male cCSNB patient. Additional screening with Sanger sequencing of 40 patients identified three other cCSNB patients harboring additional allelic mutations in GPR179. Although, immunhistological studies revealed Gpr179 in the OPL in wild-type mouse retina, Gpr179 did not colocalize with specific ON-bipolar markers. Interestingly, Gpr179 was highly concentrated in horizontal cells and Müller cell endfeet. The involvement of these cells in cCSNB and the specific function of GPR179 remain to be elucidated.","dc:creator":"Audo I","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing identifies mutations in GPR179 leading to autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16229975","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Glutamate receptors (also known as clan C) are one of the main groups of GPCRs with many subgroup linked through complex evolutionary relationships. We performed thorough searches for genes coding for proteins belonging to this family in the human, mouse, Fugu, and zebrafish genomes, as well as in four invertebrate species. We assembled over 70 new full-length sequences from protein predictions excluding pseudogenes. This resulted in a total of 22 full-length sequences from the human genome, 79 from the mouse genome, 30 from the Fugu genome, and 32 from the zebrafish genome (pseudogenes are not included in these numbers). We show that the vertebrate Glutamate GPCRs form four main phylogenetic groups with a total of eight subgroups (Group I: V2R, TAS1R, GPRC6A, and CASR, Group II: GRM, Group III: GABA together with previously unpublished GPR158 and GPR158L and Group IV: GPRC5). All eight receptor subgroups are present both in mammals and fish, except for GPRC5 and GPR158. The pheromone (V2R), GPRC6, and sweet taste (TAS1) receptors were not found in invertebrates while GRM, GABA, and CASR were found in both C. elegans and C. intestinalis. The pheromone receptors are found in high numbers in mouse, zebrafish and Fugu but are only found as pseudogenes in the human genome.

congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of retinal disorders characterized by nonprogressive impairment of night vision, absence of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave, and variable degrees of involvement of other visual functions. We report here that mutations in GPR179, encoding an orphan G protein receptor, underlie a form of autosomal-recessive cCSNB. The Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mouse model was initially discovered by the absence of the ERG b-wave, a component that reflects depolarizing bipolar cell (DBC) function. We performed genetic mapping, followed by next-generation sequencing of the critical region and detected a large transposon-like DNA insertion in Gpr179. The involvement of GPR179 in DBC function was confirmed in zebrafish and humans. Functional knockdown of gpr179 in zebrafish led to a marked reduction in the amplitude of the ERG b-wave. Candidate gene analysis of GPR179 in DNA extracted from patients with cCSNB identified GPR179-inactivating mutations in two patients. We developed an antibody against mouse GPR179, which robustly labeled DBC dendritic terminals in wild-type mice. This labeling colocalized with the expression of GRM6 and was absent in Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that GPR179 plays a critical role in DBC signal transduction and expands our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate normal rod vision.","dc:creator":"Peachey NS","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"GPR179 is required for depolarizing bipolar cell function and is mutated in autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness."}},{"id":"cggv:929b172c-dc85-4835-bb27-a48db14c9a37_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:21010794-3db0-4255-9502-b95269c57c34"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22325362"}],"rdfs:label":"FM2"},{"id":"cggv:f9732d30-72e8-4b51-8c42-30872601644f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9732d30-72e8-4b51-8c42-30872601644f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:929b172c-dc85-4835-bb27-a48db14c9a37","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:929b172c-dc85-4835-bb27-a48db14c9a37_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:95297f51-f50a-42c1-be3a-edb0af693cb3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95297f51-f50a-42c1-be3a-edb0af693cb3","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:8fd4d90e-1c4e-47fa-b479-4e5d6ca78bd8"},{"id":"cggv:443b6085-c984-4910-b362-4a984da12155","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001004334.4(GPR179):c.187del (p.Leu63fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129755"}}],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:e988e90d-60d4-4d31-a3d5-62e725b7007f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8fd4d90e-1c4e-47fa-b479-4e5d6ca78bd8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22325362"},{"id":"cggv:f6e12d3f-3232-4855-b0fc-be849ef85796_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:443b6085-c984-4910-b362-4a984da12155"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22325362"}],"rdfs:label":"FM1"},{"id":"cggv:e988e90d-60d4-4d31-a3d5-62e725b7007f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e988e90d-60d4-4d31-a3d5-62e725b7007f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:f6e12d3f-3232-4855-b0fc-be849ef85796","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6e12d3f-3232-4855-b0fc-be849ef85796_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:24ba1de9-6261-4882-b3c4-65bc46d161c7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:24ba1de9-6261-4882-b3c4-65bc46d161c7","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9685a13f-64d1-491b-9b8c-27bf8fc43276","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001004334.4(GPR179):c.1364G>A (p.Gly455Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA219862"}},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:2c340da9-ae88-4876-b467-e7757b11da41_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9685a13f-64d1-491b-9b8c-27bf8fc43276"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22325361"},"rdfs:label":"7699"},{"id":"cggv:2c340da9-ae88-4876-b467-e7757b11da41","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2c340da9-ae88-4876-b467-e7757b11da41_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9.6},{"id":"cggv:53ab184d-9f73-42b6-b407-7d72f7b44c8a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:53ab184d-9f73-42b6-b407-7d72f7b44c8a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd88de3a-4ad9-437c-99ea-d4624c031d72","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9ea5fd1-d9ee-4c86-9149-162c3dd324bc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"GPR179 is localized in the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells in whole human retina.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *GPR179* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *GPR179*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800396). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. In summary, *GPR179* is definitively associated with GPR179-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800396). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification has been approved by the Retina GCEP on June 2nd, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:53ab184d-9f73-42b6-b407-7d72f7b44c8a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
