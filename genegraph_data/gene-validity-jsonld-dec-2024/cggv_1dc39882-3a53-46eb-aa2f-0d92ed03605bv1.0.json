Recently, we have shown that acetylation of TBX5 potentiates its activity and is important for heart and limb development. Here we report that class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5 associate with TBX5 and repress its role in cardiac gene transcription. Both HDAC4 and HDAC5 deacetylate TBX5, which promotes its relocation to the cytoplasm and HDAC4 antagonizes the physical association and functional cooperation between TBX5 and MEF2C. We also show that protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) relieves the HDAC4/5-mediated repression of TBX5. Thus, this study reveals a novel interaction of HDAC4/5 and PRKD1 in the regulation of TBX5 transcriptional activity.","dc:creator":"Ghosh TK","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"HDAC4 and 5 repression of TBX5 is relieved by protein kinase D1."},"rdfs:label":"Ghosh Western Blot"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6814fd44-99ae-49e8-ab66-3130f9e2a39a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5a800356-32a6-425e-8030-cbe1c4a26044","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"Luciferase-reporter assay shows that PRKD1 relieves repression of TBX5, the MYH6 promoter.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31784580","rdfs:label":"Ghosh TBX5 protein interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:1dc39882-3a53-46eb-aa2f-0d92ed03605b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.6}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":8859,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":1.6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b8783439-a834-4adf-ad69-fbf347cc9998","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:9407","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*PRKD1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2021 (Reuter et al. 2016, PMID: 34328347). Two variants (frameshift) that have been reported in 2 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 34328347, 36478645) are included in this curation. The split curation for autosomal recessive congenital heart disease has been curated separately. There are more variants reported in individuals with CHD in 16 publications, all of which were not scored due to a, a high minor allele frequency (>0.00001) in gnomAD v.4, inheritance from unaffected parents, the variant being a copy number variant containing additional genomic material, the proband having additional variants in genes associated with congenital heart disease, and/or the proband having a syndromic phenotype (PMID: 25713110, 27479907, 28991257, 31453292, 31130284, 30149741, 33131162, 32817298, 33919081, 32368696, 34328347, 36308391, 34983622, 35885997, 37035742, 36568277). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be unclear. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data in mouse embryos and protein interaction data (PMID: 31784580). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between* PRKD1 *and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
