More than 3500 monogenic diseases have been characterized, but clinical testing is available for only some of them and many feature clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Hence, an immense unmet need exists for improved molecular diagnosis in infants. Because disease progression is extremely rapid, albeit heterogeneous, in newborns, molecular diagnoses must occur quickly to be relevant for clinical decision-making. We describe 50-hour differential diagnosis of genetic disorders by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) that features automated bioinformatic analysis and is intended to be a prototype for use in neonatal intensive care units. Retrospective 50-hour WGS identified known molecular diagnoses in two children. Prospective WGS disclosed potential molecular diagnosis of a severe GJB2-related skin disease in one neonate; BRAT1-related lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome in another infant; identified BCL9L as a novel, recessive visceral heterotaxy gene (HTX6) in a pedigree; and ruled out known candidate genes in one infant. Sequencing of parents or affected siblings expedited the identification of disease genes in prospective cases. Thus, rapid WGS can potentially broaden and foreshorten differential diagnosis, resulting in fewer empirical treatments and faster progression to genetic and prognostic counseling.","dc:creator":"Saunders CJ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Rapid whole-genome sequencing for genetic disease diagnosis in neonatal intensive care units."}},"rdfs:label":"CMH172"},{"id":"cggv:1fd26b22-2d87-49fa-b399-cca7db26f7fe","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1fd26b22-2d87-49fa-b399-cca7db26f7fe_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:aae9882d-f2c2-44c9-9722-027d3b2d8275_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aae9882d-f2c2-44c9-9722-027d3b2d8275","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:37fb3f10-75c5-4cbb-b90d-48d5e05dfe01","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152743.4(BRAT1):c.962_963del (p.Leu321fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA185865"}},{"id":"cggv:60e5fec8-d398-4744-bf7f-f9130d940ac6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152743.4(BRAT1):c.176T>C (p.Leu59Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA185863"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012448","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0001276","obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0002123","obo:HP_0002266","obo:HP_0001776"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:35605fac-af03-4e76-8ed0-4c0eb73ee2a1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:60e5fec8-d398-4744-bf7f-f9130d940ac6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25319849","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Homozygous frameshift BRAT1 mutations were found in patients with lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome (MIM# 614498). Here, we report on two siblings with compound heterozygous mutations in BRAT1. They had intractable seizures from neonatal period, dysmorphic features and hypertonia. Progressive microcephaly was also observed. Initial electroencephalogram showed a suppression-burst pattern, leading to a diagnosis of Ohtahara syndrome. They both died from pneumonia at 1 year and 3 months, respectively. Whole-exome sequencing of one patient revealed a compound heterozygous BRAT1 mutations (c.176T>C (p.Leu59Pro) and c.962_963del (p.Leu321Profs*81)). We are unable to obtain DNA from another patient. The p.Leu59Pro mutation occurred at an evolutionarily conserved amino acid in a CIDE-N (N-terminal of an cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector) domain, which has a regulatory role in the DNA fragmentation pathway of apoptosis.

For some, uninformative mapping or large gene lists preclude disease-gene identification by Sanger sequencing. Seven such conditions were selected for exome sequencing at the Broad Institute; all had been previously mapped at the CSC using low density SNP microarrays coupled with autozygosity and linkage analyses. Using between 1 and 5 patient samples per disorder, we identified sequence variants in the known disease-causing genes SLC6A3 and FLVCR1, and present evidence to strongly support the pathogenicity of variants identified in TUBGCP6, BRAT1, SNIP1, CRADD, and HARS.

A severe form of this phenotype associated with BRAT1 is characterized by neonatal-onset encephalopathy with rigidity and seizures (also reported in the literature as lethal neonatal spasticity-epileptic encephalopathy syndrome). For this phenotype, onset of symptoms is very early, usually within the first days or weeks of life, has a much more severe presentation, and often results in early death. The unusual feature of increased muscle tone in the form of rigidity sets this condition apart from other early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, Another form associated with milder phenotypes (BRAT1/neurodevelopmental disorder with cerebellar atrophy with or without seizures) has been assessed separately.\n\nLoss of function variants have been commonly reported in association with disease, however missense, inframe deletions, multi exonic deletions and at least 1 silent variant (which is suspected to result in improper splicing) have also been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 22279524, 23035047, 25319849, 3168474, 33816000). Evidence supporting this gene disease pair includes experimental data as well. Supporting experimental data has demonstrated that variants in this gene result in a failure of the protein to localize to the nucleus (PMID: 22279524). \n\nAt the time of this review, no difference in variant type has been noted between the phenotypes of this gene. In addition, the same variant has been identified in both the severe and attenuated forms of this disease. In all instances the identified variants were either homozygous or compound heterozygous supporting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. BRAT1 is definitively associated with neonatal-onset encephalopathy with rigidity and seizures. This has been demonstrated in the clinical and research settings and this evidence has been maintained over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 4/19/22 (SOP version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:698a4cb3-df52-432b-9d3e-d3d76111db25"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
