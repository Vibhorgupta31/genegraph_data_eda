However, the specific receptors mediating responses to BMPs in human vascular cells are not known. We show that human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) express high specific (125)I-BMP4 binding, whereas human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) exhibit low binding. BMP4 competes for both high- and low-affinity (125)I-BMP4 binding sites on HPASMCs, yet BMP2 competes only at the low-affinity binding sites. In addition, BMP4, but not BMP2, induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation at low concentrations in HPASMCs. Conversely, HMEC-1 cells exhibited a single binding site population with equal affinity for BMP2 and BMP4. In both cell types, growth differentiation factor-5 (GDF5), BMP6, and BMP7 stimulated Smad1/5 phosphorylation and competed for (125)I-BMP4 less efficiently than BMP2 or BMP4. HPAECs exhibited weak Smad responses to BMPs. Expression analysis suggested the low binding in endothelial cells corresponded to lower ALK3 and ALK6 expression. Although transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for ALK3 and BMPR-II abrogated Smad1/5 phosphorylation to BMP4, BMP2, and GDF5 in HMEC-1 and HPASMCs, they had little effect on (125)I-BMP4 binding. ALK6 siRNA did not alter binding or Smad1/5 responses, even to GDF5, a reported ALK6 selective ligand. Therefore, ALK3/BMPR-II is the BMP4/BMP2/GDF5-responsive receptor in human vascular cells, but these studies suggest that a BMP4/GDF5 selective binding protein exists in HPASMCs. These cell-specific differences in BMP responses are important for understanding the pathogenesis of FPAH.","dc:creator":"Upton PD","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Functional characterization of bone morphogenetic protein binding sites and Smad1/5 activation in human vascular cells."},"rdfs:label":"Upton Expression of BMPR1B"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9f333c37-2f14-402c-a785-5b8393395b86","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:81f304d0-dc7c-48dc-913c-76f1a0b8ce95","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"The interaction between BMPR1B and BMPR2 has been well characterized.

BMP-2 signals via two types of receptors (BRI and BRII) that are expressed at the cell surface as homomeric as well as heteromeric complexes. Prior to ligand binding, a low but measurable level of BMP-receptors is found in preformed hetero-oligomeric complexes. The major fraction of the receptors is recruited into hetero-oligomeric complexes only after ligand addition. For this, BMP-2 binds first to the high affinity receptor BRI and then recruits BRII into the signaling complex. However, ligand binding to the preformed complex composed of BRII and BRI is still required for signaling, suggesting that it may mediate activating conformational changes. Using several approaches we have addressed the following questions: (i) Are preformed complexes incompetent of signaling in the absence of BMP-2? (ii) Which domains of the BRII receptors are essential for this complex formation? (iii) Are there differences in signals sent from BMP-induced versus preformed receptor complexes? By measuring the activation of Smads, of p38 MAPK and of alkaline phosphatase, we show that the ability of kinase-deficient BRII receptor mutants to inhibit BMP signaling depends on their ability to form heteromeric complexes with BRI. Importantly, a BRII mutant that is incapable in forming preassembled receptor complexes but recruits into a BMP-induced receptor complex does not interfere with the Smad pathway but does inhibit the induction of alkaline phosphatase as well as p38 phosphorylation. These results indicate that signals induced by binding of BMP-2 to preformed receptor complexes activate the Smad pathway, whereas BMP-2-induced recruitment of receptors activates a different, Smad-independent pathway resulting in the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity via p38 MAPK.","dc:creator":"Nohe A","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The mode of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor oligomerization determines different BMP-2 signaling pathways."},"rdfs:label":"Nohe interaction between BMPR1B and BMPR2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The interaction between BMPR1B and BMPR2 has been well characterized by multiple research papers, demonstrating that BMPR2 activity is mediated through BMPR1B phosphorylation.
