Dynamin-like protein-1 (DRP-1), encoded by DNM1L, is an evolutionarily conserved GTPase that mediates mitochondrial fission by surrounding the scission site in concentric ring-like structures via self-oligomerization, followed by GTPase-dependant constriction. Here, we describe the clinical characteristics and cellular phenotype of a patient with severe neurological dysfunction, possessing a homozygous DNM1L variant c.305C>T (p.T115M) in the GTPase domain. For comparative analysis, we also describe a previously identified heterozygous variant demonstrating a rapidly fatal neurocognitive phenotype (c.261dup/c.385:386del, p.W88M*9/E129K*6). Using patient-generated fibroblasts, we demonstrated both DNM1L variants undergo adverse alterations to mitochondrial structure and function, including impaired mitochondrial fission, reduced membrane potential, and lower oxidative capacity including an increased cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and dsDNA breaks. Mutation of DNM1L was also associated with impaired responses to oxidative stress, as treatment with hydrogen peroxide dramatically increased cellular ROS, with minimal exacerbation of already impaired mitochondrial function. Taken together, our observations indicate that homozygous p.T115M variant of DNM1L produces a neurological and neurodevelopmental phenotype, consistent with impaired mitochondrial architecture and function, through a diminished ability to oligomerize, which was most prevalent under oxidative stress.","dc:creator":"Hogarth KA","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"DNM1L Variant Alters Baseline Mitochondrial Function and Response to Stress in a Patient with Severe Neurological Dysfunction."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29110115","rdfs:label":"Hogarth 2018 Case report"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"DNML1 forms multimers; whole cell lysates from patient fibroblasts, by western blot, showed increased levels of monomeric DRP-1(DNML1) compared to the oligomerized form.

For each antibody, altogether 708 spots of tissues and cells are analysed and the resulting images and data are presented as freely available in the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org). The new version 4 of the atlas, including more than 5 million images of immunohistochemically stained tissues and cells, is based on 6122 antibodies, representing 5011 human proteins encoded by approximately 25% of the human genome. The gene-centric database includes a putative classification of proteins in various protein classes, both functional classes, such as kinases or transcription factors and project-related classes, such as candidate genes for cancer or cardiovascular diseases. For each of the internally generated antibodies, the exact antigen sequence is presented, together with a visualization of application-specific validation data, including a protein array assay, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and, in most cases, immunofluorescent-based confocal microscopy. The updated version also includes new search algorithms to allow complex queries regarding expression profiles, protein classes and chromosome location.

These processes are essential to maintain the normal mitochondrial morphology, distribution, and function. Mitochondrial fusion allows the exchange of intramitochondrial material, whereas the fission process is required to replicate the mitochondria during cell division, facilitate the transport and distribution of mitochondria, and allow the isolation of damaged organelles. Mitochondrial mobility is essential for mitochondrial distribution depending on the cellular metabolic demands. Mitophagy is needed for the elimination of dysfunctional and damaged mitochondria to maintain a healthy mitochondrial population. The mitochondrial dynamic processes are mediated by a number of nuclear-encoded proteins that function in mitochondrial transport, fusion, fission, and mitophagy. Disorders of mitochondrial dynamics are caused by pathogenic variants in the genes encoding these proteins. These diseases have a high clinical variability, and range in severity from isolated optic atrophy to lethal encephalopathy. These disorders include defects in mitochondrial fusion (caused by pathogenic variants in MFN2, OPA1, YME1L1, MSTO1, and FBXL4), mitochondrial fission (caused by pathogenic variants in DNM1L and MFF), and mitochondrial autophagy (caused by pathogenic variants in PINK1 and PRKN).

The DNM1L gene encodes Dynamin 1-like protein, a member of the dynamin superfamily of GTPases. This protein mediates mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission. Defects in DNM1L lead to impaired mitochondrial fission and therefore impaired mitochondrial replication, distribution, transport, and dynamics. DNM1L also has a role in peroxisomal fission.\n\nThe DNM1L gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2018 (PMID: 29110115).  This gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant Leigh syndrome spectrum (please see separate curation), as well as other non-Leigh syndrome spectrum phenotypes such as optic atrophy and neonatal or infantile-onset encephalopathy. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 29110115). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is suspected to be the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, and animal models (PMIDs: 30361041, 18853439, 19578372).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
