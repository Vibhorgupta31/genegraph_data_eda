More than 80% of mutant alleles consist of three mutations, that is, two splice-site alterations and one missense mutation, c.992C>A, which translates to p.H331P. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of CYP4 family members in human tissues and conducted functional studies with the wild-type and p.H331P enzymes, to elucidate the link between CYP4V2 activity and BCD. Expression analysis of 17 CYP1 to CYP4 genes showed CYP4V2 to be a major cytochrome P450 in ARPE-19 cells (a human cell line spontaneously generated from normal human retinal pigmented epithelium) and the only detectable CYP4 transcript. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that CYP4V2 protein was present in epithelial cells of the retina and cornea and the enzyme was localized to endoplasmic reticulum. Recombinant reconstituted CYP4V2 protein metabolized eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (an important constituent of the retina) to their respective ω-hydroxylated products at rates similar to those observed with purified CYP4F2, which is an established hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) hydroxylase. The disease-associated p.H331P variant was undetectable in Western blot analyses of HepG2 cells stably transduced with lentiviral expression vectors. Finally, overexpression of functional CYP4V2 in HepG2 cells altered lipid homeostasis. We demonstrated that CYP4V2 protein is expressed at high levels in ocular target tissues of BCD, that the enzyme is metabolically active toward PUFAs, and that the functional deficit among patients with BCD who carry the H331P variant is most likely a consequence of the instability of the mutant protein.","dc:creator":"Nakano M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"CYP4V2 in Bietti's crystalline dystrophy: ocular localization, metabolism of ω-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, and functional deficit of the p.H331P variant."},"rdfs:label":"functional studies of p.H331P "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:da577a4b-5c65-43fa-9a03-b275eaacb6eb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da32a83f-ce82-4db8-a456-a82b0e1b87a4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34e9e523-8019-43cc-a484-bb77b3ecb13f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Sparse crystals noted on retinal exam and the crystalline pattern became stark and approached confluence over time.

Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy (BCD) is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder characterized by the presence of multiple shimmering yellow-white deposits in the posterior pole of the retina in association with atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and chorioretinal atrophy (Garcia-Garcia et al, 2019, PMID PMID: 31440027). Over 60 variants in CTP4V2 in patients with BCD have been reported (Ng et al, 2016, PMID 27228076; Garcia-Garvia et al, 2019, PMID PMID: 31440027). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. This curation includes six variants (nonsense, missense, small deletion) in 44 probands from 3 publications (Lin et al, 2005, PMID 15937078; Xie et al, 2020, PMID 33306817; Murakami et al, 2021, PMID 33636399). One of these variants curated, c.802-8_810delinsGC, is the most common variant in East Asian individuals with BCD. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by RT-PCR data showing highest expression in retina (Li et al, 2004; PMID 150425130), functional studies of CYP4V2 variants (Nakano et al, 2012, PMID 22772592; Hata et al, 2018, PMID 29581279) and the features noted in a knockout mouse model (Lockhart et al, 2014, PMID 25118264). \nIn summary, CYP4V2 is definitively associated with Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 1st, 2021.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:da577a4b-5c65-43fa-9a03-b275eaacb6eb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
