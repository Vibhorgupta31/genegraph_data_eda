AGC2 deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with two age related phenotypes: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD, OMIM#605814) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2, OMIM#603471). NICCD arises within the first few weeks of life resulting in prolonged cholestasis and metabolic abnormalities including aminoacidemia and galactosuria. Usually symptoms disappear within the first year of life, thus making a diagnosis difficult after this time. In this study we report a new Caucasian case of NICCD, a seven week old Romanian boy with prolonged jaundice. Sequencing of the AGC2 gene showed a novel homozygous missense double-nucleotide (doublet) mutation, which produces the change of the glycine at position 437 into glutamate. Functional studies, carried out on the recombinant mutant protein, for the first time demonstrated, that NICCD is caused by a reduced transport activity of AGC2. The presence of AGC2 deficiency in other ethnic groups besides Asian population suggests further consideration for NICCD diagnosis of any neonate with an unexplained cholestasis; a prompt diagnosis is crucial to resolve the metabolic decompensation with an appropriate dietary treatment.","dc:creator":"Fiermonte G","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A new Caucasian case of neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD): a clinical, molecular, and functional study."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21914561","rdfs:label":"Case 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The score was increased because deleterious nature of the missense variant was confirmed by functional testing of recombinant mutant protein.\n"},{"id":"cggv:d274c3bd-44dd-49f0-a890-221df58fc64a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b705e9ac-9091-4ab3-819e-52e69654be3d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Genotyping method was neither described nor cited.","phenotypeFreeText":"Hypoproteinemia (total protein 3.7 g/dL and albu- min 2.0 g/dL).

A key diagnostic feature has been the deficient argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) activity (E.C. 6.3.4.5) in liver, with normal activity in skin fibroblasts. In this series we describe the clinical presentation of 10 patients referred to our laboratories for sequence analysis of the SCL25A13 gene, including several patients who presented with elevated citrulline on newborn screening. In addition to sequence analysis performed on all patients, ASS enzyme activity, citrulline incorporation and Western blot analysis for ASS and citrin were performed on skin fibroblasts if available. We have found 5 unreported mutations including two apparent founder mutations in three unrelated French-Canadian patients. In marked contrast to previous cases, these patients have a markedly reduced ASS activity in skin fibroblasts. The presence of citrin protein on Western blot in three of our cases reduces the sensitivity of a screening test based on protein immunoblotting. The finding of citrin mutations in patients of Arabic, Pakistani, French Canadian and Northern European origins supports the concept that citrin deficiency is a panethnic disease.","dc:creator":"Dimmock D","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Citrin deficiency, a perplexing global disorder."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19036621","rdfs:label":"Case 5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5be28a1c-ecce-477d-b163-058a83010fae_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64848329-2364-471d-b4c9-b17eaf78e9e3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":132,"detectionMethod":"Reverse transcription of hepatic mRNA followed by PCR across exons 6 and 7, AluI digestion of the amplicon and electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gel was used to detect c.674C>A (p.Ser225Ter) variant.

Adult-onset type II citrullinaemia (CTLN2) is characterized by a liver-specific ASS deficiency with no abnormalities in hepatic ASS mRNA or the gene ASS (refs 1-17). CTLN2 patients (1/100,000 in Japan) suffer from a disturbance of consciousness and coma, and most die with cerebral edema within a few years of onset. CTLN2 differs from classical citrullinaemia (CTLN1, OMIM 215700) in that CTLN1 is neonatal or infantile in onset, with ASS enzyme defects (in all tissues) arising due to mutations in ASS on chromosome 9q34 (refs 18-21). We collected 118 CTLN2 families, and localized the CTLN2 locus to chromosome 7q21.3 by homozygosity mapping analysis of individuals from 18 consanguineous unions. Using positional cloning we identified a novel gene, SLC25A13, and found five different DNA sequence alterations that account for mutations in all consanguineous patients examined. SLC25A13 encodes a 3.4-kb transcript expressed most abundantly in liver. The protein encoded by SLC25A13, named citrin, is bipartite in structure, containing a mitochondrial carrier motif and four EF-hand domains, suggesting it is a calcium-dependent mitochondrial solute transporter with a role in urea cycle function.","dc:creator":"Kobayashi K","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"The gene mutated in adult-onset type II citrullinaemia encodes a putative mitochondrial carrier protein."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10369257","rdfs:label":"AP-45"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Points decreased because clinical phenotype was not provided"},{"id":"cggv:49b88535-55e8-4e5d-b171-82cca24cbe35_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04000977-df5c-4eae-a067-34bd09bc17f2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":33,"detectionMethod":"Reverse transcription of hepatic mRNA, PCR across exons 8 and 9 and electrophoresis on 4% agarose gel","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Plasma cItrulline 298 nmol/ml (36±7); Plasma arginine 138 nmol/ml (118±24).

Both proteins and their C-terminal domains were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, reconstituted into liposomes and shown to catalyze the electrogenic exchange of aspartate for glutamate and a H(+). Overexpression of the carriers in transfected human cells increased the activity of the malate/aspartate NADH shuttle. These results demonstrate that citrin and aralar1 are isoforms of the hitherto unidentified aspartate/glutamate carrier and explain why mutations in citrin cause type II citrullinemia in humans. The activity of citrin and aralar1 as aspartate/glutamate exchangers was stimulated by Ca(2+) on the external side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the Ca(2+)-binding domains of these proteins are localized.

Aralar2 is identical to citrin, the product of the gene mutated in type-II citrullinaemia [Kobayashi, Sinasac, Iijima, Boright, Begum, Lee, Yasuda, Ikeda, Hirano, Terazono et al. (1999) Nat.

The N-terminal half of Aralar2/citrin is able to bind calcium and this requires the presence of the two most distal EF-hands. The localization of Aralar2/citrin expressed in human cell lines is mitochondrial, the C-terminal half containing sufficient information for import and assembly into mitochondria. The C-terminal half of Aralar proteins is related to the yeast YPR020c gene, with a very high sequence conservation (54.3% identity), suggesting that these proteins play an important role. Thus Aralar proteins are probably expressed in all tissues in an isoform-specific fashion, where they function as calcium-regulated metabolite (possibly anionic) carriers.","dc:creator":"Del Arco A","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Characterization of a second member of the subfamily of calcium-binding mitochondrial carriers expressed in human non-excitable tissues."},"rdfs:label":"Calcium binding and subcellular localization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1d58943d-26ba-4b49-931e-41a375698b2f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16650f92-75bb-4841-934e-614e8d8d3915","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Failure to transport aspartate from mitochondria into cytoplasm deprives ASS of its substrate and causes accumulation of citrulline","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11566871","rdfs:label":"Subcellular localization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:bc373b9e-ec5e-4471-92a1-bbdd9aa3378c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d6a7b809-bc96-4a18-b2a2-791b36a72779","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bf453a44-2540-4e9d-838f-c55dc3421037","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Isolated and reverse transcribed mRNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes from the proband and his parents.

The absence of citrin leads to a liver-specific, quantitative decrease of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), causing hyperammonemia and citrullinemia. To investigate the physiological role of citrin and the development of CTLN2, an Slc25a13-knockout (also known as Ctrn-deficient) mouse model was created. The resulting Ctrn-/- mice were devoid of Slc25a13 mRNA and citrin protein. Liver mitochondrial assays revealed markedly decreased activities in aspartate transport and the malate-aspartate shuttle. Liver perfusion also demonstrated deficits in ureogenesis from ammonia, gluconeogenesis from lactate, and an increase in the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio within hepatocytes. Surprisingly, Ctrn-/- mice up to 1 year of age failed to show CTLN2-like symptoms due to normal hepatic ASS activity. Serological measures of glucose, amino acid, and ammonia metabolism also showed no significant alterations. Nitrogen-loading treatments produced only minor changes in the hepatic ammonia and amino acid levels. These results suggest that citrin deficiency alone may not be sufficient to produce a CTLN2-like phenotype in mice.

At least 10 unique variants, most of which are null or missense, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands with citrullinemia type 2 in 4 publications (PMIDs: 18367750, 10369257, 19036621, 18392553) as well as in 4 publication describing at least 5 probands with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (PMIDs: 21914561, 11343052, 11343053, 31607264). At least one proband with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis developed citrullinemia type 2 later in life (Tomomasa et al. PMID 11343053). All of these probands share the common biochemical abnormality of elevated plasma citrulline. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with significantly reduced or absent glutamate transport into and aspartate transport out of mitochondria which deprives argininosuccinate synthetase of a substrate leading to accumulation of citrulline and ammonia. This gene-disease association is also supported by the protein's biological function and functional studies recombinant proteins and complementation studies in yeast which demonstrated that mutant proteins have significantly impacted carrier activity when compared to the wild-type. In summary, SLC25A13/citrin is definitively associated with autosomal recessive citrullinemia type 2.
