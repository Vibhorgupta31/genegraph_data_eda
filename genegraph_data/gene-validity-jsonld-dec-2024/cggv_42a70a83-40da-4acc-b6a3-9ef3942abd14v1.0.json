Recessive mutations in GPT2 have been recently identified in a new syndrome involving intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), postnatal microcephaly, and spastic paraplegia. We have identified additional families with recessive GPT2 mutations and expanded the phenotype to include small stature. GPT2 loss-of-function mutations were identified in four families, nine patients total, including: a homozygous mutation in one child [c.775T>C (p.C259R)]; compound heterozygous mutations in two siblings [c.812A>C (p.N271T)/c.1432_1433delGT (p.V478Rfs*73)]; a novel homozygous, putative splicing mutation [c.1035C>T (p.G345=)]; and finally, a recurrent mutation, previously identified in a distinct family [c.1210C>T (p.R404*)]. All patients were diagnosed with IDD. A majority of patients had remarkably small stature throughout development, many < 1st percentile for height and weight. Given the potential biological function of GPT2 in cellular growth, this phenotype is strongly suggestive of a newly identified clinical susceptibility. Further, homozygous GPT2 mutations manifested in at least 2 of 176 families with IDD (approximately 1.1%) in a Pakistani cohort, thereby representing a relatively common cause of recessive IDD in this population, with recurrence of the p.R404* mutation in this population.

We report autosomal recessive mutations in the enzyme glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in large kindreds initially ascertained for intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). GPT2 [also known as alanine transaminase 2 (ALT2)] is one of two related transaminases that catalyze the reversible addition of an amino group from glutamate to pyruvate, yielding alanine and α-ketoglutarate. In addition to IDD, all affected individuals show postnatal microcephaly and ∼80% of those followed over time show progressive motor symptoms, a spastic paraplegia. Homozygous nonsense p.Arg404* and missense p.Pro272Leu mutations are shown biochemically to be loss of function. The GPT2 gene demonstrates increasing expression in brain in the early postnatal period, and GPT2 protein localizes to mitochondria. Akin to the human phenotype, Gpt2-null mice exhibit reduced brain growth. Through metabolomics and direct isotope tracing experiments, we find a number of metabolic abnormalities associated with loss of Gpt2. These include defects in amino acid metabolism such as low alanine levels and elevated essential amino acids. Also, we find defects in anaplerosis, the metabolic process involved in replenishing TCA cycle intermediates. Finally, mutant brains demonstrate misregulated metabolites in pathways implicated in neuroprotective mechanisms previously associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Overall, our data reveal an important role for the GPT2 enzyme in mitochondrial metabolism with relevance to developmental as well as potentially to neurodegenerative mechanisms.","dc:creator":"Ouyang Q","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in mitochondrial enzyme GPT2 cause metabolic dysfunction and neurological disease with developmental and progressive features."}},"rdfs:label":"MC9401"},{"id":"cggv:1bfae128-a9b6-4964-942d-1bae0fc5d6b6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1bfae128-a9b6-4964-942d-1bae0fc5d6b6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:1bfae128-a9b6-4964-942d-1bae0fc5d6b6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expressed mutated transcripts in HeLa cells and enzyme activity was substantially diminished to background levels."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"MAF 0.0002979 (9/30214 alleles) in the  South Asian population."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a22045e1-f7e3-424b-a44e-45cfa07073c8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a22045e1-f7e3-424b-a44e-45cfa07073c8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5b34fbc3-ece4-4d15-8216-6f15595376af","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_133443.4(GPT2):c.775T>C (p.Cys259Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/983542"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001288","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001249"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:dea45d6a-634b-47f4-9c47-a4d50c5681a3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5b34fbc3-ece4-4d15-8216-6f15595376af"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471722"},"rdfs:label":"2.1"},{"id":"cggv:dea45d6a-634b-47f4-9c47-a4d50c5681a3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dea45d6a-634b-47f4-9c47-a4d50c5681a3_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:dea45d6a-634b-47f4-9c47-a4d50c5681a3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expression in HeLa cells found reduced expression levels and substantially diminished enzymatic activity comparable to empty vector."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"MAF of 0.0001202 (3/24962 alleles) in the gnomAD African/African-American  population."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:42a70a83-40da-4acc-b6a3-9ef3942abd14_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11},{"id":"cggv:1aace702-2eac-453b-9e70-0b6a4b427f6b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1aace702-2eac-453b-9e70-0b6a4b427f6b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":19,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0a8f01fc-003c-4743-a79e-c8da9bc9d6d6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_133443.4(GPT2):c.1210C>T (p.Arg404Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8038814"}},"detectionMethod":"WES with Sanger confirmation.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0002355","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0002028","obo:HP_0008947","obo:HP_0011999"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:4dfc9af4-47d9-4a91-bc3c-e149e6f20099_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0a8f01fc-003c-4743-a79e-c8da9bc9d6d6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27601654"},"rdfs:label":"MI1001"},{"id":"cggv:4dfc9af4-47d9-4a91-bc3c-e149e6f20099","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4dfc9af4-47d9-4a91-bc3c-e149e6f20099_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4dfc9af4-47d9-4a91-bc3c-e149e6f20099_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expressed mutated transcripts in HeLa cells.

Here, we report a novel recessive GPT2 stop mutation p.Gln24* causing a complex IDD phenotype in a homozygous state in 5 patients from 2 consanguineous Arab families. By compiling clinical information of these individuals and previously described GPT2 patients a recognizable neurodevelopmental and potentially neurodegenerative phenotype can be assigned consisting of intellectual disability, pyramidal tract affection with spastic paraplegia, microcephaly and frequently epilepsy. Because of the consistent presence of pyramidal tract affection in GPT2 patients, we further suggest that GPT2 mutations should be considered in cases with complex hereditary spastic paraplegia.","dc:creator":"Hengel H","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"GPT2 mutations cause developmental encephalopathy with microcephaly and features of complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia."}},"rdfs:label":"F1-11.5"},{"id":"cggv:20e6d446-0498-4c7d-a855-da8a3d182d9a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20e6d446-0498-4c7d-a855-da8a3d182d9a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The nonsense variant in exon 2 of 12 is predicted to result in NMD.

The glutamate-glutamine/lactate-alanine shuttle pathway is important in glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes, to produce glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. Disruption of the production of this major neurotransmitter would be predicted to have catastrophic and generalized effects on brain function but would not be predicted to significantly affect other parts of the body since the expression of the ALT1 isoform should compensate in tissues other than the brain which expresses only ALT2.

Two ALT isoenzymes are known to exist, but only one ALT gene has been cloned, GPT. In this study, we cloned a homolog of GPT and named it GPT2, and the corresponding protein ALT2. GPT2 shares 69% identity and 78% similarity at the protein level to the previously cloned GPT. The human gene GPT2 encodes a 3.9-kb mRNA, consists of 12 exons, spanning approximately 50 kb of the genome, and maps to chromosome 16q12.1. GPT2 and GPT differ in mRNA expression in that GPT2 is highly expressed in muscle, fat, and kidney, whereas GPT is mainly expressed in kidney, liver, and heart. In addition, GPT2 seems to be the predominant form of GPT at the mRNA level in these tissues. Expression of ALT2 protein in Escherichia coli produced a functional recombinant enzyme that catalyzes alanine transamination, confirming that the enzyme is an ALT. The more abundant expression of GPT2 than GPT, especially in muscle and fat, suggests a unique and previously unrecognized role of this gene product in glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism and homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Yang RZ","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"cDNA cloning, genomic structure, chromosomal mapping, and functional expression of a novel human alanine aminotransferase."},"rdfs:label":"Alanine aminotransferase"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Expression of ALT2 protein in E. coli produced a functional a recombinant enzyme that catalyzes alanine transamination."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:42a70a83-40da-4acc-b6a3-9ef3942abd14_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4721f1c1-d092-4358-84eb-6e0759fffc11","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d8d79e0-63c7-4aa9-ab6f-26dc6e71fcff","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Gpt2-null brains showed a small but consistent and significant reduction in cortical area relative to control (P < 0.03).

This neurologic syndrome is characterized by delayed psychomotor development, moderately to severely impaired intellectual development, and poor or absent speech. More severely affected individuals show poor overall growth with progressive microcephaly, axial hypotonia, oromotor dysfunction with drooling, joint contractures, and spastic paraplegia resulting in walking difficulties. Eight variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splice variants) that have been reported in 7 probands (and 22 family members) in 4 publications (PMIDs: 31471722, 29882329, 25758935, and 27601654) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by its biochemical function catalyzing a reversible transamination reaction between L-alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to produce glutamate and pyruvate (PMID: 11863375), required for amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter production. As well as its expression at increasing levels in brain during early postnatal development (PMID: 27601654) and a mouse model with decreases in postnatal brain growth and reduced alanine levels, akin to the human phenotype (PMID: 27601654).
