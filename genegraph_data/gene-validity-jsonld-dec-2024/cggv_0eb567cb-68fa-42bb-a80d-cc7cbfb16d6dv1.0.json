Mutations in TBX5 are responsible for Holt-Oram Syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease with variable and partially penetrant cardiac defects suggestive of the existence of genetic and environmental modifiers. KLF13, a member of the Krüppel-like family of zinc finger proteins is co-expressed with TBX5 in several cardiac cells including atrial cardiomyocytes and cells of the interatrial septum. We report that KLF13 interacts physically and functionally with TBX5 to synergistically activate transcription of cardiac genes. We show that TBX5 contacts KLF13 via its T-domain and find that several disease-causing mutations therein have decreased KLF13 interaction. Whereas Klf13 heterozygote mice have no detectable cardiac defects, loss of a Klf13 allele in Tbx5 heterozygote mice significantly increases the penetrance of TBX5-dependent cardiac abnormalities including atrial, atrial-ventricular and ventricular septal defects. The results reveal for the first time combinatorial interaction between a T-box protein and a KLF family member and its importance for heart and possibly other organ development. The data also suggest that, in human, KLF13 may be a genetic modifier of the Holt-Oram Syndrome gene TBX5.","dc:creator":"Darwich R","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"KLF13 is a genetic modifier of the Holt-Oram syndrome gene TBX5."},"rdfs:label":"Protein Interaction with TBX5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:47310aa4-d7c4-47c9-a5fb-05b56e6eaa72","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b903856-a33f-4a24-8c0f-f9d02274968c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Showed physical and functional interaction with GATA-4, a dosage-sensitive cardiac regulator, and provides a mechanistic explanation for KLF13 action in the heart.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17053787","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In humans, congenital heart defects occur in 1-2% of live birth, but the molecular mechanisms and causative genes remain unidentified in the majority of cases. We have uncovered a novel transcription pathway important for heart morphogenesis. We report that KLF13, a member of the Krüppel-like family of zinc-finger proteins, is expressed predominantly in the heart, binds evolutionarily conserved regulatory elements on cardiac promoters and activates cardiac transcription. KLF13 is conserved across species and knockdown of KLF13 in Xenopus embryos leads to atrial septal defects and hypotrabeculation similar to those observed in humans or mice with hypomorphic GATA-4 alleles. Physical and functional interaction with GATA-4, a dosage-sensitive cardiac regulator, provides a mechanistic explanation for KLF13 action in the heart. The data demonstrate that KLF13 is an important component of the transcription network required for heart development and suggest that KLF13 is a GATA-4 modifier; by analogy to other GATA-4 collaborators, mutations in KLF13 may be causative for congenital human heart disease.","dc:creator":"Lavallée G","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"The Kruppel-like transcription factor KLF13 is a novel regulator of heart development."},"rdfs:label":"Protein Interaction with GATA4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":7999,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:8e194e19-5b0c-4412-8e8a-97e908d4d945","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:13672","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*KLF13* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2020 (Li et all.; PMID: 32293321). Four variants (missense, nonsense) that have been reported in four probands in three publications (PMID: 32293321, 33215447, 35369534) are included in this curation. The p.Glu124* and p.Glu144* were found to segregate in two respective families (PMID:33215447,35369534). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by protein interaction experimental evidence with *GATA4* and *TBX5*, which are two genes that have been definitively associated with isolated congenital heart disease (PMID: 17053787, 28164238).In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
