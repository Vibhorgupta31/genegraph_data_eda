Since the molecular isolation of BLM, characterization of BS-causing mutations has been carried out systematically using samples stored in the Bloom's Syndrome Registry. In a survey of 134 persons with BS from the Registry, 64 different mutations were identified in 125 of them, 54 that cause premature protein-translation termination and 10 missense mutations. In 102 of the 125 persons in whom at least one BLM mutation was identified, the mutation was recurrent, that is, it was shared by two or more persons with BS; 19 of the 64 different mutations were recurrent. Ethnic affiliations of the persons who carry recurrent mutations indicate that the majority of such persons inherit their BLM mutation identical-by-descent from a recent common ancestor, a founder. The presence of widespread founder mutations in persons with BS points to population genetic processes that repeatedly and pervasively generate mutations that recur in unrelated persons.","dc:creator":"German J","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Syndrome-causing mutations of the BLM gene in persons in the Bloom's Syndrome Registry."},"rdfs:label":"Northern blots for BS patients' FCLs or LCLs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"33 FCLs or LCLs lines from BS patients were found to have no or less BLM RNA."},{"id":"cggv:be182b55-5bb3-41af-ac49-427d6a3f47b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08fe25cf-54b5-4f05-87ab-77a0249e062b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"In three BS LCLs, the quantity of RNAs identified by hybridization to the H1 cDNA was\ndecreased in comparison to that of the control LCLs.

Two kindreds with RTS were recently shown to segregate for mutations in the human RECQL4 helicase gene. We report identification of a new RTS kindred in which both brothers developed osteosarcomas. Mutation analysis of the RECQL4 gene was performed on both brothers and both parents. The brothers were shown to be compound heterozygotes for mutations in the RECQL4 gene, including a single basepair deletion in exon 9 resulting in a frameshift and early termination codon and a base substitution in the 3-prime splice site in the intron-exon boundary of exon 8, which would be predicted to cause a deletion of at least part of a consensus helicase domain. Each parent was shown to be a heterozygote carrier for one mutation. This report strengthens the association between mutations in RECQL4 helicase gene and RTS. Two other recessive disorders, Bloom syndrome and Werner syndrome, are known to be due to other human RECQ helicase gene mutations. These three disorders all manifest abnormal growth, premature aging, and predisposition to site-specific malignancies.
