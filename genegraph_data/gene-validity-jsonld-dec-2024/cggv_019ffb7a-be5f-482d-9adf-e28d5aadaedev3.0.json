However, the location and character of many of the causal mutations in LDS intuitively imply diminished TGF-β signaling. Taken together, these data have engendered controversy regarding the specific role of TGF-β in disease pathogenesis. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) has considerable phenotypic overlap with MFS and LDS, including aortic aneurysm. We identified causative variation in ten individuals with SGS in the proto-oncogene SKI, a known repressor of TGF-β activity. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals showed enhanced activation of TGF-β signaling cascades and higher expression of TGF-β-responsive genes relative to control cells. Morpholino-induced silencing of SKI paralogs in zebrafish recapitulated abnormalities seen in humans with SGS. These data support the conclusions that increased TGF-β signaling is the mechanism underlying SGS and that high signaling contributes to multiple syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysm.","dc:creator":"Doyle AJ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in the TGF-β repressor SKI cause Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome with aortic aneurysm."},"rdfs:label":"Expressed in aorta"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Included in the original GGCEP curation, but not scored by the Craniofacial Malformations GCEP.

Overexpression of SkiA or SkiB disrupted gastrulation and resulted in a dorsalized phenotype. In situ analyses suggested that overexpression of Ski leads to a slight expansion of dorsal-axial mesoderm, diminishment or loss of ventral mesoderm and radialization of dorsal neuroectoderm. The dorsalized phenotype could be rescued by the ventral specifying factor, BMP4. These results provide evidence that Ski proteins participate in dorsal-ventral specification of both neuroectoderm and mesoderm.","dc:creator":"Kaufman CD","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Ectopic expression of c-ski disrupts gastrulation and neural patterning in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded for zebrafish model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"cggv:019ffb7a-be5f-482d-9adf-e28d5aadaede_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f035d6f8-82b0-48fa-9ab1-980d923518e8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c678d402-aa35-46b0-b85d-5a487ecac21b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Western blot analysis (using primary dermal fibroblasts derived from 2 SGS patients and 2 controls) showed excessive SMAD2/3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pSMAD2/3 and pERK1/2) in patient cells compared to controls, both at baseline and after acute (30 minute) stimulation with exogenous TGF-β2.

Clinical phenotypes of SGS include craniosynostosis and craniofacial features, motor and cognitive delays, mild-moderate intellectual disability, hypotonia, musculoskeletal anomalies, and cardiovascular problems such as aortic aneurysm. Variants in SKI have been identified in at least 40 probands with SGS (GeneReviews, Greally, 2020). Seven variants (missense and in-frame indel) reported in 13 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 23023332, 23103230, 24357594, 4736733) are included in this curation. Additionally, there is evidence that variants affecting amino acid position p.Thr180 may lead to phenotypes including thoracic aortic aneurysm and a marfanoid body habitus without intellectual disability, a feature which is often characteristic of SGS (PMID: 31980905). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is proposed to be dominant-negative (PMID: 23023332). Variants in SKI associated with SGS are concentrated in exon 1, a mutational hotspot, where variants exert a stabilizing effect on SKI protein function, attenuating the TGF-β signaling pathway (PMID: 33416497). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including expression studies, animal models, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 10906458, 23023332). In summary, SKI is definitively associated with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 10/29/20 (SOP Version 8).
