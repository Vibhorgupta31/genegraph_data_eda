Associated features of the disorder include diabetes mellitus, hypertension and congenital heart disease. There are six known BBS loci, mapping to chromosomes 2, 3, 11, 15, 16 and 20. The BBS2 locus was initially mapped to an 18 cM interval on chromosome 16q21 with a large inbred Bedouin kindred. Further analysis of the Bedouin population allowed for the fine mapping of this locus to a 2 cM region distal to marker D16S408. Physical mapping and sequence analysis of this region resulted in the identification of a number of known genes and expressed sequence tag clusters. Mutation screening of a novel gene (BBS2) with a wide pattern of tissue expression revealed homozygous mutations in two inbred pedigrees, including the large Bedouin kindred used to initially identify the BBS2 locus. In addition, mutations were found in three of 18 unrelated BBS probands from small nuclear families.","dc:creator":"Nishimura DY","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Positional cloning of a novel gene on chromosome 16q causing Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS2)."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cdbce7f6-4922-4c52-883c-89de43e170fa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b2045a3-9a4d-413d-887a-7327d7d03f32","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS; OMIM 209900) is an autosomal recessive disease that is heterogeneous both clinically and genetically and is characterized by a wide and variable spectrum of clinical features that can be categorized as primary features (including retinal degeneration, polydactyly, renal and gonadal malformations, obesity, and learning disabilities) or secondary features (including speech disorders, developmental delay, ataxia, diabetes mellitus, dysmorphic features, and variable cognitive impairment).

However, despite the identification of 12 BBS genes, the molecular basis of BBS remains elusive. Here we identify a complex composed of seven highly conserved BBS proteins. This complex, the BBSome, localizes to nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm but also to the membrane of the cilium. Interestingly, the BBSome is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Strikingly, Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Conversely, preventing Rab8(GTP) production blocks ciliation in cells and yields characteristic BBS phenotypes in zebrafish. Our data reveal that BBS may be caused by defects in vesicular transport to the cilium.","dc:creator":"Nachury MV","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"A core complex of BBS proteins cooperates with the GTPase Rab8 to promote ciliary membrane biogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"BBS2 BBSome Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ee02e02b-745d-48df-a4d2-4c493d87a72c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a080cdc0-cbed-4b9a-a087-f22bd8d16ab0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Other BBSome components have been asserted in connection with various monogenic forms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including BBS2 (PMID: 11285252), ARL6 (PMID: 15258860), BBS4 (PMID: 11381270), BBS5 (PMID: 15137946), MKKS (PMID: 10973238, PMID: 10973251), BBS7 (PMID: 12567324), and TTC8 (PMID: 14520415).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22072986","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Many signaling proteins including G protein-coupled receptors localize to primary cilia, regulating cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis.

BBS is considered an autosomal recessive disorder, and recent positional cloning efforts have identified two BBS genes (BBS2 and BBS6). We screened our cohort of 163 BBS families for mutations in both BBS2 and BBS6 and report the presence of three mutant alleles in affected individuals in four pedigrees. In addition, we detected unaffected individuals in two pedigrees who carry two BBS2 mutations but not a BBS6 mutation. We therefore propose that BBS may not be a single-gene recessive disease but a complex trait requiring three mutant alleles to manifest the phenotype. This triallelic model of disease transmission may be important in the study of both Mendelian and multifactorial disorders.","dc:creator":"Katsanis N","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Triallelic inheritance in Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a Mendelian recessive disorder."}},"rdfs:label":"Katsanis_PB005"},{"id":"cggv:04215563-c289-4419-aac5-dab6c81112d0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04215563-c289-4419-aac5-dab6c81112d0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"- only scored one instance of variant to avoid double counting\n- downscored due to lack of WES"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8a4d05e1-d2b3-4d55-ba73-ac5f5f7ba958_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":["Inconclusive","Supports"],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a4d05e1-d2b3-4d55-ba73-ac5f5f7ba958","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:6f3bcd8d-0753-4d50-b751-dde0f8a6ecf4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031885.5(BBS2):c.534+1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8066019"}},{"id":"cggv:1c48dcb0-2cf5-4bc9-b158-6c7a2e9383c1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031885.5(BBS2):c.1278A>G (p.Glu426=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA495586865"}}],"detectionMethod":"Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) was then performed using a capture panel including 131 known inherited retinal disease (IRD) genes (Supplementary Table 1).

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *BBS2* loss of function) have been found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with either Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2 (MIM#: 606151) or retinitis pigmentosa 74 (MIM#: 616562), while the phenotypic variability between the two groups of cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *BBS2* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *BBS2*-related ciliopathy.\n\nNine unique variants (two missense, three nonsense, one frameshift, and three splicing) that have been reported in thirteen probands in five publications (PMIDs: 11567139, 11285252, 24608809, 21052717, 33777945) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by data from ProteinAtlas that *BBS2* is non-specifically expressed in the retina as well as many other tissues, consistent with the clinical heterogeneity of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (PMID: 28940711). Biochemical evidence indicates that the protein encoded by the *BBS2* gene is a component of the BBSome, a protein complex that functions in ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport (PMID: 22072986). Tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry has shown that *BBS2* forms a stable complex along with other proteins that are encoded by genes associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (*BBS1*, *BBS4*, *BBS5*, *BBS7*, *BBS8*, and *BBS9*, PMID: 17574030). *BBS2* homozygous knockout zebrafish without a functional copy of *BBS2* exhibit retinal degeneration and vision loss (PMID: 33324636). A *Bbs2* null mouse model recapitulated even more of the features of human patients, including obesity, retinal degeneration, renal cysts, and male infertility (PMID: 15539463).\n\nIn summary, *BBS2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive BBS2-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 7th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
