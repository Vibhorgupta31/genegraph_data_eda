Six known RET mutations were used as controls. The in silico analysis showed the highest score value (i.e. 65) for S904F, M848T, M918T and C634R, whereas L790F, G691S, T338I and V648I had 0 score. Intermediate score values were obtained by A883T (score=55), M918V, V804M and Y791F (score=15). The in vitro focus formation assay showed that cells transfected with S904F, M918T, M848T or C634R generated the largest number of focus formation units (FFU). Intermediate numbers of FFU were observed in cells transfected with M918V, V804M, Y791F or A883T, while cells transfected with L790F, G691S, T338I or V648I showed a number of FFU similar to control cells. A positive correlation between the in silico score and in vitro FFU was found (P=0.0005). Only cells transfected with M918T or C634R grew faster and generated higher number of colonies in soft agar than control cells. However, the cells that were transfected with V804M produced an intermediate number of colonies. In conclusion, two of the six rare RET mutations, S904F and M848T possessed a relatively high transforming activity but a low aggressiveness; the other four mutations T338I, V648I, M918V and A883T were low or non-transforming, and their ability to induce tumoural transformation might be related to particular genetic conditions.","dc:creator":"Cosci B","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"In silico and in vitro analysis of rare germline allelic variants of RET oncogene associated with medullary thyroid cancer."},"rdfs:label":"p.Cys634Arg exhibits high transforming activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c5f3c875-2438-4bfe-b785-b86d7d3e6507_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:247961a5-ff25-4f32-8301-3842469def8b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c144fc0-0a49-4357-a532-1e8d3cd7b4c8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The patient derived mutation in RET, C634R, which is the most prevalent mutation in MEN2A was introduced into the RET9 isoform as a transgene in two separate mouse models (PMID: 9096393, and11494127).

Four different MEN syndromes have been so far identified: MEN type 1 (MEN1), MEN2A (also referred to as MEN2), MEN2B (or MEN3) and MEN4, which have slightly varying tumor spectra and are caused by mutations in different genes. MEN1 associates with loss-of-function mutations in the MEN1 gene encoding the tumor suppressor menin. The MEN2A and MEN2B syndromes are due to activating mutations in the proto-oncogene RET (Rearranged in Transfection) and are characterized by different phenotypic features of the affected patients. MEN4 was the most recent addition to the family of the MEN syndromes. It was discovered less than 10 years ago thanks to studies of a rat strain that spontaneously develops multiple endocrine tumors (named MENX). These studies identified an inactivating mutation in the Cdkn1b gene, encoding the putative tumor suppressor p27, as the causative mutation of the rat syndrome. Subsequently, germline mutations in the human ortholog CDKN1B were also found in a subset of patients with a MEN-like phenotype and this led to the identification of MEN4. Small animal models have been instrumental in understanding important biochemical, physiological and pathological processes of cancer onset and spread in intact living organisms. Moreover, they have provided us with insight into gene function(s) and molecular mechanisms of disease progression. We here review the currently available animal models of MEN syndromes and their impact on the elucidation of the pathophysiology of these diseases, with a special focus on the rat MENX syndrome that we have been characterizing.","dc:creator":"Wiedemann T","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Animal models of multiple endocrine neoplasia."},"rdfs:label":"Review of MEN2A mouse models"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":4,"dc:description":"Given that this review article highlights two independently generated mouse models of MEN2A with mice harboring the highly prevalent C634R variant in RET, and both show developement of tumors consistent with disease I am increasing the default points."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5},{"id":"cggv:c5f3c875-2438-4bfe-b785-b86d7d3e6507_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c5f3c875-2438-4bfe-b785-b86d7d3e6507_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:c5f3c875-2438-4bfe-b785-b86d7d3e6507_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0249ea12-4358-49c2-8386-e5b2b5965135_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48b844a2-bdf1-444e-bf9e-4975ff4fe137","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"PCR and Sanger sequencing of the 16 known exons at the time for the RET gene in tumor samples first, followed by testing of DNA harvested from normal, unaffected tissues to establish germline inheritance.

Single strand conformational variants (SSCVs) in exons 7 and 8 of the RET proto-oncogene were identified in eight MEN 2A and four FMTC families. The variants were observed only in the DNA of individuals who were either affected or who had inherited the MEN2A or FMTC allele as determined by haplotyping experiments. The seven variants identified were sequenced directly. All involved point mutations within codons specifying cysteine residues, resulting in nonconservative amino acid changes. Six of the seven mutations are located in exon 7. A single mutation was found in exon 8. Variants were not detected in four MEN 2B families studied for all exon assays available, nor were they detectable in 16 cases of well documented sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma that were tested for exon 7 variants. Coinheritance of the mutations with disease and the physical and genetic proximity of the RET proto-oncogene provide evidence that RET is responsible for at least two of the three inherited forms of MEN 2.

The two mutations were present on the same RET allele and were detected in germline and tumor DNA. Both mutations were de novo, i.e. they were not found in the DNA of the parents or relatives. Immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analysis showed that the pheochromocytoma expressed calcitonin as well as both RET alleles. A cell line established from the tumor and propagated in culture sustained the expression of RET and calcitonin, as did the original pheochromocytoma. Because the patient presented with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma without parathyroid gland involvement, we speculate that this clinical picture could be correlated with the two RET mutations and to the unusual calcitonin production.

Early evidence began to show linkage of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (not discerning between type A vs. type B) as early as 1992 (Narod et al., 1992; PMID: 2572534). Numerous variants have been reported in RET in relation to multiple endocrine neoplasia type A , the majority being missense mutation in conserved cysteine (p. Cys or p.C) amino acid residues within the dimerization and activation domain, including p.C609, p.C611, p.C618, p. C620, p. C630, p.C634 (reviewed Plaza-Menaho et al., 2006; PMID: 16979782). The molecular mechanism for the RET-multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A is gain of function (GOF), as the missense mutations result in ligand-independent dimerization that induces activation of the RET protein that is a receptor tyrosine kinase (Plaza-Menaho et al., 2006; PMID: 16979782; Drilon et al., 2017, PMID 29134959). There are variant databases specific to the RET gene including the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and RET database (http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/MEN2/MEN2_welcome.php) and the RET gene LOVD database (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/RET). Substantial evidence supports this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation and experimental data with the maximum score (12) for genetic evidence reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional studies including expression, cell assays and animal models, several that were patient derived pathogenic variants expressed in the mouse (reviewed in Wiedmann et al, 2016; PMID: 26184857). These animal models developed MEN2A related tumors including medullary thyroid carcinomas. The RET gene is asserted to be associated with multiple disease entities by germline inheritance, including: (1) Central hypoventilation syndrome, congenital (MIM:209880), (2) Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MIM:155240), (3) Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIB (MIM:162300), (4) Pheochromocytoma (MIM:171300). These disease entities all follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have found no difference in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic expressivity between Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MIM:155240), Pheochromocytoma (MIM:171300), and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MIM:171400), and therefore have lumped the above listed disease entities into the curation for RET in Multiple Endocrine neoplasia type 2A. Of note, Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIB (MIM:162300) follows a different GOF mechanism and has variants specific to this disease entity and has been curated separately. Due to variants asserted in Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MIM:155240), Pheochromocytoma (MIM:171300) with both multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and type 2B, the evidence for each of these was lumped into the appropriate gene-disease relationship based on the variant asserted for the evidence. Furthermore, Central hypoventilation syndrome, congenital (MIM:209880) has distinct variants associated with it and also has a separate curation. However, it should be noted that CCHS can be a phenotypic feature observed in individuals with multiple endocrine neoplasia, so care was taken in the curation and assessing evidence based on the variant of interest asserted. In addition, the Hirsphrung disease which is associated with LOF in RET is not included in this curation. In summary, RET is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c5f3c875-2438-4bfe-b785-b86d7d3e6507"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
