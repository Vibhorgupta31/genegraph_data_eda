Conventional linkage and positional cloning have led to the mapping of six BBS loci in the human genome, four of which (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, and BBS6) have been cloned. Despite these advances, the protein sequences of the known BBS genes have provided little or no insight into their function. To delineate functionally important regions in BBS2, we performed phylogenetic and genomic studies in which we used the human and zebrafish BBS2 peptide sequences to search dbEST and the translation of the draft human genome. We identified two novel genes that we initially named \"BBS2L1\" and \"BBS2L2\" and that exhibit modest similarity with two discrete, overlapping regions of BBS2. In the present study, we demonstrate that BBS2L1 mutations cause BBS, thereby defining a novel locus for this syndrome, BBS7, whereas BBS2L2 has been shown independently to be BBS1. The motif-based identification of a novel BBS locus has enabled us to define a potential functional domain that is present in three of the five known BBS proteins and, therefore, is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of this complex syndrome.","dc:creator":"Badano JL","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Identification of a novel Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein, BBS7, that shares structural features with BBS1 and BBS2."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a09e1836-927c-424d-b10c-fd93f3e6dc6b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e7f71c39-016a-403f-b039-749d24dfe777_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e7f71c39-016a-403f-b039-749d24dfe777","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:d41eb311-f4b2-4fe2-b9ec-8e22f147bd18","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_176824.3(BBS7):c.1121C>G (p.Ser374Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA358062298"}},{"id":"cggv:71f581a8-40f2-4ffc-829e-327da6950f1e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_176824.3(BBS7):c.712_715del (p.Arg238GlufsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3064432"}}],"detectionMethod":"Genotyping consisted of Sanger sequencing of the TTC8 and BBS7 loci.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient has been diagnosed with Bardet-Biedl syndrome.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003077","obo:HP_0001133","obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0001513","obo:HP_0030515","obo:HP_0410042","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0000548","obo:HP_0000077","obo:HP_0034685","obo:HP_0100543"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Previous genotyping consisted of Sanger sequencing of the TTC8 locus.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:a05f4ef2-f9fb-44bf-91b3-bff83c2183e0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:71f581a8-40f2-4ffc-829e-327da6950f1e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19402160","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet Biedl syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy with fourteen genes currently identified.

Next, three of the remaining patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing with 96% at 20 × depth of coverage that revealed novel BBS4 mutation. Observation of no mutation in the other patients represents the possible presence of novel genes. Screening of the remaining patients for six other genes (BBS3, BBS4, BBS6, BBS7, BBS9 and BBS12) revealed five novel mutations. This result represents another indication for the genetic heterogeneity of BBS and extends the mutational spectrum of the disease by introducing nine novel mutations in five BBS genes. In conclusion, although BBS1 and BBS10 are among the most commonly mutated genes in other populations like Caucasian, these two seem not to have an important role in Iranian patients.

Higher nonhuman primates are the only animals with retinal structure similar to humans, including the presence of a macula and fovea. However, few nonhuman primate models of genetic retinal disease are known. We identified a lineage of rhesus macaques with a frameshift mutation in exon 3 of the BBS7 gene c.160delG (p.Ala54fs) that is predicted to produce a non-functional protein. In humans, mutations in this and other BBS genes cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy and a syndromic form of retinitis pigmentosa generally occurring in conjunction with kidney dysfunction, polydactyly, obesity, and/or hypogonadism. Three full- or half-sibling monkeys homozygous for the BBS7 c.160delG variant, at ages 3.5, 4 and 6 years old, displayed a combination of severe photoreceptor degeneration and progressive kidney disease. In vivo retinal imaging revealed features of severe macular degeneration, including absence of photoreceptor layers, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and retinal vasculature atrophy. Electroretinography in the 3.5-year-old case demonstrated loss of scotopic and photopic a-waves and markedly reduced and delayed b-waves. Histological assessments in the 4- and 6-year-old cases confirmed profound loss of photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons across the posterior retina, with dramatic thinning and disorganization of all cell layers, abundant microglia, absent or displaced RPE cells, and significant gliosis in the subretinal space. Retinal structure, including presence of photoreceptors, was preserved only in the far periphery. Ultrasound imaging of the kidneys revealed deranged architecture, and renal histopathology identified distorted contours with depressed, fibrotic foci and firmly adhered renal capsules; renal failure occurred in the 6-year-old case. Magnetic resonance imaging obtained in one case revealed abnormally low total brain volume and unilateral ventricular enlargement. The one male had abnormally small testes at 4 years of age, but polydactyly and obesity were not observed. Thus, monkeys homozygous for the BBS7 c.160delG variant closely mirrored several key features of the human BBS syndrome. This finding represents the first identification of a naturally-occurring nonhuman primate model of BBS, and more broadly the first such model of retinitis pigmentosa and a ciliopathy with an associated genetic mutation.

This model is consistent with the human disease at the cellular level, but does not recapitulate the organ-level dysfunction of affected patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15231740","rdfs:label":"Naturally occurring bbs-7 loss-of-function C. elegans model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This model provides insights into the human disease state at the cellular level, but the model animals are unable to recapitulate the organ-level dysfunction of affected patients."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7379,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:64b7e717-3d73-47aa-a01d-e137bb17342f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005308","gene":"hgnc:18758","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The *BBS7* gene was first reported in relation to Bardet-Biedl syndrome in a 2003 report of an affected individual from a consanguineous family (PMID: 12567324). Subsequent publications have established that cases diagnosed with Bardet-Biedl syndrome 7 exhibit retinal disease as the most penetrant feature, characterized by retinal dystrophy, often in a cone-rod pattern, photoreceptor layer loss, pigmentary retinopathy, reduced visual acuity, and/or retinal arteriolar constriction. These phenotypes are generally accompanied by diverse extraocular features such as obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities including cysts, abnormal morphology of the heart and/or liver, dental abnormalities such as crowding, hypoplastic external genitalia in males, and/or intellectual disability. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *BBS7* loss of function) were found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with Bardet-Biedl syndrome 7 (MIM# 615984), while the phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *BBS7* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as BBS7-related ciliopathy.\n\nNine suspected disease-causing variants have been scored as part of this curation (two nonsense, five frameshift, one affecting splicing, and one missense), which have been collectively reported in seven probands in seven publications (PMID: 12567324, PMID: 19402160, PMID: 24849935, PMID: 25553308, PMID: 26557828, PMID: 26518167, PMID: 30839500). All of the probands scored in this curation harbored biallelic *BBS7* variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of BBS7 function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Only two relatively small families were found in the literature (PMID: 12567324, PMID: 30839500), and segregation evidence did not contribute to the scoring of this curation.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that *BBS7* encodes a component of the BBSome, a protein complex that functions in ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport (PMID: 17574030). Consistent with these functions, BBS7 protein localizes to transition zones and ciliary axonemes and dynamically moves in both anterograde and retrograde directions along the ciliary axoneme (PMID: 15231740). BBS7 co-immunoprecipitates with BBS4 (PMID: 17574030), and the genes encoding other BBSome components have similarly been asserted in connection with various monogenic forms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including *BBS1* (PMID: 12118255), *BBS2* (PMID: 11285252), *ARL6* (PMID: 15258860), *BBS4* (PMID: 11381270), *BBS5* (PMID: 15137946), *MKKS* (PMID: 10973238, PMID: 10973251), and *TTC8* (PMID: 14520415). *C. elegans* with biallelic *Bbs-7* disruption exhibit short cilia and defects in cilia-based chemotaxis and intraflagellar transport (PMID: 15231740), while *bbs7* knockdown in zebrafish disrupts the ciliated organ controlling left-right patterning and triggers a defect in intracellular retrograde transport of melanosomes (PMID: 16399798). Biallelic disruption of *BBS7* orthologs in mice or macaques recapitulates many of the features of human patients, including retinal degeneration, abnormal renal morphology, and male reproductive defects (PMID: 23572516, PMID: 31589838).\n\nIn summary, *BBS7* is definitively associated with BBS7-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a09e1836-927c-424d-b10c-fd93f3e6dc6b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
