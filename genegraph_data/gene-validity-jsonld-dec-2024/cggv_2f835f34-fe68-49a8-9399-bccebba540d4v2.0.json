Surprisingly, prestin is a member of a gene family, solute carrier (SLC) family 26, that encodes anion transporters and related proteins. Of nine known human genes in this family, three (SLC26A2, SLC26A3 and SLC26A4) are associated with different human hereditary diseases. The restricted expression of prestin in OHCs, and its proposed function as a mechanical amplifier, make it a strong candidate gene for human deafness. Here we report the cloning and characterization of four splicing isoforms for the human prestin gene (SLC26A5a, b, c and d). SLC26A5a is the predominant form of prestin whereas the others showed limited distribution associated with certain developmental stages. Based on the functional importance of prestin we screened for possible mutations involving the prestin gene in a group of deaf probands. We have identified a 5'-UTR splice acceptor mutation (IVS2-2A>G) in exon 3 of the prestin gene, which is responsible for recessive non-syndromic deafness in two unrelated families. In addition, a high frequency of heterozygosity for the same mutation was observed in these subjects, suggesting the possibility of semi-dominant influence of the mutation in causing hearing loss. Finally, the observation of this mutation only in the Caucasian probands indicated an association with a specific ethnic background.

The results support a model in which anions act as extrinsic voltage sensors, which bind to the prestin molecule and thus trigger the conformational changes required for motility of OHCs.","dc:creator":"Oliver D","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Intracellular anions as the voltage sensor of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein."},"rdfs:label":"Electrotransduction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2f835f34-fe68-49a8-9399-bccebba540d4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e1455ad5-e999-4eb0-a19c-d211c1cc555c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e40fb96-8b68-4788-9139-93221b0ac340","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Knock-in mouse model generated with both p.V499G and p.Y501H variants.

While it is generally agreed that outer hair cells provide the amplification, two mechanisms have been proposed: stereociliary motility and somatic motility. The latter is driven by the motor protein prestin. Electrophysiological phenotyping of a prestin knockout mouse intimated that somatic motility is the amplifier. However, outer hair cells of knockout mice have significantly altered mechanical properties, making this mouse model unsatisfactory. Here, we study a mouse model without alteration to outer hair cell and organ of Corti mechanics or to mechanoelectric transduction, but with diminished prestin function. These animals have knockout-like behavior, demonstrating that prestin-based electromotility is required for cochlear amplification.","dc:creator":"Dallos P","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Prestin-based outer hair cell motility is necessary for mammalian cochlear amplification."},"rdfs:label":"p.V499G and p.Y501H mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ec44a992-8aec-42c6-9918-e34aacc49b6a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d15646d5-584d-4a53-b0fd-b59e8b7e348e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"it is not, expected HL","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21954035","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea are crucial for the remarkable hearing sensitivity and frequency tuning. To understand OHC physiology and pathology, it is imperative to use mouse genetic tools to manipulate gene expression specifically in OHCs. Here, we generated two prestin knockin mouse lines: (1) the prestin-CreERT2 line, with an internal ribosome entry site-CreERT2-FRT-Neo-FRT cassette inserted into the prestin locus after the stop codon, and (2) the prestin-CreERT2-NN line, with the FRT-Neo-FRT removed subsequently. We characterized the inducible Cre activity of both lines by crossing them with the reporter lines CAG-eGFP and Ai6. Cre activity was induced with tamoxifen at various postnatal ages and only detected in OHCs, resembling the endogenous prestin expression pattern. Moreover, prestin-CreERT2+/-(heterozygotes) and +/+(homozygotes) as well as prestin-CreERT2-NN+/-mice displayed normal hearing. These two prestin-CreERT2 mouse lines are therefore useful tools to analyze gene function in OHCs in vivo.","dc:creator":"Fang J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Outer hair cell-specific prestin-CreERT2 knockin mouse lines."},"rdfs:label":"Knockin mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"mouse had hearing"},{"id":"cggv:8c4965ec-777d-4f48-b70d-576d3926d172","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ed491942-7c23-4222-a7aa-de02ab01a83e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"OHC lengths were decreased at all cochlear turns in null mice, and IHCs and OHCs were almost completely lost at basal region of cochlea.

In addition to the mechano-electrical transduction required for auditory sensation, mammalian outer hair cells also perform electromechanical transduction, whereby transmembrane voltage drives cellular length changes at audio frequencies in vitro. This electromotility is thought to arise through voltage-gated conformational changes in a membrane protein, and prestin has been proposed as this molecular motor. Here we show that targeted deletion of prestin in mice results in loss of outer hair cell electromotility in vitro and a 40-60 dB loss of cochlear sensitivity in vivo, without disruption of mechano-electrical transduction in outer hair cells. In heterozygotes, electromotility is halved and there is a twofold (about 6 dB) increase in cochlear thresholds. These results suggest that prestin is indeed the motor protein, that there is a simple and direct coupling between electromotility and cochlear amplification, and that there is no need to invoke additional active processes to explain cochlear sensitivity in the mammalian ear.","dc:creator":"Liberman MC","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Proposed function of prestin is a cochlear amplifier.

Six variants (missense, nonsense, 5' UTR splicing) have been reported in four probands in four publications, however the association was only scored in one proband as other variants did not have sufficient evidence for pathogenicity (PMIDs: 24164807, 12719379, 17786286, 26969326). This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least one case-control study at the aggregate variant level (PMID: 19492055). No statistically significant difference was found between patients and controls in the frequency of the identified variants. The mechanism for disease is reported to be loss of function (PMIDs: 24164807, 18466744, 12239568). This gene-disease association is also supported by mouse models, biochemical function studies, and expression studies (PMIDs: 12239568, 10821263, 11423665, 12719379, 18466744, 27091614, 17998209). There is strong evidence that loss of SLC26A5 causes hearing loss in mice, yet there is limited evidence in humans. Researchers have posited that humans have a compensatory mechanism that mice do not have (Hosoya et al. 2016; PMID: 27091614). Due to the lack of convincing human patients, the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel classified this gene-disease relationship as Limited. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/19/2017.  It was reevaluated on 1/19/2022 (SOP v8).  As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.\nStrong functional evidence in mice, but lack of convincing human cases.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2f835f34-fe68-49a8-9399-bccebba540d4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
