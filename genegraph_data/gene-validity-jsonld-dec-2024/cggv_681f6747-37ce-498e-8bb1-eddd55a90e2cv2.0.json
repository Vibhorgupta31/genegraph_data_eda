Here we report that human 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase is identical with a previously described RNA-binding protein (designated AUH) possessing enoyl-CoA hydratase activity. Molecular analyses in five patients from four independent families revealed homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the AUH gene; most mutations are predicted to completely abolish protein function. Mutations identified include c.80delG, R197X, IVS8-1G>A, A240V, and c.613_614insA. Clinical severity of MGA1 in published patients has been quite variable. Included in the present study is an additional patient with MGA1 who was detected by neonatal screening and has remained asymptomatic up to his present age of 2 years. The boy is homozygous for an N-terminal frameshift mutation in the AUH gene. Complete absence of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase/AUH appears to be compatible with normal development in some cases.

Affected individuals display variable clinical manifestations ranging from mildly delayed speech development to severe psychomotor retardation with neurological handicap. MGA1 is caused by reduced or absent 3-methylglutaconyl-coenzyme A (3-MG-CoA) hydratase activity within the leucine degradation pathway. The human AUH gene has been reported to encode for a bifunctional enzyme with both RNA-binding and enoyl-CoA-hydratase activity. In addition, it was shown that mutations in the AUH gene are linked to MGA1. Here we present kinetic data of the purified gene product of AUH using different CoA-substrates. The best substrates were (E)-3-MG-CoA (V(max) = 3.9 U.mg(-1), K(m) = 8.3 microM, k(cat) = 5.1 s(-1)) and (E)-glutaconyl-CoA (V(max) = 1.1 U.mg(-1), K(m) = 2.4 microM, k(cat) = 1.4 s(-1)) giving strong evidence that the AUH gene encodes for the major human 3-MG-CoA hydratase in leucine degradation. Based on these results, a new assay for AUH activity in fibroblast homogenates was developed. The only missense mutation found in MGA1 phenotypes, c.719C>T, leading to the amino acid exchange A240V, produces an enzyme with only 9% of the wild-type 3-MG-CoA hydratase activity.","dc:creator":"Mack M","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Biochemical characterization of human 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase and its role in leucine metabolism."},"rdfs:label":"Mack_Biochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"AUH was kinetically characterized with its natural substrate 3-MG-CoA.

At least 11 unique variants (splicing errors, nonsense, frameshift, and missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in 9 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 21840233, 28438368, 20855850, 17130438, 16354225, 15033206, 12655555, 12434311). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of AUH as a 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase and its altered function in non-patient cells (PMID: 16640564). In summary, AUH is definitively associated with autosomal recessive 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 1.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:681f6747-37ce-498e-8bb1-eddd55a90e2c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
