In this report, we describe the isolation of a full-length cDNA clone encoding human 3-HAO (h3-HAO). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of rat liver 3-HAO, and they were used as primers for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of rat liver RNA. The resulting rat cDNA product was used to screen a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) cDNA library and to isolate a human 3-HAO cDNA clone. This clone was found to have an insert of 1276 nucleotides. The deduced primary structure of h3-HAO is composed of 286 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 32.6 kDa. The human sequence exhibits high similarity (94%) to the rat partial amino acid sequence deduced from the rat reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fragment. Insertion of the h3-HAO coding sequence into a eukaryotic expression vector yielded relatively high amounts of the active enzyme in human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells. The Km value of 3-HANA for recombinant h3-HAO (approximately 2 microM) was in good agreement with that reported for the native enzyme. Immunoblot analysis of recombinant h3-HAO revealed a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, as predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. RNA blot analysis of human liver and HepG2 cells revealed one major species of h3-HAO mRNA of approximately 1.3 kilobases.","dc:creator":"Malherbe P","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Molecular cloning and functional expression of human 3-hydroxyanthranilic-acid dioxygenase."},"rdfs:label":"Enzymatic activity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":"1","dc:description":"Insertion of the human HAAO coding sequence into a eukaryotic expression vector yielded relatively high amounts of the active enzyme in human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells.

Biallelic, inactivating variants in three genes encoding enzymes of this biosynthesis pathway (KYNU, HAAO, and NADSYN1) disrupt NAD synthesis and have been identified in patients with multiple malformations of the heart, kidney, vertebrae, and limbs; these patients have Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder HAAO and four families with biallelic variants in KYNU. These patients present similarly with multiple malformations of the heart, kidney, vertebrae, and limbs, of variable severity. We show that each variant identified in these patients results in loss-of-function, revealed by a significant reduction in NAD levels via yeast genetic complementation assays. For the first time, missense mutations are identified as a cause of malformation and shown to disrupt enzyme function. These missense and frameshift variants cause moderate to severe NAD deficiency in yeast, analogous to insufficient synthesized NAD in patients.

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive vertebral, cardiac, renal, and limb defects syndrome 1 in 2017 (Shi H, et al., 2017, PMID: 28792876). Seven unique variants (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in 5 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 28792876, 33942433). In addition to this case-level data experimental evidence includes its biochemical function in the kynurenine pathway (PMID: 7514594) and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 28792876). In summary, *HAAO* is definitively associated with vertebral, cardiac, renal, and limb defects syndrome 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 07/10/2020. It was reevaluated on 06/24/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Limited to Definitive due to a new case reports (PMID: 33942433).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:89484d6b-0af1-4b77-9dcb-95c18331e3b7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
