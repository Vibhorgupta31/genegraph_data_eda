One  variant (a missense) that has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 30622330) is included in this curation. However, this variant was not scored as it is too frequent and present in the hemizygous state in population databases. No scorable experimental evidence was found. The only experimental evidence evaluated was expression analysis in human fetal tissue. However, this was not counted as there was no fetal heart expression and there is no scorable genetic evidence. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between RAI2 and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role RAI2 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 4/30/2024 (SOP Version 10).\nOnly one case of genetic evidence was found, but it was not scored as the variant is too frequent in gnomAD and the database has homozygotes of the variant. Thus, disputed was considered the appropriate classification instead of no know gene-disease relationship.
