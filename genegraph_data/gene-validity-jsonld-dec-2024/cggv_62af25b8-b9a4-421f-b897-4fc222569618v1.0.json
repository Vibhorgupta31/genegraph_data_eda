Using whole-exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing, we identified three truncating mutations within PRRT2 (NM_145239.2) in eight Han Chinese families with histories of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia: c.514_517delTCTG (p.Ser172Argfs*3) in one family, c.649dupC (p.Arg217Profs*8) in six families and c.972delA (p.Val325Serfs*12) in one family. These truncating mutations co-segregated exactly with the disease in these families and were not observed in 1,000 control subjects of matched ancestry. PRRT2 is a newly discovered gene consisting of four exons encoding the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2, which encompasses 340 amino acids and contains two predicted transmembrane domains. PRRT2 is highly expressed in the developing nervous system, and a truncating mutation alters the subcellular localization of the PRRT2 protein. The function of PRRT2 and its role in paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia should be further investigated.","dc:creator":"Chen WJ","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Exome sequencing identifies truncating mutations in PRRT2 that cause paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia."},"rdfs:label":"Evaluation of PRRT2 mRNA in Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d9f4e8fa-f4bb-4e0e-9f8d-46a1d5adfead","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e132232e-de2e-4670-937d-7c6673bb242b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"A polyclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the PRRT2 protein was tested in rat and mouse brain lysates.

This study aimed to investigate the disease-causing mechanisms of these PRRT2 mutations. We first documented that Prrt2 was localized at the pre- and post-synaptic membranes with a close spatial association with SNAP25 by synaptic membrane fractionation and immunostaining of the rat neurons. Our results then revealed that the six truncating Prrt2 mutants were accumulated in the cytoplasm and thus failed to target to the cell membrane; the R308C missense mutant had significantly reduced protein expression, suggesting loss-of function effects generated by these mutations. Using in utero electroporation of shRNA into cortical neurons, we further found that knocking down Prrt2 expression in vivo resulted in a delay in neuronal migration during embryonic development and a marked decrease in synaptic density after birth. These pathologic effects and novel disease-causing mechanisms may contribute to the severe clinical symptoms in PRRT2-related diseases.","dc:creator":"Liu YT","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"PRRT2 mutations lead to neuronal dysfunction and neurodevelopmental defects."},"rdfs:label":"PRRT2 Polyclonal Antibody to Detect Presence of PRRT2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9c15556f-505c-4016-a871-f1a0f60f6db4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:da216b7f-3d9a-4be9-b663-6748be90ccfd","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"To investigate expression of the mouse ortholog, authors performed in situ hybridization on postnatal mouse brain tisue by using an antisense PRRT2 probe that was complementary to all known transcripts.

BFIE commonly present between 3 and 12 months of age, carry good response to medication, with seizures remitting by 18 months. PKC is characterized by recurrent and/or brief attacks of involuntary movement characterized by chorea, athetosis and/or other dystonic features, triggered by voluntary movement, with typical onset in childhood through adolescence and gradual reduction in severity and frequency with age. These features (BFIE and PKC) have been documented to occur in the same individuals; the presence of both of these phenotypes is identified as infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA). Loss of function variants have been primarily reported in association with this gene and phenotypes, (most notably the recurrent p.Arg217Profs*8 (c.649dupC) variant) and segregate with disease in several different families in the literature (selected publications- PMID:22101681, 22243967, 22870186, 29215089). Evidence supporting this gene disease pair includes case level and experimental data. Supporting experimental evidence has been reported in mice and rat studies (selected publications- PMID:22101681, 22243967, 27172900). This association between gene and disease has been maintained over time. Of note, instances of individuals have been reported with these phenotypes together and in isolation. Given the age dependent nature of these presentations, it is possible that the manifestations of these features may be separated by many years; initial reporting of individuals with only one of the phenotypes may be a result of age at time of report. In summary, PRRT2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA).
