We report that TACO1 is not required for embryonic survival, although the mutant mice have substantially reduced COXI protein, causing an isolated complex IV deficiency. We show that TACO1 specifically binds the mt-Co1 mRNA and is required for translation of COXI through its association with the mitochondrial ribosome. We determined the atomic structure of TACO1, revealing three domains in the shape of a hook with a tunnel between domains 1 and 3. Mutations in the positively charged domain 1 reduce RNA binding by TACO1. The Taco1 mutant mice develop a late-onset visual impairment, motor dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy and thus provide a useful model for future treatment trials for mitochondrial disease.","dc:creator":"Richman TR","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Loss of the RNA-binding protein TACO1 causes late-onset mitochondrial dysfunction in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Richman function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"LeighMap paper 19 other translational proteins related to LS, increase points to maximum per Mito GCEP biocuration review meeting."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:01d55f8b-08c5-48fc-900b-039d868fae10","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c99b3c09-df83-4778-a9ff-ac49083584ba","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Isolated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency and a defect in the rate of synthesis of the COX I subunit","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19503089","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Defects in mitochondrial translation are among the most common causes of mitochondrial disease, but the mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial translation remain largely unknown. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all mitochondrial mRNAs require specific translational activators, which recognize sequences in 5' UTRs and mediate translation. As mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs do not have significant 5' UTRs, alternate mechanisms must exist to promote translation. We identified a specific defect in the synthesis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded COX I subunit in a pedigree segregating late-onset Leigh syndrome and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. We mapped the defect to chromosome 17q by functional complementation and identified a homozygous single-base-pair insertion in CCDC44, encoding a member of a large family of hypothetical proteins containing a conserved DUF28 domain. CCDC44, renamed TACO1 for translational activator of COX I, shares a notable degree of structural similarity with bacterial homologs, and our findings suggest that it is one of a family of specific mammalian mitochondrial translational activators.","dc:creator":"Weraarpachai W","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutation in TACO1, encoding a translational activator of COX I, results in cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and late-onset Leigh syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Weraarpachai functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:39bbfee8-cc82-4248-8929-a7a0b6683fa9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a50691cb-9500-4a0f-9078-7e586520eeae","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Expression of wild-type TACO1 in subject fibroblasts (homozygous for LOF variant) rescue the COX assembly defect (Fig. 4a), the COX I synthesis defect (Fig. 4b) and COX activity (104% of control).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19503089","rdfs:label":"Weraarpachai rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:ff392619-0588-46f0-8e98-ad7148ac6019","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:88606819-14ec-4619-9310-59446caa69cb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Neuropathological evidence (Purkinje cell loss in cerebellum, atypical finding), mitochondrial dysfunction (demonstrated complex IV deficiency), motor dysfunction (progressive motor decline and incoordination)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27319982","rdfs:label":"Knockout mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5,"dc:description":"Scored neuropathological evidence 0.5 points (Purkinje cell loss in cerebellum, atypical finding), mitochondrial dysfunction 1 point (demonstrated complex IV deficiency), and motor dysfunction 1 point (progressive motor decline and incoordination), per Mito GCEP review meeting"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:14782a32-c55f-4770-98bb-8fe7757772bf_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f77190d0-e0c2-4f5e-80f8-b7bc5b0958aa","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"ID, DD, extrapyramidal signs, regression in walking, dystonia, muscle wasting, rigidity, brisk reflexes, mild nystagmus.

Current routine diagnostic genetic tests fail to establish a diagnosis in many cases. We employed exome sequencing to identify the underlying molecular defects in patients with unresolved but putatively autosomal-recessive disorders in consanguineous families and postulated that the pathogenic variants would reside within homozygous regions. Fifty consanguineous families participated in the study, with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes suggestive of autosomal-recessive inheritance, but with no definitive molecular diagnosis. DNA samples from the patient(s), unaffected sibling(s), and the parents were genotyped with a 720K SNP array. Exome sequencing and array CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) were then performed on one affected individual per family. High-confidence pathogenic variants were found in homozygosity in known disease-causing genes in 18 families (36%) (one by array CGH and 17 by exome sequencing), accounting for the clinical phenotype in whole or in part. In the remainder of the families, no causative variant in a known pathogenic gene was identified. Our study shows that exome sequencing, in addition to being a powerful diagnostic tool, promises to rapidly expand our knowledge of rare genetic Mendelian disorders and can be used to establish more detailed causative links between mutant genotypes and clinical phenotypes.

The TACO1 gene encodes the translational activator of cytochrome c oxidase I protein, which is required for translation of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, a component of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory complex. The TACO1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2009 (PMID: 19503089). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Two loss of function variants in this gene have been reported in two consanguineous families in two publications (PMIDs: 19503089, 25044680). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in five additional family members, and segregation evidence was scored for one family (PMID: 19503089). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of the protein, functional alteration and rescue experiments in patient fibroblasts, and a homozygous knockout mouse model showed complex IV deficiency and a similar phenotype to human patients (PMIDs: 19503089, 27319982). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between TACO1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
