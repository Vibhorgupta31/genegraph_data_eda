We determined the molecular basis of T2 enzyme deficiency in 26 patients at the levels of skin fibroblast enzyme activity, protein integrity, and DNA nucleotide sequence. Thirty different disease-associated alleles were identified. From these data we predicted that T2 in 6 of the 26 patients would have a mild effect on the enzyme protein and 20 would have a severe effect from their mutant genotypes. The corresponding clinical data were collected (by interviews and questionnaires) for the patients in the two groups. We found that genotype does not predict clinical severity and mutant sibs can have different clinical phenotypes; there were no consistent differences in clinical severity between patients with null-conferring or residual-conferring genotypes for T2 activity; only the absence of or a low urinary excretion of tiglyglycine during ketoacidosis correlated with a mild genotype. In general, T2 deficiency has a favorable outcome and 23 of 26 patients developed normally; one died during the first ketoacidotic episode and two have developmental delay. The median age at onset for the first ketoacidotic episode is 15 months (range 3 days to 48 months). The frequency of attacks falls with age, the last in our series occurring at 10 years of age; 11 patients had only one episode and 3 patients had none.

Although no significant residual activity was detected, mutant proteins were detected in the N158D, N158S, R208Q, Y219H and N282H mutants. Accumulation of these mutant proteins was temperature-sensitive with the highest expression levels at lower temperatures. Expression of Q73P and N353K cDNAs yielded neither residual T2 protein nor enzyme activity. An E252del mutant T2 was detected with a relative protein amount and enzyme activity of 30% and 25%, respectively, in comparison to the wild-type at 37 degrees C. The E252del mutant protein was more stable at 30 degrees C expression than 37 degrees C, but was essentially undetectable at 40 degrees C, indicating its temperature-sensitive instability. Kinetic studies revealed a twofold K(m) elevation for substrates coenzyme A and acetoacetyl-CoA in the E252del mutant, while V(max) was comparable to the wild-type. We conclude that the E252del is a temperature-sensitive K(m) mutant.

We analyzed the molecular basis of 3KTD in two generations of a family. A boy (patient 2, GK04), his father (patient 1, GK05), his mother, and his brother were studied; three mutant alleles of T2 gene were identified. Patient 1 is a compound heterozygote: one allele has a point mutation of G to A at position 547 on his T2 cDNA, causing Gly150 to Arg substitution of the mature T2 subunit, and the other allele has GT to TT transition at the 5' splice site of intron 8, causing exon 8's skipping of the T2 cDNA. Patient 2 is also a compound heterozygote: one allele inherited from his mother has AG to CG transition at the 3' splice site of intron 10, causing exon 11's skipping of the T2 cDNA, and the other allele derived from patient 1 has the G to A mutation (Gly to Arg). The brother of patient 2 is an obligatory carrier with the mutant allele causing the exon 8 skipping.

Protein analyses showed that GK10's T2 protein was undetectable in fibroblasts even with the pulse-protein labeling method and that his parents were carriers of 3KTD. Complementary DNA analyses with PCR showed that T2 cDNA in the patient lacked the normal exon 11 sequence and that his parents were obligatory carriers of the DNA sequence which canceled exon 11. When the PCR-amplified genomic fragments around exon 11 were sequenced, an AG to AC mutation at the 3' splice site of intron 10 was detected.
