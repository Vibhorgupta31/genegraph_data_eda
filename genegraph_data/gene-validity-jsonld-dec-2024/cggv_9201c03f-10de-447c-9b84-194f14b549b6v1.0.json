In Asian populations, 2 mutational analysis studies have been performed in all exons of GBA; one study in a Japanese population showed the highest odds ratio among all ethnic groups, whereas the other study in ethnic Chinese observed a trend of a higher frequency of GBA mutation in PD patients without statistical significance. To investigate whether there is an association between PD and mutations of GBA in a Korean population, we analyzed mutations of GBA and compared mutation frequencies between Korean PD patients and a control population. We analyzed mutations in GBA by sequencing exons of GBA in 277 Korean PD patients and 291 control subjects. All exons of GBA were sequenced in all PD cases and 100 control subjects. Exon 2 and exons 5-11, where mutations of GBA were found in our PD patients, were analyzed in an additional 191 control subjects. Five different pathogenic heterozygous GBA mutations, including N188S, P201H, R257Q, S271G, and L444P, were identified in 9 PD cases (3.2%), whereas there were no GBA mutations found in control subjects (p<0.01, OR 20.6, 95% CI 1.2-356.4).

However, it is unknown whether the increased risk of Parkinson's disease in GBA carriers is due to a loss of glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity. We measured glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots in patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 517) and controls (n = 252) with and without GBA mutations. Participants were recruited from Columbia University, New York, and fully sequenced for GBA mutations and genotyped for the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, the most common autosomal dominant mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots was measured by a mass spectrometry-based assay and compared among participants categorized by GBA mutation status and Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Parkinson's disease patients were more likely than controls to carry the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (n = 39, 7.5% versus n = 2, 0.8%, P < 0.001) and GBA mutations or variants (seven homozygotes and compound heterozygotes and 81 heterozygotes, 17.0% versus 17 heterozygotes, 6.7%, P < 0.001). GBA homozygotes/compound heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA heterozygotes (0.85 µmol/l/h versus 7.88 µmol/l/h, P < 0.001), and GBA heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA and LRRK2 non-carriers (7.88 µmol/l/h versus 11.93 µmol/l/h, P < 0.001). Glucocerebrosidase activity was reduced in heterozygotes compared to non-carriers when each mutation was compared independently (N370S, P < 0.001; L444P, P < 0.001; 84GG, P = 0.003; R496H, P = 0.018) and also reduced in GBA variants associated with Parkinson's risk but not with Gaucher disease (E326K, P = 0.009; T369M, P < 0.001). When all patients with Parkinson's disease were considered, they had lower mean glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity than controls (11.14 µmol/l/h versus 11.85 µmol/l/h, P = 0.011). Difference compared to controls persisted in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (after exclusion of all GBA and LRRK2 carriers; 11.53 µmol/l/h, versus 12.11 µmol/l/h, P = 0.036) and after adjustment for age and gender (P = 0.012). Interestingly, LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n = 36), most of whom had Parkinson's disease, had higher enzymatic activity than non-carriers (13.69 µmol/l/h versus 11.93 µmol/l/h, P = 0.002). In patients with idiopathic Parkinson's, higher glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity was associated with longer disease duration (P = 0.002) in adjusted models, suggesting a milder disease course. We conclude that lower glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity is strongly associated with GBA mutations, and modestly with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The association of lower glucocerebrosidase activity in both GBA mutation carriers and Parkinson's patients without GBA mutations suggests that loss of glucocerebrosidase function contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. High glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in LRRK2 G2019S carriers may reflect a distinct pathogenic mechanism. Taken together, these data suggest that glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity could be a modifiable therapeutic target.

This dysregulation was due to decreased GBA1 (β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase)) lysosomal enzyme activity in patient derived neurons, and could be rescued by increasing enzyme activity with a GCase modulator. These defects resulted in disrupted mitochondrial distribution and function, and could be further rescued by TBC1D15 in Parkinson's patient derived GBA1-linked neurons. Together, our work demonstrates a potential role of mitochondria-lysosome contacts as an upstream regulator of mitochondrial function and dynamics in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in GBA1-linked Parkinson's disease.","dc:creator":"Kim S","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Dysregulation of mitochondria-lysosome contacts by GBA1 dysfunction in dopaminergic neuronal models of Parkinson's disease."},"rdfs:label":"GCase in iPSC-derived dop. neurons and isogenic controls"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4347,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:760a8819-b82f-4195-8417-7fef7d2e968e","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005180","gene":"hgnc:4177","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"In 1987, biallelic *GBA* pathogenic variants were first linked to Gaucher's disease (Tsuji et al. 1987, PMID: 2880291), which is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. However, it was noted that several of these probands with Gaucher's disease also had parkinsonian features and an unexpectedly high number of obligate (heterozygous) carrier relatives had Parkinson's disease. *GBA* was first systematically reported in relation to Parkinson's disease in 2004 (Aharon-Peretz et al. 2004, PMID: 15525722; Goker-Alpan et al. 2004, PMID: 15591280). Parkinson's disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra, and the presence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus in most cases. Signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include tremor which is most pronounced during rest, muscle rigidity, slowing of the voluntary movements (bradykinesia), a tendency to fall back (postural instability). Different pathogenic *GBA* variants occur in 7–15% of PD patients (Blandini et al. 2019, PMID: 30589955; Sidranski et al. 2009, PMID: 19846850) and the PD risk increase is between 2- to 15-fold for carriers of *GBA* variants depending on the severity of the respective change (Gan-Or et al. 2015, PMID: 25653295). Thus, *GBA*-linked Parkinson's disease shows either a highly reduced penetrance or can be considered as a strong genetic risk factor. Several variants have been linked to Parkinson's disease, including those variants that in the biallelic stage have been shown to cause different forms of Gaucher's disease, seven of these variants (missense, frameshift, splice site, complex rearrangements) are included in this curation. The evidence for additional variants from the literature was not included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The *GBA* gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide (Glc-Cer) to ceramide and glucose. Reduced GCase activity has repeatedly been shown in mutant patient-derived and non-patient cells suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism (Alcalay et al. 2015, PMID: 26117366; Li et al.  2019, PMID: 30160596; Kim et al. 2021, PMID: 33753743). On the other hand, specific effects of mutant GBA protein on mitochondrial priming and autophagy induction indicate a gain-of-toxic-function (Li et al.  2019, PMID: 30160596). This effect may be attributed to the ER retention of mutant GBA, resulting in an unfolded protein response (Bendikov-Bar et al. 2011, PMID: 21106416). Furthermore, it has been repeatedly shown that mutant GBA promotes the accumulation of alpha-synuclein which is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (Schöndorf et al. 2014, PMID: 24905578). Following gene correction of the *GBA* mutations, the alpha-synuclein levels/accumulation were reduced to normal values (Schöndorf et al. 2014, PMID: 24905578). Notably,  genomic multiplication (i.e. over-expression) of the alpha-synuclein gene (*SNCA*) is another well-established cause of Parkinson's disease. In summary, mutations in *GBA* are definitively causing autosomal-dominant Parkinson´s disease but with highly reduced penetrance. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Parkinson’s Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 19th, 2022.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9201c03f-10de-447c-9b84-194f14b549b6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
