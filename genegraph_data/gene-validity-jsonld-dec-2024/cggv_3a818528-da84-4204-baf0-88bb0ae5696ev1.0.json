The patient presented with a multisystemic disorder characterized by muscular hypotonia, seizures, developmental retardation and death at the age of 2 years. The isoelectric focusing pattern of the patient's serum transferrin showed the partial loss of complete N-glycan side chains, which is a characteristic sign for CDG-I. Analysis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides in patient-derived fibroblasts revealed an accumulation of Man3GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man4GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. Determination of mannosyltransferase activities of early steps of lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis in fibroblasts indicated that the patient was deficient in elongating Man3GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. These findings gave rise to genetic analysis of the hALG11 cDNA, in which homozygosity for mutation c.T257C (p.L86S) was identified. Verification of the mutation as a primary cause for the genetic defect was proved by retroviral expression of human wild-type and mutated ALG11 cDNA in patient-derived fibroblasts as well as using a yeast alg11 deletion strain as a heterologous expression system for hALG11 variants. Immunofluorescence examinations combined with western blotting showed no differences of intracellular localization or expression of ALG11 between control and patient fibroblasts, respectively, indicating no mislocalization or degradation of the mutated transferase.","dc:creator":"Rind N","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"A severe human metabolic disease caused by deficiency of the endoplasmatic mannosyltransferase hALG11 leads to congenital disorder of glycosylation-Ip."},"rdfs:label":"Rind et al.

This biosynthetic pathway is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. While complementary genetic and bioinformatic approaches have enabled identification of most of the dolichol pathway enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the roles of two of the mannosyltransferases in the pathway, Alg2 and Alg11, have remained ambiguous because these enzymes appear to catalyze only two of the remaining four unannotated transformations. To address this issue, a biochemical approach was taken using recombinant Alg2 and Alg11 from S. cerevisiae and defined dolichylpyrophosphate-linked substrates. A cell-membrane fraction isolated from Escherichia coli overexpressing thioredoxin-tagged Alg2 was used to demonstrate that this enzyme actually carries out an alpha1,3-mannosylation, followed by an alpha1,6-mannosylation, to form the first branched pentasaccharide intermediate of the pathway. Then, using thioredoxin-tagged Alg2 for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of the dolichylpyrophosphate pentasaccharide, it was thus possible to define the biochemical function of Alg11, which is to catalyze the next two sequential alpha1,2-mannosylations. The elucidation of the dual function of each of these enzymes thus completes the identification of the entire ensemble of glycosyltransferases that comprise the dolichol pathway.","dc:creator":"O'Reilly MK","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"In vitro evidence for the dual function of Alg2 and Alg11: essential mannosyltransferases in N-linked glycoprotein biosynthesis."},"rdfs:label":"O'Reilly In Vitro functional alteration of ALG11"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3a818528-da84-4204-baf0-88bb0ae5696e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1aacdf27-fbe5-401d-aa72-936ac1f9baf4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:12b9b2cf-0fab-4faa-b270-763edacfd6cb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"The expression of the wild-type ALG11 cDNA in the respective patient-derived fibroblasts, the accumulations of the shortened oligosaccharides Man3GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man4GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol were overcome","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22213132","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) comprise a clinically and biochemically heterogeneous group of monogenetic-inherited, multisystemic diseases that affect the biosynthesis of N- and/or O-glycans linked to glycoconjugates.

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ALG11-CDG by Rind et al. in 2010 (PMID:20080937). At least 14 unique variants (missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands from 7 publications (PMIDs:20080937, 22213132, 28649519, 28122681, 30676690, 35907674, 36843332). Patient symptoms include failure to thrive, developmental delay, hepatopathy, hypotonia/neurologic abnormalities, hypoglycemia, protein-losing enteropathy, eye abnormalities, immunologic findings, skin abnormalities, a type 1 asialotransferrin profile, and skeletal results. No supporting segregation information is available. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of ALG11, which is a mannosyltransferase that uses GDP-mannose to sequentially add the fourth and fifth mannose residues to growing dolichol-linked oligosaccharide side chains at the outer leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PMID: 20080937). Functional alteration of non-patient cells also shows that mutations in the ALG11 gene resulted in variable degrees of impairment in Alg11 activity and N-linked glycosylation (PMID: 16878994). Finally, rescue in patient cells shows that the expression of the wild-type ALG11 cDNA in the respective patient-derived fibroblasts overcomes the accumulations of the shortened oligosaccharides Man3GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man4GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol (PMID: 22213132).\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence, genetic and experimental, is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. A classification of moderate was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on 06/21/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3a818528-da84-4204-baf0-88bb0ae5696e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
