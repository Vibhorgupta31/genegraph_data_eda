Physiological Ca(2+) signaling regulates aerobic metabolism, whereas pathological Ca(2+) overload triggers cell death. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is mediated by the Ca(2+) uniporter complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which comprises MCU, a Ca(2+)-selective ion channel, and its regulator, MICU1. Here we report mutations of MICU1 in individuals with a disease phenotype characterized by proximal myopathy, learning difficulties and a progressive extrapyramidal movement disorder. In fibroblasts from subjects with MICU1 mutations, agonist-induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake at low cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations was increased, and cytosolic Ca(2+) signals were reduced. Although resting mitochondrial membrane potential was unchanged in MICU1-deficient cells, the mitochondrial network was severely fragmented. Whereas the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophy and the core myopathies involves abnormal mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling, the phenotype associated with MICU1 deficiency is caused by a primary defect in mitochondrial Ca(2+) signaling, demonstrating the crucial role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in humans.","dc:creator":"Logan CV","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Loss-of-function mutations in MICU1 cause a brain and muscle disorder linked to primary alterations in mitochondrial calcium signaling."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c9276ee-39e6-408f-9ae0-a4c3000f3089_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93439cf0-6c4b-4c80-a006-41a3ada6053d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93439cf0-6c4b-4c80-a006-41a3ada6053d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7208e4df-9502-4d62-a807-4d2ac264b71d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001195518.2(MICU1):c.735+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10575625"}},"detectionMethod":"Homozygous for c.741+1G>A (Val248Thrfs*9)\n(NM_006077.3)\n(AKA NM_001195518.2 c.735+1G>A)\n\nAF in gnomAD 0.00005073 (no homozygotes – all European)\n","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003201","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002131","obo:HP_0003198"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:78196337-d91b-4a36-a4e8-1de16869e180_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7208e4df-9502-4d62-a807-4d2ac264b71d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24336167"},"rdfs:label":"Logan et al 2014, LUMC1"},{"id":"cggv:78196337-d91b-4a36-a4e8-1de16869e180","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78196337-d91b-4a36-a4e8-1de16869e180_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:78196337-d91b-4a36-a4e8-1de16869e180_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"cDNA sequencing by RT PCR confirmed splice variant resulted in an insertion leading to premature stop codon on both alleles \n\n(significant MICU1 mRNA loss)\n"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"cDNA sequencing by RT PCR confirmed splice variant resulted in an insertion leading to premature stop codon on both alleles \n\n(significant MICU1 mRNA loss)\n\nScore default 1.5 for null"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9760fcdb-2eef-497d-b2bb-3a060502c504_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9760fcdb-2eef-497d-b2bb-3a060502c504","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3d6fef8b-0a47-4707-bb84-701e3012a1f3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001195518.2(MICU1):c.547C>T (p.Gln183Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5550207"}},"detectionMethod":"Homozygous for c.547C>T; p.

Similar to afflicted patients, viable MICU1(-/-) mice manifest marked ataxia and muscle weakness. Early in life, these animals display a range of biochemical abnormalities, including increased resting mitochondrial calcium levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, and reduced ATP. Older MICU1(-/-) mice show marked, spontaneous improvement coincident with improved mitochondrial calcium handling and an age-dependent reduction in EMRE expression. Remarkably, deleting one allele of EMRE helps normalize calcium uptake while simultaneously rescuing the high perinatal mortality observed in young MICU1(-/-) mice. Together, these results demonstrate that MICU1 serves as a molecular gatekeeper preventing calcium overload and suggests that modulating the calcium uniporter could have widespread therapeutic benefits.","dc:creator":"Liu JC","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"MICU1 Serves as a Molecular Gatekeeper to Prevent In Vivo Mitochondrial Calcium Overload."},"rdfs:label":"Crispr MICU1-/- mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Score 1.5 points for knockout and abnormal calcium flux studies + rescue\nScore 1.5 points for mouse phenotype of embryonic lethality and ataxia + myopathy in surviving MICU1-/- mice"},{"id":"cggv:24b185b6-a4dd-4a0f-8d53-ae580ebe026a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ada615e6-f8b5-45f4-af37-e1a6ae33dba9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice should abnormal calcium flux and diminished function on rotarod test and grip test","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35302860","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca","dc:creator":"Singh R","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Uncontrolled mitochondrial calcium uptake underlies the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in MICU1-deficient mice and patients."},"rdfs:label":"Neuron KO of MICU1 in Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score 0.5 for calcium flux abnormalities, Score 0.5 for phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8377,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f834c13d-d29c-454d-986e-70daa6ea07fa","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:1530","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MICU1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 20, 2023. *MICU1* encodes mitochondrial calcium uptake protein 1. This is a key regulator of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a multi-subunit calcium channel of the mitochondrial inner membrane. MICU1 senses calcium levels via its EF-hand domains.\n\n*MICU1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2014 (PMID: 24336167).  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MICU1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the MICU1 phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. \n\nEvidence supporting the relationship between *MICU1* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two nonsense variants and two splicing / frameshift variants resulting in truncation observed in four probands in three publications (PMIDs: 24336167, 29721912, 33969448). All cases included in this curation were homozygous for the variant, and parents were confirmed carriers.  There are additional cases reported in the medical literature (PMIDs: 33428302, 32395406, 36425804, 27123478), including individuals with exonic level deletions, however these were not included in this curation as the maximum genetic evidence score was reached. Age of onset is typically in early childhood but can also be seen up to adulthood. Clinical features in affected individuals include myopathy, developmental delay, ataxia, extrapyramidal signs, chorea, tremor, dystonia, microcephaly, neuropathy, optic atrophy, and ophthalmoplegia. \n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by a expression in brain and muscle, and several mouse models showing the impact of *MICU1* knockout on mitochondrial calcium uptake (PMIDs: 24336167, 27477272, 35302860).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MICU1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 20, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4c9276ee-39e6-408f-9ae0-a4c3000f3089"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
