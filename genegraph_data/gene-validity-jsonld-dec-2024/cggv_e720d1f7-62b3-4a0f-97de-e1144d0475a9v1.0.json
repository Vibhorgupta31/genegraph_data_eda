Bi-allelic mutations in MRE11 are associated with the recessive Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder 1. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split MRE11 into two separate curations - one for the recessive Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder 1 and the second for hereditary breast cancer (refute the association with breast cancer) described here. Evidence refuting this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data, while experimental data supports the role of MRE11 in DNA damage repair. \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 POINTS**\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 4 case-control studies at the aggregate variant level and 1 case-control cohort at the single variant level. In 2021, two large case-control studies [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) and BCAC (PMID: 33471991); both with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in MRE11 and breast cancer. Likewise, another large case-control study published in 2017 (Couch et al. PMID: 28418444) screened breast cancer cases from commercial laboratories and did not find significant association of pathogenic mutations in MRE11 with breast cancer. Two more case-control studies with smaller case and control sizes also showed no association of LOF or missense MRE11 variants with breast cancer (PMID: 29368209 and 29678143). \n\n**Summary of Experimental Data: 1 POINTS**\n\nWhile case control studies did not support the gene-disease association, there is experimental evidence showing the role of MRE11 in double-strand DNA break repair (0.5 point, PMID:9651580). Another study reported reduced MRE11 expression in breast cancer tissues (0.5 point, PMID:14511253).   \n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MRE11 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 10/25/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 2/17/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\n\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MRE11 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.
