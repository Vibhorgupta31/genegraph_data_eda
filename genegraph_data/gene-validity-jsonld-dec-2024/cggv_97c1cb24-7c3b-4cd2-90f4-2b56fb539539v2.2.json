Here we studied nine LGMD-affected families from Finland, the United States and Italy and identified four dominant missense mutations leading to p.Phe93Leu or p.Phe89Ile changes in the ubiquitously expressed co-chaperone DNAJB6. Functional testing in vivo showed that the mutations have a dominant toxic effect mediated specifically by the cytoplasmic isoform of DNAJB6. In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutations increase the half-life of DNAJB6, extending this effect to the wild-type protein, and reduce its protective anti-aggregation effect. Further, we show that DNAJB6 interacts with members of the CASA complex, including the myofibrillar myopathy-causing protein BAG3. Our data identify the genetic cause of LGMD1D, suggest that its pathogenesis is mediated by defective chaperone function and highlight how mutations in a ubiquitously expressed gene can exert effects in a tissue-, isoform- and cellular compartment-specific manner.","dc:creator":"Sarparanta J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations affecting the cytoplasmic functions of the co-chaperone DNAJB6 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy."},"rdfs:label":"DNAJB6_sarparanta"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5c68ec67-689d-41dd-af98-40d3de15d2e6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a263186e-74b7-48db-ae83-680b8854523d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mutations F91I and F91L show significant reduction of the anti-aggregation function compared to the wild-type","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26338452","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"DNAJB6 is the causative gene for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1D (LGMD1D). Four different coding missense mutations, p.F89I, p.F93I, p.F93L, and p.P96R, have been reported in families from Europe, North America and Asia. The previously known mutations cause mainly adult-onset proximal muscle weakness with moderate progression and without respiratory involvement. A Finnish family and a British patient have been studied extensively due to a severe muscular dystrophy. The patients had childhood-onset LGMD, loss of ambulation in early adulthood and respiratory involvement; one patient died of respiratory failure aged 32. Two novel mutations, c.271T > A (p.F91I) and c.271T > C (p.F91L), in DNAJB6 were identified by whole exome sequencing as a cause of this severe form of LGMD1D. The results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The anti-aggregation effect of the mutant DNAJB6 was investigated in a filter-trap based system using transient transfection of mammalian cell lines and polyQ-huntingtin as a model for an aggregation-prone protein. Both novel mutant proteins show a significant loss of ability to prevent aggregation.

This association was made using case-level, segregation, and experimental data. The *DNAJB6* gene is located on chromosome 7q36.3 . The shorter transcript (DNAJB6b) referred to in the literature (NM_005494.3) is 1571 bp long encoding a 241-amino acid protein. Thirteen pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy (AD-LGMD) are recorded in ClinVar, all of them being gain of function variants such as missense variants. Patients with AD-LGMD due to *DNAJB6* variants show proximal muscle weakness with an age of onset ranging from second to fifth decade, difficulty in walking and running with loss of ambulation in some, foot drop, mild to severe respiratory issues, increased serum creatine kinase levels, and a muscle biopsy showing dystrophic changes. *DNAJB6* was first reported as an LGMD disease causing gene by Harms et al (PMID: 22334415).\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 17 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 22366786, 22334415, 26338452, 26205529, 23394708). Variants in the gene segregated with the disease. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\nThe mechanism for disease is gain of function.\nSummary of Experimental Data (3 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models and functional assays. *DNAJB6* encodes for a protein that acts as a molecular chaperone by stimulating ATPase activity. Sarparanta et al. 2012 (PMID: 22366786) studied *DNAJB6* variants in vivo and in vitro showing that the mutations in vivo show a dominant toxic effect mediated specifically by the cytoplasmic isoform of *DNAJB6*. While in vitro studies demonstrated that the mutations increase the half-life of *DNAJB6* and reduce its protective anti-aggregation effect.\nIn summary, this gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:97c1cb24-7c3b-4cd2-90f4-2b56fb539539"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
