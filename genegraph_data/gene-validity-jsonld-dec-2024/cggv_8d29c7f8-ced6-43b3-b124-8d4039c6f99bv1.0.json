PAH is a group of diseases characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure.\n\nSummary of Genetic Evidence: Seven missense, one frameshift, one stop-gain, and one splice variant have been reported in *KLK1* (Zhu et al., PMID: 31727138). These 10 probands were identified using exome sequencing in a large cohort from the National Biological Sample and Data Repository for PAH (n = 2572 cases). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence: This gene-disease association is supported by an expression experiment (PMID: 17573418). This study showed the expression of *KLK1* in adult lung tissues. \n\nIn summary, the evidence for a gene-disease relationship between *KLK1* and autosomal dominant PAH is limited.
