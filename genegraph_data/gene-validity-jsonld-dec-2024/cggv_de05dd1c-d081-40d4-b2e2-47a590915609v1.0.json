We describe here a mutation in the mouse Hbb-b2 gene, denoted Plt12, that precisely mimics the human hemoglobin Hotel Dieu variant. The mutation results in increased affinity of Hb for oxygen and Plt12 mutant mice exhibited reduced partial pressure of O(2) in the blood, accompanied by erythrocytosis characterized by elevated erythropoietin levels and splenomegaly with excess erythropoiesis. Most homozygous Hbb-b2(Plt12/Plt12) mice succumbed to early lethality associated with emphysema, cardiac abnormalities, and liver degeneration. Survivors displayed a marked thrombocytopenia without significant deficiencies in the numbers of megakaryocytes or megakaryocyte progenitor cells. The lifespan of platelets in the circulation of Hbb-b2(Plt12/Plt12) mice was normal, and splenectomy did not correct the thrombocytopenia, suggesting that increased sequestration was unlikely to be a major contributor. These data, together with the observation that megakaryocytes in Hbb-b2(Plt12/Plt12) mice appeared smaller and deficient in cytoplasm, support a model in which hypoxia causes thrombocytopenia as a consequence of an inability of megakaryocytes, once formed, to properly mature and produce sufficient platelets. The Plt12 mouse is a model of high O(2)-affinity hemoglobinopathy and provides insights into hematopoiesis under conditions of chronic hypoxia.","dc:creator":"Kauppi M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Thrombocytopenia and erythrocytosis in mice with a mutation in the gene encoding the hemoglobin Î² minor chain."},"rdfs:label":"Kauppi_Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"GCEP decided to downgrade the points since this mouse model does not exactly recapitulate the human phenotype"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:de05dd1c-d081-40d4-b2e2-47a590915609_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8547,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f1e016da-6543-4cdc-8bc1-1aac8899de8f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0054801","gene":"hgnc:4827","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*HBB* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant erythrocytosis 6 in 1968 (Stamatoyannopoulos et al., PMID: 17795074). Erythrocytosis 6 is a disorder of the blood characterized by a high concentration of erythrocytes in the blood and an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability in erythrocytosis 6 relative to other disease entities associated with *HBB*. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple curations; AD erythrocytosis, AD and AR beta-thalassemia, hemoglobin M disease, and unstable hemoglobin disease. This curation addresses only AD erythrocytosis. This curation includes at least 43 missense, 2 nonsense, and 1 indel variants reported in 46 probands with AD erythrocytosis in 25 publications (PMIDs: 17795074, 2363414, 2272838, 1814856, 12908805, 14649314, 15727901, 16282896, 16987804, 18818920, 21077764, 21250878, 23859443, 23859762, 24482100, 24200101, 27312559, 27651169, 27250824, 28332377, 31657650, 31132167, 32151172, 34167411, 35052472).\n\nThis gene disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including expression, biochemical function, protein-protein interactions, functional alteration of patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 11747442, 6644819, 3997804, 22203977). In summary, *HBB* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant erythrocytosis 6. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on 9/27/2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:de05dd1c-d081-40d4-b2e2-47a590915609"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
