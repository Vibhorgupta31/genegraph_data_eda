Here we uncover the genetic basis of these two syndromes, demonstrating that both clinically distinct entities are allelic for recessive mutations in the gene PNPLA6. In five of seven Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome/Gordon Holmes syndrome families, we identified nine rare conserved and damaging mutations by applying whole exome sequencing. Further, by dissecting the complex clinical presentation of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome and Gordon Holmes syndrome into its neurological system components, we set out to analyse an additional 538 exomes from families with ataxia (with and without hypogonadism), pure and complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. We identified four additional PNPLA6 mutations in spastic ataxia and hereditary spastic paraplegia families, revealing that Boucher-Neuhäuser and Gordon Holmes syndromes in fact represent phenotypic clusters on a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases caused by mutations in PNPLA6. Structural analysis indicates that the majority of mutations falls in the C-terminal phospholipid esterase domain and likely inhibits the catalytic activity of PNPLA6, which provides the precursor for biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Our findings show that PNPLA6 influences a manifold of neuronal systems, from the retina to the cerebellum, upper and lower motor neurons and the neuroendocrine system, with damage of this protein causing an extraordinarily broad continuous spectrum of associated neurodegenerative disease.

Later evaluation demonstrated hypothyroidism and GH deficiency. Neurologic investigations revealed lack of coordination of the distal extremities, unsteady gait, and cerebellar and pyramidal signs, including absent deep reflexes and an extensor plantar reflex. Electromyography was consistent with peripheral neuropathy, and so the diagnosis of Laurence-Moon syndrome was also strongly considered. Brain computerized tomography (CT) scan at age 40 showed an empty sella, while the pituitary had appeared normal at 21 years of age.

Although studies on animal models, including mice and Drosophila, have extended our understanding of PNPLA6, its roles in neural development and in HSP are not clearly understood. Here, we describe the generation of a vertebrate model of PNPLA6 insufficiency using morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Pnpla6 knockdown resulted in developmental abnormalities and motor neuron defects, including axon truncation and branching. The phenotypes in pnpla6 knockdown morphants were rescued by the introduction of wild-type, but not mutant, human PNPLA6 mRNA. Our results also revealed the involvement of BMP signaling in pnpla6 knockdown phenotypes. Taken together, these results demonstrate an important role of PNPLA6 in motor neuron development and implicate overexpression of BMP signaling as a possible mechanism underlying the developmental defects in pnpla6 morphants.","dc:creator":"Song Y","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Knockdown of Pnpla6 protein results in motor neuron defects in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"Zebrafish morpholino-mediated knockdown "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduced score due to zebrafish morphants not showing several major features seen in patients."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6293,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"cggv:af704d86-5fd8-46fd-9fc3-89607c923b3a","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100155","gene":"hgnc:16268","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The PNPLA6 gene is located on chromosome 19 at 19p13.2 and encodes the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6, which deacetylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine to produce glycerophosphocholine. PNPLA6 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy-ataxia-pituitary hormone abnormalities-hypogonadism (RAPH) syndrome in 2014 (Synofzik et al., PMID: 24355708). The major features of this disorder include pituitary hormone abnormalities which involve growth hormone deficiency resulting in short stature, as well as hypothyroidism. Additional features reported in multiple patients include lower limb spasticity, distal muscle wasting, cerebellar atrophy, increased patellar reflexes, neuropathy, trichomegaly, alopecia, and mild cognitive impairment. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability in the following disease entities which ended up being lumped into one disease entity: Boucher-Neuhauser syndrome (OMIM:215470), Oliver-McFarlane syndrome (OMIM:275400), Laurence-Moon syndrome (OMIM:245800), and Gordon-Holmes syndrome (no OMIM entry, but Orphanet lists this as cerebellar ataxia hypogonadism syndrome (ORPHA:1173). The disorder listed in OMIM as spastic paraplegia 39, autosomal recessive (OMIM:612020) was split from the aforementioned lumped entity due to significant phenotypic variability and has been curated separately as PNPLA6-related spastic paraplegia with or without ataxia. Thirteen variants (eight missense, one essential splice site, three frameshift, and one tandem intragenic duplication of multiple exons) that have been reported in nine probands in three publications (Synofzik et al., 2014, PMID: 24355708; Topaloglu et al., 2014, PMID: 25033069; Hufnagel et el., 2015, PMID: 25480986) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a zebrafish knockdown animal model which has fewer motor axons as well as increased defects in axon branching and truncation, a feature that correlates with axonal neuropathy seen in some patients (Song et al., 2013, PMID: 22996643). In addition, several variants seen in patients were unable to rescue the zebrafish morphant phenotype (PMID: 25480986). In summary, PNPLA6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RAPH syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 11.02.2022 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bcc502f3-e49f-4549-ba75-782235974d21"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
