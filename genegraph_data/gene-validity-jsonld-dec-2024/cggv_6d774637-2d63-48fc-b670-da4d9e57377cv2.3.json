It represents the most severe clinical phenotype in a spectrum of diseases associated with abnormal post-translational processing of a-dystroglycan that share a defect in laminin-binding glycan synthesis1. Although mutations in six genes have been identified as causes of WWS, only half of all individuals with the disease can currently be diagnosed on this basis2. A cell fusion complementation assay in fibroblasts from undiagnosed individuals with WWS was used to identify five new complementation groups. Further evaluation of one group by linkage analysis and targeted sequencing identified recessive mutations in the ISPD gene (encoding isoprenoid synthase domain containing). The pathogenicity of the identified ISPD mutations was shown by complementation of fibroblasts with wild-type ISPD. Finally, we show that recessive mutations in ISPD abolish the initial step in laminin-binding glycan synthesis by disrupting dystroglycan O-mannosylation. This establishes a new mechanism for WWS pathophysiology.","dc:creator":"Willer T","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"ISPD loss-of-function mutations disrupt dystroglycan  O-mannosylation and cause Walker-Warburg syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Willer_Rescue in patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3b968ae0-0ff7-470f-9a6f-99b7a1e174cf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d73eaec-4beb-43d2-a216-69c229ff0e0d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35422047","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Ribitol-phosphate modification is crucial for the functional maturation of α-dystroglycan. Its dysfunction is associated with muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system abnormalities; however, no effective treatments are currently available for diseases caused by ribitol-phosphate defects. In this study, we demonstrate that prodrug treatments can ameliorate muscular dystrophy caused by defects in isoprenoid synthase domain containing (ISPD), which encodes an enzyme that synthesizes CDP-ribitol, a donor substrate for ribitol-phosphate modification. We generated skeletal muscle-selective Ispd conditional knockout mice, leading to a pathogenic reduction in CDP-ribitol levels, abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, and severe muscular dystrophy. Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene replacement experiments suggested that the recovery of CDP-ribitol levels rescues the ISPD-deficient pathology. As a prodrug treatment strategy, we developed a series of membrane-permeable CDP-ribitol derivatives, among which tetraacetylated CDP-ribitol ameliorated the dystrophic pathology. In addition, the prodrug successfully rescued abnormal α-dystroglycan glycosylation in patient fibroblasts. Consequently, our findings provide proof-of-concept for supplementation therapy with CDP-ribitol and could accelerate the development of therapeutic agents for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by glycosylation defects.","dc:creator":"Tokuoka H","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"CDP-ribitol prodrug treatment ameliorates ISPD-deficient muscular dystrophy mouse model."},"rdfs:label":"Ispd-cKO mice gene replacement"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f8b7f319-54c5-4671-a1fe-201eb0363978","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:431c126e-8ac2-4a2f-a27a-0dd2af5438ed","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"ISPD-deficient cells were established by using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of HCT116 cells, a colon cancer cell line known to express the laminin-binding glycans on αDG .

Their hallmark is a reduction in the functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which can be detected in muscle biopsies. An important part of this glycosylation is a unique O-mannosylation, essential for the interaction of α-dystroglycan with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin-α2. Mutations in eight genes coding for proteins in the glycosylation pathway are responsible for ∼50% of dystroglycanopathy cases. Despite multiple efforts using traditional positional cloning, the causative genes for unsolved dystroglycanopathy cases have escaped discovery for several years. In a recent collaborative study, we discovered that loss-of-function recessive mutations in a novel gene, called isoprenoid synthase domain containing (ISPD), are a relatively common cause of Walker-Warburg syndrome. In this article, we report the involvement of the ISPD gene in milder dystroglycanopathy phenotypes ranging from congenital muscular dystrophy to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and identified allelic ISPD variants in nine cases belonging to seven families. In two ambulant cases, there was evidence of structural brain involvement, whereas in seven, the clinical manifestation was restricted to a dystrophic skeletal muscle phenotype. Although the function of ISPD in mammals is not yet known, mutations in this gene clearly lead to a reduction in the functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which not only causes the severe Walker-Warburg syndrome but is also a common cause of the milder forms of dystroglycanopathy.","dc:creator":"Cirak S","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"ISPD gene mutations are a common cause of congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 1"},{"id":"cggv:20b7dc37-03f1-4062-b12e-0ed72da435df","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20b7dc37-03f1-4062-b12e-0ed72da435df_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:20b7dc37-03f1-4062-b12e-0ed72da435df_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In case 5 from the same publication, α-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation as suggested by the lack of binding affinity to the glycoepitope-specific antibodies IIH6 and VIA4-1"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:921bf333-c73d-4c82-b47d-79a57a7f43d8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:921bf333-c73d-4c82-b47d-79a57a7f43d8","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a1eedbcc-4c1d-4651-8fd4-4fae2aa32629","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001101426.4(CRPPA):c.1354T>A (p.Ter452Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA154724612"}},"detectionMethod":"Regions of homozygosity-by-descent were identified using high-resolution SNP arrays.

Therefore, the two disease entities have been lumped under \"myopathy caused by variation in CRPPA\".\n\nThis association was made using case-level, segregation, and experimental data. The *CRPPA* gene is located on chromosome 7p21.2. The transcript referred to in the literature (NM_001101426.3) is 5742 bp long with 10 exons encoding a 451-amino acid protein. Thirteen pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (AR-LGMD) are recorded in ClinVar, most of them being predicted loss of function variants such as nonsense, frameshift, deletion/duplication and splicing variants.\nPatients with LGMD due to *CRPPA* variants show symmetrical proximal muscle weakness with an age of onset usually in first or second decade, scapular winging, difficulty in walking and running with loss of ambulation in some, foot drop, mild cardiac and respiratory issues, increased serum creatine kinase levels, and a muscle biopsy showing dystrophic changes. *CRPPA*/*ISPD* was first reported in relation to muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy in 2012 (Willer et al, PMID: 22522420, Roscioli et al, PMID: 22522421) and in relation to LGMD by Cirak et al (PMID:23288328).\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 11 probands in 3 publications (PMID:23288328, 23390185, 22522420). Variants in the gene segregated with the disease in 4 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic mutations abolishing the initial step in laminin-binding glycan synthesis by disrupting dystroglycan O-mannosylation.\nSummary of Experimental Data (4 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, cell models, expression studies, and rescue models. *CRPPA* encodes the Isoprenoid synthase domain containing protein (ISPD) also known as CDP-L-Ribitol Pyrophosphorylase A (CRPPA) protein that is part of the dystroglycan complex (PMID: 26923585). This protein participates in a biochemical reaction to produce CDP-ribitol which is a substrate of *FKTN* during the biosynthesis of the phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide, a carbohydrate structure present in alpha-dystroglycan (*DAG1*), which is required for binding laminin G-like domain-containing extracellular proteins with high affinity.\nTokuoka et al. 2022 (PMID: 35422047) studied the ISPD-deficient mice showing that the Skeletal muscle phenotype of Myf5-Ispd-cKO mice showed muscular dystrophy (HP:0003560), necrotic and regenerating fibers (HP:0003713), central nucleation (HP:0003687), and fibrous connective tissue infiltration (HP:0100297).\nTokuoka et al. 2022 (PMID: 35422047) also examined the ISPD-cKO mice gene replacement after 2 months (12 weeks of age). Western blot analysis revealed no ISPD protein signals in non-injected WT or cKO skeletal muscle, indicating that endogenous ISPD protein levels were below detectable levels in skeletal muscle. Conversely, the skeletal muscles of cKO mice treated with AAV9-MCK-hISPD displayed ISPD protein expression and recovered α-DG glycosylation. In addition, CDP-Rbo levels were dramatically higher in the AAV9-MCK-hISPD-treated skeletal muscles than in non-treated Myf5-Ispd-cKO muscle and several times higher than in non-treated WT skeletal muscle.\nIn summary, this gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP on December 12, 2024.
