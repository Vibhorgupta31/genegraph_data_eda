A particularly severe subgroup first described in 1894, and subsequently called Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, is characterized by progressive pontobulbar palsy, sensorineural hearing loss and respiratory insufficiency. There has been no treatment for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which leads to respiratory failure and usually death during childhood. We recently reported the identification of SLC52A2, encoding riboflavin transporter RFVT2, as a new causative gene for Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. We used both exome and Sanger sequencing to identify SLC52A2 mutations in patients presenting with cranial neuropathies and sensorimotor neuropathy with or without respiratory insufficiency. We undertook clinical, neurophysiological and biochemical characterization of patients with mutations in SLC52A2, functionally analysed the most prevalent mutations and initiated a regimen of high-dose oral riboflavin. We identified 18 patients from 13 families with compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in SLC52A2. Affected individuals share a core phenotype of rapidly progressive axonal sensorimotor neuropathy (manifesting with sensory ataxia, severe weakness of the upper limbs and axial muscles with distinctly preserved strength of the lower limbs), hearing loss, optic atrophy and respiratory insufficiency. We demonstrate that SLC52A2 mutations cause reduced riboflavin uptake and reduced riboflavin transporter protein expression, and we report the response to high-dose oral riboflavin therapy in patients with SLC52A2 mutations, including significant and sustained clinical and biochemical improvements in two patients and preliminary clinical response data in 13 patients with associated biochemical improvements in 10 patients. The clinical and biochemical responses of this SLC52A2-specific cohort suggest that riboflavin supplementation can ameliorate the progression of this neurodegenerative condition, particularly when initiated soon after the onset of symptoms.

Loss-of-function mutations in two riboflavin transporter genes, SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, have recently been linked to Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. However, the genetic frequency, neuropathology and downstream consequences of riboflavin transporter mutations are unclear. By screening a large cohort of 132 patients with early-onset severe sensory, motor and cranial nerve neuropathy we confirmed the strong genetic link between riboflavin transporter mutations and Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, identifying 22 pathogenic mutations in SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, 14 of which were novel. Brain and spinal cord neuropathological examination of two cases with SLC52A3 mutations showed classical symmetrical brainstem lesions resembling pathology seen in mitochondrial disease, including severe neuronal loss in the lower cranial nerve nuclei, anterior horns and corresponding nerves, atrophy of the spinothalamic and spinocerebellar tracts and posterior column-medial lemniscus pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction has previously been implicated in an array of neurodegenerative disorders. Since riboflavin metabolites are critical components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, we hypothesized that reduced riboflavin transport would result in impaired mitochondrial activity, and confirmed this using in vitro and in vivo models. Electron transport chain complex I and complex II activity were decreased in SLC52A2 patient fibroblasts, while global knockdown of the single Drosophila melanogaster riboflavin transporter homologue revealed reduced levels of riboflavin, downstream metabolites, and electron transport chain complex I activity. This in turn led to abnormal mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory chain activity and morphology. Riboflavin transporter knockdown in Drosophila also resulted in severely impaired locomotor activity and reduced lifespan, mirroring patient pathology, and these phenotypes could be partially rescued using a novel esterified derivative of riboflavin. Our findings expand the genetic, clinical and neuropathological features of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, implicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a downstream consequence of riboflavin transporter gene defects, and validate riboflavin esters as a potential therapeutic strategy.","dc:creator":"Manole A","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Clinical, pathological and functional characterization of riboflavin-responsive neuropathy."}},{"id":"cggv:9fbb0e7a-263b-4dbe-b822-993dac0a6102_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:81fa9bf3-4796-48f9-95d9-77b19e5b8a66"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29053833"}],"rdfs:label":"AM3"},{"id":"cggv:53f253e0-2a25-4fe5-8243-cd62c10a1919","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:53f253e0-2a25-4fe5-8243-cd62c10a1919_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:9fbb0e7a-263b-4dbe-b822-993dac0a6102","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9fbb0e7a-263b-4dbe-b822-993dac0a6102_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:80bb0d0a-5a5a-47f0-b540-cbddc93f49a8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:80bb0d0a-5a5a-47f0-b540-cbddc93f49a8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:84639304-886f-420a-bb08-c522addd961a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001363118.2(SLC52A2):c.935T>C (p.Leu312Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/210041"}},"detectionMethod":"screened for SLC52A2, SLC52A1 and SLC52A3 variants","phenotypeFreeText":"hypotonic","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0007141"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:97e416de-88f9-4c76-9498-fbe90909813c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:84639304-886f-420a-bb08-c522addd961a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29053833"},"rdfs:label":"AP1"},{"id":"cggv:97e416de-88f9-4c76-9498-fbe90909813c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97e416de-88f9-4c76-9498-fbe90909813c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:97e416de-88f9-4c76-9498-fbe90909813c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"3 H-Riboflavin uptake assay demonstrated decreased 3 H-riboflavin transport activity by mutated SLC52A2 compared to wild-type (Console et al., 2021, PMID: 34428344)."}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Recurrent variant that has already been scored."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:df6ef7e2-28ea-49a6-ad0a-c602c0fcf1a8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:df6ef7e2-28ea-49a6-ad0a-c602c0fcf1a8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":35,"allele":{"id":"cggv:12c03460-4099-4abc-a713-c3b7b2a9fb08","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001363118.2(SLC52A2):c.968T>C (p.Leu323Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4938321"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Weak deep tendon reflexes.

Mutations in the gene, SLC52A3 (formerly C20orf54), one of three known riboflavin transporter genes, have recently been shown to underlie a number of severe cases of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome; however, cases and families with this disease exist that do not appear to be caused by SLC52A3 mutations. We used a combination of linkage and exome sequencing to identify the disease causing mutation in an extended Lebanese Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere kindred, whose affected members were negative for SLC52A3 mutations. We identified a novel mutation in a second member of the riboflavin transporter gene family (gene symbol: SLC52A2) as the cause of disease in this family. The same mutation was identified in one additional subject, from 44 screened. Within this group of 44 patients, we also identified two additional cases with SLC52A3 mutations, but none with mutations in the remaining member of this gene family, SLC52A1. We believe this strongly supports the notion that defective riboflavin transport plays an important role in Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. Initial work has indicated that patients with SLC52A3 defects respond to riboflavin treatment clinically and biochemically. Clearly, this makes an excellent candidate therapy for the SLC52A2 mutation-positive patients identified here. Initial riboflavin treatment of one of these patients shows promising results.","dc:creator":"Johnson JO","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Exome sequencing reveals riboflavin transporter mutations as a cause of motor neuron disease."}},"rdfs:label":"Johnson Proband"},{"id":"cggv:d2a80cdd-4074-4c16-9257-6b386c1b4d43","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2a80cdd-4074-4c16-9257-6b386c1b4d43_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d2a80cdd-4074-4c16-9257-6b386c1b4d43_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"3 H-Riboflavin uptake assay demonstrated decreased 3 H-riboflavin transport activity by mutated SLC52A2 compared to wild-type (Foley et al 2014, PMID: 24253200)."}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Upgraded by 0.4pts for founder variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5a500078-4cd5-49db-b22e-c5628ee07304_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.2},{"id":"cggv:63cda020-e415-4929-870f-2bd94152cc01_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63cda020-e415-4929-870f-2bd94152cc01","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d3b41914-7e3e-451e-a82f-dc69361bf4f6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001363118.2(SLC52A2):c.505C>T (p.Arg169Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA207764"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Impaired speech.\nMild bilateral flexible pes cavus, and appendicular and axial hypotonia. \nDistal muscle wasting and weakness in the upper limbs.  \n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0000648"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:8fd1a4fd-f105-4396-ba43-cb7d58b0325a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d3b41914-7e3e-451e-a82f-dc69361bf4f6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29961509","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Brown-Vialetto-van Laere syndrome is characterized by a progressive sensorimotor neuropathy, optic atrophy, hearing loss, bulbar dysfunction, and respiratory insufficiency.

Mutations in SLC52A3 (formerly C20orf54), coding for riboflavin transporter 2 (hRFT2), have been identified as the molecular genetic correlate in several individuals with BVVLS. Exome sequencing of just one single case revealed that compound heterozygosity for two pathogenic mutations in the SLC52A2 gene coding for riboflavin transporter 3 (hRFT3), another member of the riboflavin transporter family, is also associated with BVVLS. Overexpression studies confirmed that the gene products of both mutant alleles have reduced riboflavin transport activities. While mutations in SLC52A3 cause decreased plasma riboflavin levels, concordant with a role of SLC52A3 in riboflavin uptake from food, the SLC52A2-mutant individual had normal plasma riboflavin concentrations, a finding in line with a postulated function of SLC52A2 in riboflavin uptake from blood into target cells. Our results contribute to the understanding of human riboflavin metabolism and underscore its role in the pathogenesis of BVVLS, thereby providing a rational basis for a high-dose riboflavin treatment.","dc:creator":"Haack TB","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Impaired riboflavin transport due to missense mutations in SLC52A2 causes Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:b10f6bed-e096-4a57-84f5-60bc3481c0d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:14a4e565-1a6c-427e-8924-6c48b8a577c1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22864630"}],"rdfs:label":"Haack Proband"},{"id":"cggv:935bcf94-874e-41bb-ba0f-9017a4487451","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:935bcf94-874e-41bb-ba0f-9017a4487451_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:935bcf94-874e-41bb-ba0f-9017a4487451_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Riboflavin uptake was assessed in HEK-293 cells.

This association was made using case-level data only. At least 12 missense and nonsense variants have been reported in humans. SLC52A2 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2012 (Johnson et al.). SLC52A2 is associated with the childhood onset neurodegenerative syndrome Brownâ€“Vialettoâ€“Van Laere (BVVL) which is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ponto-bulbar palsy (PMID: 22864630, 30420458). Whilst these are the most common clinical features, BVVL can also present without either symptom (PMID: 26973221). The standard treatment for BVVL is riboflavin supplementation which is associated with favourable clinical outcomes (PMID: 26973221). 10 probands in 7 publications (22740598, 22864630, 23243084, 24616084, 24253200, 25807286, 29053833) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro assays. In summary, SLC52A2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 7/9/2018. It was reevaluated on 6/21/2023 in collaboration with the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spectrum Disorders GCEP. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. However additional genetic evidence has been included and scoring adjusted to the current Gene Clinical Validity SOP Version 9. The new genetic evidence included 8 variants (5 missense, 1 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 1 small deletion) and 6 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 31064337, 30343981, 29961509, 29053833, 34737166, 27148561).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5a500078-4cd5-49db-b22e-c5628ee07304"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
