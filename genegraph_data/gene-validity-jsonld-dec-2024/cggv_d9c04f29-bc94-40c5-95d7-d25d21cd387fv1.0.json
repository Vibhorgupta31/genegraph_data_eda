Early susceptibility to a number of major age-related diseases is a key feature of this disorder. The gene responsible for WS (known as WRN) was identified by positional cloning. The predicted protein is 1432 amino acids in length and shows significant similarity to DNA helicases. Four mutations in WS patients were identified. Two of the mutations are splice-junction mutations, with the predicted result being the exclusion of exons from the final messenger RNA. One of the these mutations, which results in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein, was found in the homozygous state in 60 percent of Japanese WS patients examined. The other two mutations are nonsense mutations. The identification of a mutated putative helicase as the gene product of the WS gene suggests that defective DNA metabolism is involved in the complex process of aging in WS patients.","dc:creator":"Yu CE","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Positional cloning of the Werner's syndrome gene."},"rdfs:label":"Mutation 4 was 95 bp shorter as a RT-PCR product"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2c94163d-e4c1-4e3f-a5ad-f3f8fce62ca1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7d4055c8-1894-40ae-b42f-e927c84bbfb0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Mammals have five genes that encode different RecQ DNA helicases.

Mutation analysis of the RECQL4 gene was performed on both brothers and both parents. The brothers were shown to be compound heterozygotes for mutations in the RECQL4 gene, including a single basepair deletion in exon 9 resulting in a frameshift and early termination codon and a base substitution in the 3-prime splice site in the intron-exon boundary of exon 8, which would be predicted to cause a deletion of at least part of a consensus helicase domain. Each parent was shown to be a heterozygote carrier for one mutation. This report strengthens the association between mutations in RECQL4 helicase gene and RTS. Two other recessive disorders, Bloom syndrome and Werner syndrome, are known to be due to other human RECQ helicase gene mutations.

Since the replicative decline of normal somatic cells is associated with a loss of telomeric repeats, we investigated the kinetics of telomeric repeat loss in WS cells. The mean length of telomere restriction fragments (TRF) from the earliest passages of WS cells studied was not shorter than those of controls, possibly reflecting selective pressure for subsets of cells with relatively high residual replicative capacity. Statistical evidence indicated an accelerated shortening of TRF length in serially passaged WS cultures, but the mean TRF lengths of WS cultures that had ceased replicating were significantly longer than those of senescent controls.
