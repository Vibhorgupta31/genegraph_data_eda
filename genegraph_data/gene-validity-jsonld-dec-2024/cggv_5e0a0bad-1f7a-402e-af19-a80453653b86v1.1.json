Two-point logarithm of odds scores were calculated using MLINK (version 5.1), assuming a penetrance of 95% and a phenocopy rate of 0.001. Allele frequencies were determined from genotypes of unrelated\nindividuals. \nThe order of loci used in haplotype constructions was based on the physical mapping data derived from the Whitehead Physical Mapping Project31 or determined using physical mapping of a yeast artificial chromosome contig. Candidate genes and expressed sequence tags were defined within the disease interval on the basis of yeast artificial chromosome content mapping.","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"sudden death","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001644","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ff44c6f9-8832-4d7e-b30d-fdb4c38077bf_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5bad7da6-a90e-43a7-8cec-ef576211b024","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000006.11:g.133783902_(133785996_?)del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/163445"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10769282","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) are prevalent disorders that occur alone or as components of complex multisystem syndromes.

To elucidate the roles of eya4 in heart function, we studied zebrafish embryos injected with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. Attenuated eya4 transcript levels produced morphologic and hemodynamic features of heart failure. To determine why previously described mutated EYA4 alleles cause SNHL without heart disease, we examined biochemical interactions of mutant Eya4 peptides. Eya4 peptides associated with SNHL, but not the shortened 193-amino acid peptide associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and SNHL, bound wild-type Eya4 and associated with Six proteins. These data define unrecognized and crucial roles for Eya4-Six-mediated transcriptional regulation in normal heart function.","dc:creator":"Schönberger J","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Mutation in the transcriptional coactivator EYA4 causes dilated cardiomyopathy and sensorineural hearing loss."},"rdfs:label":"Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e994e7c2-87ce-4ef0-ba09-94922c75b3a0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37558714-736c-4aa3-bd01-29cfb1fb2b1a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15735644","rdfs:label":"Immunoprecipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"T7-tagged E193 did not interact with full-length Eya4, Six1 or Six2, even in the presence of untagged full-length Eya4.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and segregation data.  Of note, EYA4-related DCM has been observed with accompanying sensorineural hearing loss. At least 1 unique variant has been reported in humans (Schonberger et al, 2000, PMID: 10769282). This variant segregated with disease in 9 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by studies on protein interaction, expression studies and studies in a non-human model organism (Schonberger et al, 2005, PMID: 15735644). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of EYA4 with autosomal dominant DCM.
