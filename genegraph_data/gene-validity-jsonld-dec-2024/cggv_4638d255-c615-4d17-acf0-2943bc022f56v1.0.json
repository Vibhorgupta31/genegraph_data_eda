Genes for dominant (NEM1) and recessive (NEM2A) nemaline myopathy have been localised to chromosomes one and two, respectively. A missense mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin gene (TPM3) has been associated with NEM1 in one family. Probands from 76 other nemaline myopathy families have now been screened for TPM3 mutations. One proband, who was not noted to have any weakness neonatally, but who died at 21 months of age, was shown to be homozygous for a single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) in skeletal-muscle-specific exon 1 of TPM3. Sequencing revealed homozygosity for a nonsense mutation at codon 31 (CAG to TAG). The patient should have no functioning alpha-tropomyosin slow protein. The nemaline bodies in this patient were exclusively in type one fibres, consistent with the expression of TPM3 only in type one fibres.","dc:creator":"Tan P","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin slow gene TPM3 in a patient with severe infantile nemaline myopathy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11},{"id":"cggv:bdab7f67-dcf8-4dda-89b1-9ff5f5895d57_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdab7f67-dcf8-4dda-89b1-9ff5f5895d57","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":21,"allele":{"id":"cggv:5d115c31-09c1-40bd-80fd-11f2b5b41c06","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152263.4(TPM3):c.94C>T (p.Gln32Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA232705"}},"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was collected from nemaline myopathy patients following standard procedures.

In an attempt to find a seventh gene, we performed linkage and subsequent sequence analyses in 12 Turkish families with recessive NM. We found homozygosity in two of the families at 1q12-21.2, a region encompassing the gamma-tropomyosin gene (TPM3) encoding slow skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin, a known NM gene. Sequencing revealed homozygous deletion of the first nucleotide of the last exon, c.913delA of TPM3 in both families. The mutation removes the last nucleotide before the stop codon, causing a frameshift and readthrough across the termination signal. The encoded alphaTm(slow) protein is predicted to be 73 amino acids longer than normal, and the extension to the protein is hypothesised to be unable to form a coiled coil. The resulting tropomyosin protein may therefore be non-functional. The affected children in both families were homozygous for the mutation, while the healthy parents were mutation carriers. Both of the patients in Family 1 had the severe form of NM, and also an unusual chest deformity. The affected children in Family 2 had the intermediate form of NM. Muscle biopsies showed type 1 (slow) fibres to be markedly smaller than type 2 (fast) fibres. Previously, there had been five reports, only, of NM caused by mutations in TPM3. The mutation reported here is the first deletion to be identified in TPM3, and it is likely to be a founder mutation in the Turkish population.","dc:creator":"Lehtokari VL","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Identification of a founder mutation in TPM3 in nemaline myopathy patients of Turkish origin."}},"rdfs:label":"Lehtokari Proband F2-1"},{"id":"cggv:d9e2aeda-73dc-40da-8460-a60f0bc53358","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9e2aeda-73dc-40da-8460-a60f0bc53358_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant previously scored.

Pathologic diagnosis of CFTD is based on the presence of type 1 fiber hypotrophy of at least 12% in the absence of other notable pathological findings. Mutations of the ACTA1 and SEPN1 genes have been identified in a small percentage of CFTD cases. The muscle tropomyosin 3 gene, TPM3, is mutated in rare cases of nemaline myopathy that typically exhibit type 1 fiber hypotrophy with nemaline rods, and recently mutations in the TPM3 gene were also found to cause CFTD. We screened the TPM3 gene in patients with a clinical diagnosis of CFTD, nemaline myopathy, and with undefined congenital myopathies. Mutations in TPM3 were identified in 6 out of 13 patients with CFTD, as well as in one case of nemaline myopathy. Review of muscle biopsies from patients with diagnoses of CFTD revealed that patients with a TPM3 mutation all displayed marked disproportion of fiber size, without type 1 fiber predominance. Several mutation-negative cases exhibited other abnormalities, such as central nuclei and central cores. These results support the utility of the CFTD diagnosis in directing the course of genetic testing.","dc:creator":"Lawlor MW","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations of tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) are common and associated with type 1 myofiber hypotrophy in congenital fiber type disproportion."}},"rdfs:label":"Lawlor Proband 313-1"},{"id":"cggv:d29af1f6-e886-4d71-ab00-f5128d038f23","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d29af1f6-e886-4d71-ab00-f5128d038f23_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d29af1f6-e886-4d71-ab00-f5128d038f23_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 21357678"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduced score due to variant previously used and proband's family has distant consanguinity three generations removed."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11},{"id":"cggv:4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:420ef8e8-4ec6-4f43-9d52-13f352014fb7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a6e61b7d-4277-417d-a8e7-6e26bc9324c3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"ACTA1 encodes skeletal muscle alpha-actin, the primary actin isoform that is the core of the thin filament of the sarcomere.

All studied tropomyosin mutants reduced Ca-induced activation but had no effect on the inhibition of actomyosin cross-bridges. Ca(2+)-sensitivity of the actomyosin interactions, as well as cooperativity of myosin-induced activation of the thin filament was affected by individual tropomyosin mutants with various degrees. Decreased motility of the reconstructed thin filaments was a result of combined functional defects caused by myopathy-related tropomyosin mutants.

In contrast to the mechanisms underlying weakness in NEB-based myopathy, which are related to loss of thin-filament functions normally exerted by nebulin, the pathogenesis of muscle weakness in patients with TPM3 mutations remains largely unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the contractile phenotype of TPM3-based myopathy is different from that of NEB-based myopathy and that this phenotype is a direct consequence of the loss of the specific functions normally exerted by tropomyosin. To test this hypothesis, we used a multidisciplinary approach, including muscle fiber mechanics and confocal and electron microscopy to characterize the structural and functional phenotype of muscle fibers from five patients with TPM3-based myopathy and compared this with that of unaffected control subjects. Our findings demonstrate that patients with TPM3-based myopathy display a contractile phenotype that is very distinct from that of patients with NEB-based myopathy. Whereas both show severe myofilament-based muscle weakness, the contractile dysfunction in TPM3-based myopathy is largely explained by changes in cross-bridge cycling kinetics, but not by the dysregulation of sarcomeric thin-filament length that plays a prominent role in NEB-based myopathy. Interestingly, the loss of force-generating capacity in TPM3-based myopathy appears to be compensated by enhanced thin-filament activation. These findings provide a scientific basis for differential therapeutics aimed at restoring contractile performance in patients with TPM3-based versus NEB-based myopathy.","dc:creator":"Ottenheijm CA","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Changes in cross-bridge cycling underlie muscle weakness in patients with tropomyosin 3-based myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Ottenheijm muscle fiber mechanics"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8485,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:15a47a70-5c18-479f-840f-bae276db324b","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100108","gene":"hgnc:12012","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*TPM3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive *TPM3*-related myopathy in 1999 (PMID: 10619715). Cases of *TPM3*-related myopathy have historically been categorized by histological features in muscle biopsy and include nemaline myopathy, cap myopathy, and myopathy with fiber-type disproportion on a spectrum of severity. Several unique loss-of-function null variants (e.g. nonsense, splice-site, frameshift) have been reported in humans, in an autosomal recessive manner. Case-level genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship (11 points) includes published reports of at least six probands observed to have loss of function variants and parents who are asymptomatic heterozygous carriers (PMIDs: 10619715, 12196661, 18382475, 19953533, 37393515). Additionally, these probands display various phenotypes, with the majority showing hypotonia, poor head control, inability to walk, scoliosis, Type 1 muscle fiber atrophy/hypotrophy, delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness, and nemaline bodies. This gene-disease association is additionally supported by TPM3's biochemical function, unique expression in the skeletal muscle tissue, physical protein interaction with ACTA1 (PMID: 22749829), and altered function of TPM3 mutant proteins dramatically changing myofilament function (PMID: 21357678). Experimental-level genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship scored 3 points. In summary, there is definitive evidence (14 points) to support the relationship between *TPM3* and autosomal recessive *TPM3*-related myopathy.
