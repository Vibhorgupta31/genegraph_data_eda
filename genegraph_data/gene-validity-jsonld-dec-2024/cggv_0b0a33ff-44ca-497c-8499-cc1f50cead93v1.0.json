The TSC2 gene is one of two genes determining tuberous sclerosis. Inactivating germline mutations of TSC2 in patients with tuberous sclerosis and somatic loss of heterozygosity at the TSC2 locus in the associated hamartomas indicate that TSC2 functions as a tumour suppressor gene and that loss of function is critical to expression of the tuberous sclerosis phenotype. The TSC2 product, tuberin, has a region of homology with the GTPase activating protein rap1GAP and stimulates the GTPase activity of rap1a and rab5a in vitro. Here we show that the region of homology between tuberin and human rap1GAP and the murine GAP mSpa1 is more extensive than previously reported and spans approximately 160 amino acid residues encoded within exons 34-38 of the TSC2 gene. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of these exons in 173 unrelated patients with tuberous sclerosis and direct sequencing of variant conformers together with study of additional family members enabled characterisation of disease associated mutations in 14 cases. Missense mutations, which occurred in exons 36, 37 and 38 were identified in eight cases, four of whom shared the same recurrent change P1675L. Each of the five different missense mutations identified was shown to occur de novo in at least one sporadic case of tuberous sclerosis. The high proportion of missense mutations detected in the region of the TSC2 gene encoding the GAP-related domain supports its key role in the regulation of cellular growth.","dc:creator":"Maheshwar

TSC is genetically linked to two loci: TSC1 on chromosome 9q34 and TSC2 on 16p13.3. TSC2 has been cloned, sequenced and encodes a protein (tuberin) which functions as a tumor suppressor. We have analyzed the distribution of TSC2 mRNA and tuberin in the brains of TSC patients and non-affected individuals using both autopsy and biopsy material. High levels of transcript and protein expression were observed in choroid plexus epithelium, ependymal cells, most brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons, Purkinje cells and the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum in both TSC and control cases. Individual balloon cells from TSC patients showed very faint expression while other glia showed no expression of either transcript or tuberin. Neocortical and hippocampal neurons expressed high levels of TSC2 transcript, but only modest levels of tuberin. The internal granule cell layer of the cerebellum expressed abundant transcript but low levels of tuberin. These observations suggest either that tuberin expression is controlled at the level of both transcription and translation or the antibody and in-situ hybridization recognize different splice variants of the TSC2 gene. In TSC patients, dysmorphic cytomegalic neurons expressed high levels of tuberin and transcript, particularly when in an 'ectopic' location. Individual cells within subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) and hamartomas from TSC patients expressed moderate to high levels of TSC2 transcript and tuberin. While the TSC2 transcript is widely expressed primarily within neurons, tuberin is demonstrable primarily within dysplastic/cytomegalic cells of the cortex and subependymal hamartomas/SEGAs. CNS expression of tuberin is unique in that primarily non-dividing cells express it in this location, whereas extra-CNS expression of tuberin is mainly found in actively proliferating cell types such as epithelium.","dc:creator":"Kerfoot C","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Localization of tuberous sclerosis 2 mRNA and its protein product tuberin in normal human brain and in cerebral lesions of patients with tuberous sclerosis."},"rdfs:label":"TSC2 expression in TSC brains"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:403848d5-feab-4d90-8fed-ee97f8aadfef","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:16a1d38e-b101-4cd7-8a1f-e8a49f21582b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Northern blot analysis of rat tissue shows high expression of TSC2 in the brain/ CNS, heart, lung, and muscle.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7972075","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genetic predisposition to neoplasia often involves tumor suppressor genes.

Tuberin contains a RapGAP homology domain responsible for inactivation of Rheb, but functions of other protein domains remain elusive. Here we show that the TSC2 N terminus interacts with the TSC1 C terminus to mediate complex formation. The structure of the TSC2 N-terminal domain from Chaetomium thermophilum and a homology model of the human tuberin N terminus are presented. We characterize the molecular requirements for TSC1-TSC2 interactions and analyze pathological point mutations in tuberin. Many mutations are structural and produce improperly folded protein, explaining their effect in pathology, but we identify one point mutant that abrogates complex formation without affecting protein structure. We provide the first structural information on TSC2/tuberin with novel insight into the molecular function.","dc:creator":"Zech R","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2) N Terminus Provides Insight into Complex Assembly and Tuberous Sclerosis Pathogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"TSC2 N-term binds TSC1 C-term"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Due to several lines of evidence presented in this paper to show interaction, I increased the points."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0b0a33ff-44ca-497c-8499-cc1f50cead93_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9476f245-10ab-4ff9-90f4-ca0d7dac9f80","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c49a7051-74ec-42f6-af92-e441b3bbaba8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Re-expression of wildtype TSC2 in TSC2 null rat embryonicc fibroblasts (REFs) resulted in cytoskeletal changes including the formation of lamelllipodia and filopodia, indicating activation of the actin cytoskeleton that is conducive to cell migration.

TSC2, a downstream target of AKT, is a central player in negatively controlling cell proliferation and protein translation through suppressing the activity of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). However, the function of TSC2 in regulating cell migration remains unclear. Here, we show that TSC2 plays a critical role in the control of cell spreading, polarity, and migration. TSC2-deficient fibroblast cells were impaired in their ability to spread and alter actin cytoskeleton upon stimulation with insulin-like growth factor-1. Using scratch-induced polarization assay, we demonstrate that TSC2((-/-)) fibroblast cells polarized poorly toward the wound compared with wild-type cells. Similarly, knockdown of TSC2 expression in colon cancer cells resulted in a marked decrease in cell motility. Functionally, the activation of CDC42- and RAC1-GTPase was largely reduced in TSC2 knock-out fibroblast and TSC2 knockdown cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of an activating p110alpha mutant or short term rapamycin treatment rescued the cell polarization defect in TSC2((-/-)) fibroblast cells. Concurrently, the activation of CDC42 and RAC1 increased. The defect in cell migration and CDC42 and RAC1 activation was reversed by reintroducing TSC2 back into TSC2((-/-)) fibroblast cells. Taken together, we identified a novel role of TSC2 in controlling cell polarity and migration by regulating CDC42 and RAC1 activation.","dc:creator":"Larson Y","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) regulates cell migration and polarity through activation of CDC42 and RAC1."},"rdfs:label":"Re-expression of TSC2 rescues cell migration defects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Note: There was no reference or description on how the TSC2 null rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) were generated.

The homozygous mutant condition is lethal at around the 13th day of fetal life. In heterozygotes, RCs invariably develop in the first year of life. Histologically, RCs develop through multiple stages from early preneoplastic lesions (i.e., phenotypically altered tubules) to adenomas. The wild-type allele mutation has been found even in the earliest preneoplastic lesions, fitting Knudson's two-hit hypothesis and supporting the hypothesis that Tsc2 is a tumor suppressor gene. In this study, homozygous deletion of the Ink4 homologue on rat chromosome 5q was observed in 14 of 24 (58%) RC-derived cell lines. This may represent involvement of a second tumor suppressor gene, contributing to tumor progression. Considering previous results of studies of homozygous deletion of the Ifn alpha gene in five of 24 cases (21%) and the Ifn beta gene in one of 24 cases (4%), the order of the genes may be Ink4-Ifn alpha-Ifn beta.

Numerous variants have been reported in TSC2 in relation to tuberous sclerosis complex, including missense, nonsense, indels and small deletions that result in frameshift, as well as intragenic deletions (Hasbani and Crino, 2018 PMID: 29478616). The  TSC2 database in LOVD (http://chromium.lovd.nl/LOVD2/TSC/home.php?select_db=TSC2) shows a total of 2689 unique variants associated with TSC2 (as of Jan 07, 2019). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for 20 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level data is available, however the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional studies including expression and protein interaction and  animal models. The molecular mechanism for TSC2 in tuberous sclerosis is loss of function, as indicated by deletion and nonsense variation, as well as biochemical loss of tumor suppressor activity (Hasbani and Crino, 2018 PMID: 29478616). In summary, TSC2 is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant tuberous sclerosis complex. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0b0a33ff-44ca-497c-8499-cc1f50cead93"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
