Using linkage analysis in a three generation kindred, we have mapped a new locus for X-linked dominant CMT to chromosome Xp22.11. A microsatellite scan of the X chromosome established significant linkage to several markers including DXS993 (Zmax = 3.16; Î¸ = 0.05). Extended haplotype analysis refined the linkage region to a 1.43-Mb interval flanked by markers DXS7110 and DXS8027. Whole exome sequencing identified a missense mutation c.G473A (p.R158H) in the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 3 (PDK3) gene. The change localized within the 1.43-Mb linkage interval, segregated with the affected phenotype and was excluded in ethnically matched control chromosomes. PDK3 is one of the four isoenzymes regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), by reversible phosphorylation, and is a nuclear-coded protein located in the mitochondrial matrix. PDC catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA and is a key enzyme linking glycolysis to the energy-producing Krebs cycle and lipogenic pathways. We found that the R158H mutation confers enzyme hyperactivity and binds with stronger affinity than the wild-type to the inner-lipoyl (L2) domain of the E2p chain of PDC. Our findings suggest a reduced pyruvate flux due to R158H mutant PDK3-mediated hyper-phosphorylation of the PDC as the underlying pathogenic cause of peripheral neuropathy. The results highlight an important causative link between peripheral nerve degeneration and an essential bioenergetic or biosynthetic pathway required for the maintenance of peripheral nerves.","dc:creator":"Kennerson ML","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A new locus for X-linked dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX6) is caused by mutations in the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 3 (PDK3) gene."},"rdfs:label":"PDK3 expressed in human brain "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:45984c77-8b37-43a9-b810-c5c7f0d2e1e8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4bfab4d1-8a3e-472b-9063-7852d64aef8a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"ATP depletion has been previously described in other CMT cell models.

In this study we demonstrate that the increased PDK3 activity in patient fibroblasts (PDK3(R158H)) leads to the attenuation of PDC through hyper-phosphorylation of E1 at selected serine residues. This hyper-phosphorylation can be reversed by treating the PDK3(R158H) fibroblasts with the PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA). In the patient cells, down-regulation of PDC leads to increased lactate, decreased ATP and alteration of the mitochondrial network.

Linkage analysis mapped the locus to Xp22.11, and further haplotype analysis and exome sequencing identified a missense variant p.R158H in PDK3 gene segregating in all affected family members. Male patients presented with foot deformity, gait abnormalities, hand tremor, absent ankle reflexes, distal lower limb weakness, sensory abnormalities, and motor developmental delay. Carrier females were asymptomatic or mildly affected.  Disease was progressive with childhood onset of a predominantly axonal motor and sensory neuropathy. The same missense variant was later reported in an unrelated Korean family, affected individuals presented with similar clinical manifestations as those of the Australian family (Kennerson et al., PMID: 26801680). The variant p.R158H seems to occur on a different haplotype when compared with the original Australian CMTX6 family, excluding a common founder. Other missense variants were reported in the literature, but since pathogenicity was only confirmed for the recurrent missense variant p.R158H, they were not included in this curation.\n\nPDK3 gene comprises 12 exons and encodes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3, a protein residing in the mitochondrial matrix. PDK3 is one of the four isoenzymes negatively regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), by reversible phosphorylation of its catalytic subunit E1. PDK3 is expressed in the human spinal cord, fetal and adult brain, as well as in skeletal muscle. Expression in the brain was also shown in mouse and rat tissues. \n\nPrimary fibroblasts cultured from CMTX6 patients showed hyperphosphorylation of E1 at selected serine residues and subsequent reduction of PDC activity. The variant p.R158H had, however, no effect on the level of PKD3 expression in fibroblasts (PMID: 27388934, PMID: 32504000). Patient fibroblasts showed increased lactate, decreased ATP, and alteration of the mitochondrial network (PMID: 27388934). Furthermore, E1 hyperphosphorylation was maintained in patient derived iPSC cells as well as patient derived motor neurons.  Phosphorylation was reverted by either gene editing of the p.R158H variant or pharmacological inhibition (PMID: 32504000).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by C. elegans knock-in and overexpression models. Both showed reduced body width, defective stress response to paraquat induced oxidative stress, axon-associated synaptic transmission deficits, and reduced ATP levels; recapitulating the phenotype observed in patient fibroblasts and iPSC-derived motor neurons (PMID: 34387338).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between PDK3 and X linked dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 6. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:508a1db7-0cf1-4c28-9203-89a3f4d7438d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
