Our aim was to analyse by in silico and in vitro assays the transforming activity of six rare RET mutations (T338I, V648I, M918V, A883T, S904F and M848T). Six known RET mutations were used as controls. The in silico analysis showed the highest score value (i.e. 65) for S904F, M848T, M918T and C634R, whereas L790F, G691S, T338I and V648I had 0 score. Intermediate score values were obtained by A883T (score=55), M918V, V804M and Y791F (score=15). The in vitro focus formation assay showed that cells transfected with S904F, M918T, M848T or C634R generated the largest number of focus formation units (FFU). Intermediate numbers of FFU were observed in cells transfected with M918V, V804M, Y791F or A883T, while cells transfected with L790F, G691S, T338I or V648I showed a number of FFU similar to control cells. A positive correlation between the in silico score and in vitro FFU was found (P=0.0005). Only cells transfected with M918T or C634R grew faster and generated higher number of colonies in soft agar than control cells. However, the cells that were transfected with V804M produced an intermediate number of colonies. In conclusion, two of the six rare RET mutations, S904F and M848T possessed a relatively high transforming activity but a low aggressiveness; the other four mutations T338I, V648I, M918V and A883T were low or non-transforming, and their ability to induce tumoural transformation might be related to particular genetic conditions.","dc:creator":"Cosci B","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"In silico and in vitro analysis of rare germline allelic variants of RET oncogene associated with medullary thyroid cancer."},"rdfs:label":"Aggressive transforming ability with constitutive activation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:01bc1378-9644-4b12-8c3a-893b80e563a6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be4d45fa-f384-4adf-b0d1-ab5c23784476","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The Ret^MEN2B/+ heterozygous mice generated by Smith-Hicks et al., 2000 (PMID: 10675330) developed thyroid C-cell hyperplasia (CCH), adrenal chromaffin cell hyperplasia and peochromocytoma.

Four different MEN syndromes have been so far identified: MEN type 1 (MEN1), MEN2A (also referred to as MEN2), MEN2B (or MEN3) and MEN4, which have slightly varying tumor spectra and are caused by mutations in different genes. MEN1 associates with loss-of-function mutations in the MEN1 gene encoding the tumor suppressor menin. The MEN2A and MEN2B syndromes are due to activating mutations in the proto-oncogene RET (Rearranged in Transfection) and are characterized by different phenotypic features of the affected patients. MEN4 was the most recent addition to the family of the MEN syndromes. It was discovered less than 10 years ago thanks to studies of a rat strain that spontaneously develops multiple endocrine tumors (named MENX). These studies identified an inactivating mutation in the Cdkn1b gene, encoding the putative tumor suppressor p27, as the causative mutation of the rat syndrome. Subsequently, germline mutations in the human ortholog CDKN1B were also found in a subset of patients with a MEN-like phenotype and this led to the identification of MEN4. Small animal models have been instrumental in understanding important biochemical, physiological and pathological processes of cancer onset and spread in intact living organisms. Moreover, they have provided us with insight into gene function(s) and molecular mechanisms of disease progression.

Earlier evidence suggested that the disease MEN2B mapped to chromosome 10 (where the RET gene is located) as early as 1990 (Norum et al., 1990 PMID:1979053). One variant, p.Met918Thr, is responsible for nearly all cases of MEN2B, and it is estimated that around 50% of the reported cases of MEN2B are de novo (Carlson et al. 1994 PMID:7977365; Plaza-Menaho et al., 2006; PMID: 16979782). Another RET variant (p. Ala883Phe) has been asserted to be responsible for the development of ~5% of MEN2B (Smith et al., 1997 PMID:9294615). The molecular mechanism for the gene RET in the disease entity MEN2B is gain of function. While similar to RET-MEN2A (described in a separate curation), in that the mechanism is GOF, the mechanism(s) responsible for the two disease entities are distinct. In MEN2B the p.Met918Thr variation occurs in exon 16 of RET in the tyrosine kinase domain which causes autophosphorylation and activation of RET. There is a significant amount of case-level data with the maximum points for genetic evidence reached (12 points). This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional studies including expression, cell assays and animal models, several that were patient derived pathogenic variants expressed in the mouse (reviewed in Wiedmann et al, 2016 PMID: 26184857). These animal models developed carcinomas consistent with the disease multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. The RET gene is asserted to be associated with multiple disease entities by germline inheritance , including: (1) Central hypoventilation syndrome, congenital (MIM:209880), (2) Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MIM:155240), (3) Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIA/2A (MIM:171400), (4)Pheochromocytoma (MIM:171300). These disease entities all follow an inheritance pattern of autosomal dominant. Per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we did find a difference in the molecular mechanism (defined above) and phenotypic expressivity between the disease entities MEN2A (MIM:171400) and MEN2B (162300), and therefore have split these curations. Therefore, the curation for RET-MEN2A can be found separately. In summary, RET is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
