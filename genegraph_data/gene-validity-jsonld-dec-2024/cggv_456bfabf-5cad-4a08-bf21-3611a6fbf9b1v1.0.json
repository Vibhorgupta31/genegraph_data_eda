Nevertheless, the mechanisms of NF-kappaB-mediated regulation of gene expression, and the signaling molecules participating in the NF-kappaB pathway in the central nervous system are, to date, poorly understood. To identify such molecules, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using NIK as bait. As a result, we identified a novel NIK and IKK(beta) binding protein designated NIBP that is mainly expressed in brain, muscle, heart, and kidney. Interestingly, low levels of expression were detected in immune tissues such as spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes, where NF-kappaB is known to modulate immune function. We demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that NIBP expression in the brain is localized to neurons. NIBP physically interacts with NIK, IKK(beta), but not IKK(alpha) or IKK(gamma). NIBP overexpression potentiates tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation through increased phosphorylation of the IKK complex and its downstream I(kappa)B(alpha) and p65 substrates. Finally, knockdown of NIBP expression by small interfering RNA reduces tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, prevents nerve growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation, and decreases Bcl-xL gene expression in PC12 cells. Our data demonstrate that NIBP, by interacting with NIK and IKK(beta), is a new enhancer of the cytokine-induced NF-(kappa)B signaling pathway. Because of its neuronal expression, we propose that NIBP may be a potential target for modulating the NF-(kappa)B signaling cascade in neuronal pathologies dependent upon abnormal activation of this pathway.","dc:creator":"Hu WH","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"NIBP, a novel NIK and IKK(beta)-binding protein that enhances NF-(kappa)B activation."},"rdfs:label":"NIBP knockdown"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:456bfabf-5cad-4a08-bf21-3611a6fbf9b1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:456bfabf-5cad-4a08-bf21-3611a6fbf9b1_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:456bfabf-5cad-4a08-bf21-3611a6fbf9b1_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a37b8d2-2d60-45a0-908f-054478c235b8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4cb75dfe-ae14-4142-b796-dcb5f7bc8a39","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":19,"detectionMethod":"","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Chromosome analysis, array-CGH testing at 1 Mb resolution, metabolic screening, and molecular testing for fragile X and FRAXE syndromes were all normal.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:6a37b8d2-2d60-45a0-908f-054478c235b8_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:73fd2428-54a5-4117-ab32-24611419624f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001160372.4(TRAPPC9):c.1414C>T (p.Arg472Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA114483"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20004764","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Autosomal-recessive inheritance accounts for nearly 25% of nonsyndromic mental retardation (MR), but the extreme heterogeneity of such conditions markedly hampers gene identification.

It occurs with a prevalence of approximately 2%, is an etiologically heterogeneous condition, and is frequently the result of genetic aberrations. Autosomal-recessive forms of nonsyndromic MR (NS-ARMR) are believed to be common, yet only five genes have been identified. We have used homozygosity mapping to search for the gene responsible for NS-ARMR in a large Pakistani pedigree. Using Affymetrix 5.0 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, we identified a 3.2 Mb region on 8q24 with a continuous run of 606 homozygous SNPs shared among all affected members of the family. Additional genotype data from microsatellite markers verified this, allowing us to calculate a two-point LOD score of 5.18. Within this region, we identified a truncating homozygous mutation, R475X, in exon 7 of the gene TRAPPC9. In a second large NS-ARMR/ID family, previously linked to 8q24 in a study of Iranian families, we identified a 4 bp deletion within exon 14 of TRAPPC9, also segregating with the phenotype and truncating the protein. This gene encodes NIK- and IKK-beta-binding protein (NIBP), which is involved in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and directly interacts with IKK-beta and MAP3K14. Brain magnetic resonance imaging of affected individuals indicates the presence of mild cerebral white matter hypoplasia. Microcephaly is present in some but not all affected individuals.

Here we report the genetic definition of two sporadic cases, with syndromic ID/DD for whom array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) identified a de novo copy number variant (CNV) of uncertain significance. The phenotypes included microcephaly with brachycephaly and a distinctive facies in one proband, and hypotonia in the legs and mild ataxia in the other. WES allowed identification of a functionally relevant homozygous variant affecting a known disease gene for rare syndromic ID/DD in each proband, that is, c.1423C>T (p.Arg377*) in the Trafficking Protein Particle Complex 9 (TRAPPC9), and c.154T>C (p.Cys52Arg) in the Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (VLDLR). Four mutations affecting TRAPPC9 have been previously reported, and the present finding further depicts this syndromic form of ID, which includes microcephaly with brachycephaly, corpus callosum hypoplasia, facial dysmorphism, and overweight. VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia (VLDLR-CH) is characterized by non-progressive congenital ataxia and moderate-to-profound intellectual disability. The c.154T>C (p.Cys52Arg) mutation was associated with a very mild form of ataxia, mild intellectual disability, and cerebellar hypoplasia without cortical gyri simplification.
