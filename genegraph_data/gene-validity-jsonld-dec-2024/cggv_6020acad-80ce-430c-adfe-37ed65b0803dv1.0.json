Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Mito protein import and processing"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This gene shares function with 2-5 gene products important in mitochondrial protein import and processing."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:6020acad-80ce-430c-adfe-37ed65b0803d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:223b3afb-a92a-49a4-ae33-5c701b1534ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8839d91c-9d87-48c6-b6c2-1065d1dc0d12","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Western blot analysis showed that the complete loss of MPPa at 4 days resulted in a significant accumulation of FXN42-210 and depletion of FXN81-210.\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26657514","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Choquet K","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by a homozygous mutation in PMPCA."},"rdfs:label":"Choquet_Functional alteration (non patient cells)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Western blot analysis showed that the complete loss of MPPa at 4 days resulted in a significant accumulation of FXN42-210 and depletion of FXN81-210."},{"id":"cggv:cc124731-81b0-4a69-8a6b-5af10ab83ffc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bcf61ffb-9871-451b-afc5-030803fe1e13","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"PMPCA pathogenic variants impacts the maturation process of frataxin (a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein which undergoes cleavage by MPP after import into the mitochondria).

Analysis of lymphoblastoid cells and fibroblasts from patients homozygous for the PMPCA p.Ala377Thr mutation and carriers demonstrate that the mutation impacts both the level of the alpha subunit encoded by PMPCA and the function of mitochondrial processing peptidase. In particular, this mutation impacts the maturation process of frataxin, the protein which is depleted in Friedreich ataxia.

We report a case of a 15-year-old Japanese girl with infancy-onset, very severe and progressive developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebellar atrophy and excessive brain iron accumulation in the bilateral globus pallidi and substantia nigra.

This gene encodes mitochondrial peptidase processing subunit alpha, the alpha subunit of a proteolytic heterodimer that, together with PMPCB, is responsible for cleaving the transit peptide from nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins after import into the mitochondria.\n\n*PMPCA* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2015 (PMID: 25808372), in several individuals with cerebellar atrophy and ataxia.  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *PMPCA*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *PMPCA* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 10 unique variants [seven missense including c.1129G>A (p.Ala377Thr) that is a Lebanese founder variant, one frameshift, two splicing] identified in 26 affected individuals from 11 kindreds from seven publications (PMIDs: 25808372, 26657514, 27148589, 30617178, 33272776, 35803560, 37332652). Additional cases were reported in the medical literature but excluded from this curation as phasing was not performed (PMIDs: F4 in 25808372, 36233161).  Additionally, there is a report of autosomal dominant inheritance of *PMPCA* variants (PMID: 35885985) that was also excluded from this curation as additional studies are needed to confirm this disease mechanism.  \n\nSome affected individuals had developmental delay from early in life while others met their milestones on time with subsequent regression in the first couple years of life. The outcomes were variable, but all cases appeared to be living at the time of report except for one individual who died at 17 years of age (PMID: 35803560). Features in affected individuals include developmental delay, ataxia (both stable and progressive courses reported), dysarthria and tremor. Some affected individuals had intellectual disability and some had mood disorders. Other features seen include faltering growth, ophthalmoplegia, and optic atrophy; and one individual had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsy was not consistently performed and results were variable when this was completed. Brain imaging showed cerebellar atrophy and generalized brain atrophy. Metabolic screening labs were generally normal but some individuals had elevated lactate.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function (PMID: 33340416), functional alteration in patient (PMID: 25808372) and non-patient cells (PMID: 26657514), and rescue in patient cells (PMID: 27148589).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *PMPCA* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 18, 2023 (SOP Version 10).
