Genetic analyses have identified several genes mutated in ALS patients, and one of them is Cyclin F gene (CCNF), the product of which (Cyclin F) serves as the substrate-binding module of a SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex. However, the role of Cyclin F in ALS pathogenesis has remained unclear. Here, we show that Cyclin F binds to valosin-containing protein (VCP), which is also reported to be mutated in ALS, and that the two proteins colocalize in the nucleus. VCP was found to bind to the NH2-terminal region of Cyclin F and was not ubiquitylated by SCFCyclin F in transfected cells. Instead, the ATPase activity of VCP was enhanced by Cyclin F in vitro. Furthermore, whereas ALS-associated mutations of CCNF did not affect the stability of Cyclin F or disrupt formation of the SCFCyclin F complex, amino acid substitutions in the VCP binding region increased the binding ability of Cyclin F to VCP and activity of VCP as well as mislocalization of the protein in the cytoplasm. We also provided evidence that the ATPase activity of VCP promotes cytoplasmic aggregation of transactivation responsive region (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43, which is commonly observed in degenerating neurons in ALS patients. Given that mutations of VCP identified in ALS patients also increase its ATPase activity, our results suggest that Cyclin F mutations may contribute to ALS pathogenesis by increasing the ATPase activity of VCP in the cytoplasm, which in turn increases TDP-43 aggregates.","dc:creator":"Yu Y","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Pathogenic mutations in the ALS gene CCNF cause cytoplasmic mislocalization of Cyclin F and elevated VCP ATPase activity."},"rdfs:label":"HEK293 CCNF and VCP"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded to 1 pt as VCP is a gene strongly associated with ALS with a known mechanism of increasing TDP43 accumulation by increased ATPase activity.

Approximately 10% of cases have a known family history of ALS and disease-linked mutations in multiple genes have been identified. ALS-linked mutations in CCNF were recently reported, however the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations are yet to be established. To investigate possible disease mechanisms, we developed in vitro and in vivo models based on an ALS-linked missense mutation in CCNF. Proteomic analysis of the in vitro models identified the disruption of several cellular pathways in the mutant model, including caspase-3 mediated cell death. Transient overexpression of human CCNF in zebrafish embryos supported this finding, with fish expressing the mutant protein found to have increased levels of cleaved (activated) caspase-3 and increased cell death in the spinal cord. The mutant CCNF fish also developed a motor neuron axonopathy consisting of shortened primary motor axons and increased frequency of aberrant axonal branching. Importantly, we demonstrated a significant correlation between the severity of the CCNF-induced axonopathy and a reduced motor response to a light stimulus (photomotor response). This is the first report of an ALS-linked CCNF mutation in vivo and taken together with the in vitro model identifies the disruption of cell death pathways as a significant consequence of this mutation. Additionally, this study presents a valuable new tool for use in ongoing studies investigating the pathobiology of ALS-linked CCNF mutations.","dc:creator":"Hogan AL","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Expression of ALS/FTD-linked mutant CCNF in zebrafish leads to increased cell death in the spinal cord and an aberrant motor phenotype."},"rdfs:label":"Neuro 2A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgraded to zero points as study suggests upregulation of caspase 3 by proteasome analysis and western blot but further evidence suggesting an increase in neuronal cell death is not available."},{"id":"cggv:20842fec-c932-4f32-a898-4f95df2ad2be","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d4878ba-a47b-4691-856f-5593e55235e9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Immunoblotting analysis of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (Lamp2A), LC3, and p62/SQSTM1, was performed.

Linkage analysis revealed a candidate region at 16p13.3-p12.3, which was determined to be a novel mutation in CCNF (Ser621Gly) by exome sequencing. CCNF codes for the Cyclin F protein, a component of an E3 ubiquitinâ€“protein ligase (F box protein family) (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) that is involved in mediating the ubiquitination and consequently degradation of target proteins through the ubiquitin proteasome system.  At least 37 variants in the CCNF gene have since been reported to cause ALS-FTD in humans of diverse geoancestry across five publications (PMIDs: 27080313, 29102476, 30008669, 28281833, 31475037). However, several reported variants have relatively high minor allele frequencies in population databases (>0.000005) and were not scored as genetic-level evidence. Overall evidence supporting the CCNF gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Mutant Cyclin F (Ser621Gly) has been shown to disrupt Lys48-specific ubiquitylation, resulting in accumulation of RRM2 and TDP43 (PMID: 28852778). The mutant protein interacts with p62/SQSTM1 and leads to defects in autophagic degradation (PMID: 28852778). Additionally, mutant Cyclin F has been shown to cause cytoplasmic mislocalization of Cyclin F and elevated VCP ATPase activity (which promotes cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43) (PMID: 31577344). Finally, mutant Cyclin F (Ser621Gly) has been shown to cause disruption of axonal outgrowth, increased cell death in the spinal cord, and aberrant motor phenotype in Zebrafish (PMID: 28444311). In summary, due to limited scorable genetic-level evidence and lack of a strong model system to demonstrate the phenotype of mutant CCNF, there is currently limited evidence to support a gene-disease relationship between CCNF and ALS-FTD.
