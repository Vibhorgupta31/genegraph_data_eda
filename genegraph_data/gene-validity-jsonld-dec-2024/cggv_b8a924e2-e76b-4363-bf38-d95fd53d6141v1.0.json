We identified a causal mutation in 1 of 14 genes in 50% (353/710). This includes HIST1H1E, encoding histone H1.4, which has not been associated with a developmental disorder previously. The pathogenic HIST1H1E mutations are predicted to result in a product that is less effective in neutralizing negatively charged linker DNA because it has a reduced net charge, and in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions because key residues are truncated. Functional network analyses demonstrated that epigenetic regulation is a prominent biological process dysregulated in individuals with OGID. Mutations in six epigenetic regulation genes-NSD1, EZH2, DNMT3A, CHD8, HIST1H1E, and EED-accounted for 44% of individuals (311/710). There was significant overlap between the 14 genes involved in OGID and 611 genes in regions identified in GWASs to be associated with height (p = 6.84 × 10-8), suggesting that a common variation impacting function of genes involved in OGID influences height at a population level. Increased cellular growth is a hallmark of cancer and there was striking overlap between the genes involved in OGID and 260 somatically mutated cancer driver genes (p = 1.75 × 10-14). However, the mutation spectra of genes involved in OGID and cancer differ, suggesting complex genotype-phenotype relationships. These data reveal insights into the genetic control of human growth and demonstrate that exome sequencing in OGID has a high diagnostic yield.","dc:creator":"Tatton-Brown K","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations in Epigenetic Regulation Genes Are a Major Cause of Overgrowth with Intellectual Disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28475857","rdfs:label":"COG 1291"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:8c0e4cda-7734-40bc-8c92-59580671f05f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:799c6287-c57e-4abe-bb94-9aea85363548","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sanger sequence analysis of the coding exons and splice junctions of 676 Vega annotated genes on the X chromosome","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000411"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"karyotype, fragile X, 61 known X-linked ID genes","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:8c0e4cda-7734-40bc-8c92-59580671f05f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b91a4627-29c8-44ec-918b-04dc1a07ef97","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153252.4(BRWD3):c.946dupA (p.Arg316Lysfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/10803"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17668385"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17668385","rdfs:label":"Proband 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:c5e345b7-5ad3-4c21-be7c-ab40496918d4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2aebe3dc-8e73-437d-8d06-1bebf237a437","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing of NSD1, EZH2, DNMT3A, and PPP2R5D;
