Here, we report a detailed cross-sectional analysis of clinical, imaging and molecular data of 156 patients from 101 families. Enrolled patients were of diverse ethnic backgrounds and covered a wide age range (1.0-49.3 years). While the mean age at symptom onset was 0.8 ± 0.6 years [standard deviation (SD), range 0.2-5.0], the mean age at diagnosis was 10.2 ± 8.5 years (SD, range 0.1-46.3). We define a set of core features: early-onset developmental delay with delayed motor milestones and significant speech delay (50% non-verbal); intellectual disability in the moderate to severe range; mild hypotonia in infancy followed by spastic diplegia (mean age: 8.4 ± 5.1 years, SD) and later tetraplegia (mean age: 16.1 ± 9.8 years, SD); postnatal microcephaly (83%); foot deformities (69%); and epilepsy (66%) that is intractable in a subset. At last follow-up, 36% ambulated with assistance (mean age: 8.9 ± 6.4 years, SD) and 54% were wheelchair-dependent (mean age: 13.4 ± 9.8 years, SD). Episodes of stereotypic laughing, possibly consistent with a pseudobulbar affect, were found in 56% of patients. Key features on neuroimaging include a thin corpus callosum (90%), ventriculomegaly (65%) often with colpocephaly, and periventricular white-matter signal abnormalities (68%). Iron deposition and polymicrogyria were found in a subset of patients. AP4B1-associated SPG47 and AP4M1-associated SPG50 accounted for the majority of cases. About two-thirds of patients were born to consanguineous parents, and 82% carried homozygous variants. Over 70 unique variants were present, the majority of which are frameshift or nonsense mutations. To track disease progression across the age spectrum, we defined the relationship between disease severity as measured by several rating scales and disease duration. We found that the presence of epilepsy, which manifested before the age of 3 years in the majority of patients, was associated with worse motor outcomes. Exploring genotype-phenotype correlations, we found that disease severity and major phenotypes were equally distributed among the four subtypes, establishing that SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 share a common phenotype, an 'AP-4 deficiency syndrome'. By delineating the core clinical, imaging, and molecular features of AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia across the age spectrum our results will facilitate early diagnosis, enable counselling and anticipatory guidance of affected families and help define endpoints for future interventional trials.","dc:creator":"Ebrahimi-Fakhari D","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Defining the clinical, molecular and imaging spectrum of adaptor protein complex 4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32979048","rdfs:label":"Patient92"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"2 points were awarded based on the ID/autism expert group’s opinion that awarding 3 points (recommended based on SOP V8) for each case was too high and allowed for too few (only 4) cases to reach a definitive classification for AR conditions."},{"id":"cggv:f99f6143-396d-4195-9e85-27ce3fbc3caa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:77b78610-ff40-4a8a-9d53-f5541eecae35","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":24,"detectionMethod":"Linkage/homozygosity mapping identified 14 Mb candidate region on chromosome 7q22 containing 203 genes. \n\nmRNA expression of candidate gene transcripts in fibroblasts from probands and controls identified the AP4M1 gene as the strongest downregulated transcript in all neurologically compromised patients with a 2-fold downregulation of the gene (Figure S2).\n\nSequencing of the AP4M1 candidate locus revealed a splice donor site homozygous mutation in intron 14, c.1137+1G→T, in all five patients, whereas the parents were heterozygous (Figure 3A).

Here, we describe an autosomal-recessive type of tetraplegic cerebral palsy with mental retardation, reduction of cerebral white matter, and atrophy of the cerebellum in an inbred sibship. The phenotype was recorded and evolution followed for over 20 years. Brain lesions were studied by diffusion tensor MR tractography. Homozygosity mapping with SNPs was performed for identification of the chromosomal locus for the disease. In the 14 Mb candidate region on chromosome 7q22, RNA expression profiling was used for selecting among the 203 genes in the area. In postmortem brain tissue available from one patient, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed. Disease course and imaging were mostly reminiscent of hypoxic-ischemic tetraplegic cerebral palsy, with neuroaxonal degeneration and white matter loss. In all five patients, a donor splice site pathogenic mutation in intron 14 of the AP4M1 gene (c.1137+1G-->T), was identified. AP4M1, encoding for the mu subunit of the adaptor protein complex-4, is involved in intracellular trafficking of glutamate receptors. Aberrant GluRdelta2 glutamate receptor localization and dendritic spine morphology were observed in the postmortem brain specimen.

Recently, mutations affecting all four subunits of AP4 (AP4M1, AP4E1, AP4S1, and AP4B1) have been found to cause similar autosomal recessive phenotype consisting of tetraplegic cerebral palsy and intellectual disability. The aim of this study was analyzing AP4 genes in three new families with this phenotype, and discussing their clinical findings with an emphasis on neuroimaging and facial features. Using homozygosity mapping followed by whole-exome sequencing, we identified two novel homozygous mutations in AP4M1 and a homozygous deletion in AP4B1 in three pairs of siblings. Spastic tetraplegia, microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, limited speech, and stereotypic laughter were common findings in our patients. All patients also had similar facial features consisting of coarse and hypotonic face, bitemporal narrowing, bulbous nose with broad nasal ridge, and short philtrum which were not described in patients with AP4M1 and AP4B1 mutations previously. The patients presented here and previously with AP4M1, AP4B1, and AP4E1 mutations shared brain abnormalities including asymmetrical ventriculomegaly, thin splenium of the corpus callosum, and reduced white matter volume. The patients also had hippocampal globoid formation and thin hippocampus. In conclusion, disorders due to mutations in AP4 complex have similar neurological, facial, and cranial imaging findings. Thus, these four genes encoding AP4 subunits should be screened in patients with autosomal recessive spastic tetraplegic cerebral palsy, severe intellectual disability, and stereotypic laughter, especially with the described facial and cranial MRI features.","dc:creator":"Tüysüz B","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive spastic tetraplegia caused by AP4M1 and AP4B1 gene mutation:

sites to mediate neurotransmission. Receptors clustering at postsynaptic sites has been extensively studied; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular trafficking of receptors to their specific destinations remain unclear. In the present study, we found that glutamate receptor delta2 interacted directly with AP-4, a newly identified adaptor protein complex-4 that mediates protein sorting in mammalian cells. The interaction between mu4 subunit of AP-4 and the delta2 C-terminal involved multiple amino acid sequence motifs other than the classical tyrosine-based signals. AP-4 complex is expressed ubiquitously in many regions of brain, with localization on the Golgi-like structures in the cell bodies and dendrites of neurons. In addition, overexpression of mu4 substantially altered the distribution pattern of delta2 in heterologous cells. These results suggest a potential involvement of AP-4 in the trafficking of delta2 in the brain.","dc:creator":"Yap CC","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Adaptor protein complex-4 (AP-4) is expressed in the central nervous system neurons and interacts with glutamate receptor delta2."},"rdfs:label":"μ4-δ2 receptor yeast two-hybrid system interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:7660aff1-0ebf-4790-9fac-82417ffe44cf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f976e80-44ba-4750-b280-1fccd2047485","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"AP4B1, AP4E1 and AP4S1 also encode the three other subunits of the adaptor protein 4 (AP4); loss of any of these subunits results in the same AP4 deficiency clinical phenotype","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32979048","rdfs:label":"AP4 protein function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The finding that all four AP4 subunits result in a very similar, distinct phenotype is very strong evidence; this also demonstrates biochemical functional evidence of the involvement of AP4E1 in  the AP4 complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:f49be3e4-4e1f-478b-b4e0-f41623e5b548_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66a116e0-2f94-4b57-8f8f-a32a4470ba8c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ce1625c-5ea4-4be6-8cf2-25186d0fff2a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Patient post-mortem brain immunohistochemistry showed abnormal staining of glutamate receptor GluRδ2 in the Purkinje cell perikaryal and structural changes in dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells –  suggestive of abnormal vesicle-mediated transport to the dendrites and retention at the trans-Golgi network","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19559397","rdfs:label":"Abnormal GluRδ2 patterning in patient dendrites"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2823,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3bb8309a-2a22-4518-b352-9420638271c8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100176","gene":"hgnc:574","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"AP4M1 loss-of-function variants were first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Adaptor Protein 4 (AP4) deficiency syndrome in 2009 (PMID: 19559397). AP4 deficiency results in severe early-onset developmental delay with motor and speech delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia in infancy followed by spastic paraplegia and later tetraplegia, microcephaly, and seizures (PMID: 32979048). At least 59 individuals from 34 families with biallelic AP4M1 nonsense, frameshift, splicing and large deletion variants leading to loss of protein function have been reported (PMIDs: 19559397, 24700674, 25496299, 29096665, 32979048). The gene-disease association is further supported by biochemical and functional evidence demonstrating loss of AP4 complex function and abnormal glutamate receptor GluRδ2 staining in dendrites of post-mortem brain samples from patients with AP4M1 loss-of-function variants (PMID: 19559397). In summary, the AP4M1 gene is definitively associated with autosomal recessive AP4 deficiency syndrome.
