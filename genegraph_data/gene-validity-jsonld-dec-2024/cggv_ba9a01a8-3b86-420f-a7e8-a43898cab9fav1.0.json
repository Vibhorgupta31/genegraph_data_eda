Clinical heterogeneity has been reported, but key diagnostic findings are developmental regression, elevated lactate and characteristic neuroimaging abnormalities. Here, we describe three affected children from two unrelated families who presented with Leigh syndrome due to homozygous variants (c.346_*7del and c.173A>T p.His58Leu) in NDUFC2, encoding a complex I subunit. Biochemical and functional investigation of subjects' fibroblasts confirmed a severe defect in complex I activity, subunit expression and assembly. Lentiviral transduction of subjects' fibroblasts with wild-type NDUFC2 cDNA increased complex I assembly supporting the association of the identified NDUFC2 variants with mitochondrial pathology. Complexome profiling confirmed a loss of NDUFC2 and defective complex I assembly, revealing aberrant assembly intermediates suggestive of stalled biogenesis of the complex I holoenzyme and indicating a crucial role for NDUFC2 in the assembly of the membrane arm of complex I, particularly the ND2 module.","dc:creator":"Alahmad A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in NDUFC2 cause early-onset Leigh syndrome and stalled biogenesis of complex I."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba9a01a8-3b86-420f-a7e8-a43898cab9fa_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba9a01a8-3b86-420f-a7e8-a43898cab9fa_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:599c2d55-6e48-46e9-aa3e-3f0e9ed68241_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:599c2d55-6e48-46e9-aa3e-3f0e9ed68241","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"cggv:24907273-04c1-4002-9da0-457e02aba3d1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004549.6(NDUFC2):c.346_*7del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139662105"}},"detectionMethod":" Subsequent unbiased WGS identified a homozygous 22‐nucleotide deletion within the last exon of the NDUFC2 gene (NM_004549.6). \nThis c.346_*7del NDUFC2 variant (ClinVar: SCV001162791) is predicted to cause a p.(His116_Arg119delins21) stop‐loss variant in the NDUFC2 protein  \nSegregation analysis using Sanger sequencing found both parents and a healthy brother were heterozygous for the c.346_*7del variant;\n\nAbsent gnomAD v4.0.0","firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Leigh syndrome, rain MRI at 21 months showed bilateral areas of abnormal high signal intensity at the corticospinal tract level of the corona radiata with loss of white matter volume at these areas.

Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Å resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Numerous Complex I subunits and Assembly Factors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes involved as complex I subunits and assembly factors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ba9a01a8-3b86-420f-a7e8-a43898cab9fa_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f4f8cbb-5004-4fc2-8a2a-2bd4f4f2b343","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f66bc0b1-2acd-4ec8-b334-3907e356fe8d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Absence of NDUFC2 on complexome profiling","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969598","rdfs:label":"Complexome Studies in Subject 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Score 0.5 for little detectable NDUFC2 protein on complexome"},{"id":"cggv:99d4da94-4910-40d9-8bcd-2d219e65fb32","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a82285ae-d4fb-4ef1-8fd9-743e17793443","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Absence of NDUFC2 protein (mRNA 43% of control)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969598","rdfs:label":"Complexome Studies in Subject 1 "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Score 0.5 for absence of NDUFC2 protein on Complexome analysis "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":7595,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bdea6d68-c668-4328-9ee5-18538c9d1d96","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:7706","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFC2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of December 18, 2023. The *NDUFC2* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit C2, which also plays a role in complex I assembly. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe first and only report of *NDUFC2* in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2020 (PMID:32969598) in two unrelated probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFC2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFC2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFC2* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with LSS on November 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included\ntwo variants (homozygous missense and homozygous stop-loss) identified in two cases in one publication (PMID: 32969598). This gene-disease association is also supported by functional implication its known biochemical function (PMID: 27509854) and by complexome profiling in patient cells (PMID: 32969598). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFC2* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 18, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
