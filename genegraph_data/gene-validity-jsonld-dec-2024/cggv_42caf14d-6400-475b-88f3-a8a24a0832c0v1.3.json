(PMID: 8563763). However, the *FBN1* variant in this report has been found at a higher than expected frequency in the general population and is therefore not considered evidence in this evaluation. Two additional missense variants described in PMIDs: 19293843 and 27160103 have been observed at frequencies in the general population too high to be considered as evidence. Three additional variants described in PMIDs: 8563763, 16333834, and 19293843 were not evaluated as the clinical presentation of the affected individuals was more consistent with Marfan syndrome than Shprintzen-Goldberg Syndrome. In 2012, heterozygous pathogenic variants in the gene *SKI* were reported as the genetic cause of Shprintzen-Goldberg Syndrome (PMIDs: 23023332, 23103230). In summary, the evidence supporting an association between Shprintzen-Goldberg Syndrome and *FBN1* is disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/01/2021.\nNo valid evidence to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role played by FBN1 in this disease.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:42caf14d-6400-475b-88f3-a8a24a0832c0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
