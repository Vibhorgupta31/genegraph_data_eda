We report a patient with agenesis of corpus callosum, dysmorphism, and fatal neonatal lactic acidosis with markedly decreased complex I and IV activity in muscle and liver and a generalized mitochondrial translation defect identified in pulse-label experiments. The defect was associated with marked reduction of the 12S rRNA transcript level likely attributed to a nonsense mutation in the MRPS16 gene. A new group of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders is proposed, resulting from mutations in nuclear encoded components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus.","dc:creator":"Miller C","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Defective mitochondrial translation caused by a ribosomal protein (MRPS16) mutation."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband Miller et al 2004"},{"id":"cggv:db262eb1-9fe0-4298-8fb1-84b15c01a157","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:db262eb1-9fe0-4298-8fb1-84b15c01a157_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:db262eb1-9fe0-4298-8fb1-84b15c01a157_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"1.5 (last exon, but truncates roughly 20% of protein PMID: 18539099 shows mRNA MRPS16 13% of control, MRPS16 not present on WB) "}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"1.5 (last exon, but truncates roughly 20% of protein PMID: 18539099 shows mRNA MRPS16 13% of control, MRPS16 not present on WB) "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:1bc34eb8-8f60-4fad-892b-11929760cae6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1bc34eb8-8f60-4fad-892b-11929760cae6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46c928d9-65c3-4245-9086-370e9dda7cd1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d32a362-ca7b-4ae7-b75f-af8fc4552bf2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"All genes are either respiratory chain subunits or ribosomal proteins","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15505824","rdfs:label":"Pulse labeling translation in FCL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes implicated \nCryo-EM not scored separately since max score reached but can be found at PMID: 24799711"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:1bc34eb8-8f60-4fad-892b-11929760cae6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63f721ef-e800-4f8d-9525-4dc3a4c33dbe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b725fd60-2c78-49e9-96cc-0ad9d73f05fb","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"12S rRNA 12% of control on Northern Blot ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15505824","rdfs:label":"Northern Blot RNA studies "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Discuss whether overlaps too much with Figure A and Pulse chase"},{"id":"cggv:c7fc3ac9-8fd3-472e-bafa-37b7924bdf5e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a40dfb4-cbbd-4f53-9e11-ce720c5d9fdf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"MSK: I 25% control, II 114%, II+III 0%, IV 22%, V 23% \nLIV: I 18%, II+III 19%, IV 17% \n\nValues are normalized for CS\nSpectrophotometry \nFibroblast, borderline low IV , II, III normal","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15505824","rdfs:label":"Respiratory Chain Studies in Muscle and Liver"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Score 1 point for each tissue since combined oxphos"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":5213,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":7,"subject":{"id":"cggv:74245143-6084-405d-9f0e-fa53c43ffc4c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:14048","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MRPS16* and mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of June 16, 2022. The *MRPS16* gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S16, a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.\n\nThe *MRPS16* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2004 (PMID: 15505824). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MRPS16*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MRPS16* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous nonsense variant identified in one case from one publication (PMID: 15505824). This individual was of Bedouin descent and was born to consanguineous parents. Medical concerns included severe lactic acidosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly, lethargy, and neonatal hypotonia. This individual died in the first few days of life. While this report pre-dated the comprehensive genomic sequencing, this GCEP agreed the biochemical and genetic evaluation performed was sufficient for this case to be included in this curation, and functional validation of the variant identified in this case was performed in a subsequent publication (PMID:18539099). Loss-of-function is implicated as a mechanism of disease.  This gene-disease relationship is also supported by its known biochemical function that is shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 15505824). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although the total score (7) falls in the moderate range, only one case with primary mitochondrial disease has been reported, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 16, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\nAlthough the total score (7) falls in the moderate range, only one case with primary mitochondrial disease has been reported, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time.  However, the evidence is compelling and, with a second case report, this association would reach criteria for a moderate classification.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1bc34eb8-8f60-4fad-892b-11929760cae6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
