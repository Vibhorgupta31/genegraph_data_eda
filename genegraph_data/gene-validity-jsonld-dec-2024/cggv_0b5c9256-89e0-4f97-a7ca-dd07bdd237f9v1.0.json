Disturbance of this highly regulated process underlies familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), a genetically heterogeneous autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a severe hyperinflammatory phenotype. Here, we have assigned FHL-5 to a 1 Mb region on chromosome 19p by using high-resolution SNP genotyping in eight unrelated FHL patients from consanguineous families. Subsequently, we found nine different mutations, either truncating or missense, in STXBP2 in twelve patients from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Central Europe. STXBP2 encodes syntaxin binding protein 2 (Munc18-2), involved in the regulation of vesicle transport to the plasma membrane. We have identified syntaxin 11, a SNARE protein mutated in FHL-4, as an interaction partner of STXBP2. This interaction is eliminated by the missense mutations found in our FHL-5 patients, which leads to a decreased stability of both proteins, as shown in patient lymphocytes. Activity of natural killer and cytotoxic T cells was markedly reduced or absent, as determined by CD107 degranulation. Our findings thus identify a key role for STXBP2 in lytic granule exocytosis.","dc:creator":"zur Stadt U","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL-5) is caused by mutations in Munc18-2 and impaired binding to syntaxin 11."},"rdfs:label":"increased expression in hematopoietic cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Consistent with enhanced expression in lymphoid tissue reported in the Human Protein Atlas."},{"id":"cggv:414247d3-2dc9-4970-a78a-3dd12caef7e0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ff05c49-f0b1-42ca-897f-f570f15bc4bb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"The authors assessed the expression of STXBP2 in lymphoblasts obtained from F2P1, F2P2, F5P1, and F6P1.

These genes all encode proteins involved in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes. Here, we show that the gene encoding syntaxin-binding protein 2 (Munc18-2; official gene symbol STXBP2) is mutated in another subset of patients with FHL (designated by us as \"FHL5\"). Lymphoblasts isolated from these patients had strongly decreased STXBP2 protein expression, and NK cells exhibited impaired cytotoxic granule exocytosis, a defect that could be overcome by ectopic expression of wild-type STXBP2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that syntaxin-11 is the main partner of STXBP2 in lymphocytes, as its expression required the presence of STXBP2. Our work shows that STXBP2 deficiency causes FHL5.

We detected biallelic mutations in 37 patients from 28 families of various ethnic origins. Missense mutations and mutations affecting 1 of the exon 15 splice sites were the predominant changes detectable in this cohort. Patients with exon 15 splice-site mutations (n = 13) developed clinical manifestations significantly later than patients with other mutations (median age, 4.1 year vs 2 months) and showed less severe impairment of degranulation and cytotoxic function of NK cells and CTLs. Patients with FHL5 showed several atypical features, including sensorineural hearing deficit, abnormal bleeding, and, most frequently, severe diarrhea that was only present in early-onset disease. In conclusion, we report the largest cohort of patients with FHL5 so far, describe an extended disease spectrum, and demonstrate for the first time a clear genotype-phenotype correlation.","dc:creator":"Pagel J","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Distinct mutations in STXBP2 are associated with variable clinical presentations in patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL5)."}},{"id":"cggv:0450ad7c-facb-4d3b-af19-94b957541014_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:08e64423-8984-4dac-b994-caf0d9485c11"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22451424"}],"rdfs:label":"A-376"},{"id":"cggv:033fe9b8-428d-4713-a2ab-b6c6a727b072","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:033fe9b8-428d-4713-a2ab-b6c6a727b072_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:033fe9b8-428d-4713-a2ab-b6c6a727b072_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"An exogenous construct made with cDNA that harbors the c.1621G>A mutation, resulting in Gly541Ser was used for coimmunoprecipitation analysis for binding with syntaxin 11.

FHL is a hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by an uncontrolled and ineffective proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages that infiltrate multiple organs, including liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system (CNS), and produce massive amounts of cytokines. This overwhelming hyperimmune status results in a clinical picture characterized by persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hemophagocytosis in various tissues, coagulation abnormalities, and inflammatory CNS disease. Patients with FHL5 have several unique features, including sensorineural hearing deficit, abnormal bleeding, and severe diarrhea. *STXBP2* is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and vesicle fusion with membranes, it contributes to the granule exocytosis machinery through interaction with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins that regulate membrane fusion. The role of *STXBP2* in the cytotoxic granule pathway, and how variation in the gene results in FHL5 is currently not understood in detail but the mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This curation includes eleven variants (including in-frame deletions, missense, splicing, and frameshift) found in ten probands from two publications (PMIDs: 19804848, 22451424). Additional cases are available in the literature however the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. A role in disease is supported by increased expression of *STXBP2* in NK cells, T cells, monocytes, and other hematopoietic cells (PMID: 19804848), which is altered in patients (PMID: 19884660), resulting in altered cytotoxicity of patient NK cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (PMID: 19804848). Additionally, degranulation defects were rescued in patient cells with wildtype *STXBP2* (PMID: 19884660). *STXBP2* is also known to interact with *STX11*, which has a well established relationship with FHL (PMID: 19804848). In summary *STXBP2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive FHL5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0b5c9256-89e0-4f97-a7ca-dd07bdd237f9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
