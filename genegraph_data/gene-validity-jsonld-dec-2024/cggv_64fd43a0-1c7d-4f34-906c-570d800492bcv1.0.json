HPP is heterogeneous, with clinical presentation correlating with residual TNSALP activity and/or dominant-negative effects (DNE). We measured residual activity and DNE for 155 ALPL variants by transient transfection and TNSALP enzymatic activity measurement. Ninety variants showed low residual activity and 24 showed DNE. These results encompass all missense variants with carrier frequencies above 1/25,000 from the Genome Aggregation Database. We used resulting data as a reference to develop a new computational algorithm that scores ALPL missense variants and predicts high/low TNSALP enzymatic activity. Our approach measures the effects of amino acid changes on TNSALP dimer stability with a physics-based implicit solvent energy model. We predict mutation deleteriousness with high specificity, achieving a true-positive rate of 0.63 with false-positive rate of 0, with an area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.9, better than all in silico predictors tested. Combining this algorithm with other in silico approaches can further increase performance, reaching an AUC of 0.94. This study expands our understanding of HPP heterogeneity and genotype/phenotype relationships with the aim of improving clinical ALPL variant interpretation.","dc:creator":"Del Angel G","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Large-scale in vitro functional testing and novel variant scoring via protein modeling provide insights into alkaline phosphatase activity in hypophosphatasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160374","rdfs:label":"32"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"2 points (1.5 predicted null + 0.5 for missense with functional evidence)\nAllele 1: 0.034 compared to WT\nAllele 2: 0 (predicted null)\n"},{"id":"cggv:17c64bf9-4672-459a-a6a1-7ca8aaf48ab2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0c5304f3-8207-433b-887f-5763b1fa1bdb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Fibroblasts from patient used and DNA was amplified and then run on a gel.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"“Classical abnormalities” associated with perinatal hypophosphatasia, including profound skeletal hypomineralization, serum ALP was 11 U/L (normal: 168-406), urinary phosphoethanolamine excretion of 4.32 µmol/mg of creatinine","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003239","obo:HP_0010683"],"secondTestingMethod":"Denaturing gradient gel","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:17c64bf9-4672-459a-a6a1-7ca8aaf48ab2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ff79e0b0-9d8e-4948-b550-53028c47ab18","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.535G>A (p.Ala179Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256919"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3174660","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hypophosphatasia is an inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization and a deficiency of serum and tissue liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase (L/B/K ALP) activity. Clinical severity is variable, ranging from death in utero (due to severe rickets) to pathologic fractures first presenting in adult life. Affected siblings, however, are phenotypically similar. Severe forms of the disease are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion; heterozygotes often show reduced serum ALP activity. The specific gene defects in hypophosphatasia are unknown but are thought to occur either at the L/B/K ALP locus or within another gene that regulates L/B/K ALP expression. We used the polymerase chain reaction to examine L/B/K ALP cDNA from a patient with a perinatal (lethal) form of the disease. We observed a guanine-to-adenine transition in nucleotide 711 of the cDNA that converts alanine-162 of the mature enzyme to threonine.

Severe forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion; the mode of transmission of mild forms is uncertain. The biochemical hallmark of hypophosphatasia is deficient activity of the tissue-nonspecific isozyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). Previously, we demonstrated in one inbred infant that an identical missense mutation in both alleles of the gene encoding TNSALP caused lethal disease. We have now examined TNSALP cDNAs from four unrelated patients with the severe perinatal or infantile forms of hypophosphatasia. Each of the eight TNSALP alleles from these four individuals contains a different point mutation that causes an amino acid substitution. These base changes were not detected in at least 63 normal individuals and, thus, appear to be causes of hypophosphatasia in the four patients. (Two additional base substitutions, found in one allele from each of the four patients, are linked polymorphisms.) Twenty-three unrelated patients (of 50 screened), who reflect the entire clinical spectrum of hypophosphatasia, possess one of our of the above eight mutations. In two of these additional patients, mild forms of the disease are also inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Our findings indicate that hypophosphatasia can be caused by a number of different missense mutations and that the specific interactions of different TNSALP mutant alleles are probably important for determining clinical expression. Severe forms, perinatal and infantile disease, are largely the result of compound heterozygosity for different hypophosphatasia alleles. At least some cases of childhood and adult hypophosphatasia are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.","dc:creator":"Henthorn PS","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Different missense mutations at the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase gene locus in autosomal recessively inherited forms of mild and severe hypophosphatasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1409720","rdfs:label":"GM3859"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"TNSALP mutants (R71C and D294A) were expressed ectopically in COS-1 cells.

In this study, a detailed characterization of the ultrastructural localization, the relative amount and ultrastructural morphology of bone mineral was carried out in tibial growth plates and in subjacent metaphyseal bone of 10-day-old TNAP knockout mice. Alizarin red staining, microcomputerized tomography (micro CT), and FTIR imaging spectroscopy (FT-IRIS) confirmed a significant overall decrease of mineral density in the cartilage and bone matrix of TNAP-deficient mice. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed diminished mineral in growth plate cartilage and in newly formed bone matrix. High resolution TEM indicated that mineral crystals were initiated, as is normal, within matrix vesicles (MVs) of the growth plate and bone of TNAP-deficient mice. However, mineral crystal proliferation and growth was inhibited in the matrix surrounding MVs, as is the case in the hereditary human disease hypophosphatasia. These data suggest that hypomineralization in TNAP-deficient mice results primarily from an inability of initial mineral crystals within MVs to self-nucleate and to proliferate beyond the protective confines of the MV membrane. This failure of the second stage of mineral formation may be caused by an excess of the mineral inhibitor pyrophosphate (PPi) in the extracellular fluid around MVs. In normal circumstances, PPi is hydrolyzed by the TNAP of MVs' outer membrane yielding monophosphate ions (Pi) for incorporation into bone mineral. Thus, with TNAP deficiency a buildup of mineral-inhibiting PPi would be expected at the perimeter of MVs.","dc:creator":"Anderson HC","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Impaired calcification around matrix vesicles of growth plate and bone in alkaline phosphatase-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Knockout mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded because it did not fully recapitulate the human phenotype"},{"id":"cggv:dc427b0f-e7ce-464a-a26e-dff7671ee330","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1449eb7d-fbbc-43a6-89a2-e13a653216ab","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Increased TNSALP substrates seen in KO mice similar to those seen in humans with hypophosphatasia and low ALP levels like humans.

Severe hypophosphatasia is a rare, severe form of hypophosphatasia characterized by infantile rickets without elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and a wide range of clinical manifestations due to hypomineralization. Individuals often present with these features in infancy or in the perinatal period. Based upon the severity and mode of inheritance of the hypophosphatasia clinical subtypes, the curations for autosomal recessive moderate hypophosphatasia, autosomal dominant moderate hypophosphatasia, and autosomal dominant mild hypophosphatasia have been split and curated separately (PMID: 32973344). Sixteen variants (missense, nonsense, splice) that have been reported in 9 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 3174660, 1409720, 18523927, 17922851, 29159075, 32160374) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and a rescue study (PMIDs: 10620060, 14982838, 30700765, 18086009). In summary, ALPL is definitively associated with autosomal recessive severe hypophosphatasia. This has\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has\nbeen upheld over time.
