Our morphological study on LGMD D2 muscle described the expression of TNPO3 and SRSF1, a splicing factor transported by TNPO3. Moreover, we investigated some sarcomeric and nuclear proteins, likely altered by TNPO3 mutation. Through an in silico approach we tried to identify genes involved in pathways that include, besides TNPO3 and SRSF1, p62 and Murf-1, altered in LGMD D2. In patients' muscles TNPO3 appeared weaker and randomly organized, with sporadic cytoplasmic aggregates positive for TNPO3; both SRSF1 and sarcomeric alpha actinin showed a different expression, while there were no alterations in the expression of the nuclear proteins. The in silico study lead to identify five genes, all coding for proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Our data suggest a possible interference in the morphology and function of myofibrillar network by mutated TNPO3; these findings are supported by the in silico identification of genes involved in muscle contraction that could help to explain the pathogenic mechanisms of LGMD D2.","dc:creator":"Costa R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Transportin 3 (TNPO3) and related proteins in limb girdle muscular dystrophy D2 muscle biopsies: A morphological study and pathogenetic hypothesis."},"rdfs:label":"Costa_Expression_Experiment "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Already included an expression experiment detailing expression of TNPO3 in muscle tissue - 0 points given here"},{"id":"cggv:c1c387a5-5bdd-419f-be8b-5a90033d6d24","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6ed1af09-ef82-46cd-92d5-ab06953971d6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Both TNPO3 RNA and protein expression is confirmed in skeletal muscle cells of both probands and controls via Real Time PCR and immunostaining respectively, with variants that extend the C-terminus of the protein altering normal nuclear expression.

Here, using a whole genome sequencing strategy, we identified the causative mutation of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1F, a heterozygous single nucleotide deletion (c.2771del) in the termination codon of transportin 3 (TNPO3). This gene is situated within the chromosomal region linked to the disease and encodes a nuclear membrane protein belonging to the importin beta family. TNPO3 transports serine/arginine-rich proteins into the nucleus, and has been identified as a key factor in the HIV-import process into the nucleus. The mutation is predicted to generate a 15-amino acid extension of the C-terminus of the protein, segregates with the clinical phenotype, and is absent in genomic sequence databases and a set of >200 control alleles. In skeletal muscle of affected individuals, expression of the mutant messenger RNA and histological abnormalities of nuclei and TNPO3 indicate altered TNPO3 function.

The domain rich in arginine/serine (RS) repeats (RS domain) serves as both a nuclear and subnuclear localization signal. We previously identified an importin beta family protein, transportin-SR2 (TRN-SR2), that specifically interacts with phosphorylated RS domains. A TRN-SR2 mutant deficient in Ran binding colocalizes with SR proteins in nuclear speckles, suggesting a role of TRN-SR2 in nuclear targeting of SR proteins. Using in vitro import assays, we here show that nuclear import of SR protein fusions requires cytosolic factors, and that the RS domain becomes phosphorylated in the import reaction. Reconstitution of SR protein import by using recombinant transport factors clearly demonstrates that TRN-SR2 is capable of targeting phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, SR proteins to the nucleus. Therefore, RS domain phosphorylation is critical for TRN-SR2-mediated nuclear import. Interestingly, we found that the RNA-binding activity of SR proteins confers temperature sensitivity to their nuclear import. Finally, we show that TRN-SR2 interacts with a nucleoporin and is targeted not only to the nuclear envelope but also to nuclear speckles in vitro. Thus, TRN-SR2 may perhaps escort SR protein cargoes to nuclear subdomains.","dc:creator":"Lai MC","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Transportin-SR2 mediates nuclear import of phosphorylated SR proteins."},"rdfs:label":"TNPO3 Transporter Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Although the exact mechanism affected by TNPO3 in the skeletal muscle to cause the gross phenotypes of LGMD are not fully understood, the transporter's function clearly matches the histological signs observed on muscle biopsy with abnormal nuclei.

Autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (MONDO:0015151) is characterized by proximal muscle weakness primarily affecting the lower limbs, but also affecting the upper limbs in most patients.\n \nSummary of Genetic Evidence (4.5 points): Three unique variants have been reported in humans, all of which are 1-bp deletions that extend the c-terminus of the protein by ~15-20 amino acids. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and limited experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in three probands in three publications with subject overlap between them (PMIDs: 23543484, 31071488, 31192305).\n Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three families, with the first large Spanish family yielding a maximum LOD score of 7.56 at Œ∏ = 0 with 32 affected individuals and whole exome sequencing. Although the mechanism for disease is not fully understood, functional studies and interactions have posited that *TNPO3* variants likely affect multiple systems including nuclear transport and myofibrillar networks (Costa et al., PMID: 32690349).\n \nSummary of Experimental Evidence (2 points): This gene-disease association is supported by only a limited amount of experimental evidence. The protein's nuclear import biochemical function provides specific evidence due to nuclear alterations unique to this LGMD, including centrally nucleated muscle fibers, rimmed vacuoles, and inclusion bodies (PMID:11517331). Normal expression in skeletal muscle tissue nuclei for both RNA and protein also provide evidence towards this association (PMID:23543484). Introduction of the human *TNPO3* c.2771delA variant (*TNPO3*mut) expression in fly motor neurons reduced locomotor activity of fly‚Äôs overtime, thus supporting the phenotype found in humans (PMID: 34547132).\n \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more experimental evidence and functional data is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9cd2cbd3-46da-490c-9765-40b52750dded"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
