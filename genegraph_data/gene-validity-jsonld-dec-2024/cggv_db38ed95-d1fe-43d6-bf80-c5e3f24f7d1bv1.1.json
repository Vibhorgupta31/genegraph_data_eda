Although a large proportion of X-linked MR genes have been identified, only four genes responsible for autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic MR (AR-NSMR) have been described so far. Here, we report on two genes involved in autosomal-recessive and X-linked NSMR. First, autozygosity mapping in two sibs born to first-cousin French parents led to the identification of a region on 8p22-p23.1. This interval encompasses the gene N33/TUSC3 encoding one subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase) complex, which catalyzes the transfer of an oligosaccharide chain on nascent proteins, the key step of N-glycosylation. Sequencing N33/TUSC3 identified a 1 bp insertion, c.787_788insC, resulting in a premature stop codon, p.N263fsX300, and leading to mRNA decay. Surprisingly, glycosylation analyses of patient fibroblasts showed normal N-glycan synthesis and transfer, suggesting that normal N-glycosylation observed in patient fibroblasts may be due to functional compensation. Subsequently, screening of the X-linked N33/TUSC3 paralog, the IAP gene, identified a missense mutation (c.932T-->G, p.V311G) in a family with X-linked NSMR. Recent studies of fucosylation and polysialic-acid modification of neuronal cell-adhesion glycoproteins have shown the critical role of glycosylation in synaptic plasticity. However, our data provide the first demonstration that a defect in N-glycosylation can result in NSMR. Together, our results demonstrate that fine regulation of OTase activity is essential for normal cognitive-function development, providing therefore further insights to understand the pathophysiological bases of MR.","dc:creator":"Molinari F","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Oligosaccharyltransferase-subunit mutations in nonsyndromic mental retardation."},"rdfs:label":"Tissue Distribution of N33/TUSC3 mRNA"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not specific enough"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:db38ed95-d1fe-43d6-bf80-c5e3f24f7d1b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c7f207d1-ab36-4008-a203-b43fed55a0f9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34cd09ae-55ea-480a-9f43-94b1c5eac06f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"No aberrant mRNA but a reduced amount of transcript was observed.

The pattern completion ability was also improved in aged rats. MgT-treated rats had higher density of synaptophysin-/synaptobrevin-positive puncta in DG and CA1 subregions of hippocampus that were correlated with memory improvement. Functionally, magnesium increased the number of functional presynaptic release sites, while it reduced their release probability. The resultant synaptic reconfiguration enabled selective enhancement of synaptic transmission for burst inputs. Coupled with concurrent upregulation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors and its downstream signaling, synaptic plasticity induced by correlated inputs was enhanced.

We performed whole exome sequencing to 21 Turkish families, seven multiplex and 14 simplex, with nonsyndromic ID.

We revealed the underlying causative variants in seven families in MCPH1 (c.427dupA, p.T143Nfs*5), WDR62 (c.3406C>T, p.R1136*), ASPM (c.5219_5225delGAGGATA, p.R1740Tfs*7), RARS (c.1588A>G, p.T530A), CC2D1A (c.811delG, p.A271Pfs*30), TUSC3 (c.793C>T, p.Q265*) and ZNF335 (c.808C>T, p.R270C and c.3715C>A, p.Q1239K) previously linked with ARID.

Of note, large deletions cannot be entered into the Gene Curation Interface at this time but have been observed   in probands with Intellectual disability (PMIDs: 28397838, 18452889, 23825019). Case-level evidence supports this gene-disease relationship. In summary, TUSC3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:db38ed95-d1fe-43d6-bf80-c5e3f24f7d1b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
