Individuals with these variants exhibited developmental delay and intellectual disability. Core clinical features included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mild facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis, and osteochondromas. Out of the 19 individuals, 14 had de novo variants, while 4 inherited the variant, including 3 siblings from their affected father and 1 individual from an unaffected father with 22% mosaicism for the variant. Given the spectrum of neurodevelopmental features observed, the gene is curated for autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. \n\nSeventeen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, copy number variants) have been reported in 19 probands in one publication (Tolchin et al.,PMID: 32442410 ) are included in this curation. Most variants were de novo. Functional assays like immunoblotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that two of the missense variants significantly affect SOX6's ability to localize within the nucleus and bind to target DNA.  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\n\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SOX6* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism expert panel on September 17th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c9a42d99-af9a-47d6-ab3c-e2d874f823f2"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
