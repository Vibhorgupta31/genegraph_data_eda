Over 130 genes are implicated and next generation sequencing further identifies potential disease drivers in affected individuals. However, functional testing of these variants is challenging, making it difficult to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic events. Using proximity labelling, we identified OST48 as a protein that transiently interacts with lysyl oxidase (LOX), a secreted enzyme that cross-links the fibrous extracellular matrix. OST48 is a non-catalytic component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which transfers glycans to substrate proteins. OST48 is encoded by DDOST, and 43 variants of DDOST are described in CDG patients, of which 34 are classified as variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). We developed an assay based on LOX N-glycosylation that confirmed two previously characterised DDOST variants as pathogenic. Notably, 39 of the 41 remaining variants did not have impaired activity, but we demonstrated that p.S243F and p.E286del were functionally impaired, consistent with a role in driving CDG in those patients. Thus, we describe a rapid assay for functional testing of clinically relevant CDG variants to complement genome sequencing and support clinical diagnosis of affected individuals.","dc:creator":"Kas SM","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Functional classification of DDOST variants of uncertain clinical significance in congenital disorders of glycosylation."},"rdfs:label":"Kas 2023 Biochemical function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9c65492a-146d-4d6b-a720-6af6084da91c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6eb2ced5-1139-4ea7-977e-612e5c00949b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"DDOST is part of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex(OST complex)which plays a key role in N-glycosylation.

In this report we show that the essential yeast protein WBP1 (te Heesen et al., 1991) is required for N-oligosaccharyl transferase in vivo and in vitro. Depletion of WBP1 correlates with a defect in transferring core oligosaccharides to carboxypeptidase Y and proteinase A in vivo. In addition, in vitro N-glycosylation of the acceptor peptide Tyr-Asn-Leu-Thr-Ser-Val using microsomal membranes from WBP1 depleted cells is reduced as compared with membranes from wild-type cells.

Approximately 20% of patients do not survive beyond the age of 5 years old as a result of widespread organ dysfunction. Although most patients receive a CDG diagnosis based on abnormal glycosylation of transferrin, this test cannot provide a genetic diagnosis; indeed, many patients with abnormal transferrin do not have mutations in any known CDG genes. Here, we combined biochemical analysis with whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the genetic defect in an untyped CDG patient, and we found a 22 bp deletion and a missense mutation in DDOST, whose product is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex that transfers the glycan chain from a lipid carrier to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Biochemical analysis with three biomarkers revealed that N-glycosylation was decreased in the patient's fibroblasts. Complementation with wild-type-DDOST cDNA in patient fibroblasts restored glycosylation, indicating that the mutations were pathological. Our results highlight the power of combining WES and biochemical studies, including a glyco-complementation system, for identifying and confirming the defective gene in an untyped CDG patient.

At least 7 unique variants (missense, frameshift) have been reported. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 4 probands from 4 publications (PMIDs 22305527, 33413482, 34462534, 36214423). Patients have a range of clinical features, including developmental delay, hypotonia, failure to thrive, eye abnormalities, gastrointestinal involvement, and liver dysfunction.  The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of DDOST, which encodes a subunit of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex (OST complex) which plays a key role in N-glycosylation (PMIDs 1600939, 37848450). Rescue experiments in patient fibroblasts demonstrated that wild type DDOST restores glycosylation (PMID 22305527). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 15, 2023 (SOP version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e0605b51-70c5-42ee-81b5-d45bb0b1fdab"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
