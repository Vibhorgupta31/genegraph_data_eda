Mutations in VPS33B account for most cases of ARC. We identified mutations in VIPAR (also called C14ORF133) in individuals with ARC without VPS33B defects. We show that VIPAR forms a functional complex with VPS33B that interacts with RAB11A. Knockdown of vipar in zebrafish resulted in biliary excretion and E-cadherin defects similar to those in individuals with ARC. Vipar- and Vps33b-deficient mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMDC-3) cells expressed membrane proteins abnormally and had structural and functional tight junction defects. Abnormal Ceacam5 expression was due to mis-sorting toward lysosomal degradation, but reduced E-cadherin levels were associated with transcriptional downregulation. The VPS33B-VIPAR complex thus has diverse functions in the pathways regulating apical-basolateral polarity in the liver and kidney.","dc:creator":"Cullinane AR","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in VIPAR cause an arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis syndrome phenotype with defects in epithelial polarization."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20190753","rdfs:label":"Subject 7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The homozygous Met1Arg variant is predicted to cause failure of translation but this was not confirmed.

Although several proteins are known to be required for δ-granule development, less is known about α-granule biogenesis. Our previous work showed that the BEACH protein NBEAL2 and the Sec1/Munc18 protein VPS33B are required for α-granule biogenesis. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, mass spectrometry, coimmunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics studies, we identified VPS16B as a VPS33B-binding protein. Immunoblotting confirmed VPS16B expression in various human tissues and cells including megakaryocytes and platelets, and also in megakaryocytic Dami cells. Characterization of platelets from a patient with arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome containing mutations in C14orf133 encoding VPS16B revealed pale-appearing platelets in blood films and electron microscopy revealed a complete absence of α-granules, whereas δ-granules were observed. Soluble and membrane-bound α-granule proteins were reduced or undetectable, suggesting that both releasable and membrane-bound α-granule constituents were absent. Immunofluorescence microscopy of Dami cells stably expressing GFP-VPS16B revealed that similar to VPS33B, GFP-VPS16B colocalized with markers of the trans-Golgi network, late endosomes and α-granules.

However, the mechanism and contribution of collagen modifications that occur outside the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi are not understood.

Identification of structural and functional collagen abnormalities in cells and tissues from patients and murine models of the autosomal recessive multisystem disorder Arthrogryposis, Renal dysfunction and Cholestasis syndrome caused by VIPAR and VPS33B deficiencies confirmed our findings. Thus, regulation of post-Golgi LH3 trafficking is essential for collagen homeostasis and for the development and function of multiple organs and tissues.","dc:creator":"Banushi B","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Regulation of post-Golgi LH3 trafficking is essential for collagen homeostasis."},"rdfs:label":"Vipas39 ko mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The collagen abnormalities identified in skin fibroblasts and tendons consistent with the characteristic ARC features of ichthyosis, arthrogryposis, osteopenia and bone fractures suggest an important role for VIPAS39 dependent trafficking in connective tissue.

The classical presentation of ARC includes congenital joint contractures, renal tubular dysfunction, and cholestasis. Additional features include ichthyosis, central nervous system malformation, platelet anomalies, and severe failure to thrive. At least 13 unique variants (mostly nonsense but also frameshift, splicing, start loss, and missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 20190753, 22753090, 23002115, 23636179). This gene-disease relationship is supported by its interaction with VPS33B (PMID: 20190753) and their function as part of a complex that interacts with an active form of RAB11A involved in apical membrane protein sorting, the alteration in mIMCD-3 cells confirming the role of VIPAS39 in regulating apical-basolateral polarity in the kidney consistent with the renal dysfunction seen in patients (PMID: 20190753), a zebrafish model recapitulating biliary abnormalities (PMID: 20190753), and a mouse model with collagen abnormalities identified in skin fibroblasts and tendons consistent with the characteristic ARC features of ichthyosis, arthrogryposis, osteopenia and bone fractures (PMID: 27435297).
