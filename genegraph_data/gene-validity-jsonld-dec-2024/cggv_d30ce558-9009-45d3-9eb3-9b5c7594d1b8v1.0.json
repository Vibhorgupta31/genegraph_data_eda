Its expression is restricted mainly to cardiomyocytes, although it is also expressed in skeletal muscle, testis and brain. Like other alpha-catenins, alphaT-catenin provides an indispensable link between a cadherin-based adhesion complex and the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in strong cell-cell adhesion. We show here that the tissue-specificity of alphaT-catenin expression is controlled by its promoter region. By in silico analysis, we found that the alphaT-catenin promoter contains several binding sites for cardiac and muscle-specific transcription factors. By co-transfection studies in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, we demonstrated that MEF2C and GATA-4 each have an activating effect on the alphaT-catenin promoter. Transfections with wild-type and mutant promoter constructs in cardiac HL-1 cells indicated that one GATA box is absolutely required for high alphaT-catenin promoter activity in these cells. Furthermore, we showed that the GATA-4 transcription factor specifically binds and activates the alphaT-catenin promoter in vivo in cardiac HL-1 cells. In vivo promoter analysis in transgenic mice revealed that the isolated alphaT-catenin promoter region could direct the tissue-specific expression of a LacZ reporter gene in concordance with endogenous alphaT-catenin expression.","dc:creator":"Vanpoucke G","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"GATA-4 and MEF2C transcription factors control the tissue-specific expression of the alphaT-catenin gene CTNNA3."},"rdfs:label":"Protein interaction study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":7389,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":0.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f927e3f1-3ace-448b-bf76-79fcd84390a9","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:2511","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000005"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*CTNNA3* was first reported in relation to congenital heart disease in 2013 (Symou et al., PMID:23481551). Five probands with multi-gene CNVs (4 gross deletions, 1 duplication) at the 10q21.3 location have been reported in four publications (PMIDs: 23481551, 24297458, 28378413, 28472932). Although this gene-disease association is supported by a protein interaction study (PMID:​ 15302915), no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CTNNA3* and congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *CTNNA3* plays in this disease.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 10/17/2023 (SOP Version 9)\nExperts deemed evidence not enough to support the gene-diasease relationship","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d30ce558-9009-45d3-9eb3-9b5c7594d1b8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
