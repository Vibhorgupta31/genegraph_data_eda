Whole-exome sequencing of a single Italian proband affected by non-syndromic HL identified a novel missense variant within the PRPS1 gene (NM_002764.3:c.337G>T (p.A113S)) segregating with post-lingual, bilateral, progressive deafness in the proband's family. Defects in this gene, encoding the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS-I) enzyme, determine either X-linked syndromic conditions associated with hearing impairment (eg, Arts syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type X-5) or non-syndromic HL (DFNX1). A subsequent screening of the entire PRPS1 gene in 16 unrelated probands from X-linked deaf families led to the discovery of two additional missense variants (c.343A>G (p.M115V) and c.925G>T (p.V309F)) segregating with hearing impairment, and associated with mildly-symptomatic peripheral neuropathy. All three variants result in a marked reduction (>60%) of the PRS-I activity in the patients' erythrocytes, with c.343A>G (p.M115V) and c.925G>T (p.V309F) affecting more severely the enzyme function.

The disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, and the affected male patients invariably develop sensorineural hearing loss of prelingual type followed by gating disturbance and visual loss. The family of European descent was reported in 1967 as having Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome, and recently a Korean family with the same symptom triad was identified with a novel disease locus CMTX5 on the chromosome band Xq21.32-q24. PRPS1 (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1) is an isoform of the PRPS gene family and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, including cochlea. The enzyme mediates the biochemical step critical for purine metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis. The mutations identified were E43D, in patients with Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome, and M115T, in the Korean patients with CMTX5. We also showed decreased enzyme activity in patients with M115T.

Zebrafish prps1a mutants and prps1a;prps1b double mutants showed similar morphological phenotypes with increasingly severe phenotypes as the number of mutant alleles increased. Phenotypes included smaller eyes and reduced hair cell numbers, consistent with the optic atrophy and hearing impairment observed in human patients. The double mutant also showed abnormal development of primary motor neurons, hair cell innervation, and reduced leukocytes, consistent with the neuropathy and recurrent infection of the human patients possessing the most severe reductions of PRPS1 activity.

Fourteen unique loss of function (LOF) missense variants have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in more than 15 additional family members. PRPS1 was first associated with hearing loss in humans in 1988 (Becker et al.); however, since then LOF variants in this gene have also been associated with syndromic conditions in which hearing loss is a feature, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX5), Arts Syndrome, and more severe deficiency disorders. Of note, intellectual disability and developmental delay are usually associated with Arts syndrome and more severe cases of PRPS1 deficiency, but not CMTX5 or nonsyndromic hearing loss (PMID: 24961627). While most males with Arts syndrome present with mild to moderate intellectual disability, females may have milder phenotypes. Additionally, visual and hearing impairment can make it difficult to assess cognitive ability. Because these conditions exist on a spectrum of severity, there may be significant overlap between phenotypes. There is some understanding of the mechanisms by which missense variants cause each disorder using structural analysis and crystal structures of the protein and its variants, but intrafamilial phenotypic variation makes it difficult to separate PRPS1 nonsyndromic and syndromic hearing loss. Loss of function variants have been found to cause nonsyndromic hearing loss, CMTX5 and Arts Syndrome, while PRPS1 superactivity disorders, which have been assessed separately, are caused by gain of function variants that destabilize allosteric sites (de Brouwer et al. 2010). In summary, PRPS1 is definitively associated with syndromic and nonsyndromic X-linked sensorineural hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was originally approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss gene curation expert panel (GCEP) on 7/9/2018. The ClinGen ID/Autism GCEP reviewed the curation on 12/11/2019 to include additional information about the incidence of intellectual disability in the disease spectrum.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9416f6e2-8de3-48b0-9a1c-9bd11a59315c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
