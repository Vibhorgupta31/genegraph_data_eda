For example, Trio, GEF-H1, and Tiam1 are a subset of GEFs that specifically activate Rac1 but not the closely related Cdc42. The Rac1 specificity of these GEFs appears to be governed by Rac1-GEF binding interaction. To understand the detailed mechanism underlying the GEF specificity issue, we have analyzed a panel of chimeras made between Rac1 and Cdc42 and examined a series of point mutants of Rac1 made at the switch I, switch II, and beta(2)/beta(3) regions for their ability to interact with and to be activated by the GEFs. The results reveal that Rac1 residues of both the switch I and switch II regions are involved in GEF docking and GEF-mediated nucleotide disruption, because mutation of Asp(38), Asn(39), Gln(61), Tyr(64), or Arg(66)/Leu(67) into Ala results in the loss of GEF binding, whereas mutation at Tyr(32), Asp(65), or Leu(70)/Ser(71) leads to the loss of GEF catalysis while retaining the binding capability. The region between amino acids 53-72 of Rac1 is required for specific recognition and activation by the GEFs, and Trp(56) in beta(3) appears to be the critical determinant. Introduction of Trp(56) to Cdc42 renders it fully responsive to the Rac-specific GEF in vitro and in cells. Further, a polypeptide derived from the beta(3) region of Rac1 including the Trp(56) residue serves as a specific inhibitor for Rac1 interaction with the GEFs. Taken together, these results indicate that Trp(56) is the necessary and sufficient determinant of Rac1 for discrimination by the subset of Rac1-specific GEFs and suggest that a compound mimicking Trp(56) action could be explored as an interfering reagent specifically targeting Rac1 activation.","dc:creator":"Gao Y","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Trp(56) of rac1 specifies interaction with a subset of guanine nucleotide exchange factors."},"rdfs:label":"Protein interaction with RAC1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"We are giving a total score 0.5 points for protein interaction with FLNA and RAC1."},{"id":"cggv:0f6ada00-5744-46c2-84ea-5ec05c44001e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:80ceeb0a-1d3a-43cb-a788-2e2e1ba1c4ab","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Review article: TRIO is involved in neurogenesis, migration and synapse formation, among other roles.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076143","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Small Rho-GTPases are enzymes that are bound to GDP or GTP, which determines their inactive or active state, respectively.

Variants in TRIO were first reported in relation to autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability (ID) in 2016 (Ba et al., PMID: 26721934). Numerous variants in TRIO, including nonsense, frameshift and missense variants, have been reported, with most variants occurring de novo. Pathogenic variants in TRIO are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ID and autism spectrum disorder. Other features include gastrointestinal problems, facial and skeletal dysmorphism. Missense variants cluster in two domains, the spectrin repeat and the RAC1-activating GEFD1. Individuals with variants in the spectrin domain have severe ID associated with macrocephaly and recognizable facial dysmorphism, whereas individuals with GEFD1 variants display milder ID and microcephaly (PMID: 32109419). Functional studies show that spectrin variants result in hyper-activation of RAC1, while GEFD1 variants cause hypo-activation of RAC1. RAC1 activation levels are correlated with the head size of affected individuals. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 25 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 26721934, 27418539, 32109419). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.  This gene-disease association is also supported by TRIOâ€™s role in neurogenesis, migration and synapse formation; protein interaction between TRIO and proteins involved in ID (RAC1, FLNA), functional alterations in non-patient cells, and mouse and xenopus models (4 points). In summary, TRIO is definitely associated with syndromic intellectual disability.
