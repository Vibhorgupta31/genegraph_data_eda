Deleterious variation within components of the transforming growth factor-β pathway, particularly the bone morphogenetic protein type 2 receptor (BMPR2), underlies most heritable forms of PAH. To identify the missing heritability we perform whole-genome sequencing in 1038 PAH index cases and 6385 PAH-negative control subjects. Case-control analyses reveal significant overrepresentation of rare variants in ATP13A3, AQP1 and SOX17, and provide independent validation of a critical role for GDF2 in PAH. We demonstrate familial segregation of mutations in SOX17 and AQP1 with PAH. Mutations in GDF2, encoding a BMPR2 ligand, lead to reduced secretion from transfected cells. In addition, we identify pathogenic mutations in the majority of previously reported PAH genes, and provide evidence for further putative genes. Taken together these findings contribute new insights into the molecular basis of PAH and indicate unexplored pathways for therapeutic intervention.","dc:creator":"Gräf S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Identification of rare sequence variation underlying heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29650961","rdfs:label":"SG-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Variant downgraded due to a lack of segregation data and no functional data."},{"id":"cggv:bf92ed2b-49c1-4179-8700-5e1fea223f59_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa20bd3c-3c56-45d5-8778-4a7c9f8f0fd7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"detectionMethod":"Variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing and validated by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:bf92ed2b-49c1-4179-8700-5e1fea223f59_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:56b0dd25-456b-446f-a4a5-f1af6e8bbb1f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002246.3(KCNK3):c.675C>A (p.Phe225Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA346262531"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29631995","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease characterized by pulmonary arteriole remodeling, elevated arterial pressure and resistance, and subsequent heart failure.

Current classification based on clinical features does not reflect the underlying molecular profiling of these groups. The advance in massive parallel sequencing in PAH has allowed for the describing of several new causative and susceptibility genes related to PAH, improving overall patient diagnosis. In order to address the molecular diagnosis of patients with PAH we designed, validated, and routinely applied a custom panel including 21 genes. Three hundred patients from the National Spanish PAH Registry (REHAP) were included in the analysis. A custom script was developed to annotate and filter the variants. Variant classification was performed according to the ACMG guidelines. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants have been found in 15% of the patients with 12% of variants of unknown significance (VUS). We have found variants in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) and congenital heart disease (CHD). In addition, in a small proportion of patients (1.75%), we observed a possible digenic mode of inheritance. These results stand out the importance of the genetic testing of patients with associated forms of PAH (i.e., CHD and CTD) additionally to the classical IPAH and HPAH forms. Molecular confirmation of the clinical presumptive diagnosis is required in cases with a high clinical overlapping to carry out proper management and follow up of the individuals with the disease.","dc:creator":"Castaño JAT","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Customized Massive Parallel Sequencing Panel for Diagnosis of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33007923","rdfs:label":"HTP248"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Variant reported as VUS based on ACMG guidelines.

Although studies suggest that background K+ currents carried by 2-pore domain K+ channels are important regulators of resting membrane potential in PASMC, their role in human PASMC is unknown. Our study tested the hypothesis that TASK-1 leak K+ channels contribute to the K+ current and resting membrane potential in human PASMC. We used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and TASK-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Noninactivating K+ current performed by TASK-1 K+ channels were identified by current characteristics and inhibition by anandamide and acidosis (pH 6.3), each resulting in significant membrane depolarization. Moreover, we showed that TASK-1 is blocked by moderate hypoxia and activated by treprostinil at clinically relevant concentrations. This is mediated via protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of TASK-1. To further confirm the role of TASK-1 channels in regulation of resting membrane potential, we knocked down TASK-1 expression using TASK-1 siRNA. The knockdown of TASK-1 was reflected by a significant depolarization of resting membrane potential. Treatment of human PASMC with TASK-1 siRNA resulted in loss of sensitivity to anandamide, acidosis, alkalosis, hypoxia, and treprostinil. These results suggest that (1) TASK-1 is expressed in human PASMC; (2) TASK-1 is hypoxia-sensitive and controls the resting membrane potential, thus implicating an important role for TASK-1 K+ channels in the regulation of pulmonary vascular tone; and (3) treprostinil activates TASK-1 at clinically relevant concentrations via PKA, which might represent an important mechanism underlying the vasorelaxing properties of prostanoids and their beneficial effect in vivo.","dc:creator":"Olschewski A","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Impact of TASK-1 in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells."},"rdfs:label":"Cell culture (WT)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a9093a6f-016f-4eaf-b39d-deb1be4a5263","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:012b9e06-f409-444e-9e22-85e2dc69dd57","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Western blot indicates quantifiable KCNK3 expression in the lungs from 4 control subjects.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26912814","rdfs:label":"Western blot (WT)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:e20d0ee0-4a14-4569-a451-729348ce8d23_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f0ccc07-d0b7-4556-bd47-eb5ee828bbed","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6c704b48-d0ee-495e-86f3-0d017d118d9c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Using patch-clamp technique, KCNK3 function was evaluated in cultured human PASMCs (n=10 control and n=7 IPAH subjects) plus the selective KCNK3 blocker A293 at 200 nmol/L.

Independent validation by sequence analysis detected additional missense variants in 2/92 familial and 3/230 sporadic cases. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of genetic evidence: 7 points. Variants in this gene have since been reported in at least 22 probands in 11 publications. All variants are rare, likely deleterious missense variants. Ma et al. and Cunningham et al.
