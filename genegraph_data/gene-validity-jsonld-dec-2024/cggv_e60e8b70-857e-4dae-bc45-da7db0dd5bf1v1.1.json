This is a Duchenne-like disease affecting both males and females first described in Tunisian families. Adhalin deficiency has been found in SCARMD patients from North Africa Europe, Brazil, Japan and North America (SLR & KPC, unpublished data). The disease was initially linked to an unidentified gene on chromosome 13 in families from North Africa, and to the adhalin gene itself on chromosome 17q in one French family in which missense mutations were identified. Thus there are two kinds of myopathies with adhalin deficiency: one with a primary defect of adhalin (primary adhalinopathies), and one in which absence of adhalin is secondary to a separate gene defect on chromosome 13. We have examined the importance of primary adhalinopathies among myopathies with adhalin deficiency, and describe several additional mutations (null and missense) in the adhalin gene in 10 new families from Europe and North Africa. Disease severity varies in age of onset and rate of progression, and patients with null mutations are the most severely affected.","dc:creator":"Piccolo F","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Primary adhalinopathy: a common cause of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy of variable severity."}},"rdfs:label":"Family 6-PE-1"},{"id":"cggv:cba19040-777f-4440-94b9-0983d89abd1a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cba19040-777f-4440-94b9-0983d89abd1a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cba19040-777f-4440-94b9-0983d89abd1a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Immunofluorescence of tissues samples showed reduced adhalin/ SGCA staining, indicating LOF (Table 1).

Mutations in any of the four genes encoding sarcoglycans cause a deficiency in all sarcoglycans in the sarcolemma and produce one of four types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. A fifth widely expressed sarcoglycan, epsilon-sarcoglycan, has been recently described. epsilon-Sarcoglycan is homologous to alpha-sarcoglycan, but whether it associates with the other sarcoglycans in muscle is not known. In this study, we use wild type and alpha-sarcoglycan-deficient mice to analyze the localization and association of sarcoglycans in skeletal muscle in vivo. The amounts of beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycans are reduced in alpha-sarcoglycan mutants, whereas the amount of epsilon-sarcoglycan is unchanged. We show here that epsilon-sarcoglycan is complexed with beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycans in both wild type and alpha-sarcoglycan mutant mice. We also use C2C12 myocytes to study the temporal expression and organization of sarcoglycan complexes during muscle cell differentiation in vitro. In C2C12 cells, alpha- and epsilon-sarcoglycans form separate complexes with beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycans. Both types of complexes are expressed at the cell surface and presumed to be functional. These results suggest that epsilon-sarcoglycan serves a function similar to that of alpha-sarcoglycan and that residual beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan seen in mutant mice and alpha-sarcoglycan-deficient patients is due to its association with epsilon-sarcoglycan.","dc:creator":"Liu LA","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Sarcoglycan isoforms in skeletal muscle."},"rdfs:label":"SGCA interacts with other sarcoglycans"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This evidence indicates that multiple sarcoglycans interact in a signaling complex with SGCA, including SGCB, SGCG, SGCD.

These four sarcoglycans form a subcomplex that is closely linked to the major dystrophin-associated protein complex, which is essential for membrane integrity during muscle contraction and provides a scaffold for important signalling molecules. Proper assembly, trafficking and targeting of the sarcoglycan complex is of vital importance, and mutations that severely perturb tetramer formation and localisation result in sarcoglycanopathy. Gene defects in one sarcoglycan cause the absence or reduced concentration of the other subunits. Most genetic defects generate mutated proteins that are degraded through the cell's quality control system; however, in many cases, conformational modifications do not affect the function of the protein, yet it is recognised as misfolded and prematurely degraded. Recent evidence shows that misfolded sarcoglycans could be rescued to the cell membrane by assisting their maturation along the ER secretory pathway. This review summarises the etiopathogenesis of sarcoglycanopathies and highlights the quality control machinery as a potential pharmacological target for therapy of these genetic disorders.","dc:creator":"Sandonà D","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Sarcoglycanopathies: molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic prospects."},"rdfs:label":"Sarcoglycans are associated with LGMD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:e60e8b70-857e-4dae-bc45-da7db0dd5bf1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:41b85a47-56f1-4141-9ce2-44dfb16670ce","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63078ea0-480e-4b69-90a1-2cd82c9ede1d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The Sgca homozygous null mice displayed characteristic muscle pathology observed in patients with muscular dystrophy, including scattered clusters of necrotic layers, increased size and number of necrotic clusters (Figure 2), increase in nonregenerating myocytes, and impaired sarcolemma integrity as tested by Evan blue dye membrane permeabilization assays (Figure 3).

To determine how alpha-sarcoglycan deficiency leads to muscle fiber degeneration, we generated and analyzed alpha-sarcoglycan- deficient mice. Sgca-null mice developed progressive muscular dystrophy and, in contrast to other animal models for muscular dystrophy, showed ongoing muscle necrosis with age, a hallmark of the human disease. Sgca-null mice also revealed loss of sarcolemmal integrity, elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes, increased muscle masses, and changes in the generation of absolute force. Molecular analysis of Sgca-null mice demonstrated that the absence of alpha-sarcoglycan resulted in the complete loss of the sarcoglycan complex, sarcospan, and a disruption of alpha-dystroglycan association with membranes. In contrast, no change in the expression of epsilon-sarcoglycan (alpha-sarcoglycan homologue) was observed. Recombinant alpha-sarcoglycan adenovirus injection into Sgca-deficient muscles restored the sarcoglycan complex and sarcospan to the membrane. We propose that the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex is requisite for stable association of alpha-dystroglycan with the sarcolemma.

Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness of proximal limb with age, which can lead to difficulty walking or complete loss of ambulation requiring wheel chair use. Other phenotypic features associated include scapular winging, calf pseudo hypertrophy, contractors, and in some cases cardiomyopathy (PMID: 22303798, 19781108 ). Numerous variants have been reported, in both ClinVar and in LOVD (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/SGCA). Further, the p.Arg77Cys variant is a known founder variant and has been estimated to account for ~30% of autosomal recessive LGMD associated with SGCA (PMID: 9192266, 15736300, 8528203). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, functional data, and model organisms. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for more than 20 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data is available, however the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) and experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. The mechanism for the gene-disease relationship is protein loss of function, as SGCA encodes alpha-sarcoglycan, an essential component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (PMID: 19781108) present in striated muscle costameres which function in muscle contraction. In summary, SGCA is definitively associated with autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (MONDO:0015152).
