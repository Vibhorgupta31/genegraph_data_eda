We report here analysis of Tbx20 expression during murine cardiac development and assessment of DNA-binding and transcriptional properties of Tbx20 isoforms. Tbx20 was expressed in myocardium and endocardium, including high levels in endocardial cushions. cDNAs generated by alternative splicing encode at least four Tbx20 isoforms, and Tbx20a uniquely carried strong transactivation and transrepression domains in its C terminus. Isoforms with an intact T-box bound specifically to DNA sites resembling the consensus brachyury half site, although with less avidity compared with the related factor, Tbx5. Tbx20 physically interacted with cardiac transcription factors Nkx2-5, GATA4, and GATA5, collaborating to synergistically activate cardiac gene expression. Among cardiac GATA factors, there was preferential synergy with GATA5, implicated in endocardial differentiation. In Xenopus embryos, enforced expression of Tbx20a, but not Tbx20b, led to induction of mesodermal and endodermal lineage markers as well as cell migration, indicating that the long Tbx20a isoform uniquely bears functional domains that can alter gene expression and developmental behaviour in an in vivo context.

Mutations in GATA4, the mammalian homolog of pnr, have also been implicated in causing human cardiac disease in a haploinsufficient manner. Mouse models of Gata4 loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies underscored the importance of Gata4 in regulating cardiac progenitor cells specification and differentiation. However, it is not known whether pnr/Gata4 is directly involved in establishing and maintaining adult heart physiology because of the lethality associated with defective heart function and redundancy among various GATA factors in vertebrates. Here, we took advantage of the Drosophila heart model to examine the function of pnr in adult heart physiology. We found that pnr heterozygous mutants result in defective cardiac performance in response to electrical pacing of the heart as well as in elevated arrhythmias. Adult-specific disruption of pnr function using a dominant-negative form pnrEnR revealed a cardiac autonomous requirement of pnr in regulating heart physiology. Moreover, we identified Tbx20/neuromancer (nmr) as a potential downstream mediator of pnr in regulating cardiac performance and rhythm regularity, based on the observation that overexpression of nmr genes, but not of tinman, partially rescues the adult defects in pnr mutants. We conclude that pnr is not only essential for early cardiac progenitor formation, along with tinman and T-box factors, but also plays an important role in establishing and/or maintaining proper heart function, which is partially through another key regulator Tbx20/nmr.","dc:creator":"Qian L","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Partial loss of GATA factor Pannier impairs adult heart function in Drosophila."},"rdfs:label":"Partial loss of GATA factor Pannier impairs adult heart "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded due to not directly showing CHD relation"},{"id":"cggv:8ca2c039-156b-4ee6-bd5a-be212debc06f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:082f763e-d6c6-4544-8ab1-39a61d2ae2ac","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Conditional ablation of Tbx20 in adult mouse cardiomyocytes results in functional abnormalities within 5 days and rapid progression to heart failure within 15 days.

We recently demonstrated that TBX20, a transcriptional regulator required for cardiac development, has key roles in the maintenance of functional and structural phenotypes in adult mouse heart. Conditional ablation of Tbx20 in adult cardiomyocytes leads to a rapid onset and progression of heart failure, with prominent conduction and contractility phenotypes that lead to death. Here we describe a more comprehensive molecular characterization of the functions of TBX20 in adult mouse heart. Coupling genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptome analyses (RNA-Seq), we identified a subset of genes that change expression in Tbx20 adult cardiomyocyte-specific knockout hearts which are direct downstream targets of TBX20. This analysis revealed a dual role for TBX20 as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor, and that each of these functions regulates genes with very specialized and distinct molecular roles. We also show how TBX20 binds to its targets genome-wide in a context-dependent manner, using various cohorts of co-factors to either promote or repress distinct genetic programs within adult heart. Our integrative approach has uncovered several novel aspects of TBX20 and T-box protein function within adult heart.

We now show by gene targeting that murine T-box transcription factor Tbx20 plays a central role in these pathways, and has important activities in both cardiac development and adult function. Loss of Tbx20 results in death of embryos at mid-gestation with grossly abnormal heart morphogenesis. Underlying these disturbances was a severely compromised cardiac transcriptional program, defects in the molecular pre-pattern, reduced expansion of cardiac progenitors and a block to chamber differentiation. Notably, Tbx20-null embryos showed ectopic activation of Tbx2 across the whole heart myogenic field. Tbx2 encodes a transcriptional repressor normally expressed in non-chamber myocardium, and in the atrioventricular canal it has been proposed to inhibit chamber-specific gene expression through competition with positive factor Tbx5. Our data demonstrate a repressive activity for Tbx20 and place it upstream of Tbx2 in the cardiac genetic program. Thus, hierarchical, repressive interactions between Tbx20 and other T-box genes and factors underlie the primary lineage split into chamber and non-chamber myocardium in the forming heart, an early event upon which all subsequent morphogenesis depends. Additional roles for Tbx20 in adult heart integrity and contractile function were revealed by in-vivo cardiac functional analysis of Tbx20 heterozygous mutant mice.
