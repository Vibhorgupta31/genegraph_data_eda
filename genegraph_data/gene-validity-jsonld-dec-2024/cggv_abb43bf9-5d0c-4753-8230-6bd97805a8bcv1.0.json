CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH.

Four unrelated CS-A patients (CS2OS, CS2AW, Nps2 and CS2SE) had a deletion including exon 4, suggesting that there is a founder effect on the CSA mutation in Japanese CS-A patients. Patient CS2SE was a compound heterozygote for this deletion and an amino acid substitution at the 106th glutamine to proline (Q106P) in the WD-40 repeat motif of the CSA protein, which resulted in a defective nucleotide excision repair. Patient Mps1 had a large deletion in the upstream region including exon 1 of the CSA gene. Our results indicate that a rapid and reliable diagnosis of CSA mutations could be achieved in CS-A patients by PCR or PCR-RFLP and that the Q106P mutation could alter the propeller structure of the CSA protein which is important for the formation of the CSA protein complex.","dc:creator":"Ren Y","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Three novel mutations responsible for Cockayne syndrome group A."},"rdfs:label":"UV-light death in ERCC8 deficient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:148c56c6-4d6d-43f5-93b7-685d8837ee35","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d52bc06e-b632-4102-bdb9-ffce90548729","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Following exposure to UV irradiation, irradiated WT cells recovered to 74% DNA synthesis relative to a non-irradiated WT control, whereas the CSA10NO patient cells and the Cockayne syndrome control cells (Erasmus MC) retained only 12 and 11% DNA synthesis, respectively, compared to non-irradiated control cells.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17084038","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is mainly caused by mutations in the Cockayne syndrome group A or B (CSA or CSB) genes which are required for a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair entitled transcription coupled repair.

Up to now, nine different CSA mutations have been identified. We examined two Somali siblings 9 and 12 years old with clinical features typical of CS including skin photosensitivity, progressive ataxia, spasticity, hearing loss, central and peripheral demyelination and intracranial calcifications. Molecular analysis showed a novel splice acceptor site mutation, a G to A transition in the -1 position of intervening sequence 6 (g.IVS6-1G>A), in the CSA (excision repair cross-complementing 8 (ERCC8)) gene. IVS6-1G>A results in a new 28 amino acid C-terminus and premature termination of the CSA protein (G184DFs28X).

TCR requires RNA polymerase II (Pol II), but the mechanism by which repair enzymes preferentially recognize and repair DNA lesions on Pol II-transcribed genes is incompletely understood. Herein we demonstrate that a fraction of the large subunit of Pol II (Pol II LS) is ubiquitinated after exposing cells to UV-radiation or cisplatin but not several other DNA damaging agents. This novel covalent modification of Pol II LS occurs within 15 min of exposing cells to UV-radiation and persists for about 8-12 hr. Ubiquitinated Pol II LS is also phosphorylated on the C-terminal domain. UV-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS is deficient in fibroblasts from individuals with two forms of Cockayne syndrome (CS-A and CS-B), a rare disorder in which TCR is disrupted. UV-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS can be restored by introducing cDNA constructs encoding the CSA or CSB genes, respectively, into CS-A or CS-B fibroblasts. These results suggest that ubiquitination of Pol II LS plays a role in the recognition and/or repair of damage to actively transcribed genes. Alternatively, these findings may reflect a role played by the CSA and CSB gene products in transcription.","dc:creator":"Bregman DB","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"UV-induced ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II: a novel modification deficient in Cockayne syndrome cells."},"rdfs:label":"Restoration of Pol II LS Ubiquitination"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5903,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:1d5b54f6-6405-46e2-be65-4e63a4669eb1","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019569","gene":"hgnc:3439","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The ERCC8 gene is located on chromosome 5 at 5q12.1 and encodes the Excision Repair 8, CSA Ubiquitin Ligase Complex Subunit protein, a DNA-binding protein that is important in transcription-coupled excision repair. ERCC8 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Cockayne syndrome type 1/A in 1995 (Henning et al., PMID:7664335). Cockayne syndrome type 1 is characterized by normal prenatal growth with the onset of growth and developmental abnormalities in the first two years. By the time the disease has fully manifested itself, height, weight, and head circumference are far below the fifth percentile. Progressive impairment of vision, hearing, and central and peripheral nervous system function leads to severe disability, with death typically occurring in the first or second decade. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability and severity. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, Cockayne syndrome type 1 (OMIM: 216400) and UV-sensitive syndrome 2 (OMIM: 614621). 10 variants (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site, and missense) that have been reported in 5 probands in 2 publications (Cao et al., 2004, PMID:14661080; Calmels et al., 2018, PMID:29572252) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (biochemical function and rescue) (Bregman et al., 1996, PMID:8876179; Houser et al., 1996, PMID:12509261; Ren et al., 2003, PMID:12655141). One mouse model demonstrated that homozygous LOF in ERCC8 results in defective transcription coupled-nucleotide excision repair in response to UV-light damage, a biochemical function and functional alteration also seen in ERCC6. In immortalized Cockayne syndrome type 1 cells with variants in ERCC8 knock-in of the wild-type protein restored the cells’ response to UV-light damange. Patient and cultured cells alike, similarly are less able to survive and/or synthesize DNA following UV irradiation in comparison to WT controls. In summary, ERCC8 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Cockayne syndrome type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date July 15, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:abb43bf9-5d0c-4753-8230-6bd97805a8bc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
