The phenotypic consequence of germline TRAF7 variants remains unclear. Here we report missense variants in TRAF7 in seven unrelated individuals referred for clinical exome sequencing. The seven individuals share substantial phenotypic overlap, with developmental delay, congenital heart defects, limb and digital anomalies, and dysmorphic features emerging as key unifying features. The identified variants are de novo in six individuals and comprise four distinct missense changes, including a c.1964G>A (p.Arg655Gln) variant that is recurrent in four individuals. These variants affect evolutionarily conserved amino acids and are located in key functional domains.

This is a multisystemic developmental disorder with developmental delay/intellectual disability, variable cardiac and digital anomalies, and recognizable facial features. Some patients may have autism spectrum disorder, seizures, hearing loss or ocular abnormalities. Thirteen *de novo* missense variants that have been reported in 16 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 29961569, 32376980) are included in this curation. More genetic evidence is available in the literature (PMIDs: 34513876, 37067385, 38569228, 38612512) but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Several variants are recurrent (including p.Arg655Gln and p.Phe617Leu), and most cluster within the WD40 repeats of the TRAF7 protein, suggesting dominant-negative and/or gain-of-function effects. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by zebrafish and xenopus *traf7* model systems (PMID: 37043537), and functional studies demonstrating transcriptional changes and altered ERK signaling in the presence of pathogenic *TRAF7* variants (PMID: 29961569, 32376980). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *TRAF7* and autosomal dominant syndromic complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panels on the meeting date September 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c6291da3-f236-4abe-ba39-ed00366e894a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
