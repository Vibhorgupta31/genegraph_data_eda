Here, we demonstrate that SDHAF1 contributes to iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster incorporation into the Fe-S subunit of CII, SDHB. SDHAF1 transiently binds to aromatic peptides of SDHB through an arginine-rich region in its C terminus and specifically engages a Fe-S donor complex, consisting of the scaffold, holo-ISCU, and the co-chaperone-chaperone pair, HSC20-HSPA9, through an LYR motif near its N-terminal domain. Pathogenic mutations of SDHAF1 abrogate binding to SDHB, which impairs biogenesis of holo-SDHB and results in LONP1-mediated degradation of SDHB. Riboflavin treatment was found to ameliorate the neurologic condition of patients. We demonstrate that riboflavin enhances flavinylation of SDHA and reduces levels of succinate and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1α and -2α, explaining the favorable response of patients to riboflavin.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 19465911). Segregation data includes 4 affected individuals and 12 unaffected individuals in one kindred (PMID: 19465911). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 19465911, 22995659).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
