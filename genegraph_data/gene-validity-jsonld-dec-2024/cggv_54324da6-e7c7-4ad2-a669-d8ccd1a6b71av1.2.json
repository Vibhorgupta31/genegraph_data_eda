The mechanism of disease is heterozygous missense variants with a gain-of-function effect on sodium channel activity (PMID: 27164707, 36029553). The clinical presentation typically includes infantile-onset generalized and/or focal seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and cerebellar or cerebral atrophy. Autism spectrum disorder has been reported in several cases.\nThree missense variants in this gene have been reported in at least 21 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 27164707, 27830185, 27872899, 28506426, 29699863, 30951195, 31292943, 32645220, 33287870, 36029553), including a recurrent variant, p.Arg52His,  observed in 14 unrelated individuals. Variants usually occur *de novo* or are inherited from parents with germline or somatic mosaicism. In addition, two studies reported three probands with overlapping phenotypes carrying gene duplications resulting in loss of function (PMIDs: 28144627, 32524056, 36029553); these variants were not scored in this curation due to their different molecular mechanism.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including biochemical function (PMID: 33245860), functional alteration in cultured cells (PMIDs: 27164707, 36029553) and animal models in zebrafish (PMID: 27164707) and mice (PMID: 33982289).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *FGF12* and autosomal dominant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 1, 2023 (SOP version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:54324da6-e7c7-4ad2-a669-d8ccd1a6b71a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
