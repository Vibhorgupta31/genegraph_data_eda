CaM inhibits the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and cardiac muscle receptor (RyR2) at >1 microm Ca2+ but activates RyR1 and inhibits RyR2 at <1 microm Ca2+. Here we tested whether CaM regulates RyR2 by binding to a highly conserved site identified previously in RyR1. Deletion of RyR2 amino acid residues 3583-3603 resulted in background [35S]CaM binding levels. In single channel measurements, deletion of the putative CaM binding site eliminated CaM inhibition of RyR2 at Ca2+ concentrations below and above 1 microm. Five RyR2 single or double mutants in the CaM binding region (W3587A, L3591D, F3603A, W3587A/L3591D, L3591D/F3603A) eliminated or greatly reduced [35S]CaM binding and inhibition of single channel activities by CaM depending on the Ca2+ concentration. An RyR2 mutant, which assessed the effects of 4 amino acid residues that differ between RyR1 and RyR2 in or flanking the CaM binding domain, bound [35S]CaM and was inhibited by CaM, essentially identical to wild type (WT)-RyR2. Three RyR1 mutants (W3620A, L3624D, F3636A) showed responses to CaM that differed from corresponding mutations in RyR2.

Ca2+ binding to the main alpha1c channel subunit has been widely proposed to initiate such Ca2+ -dependent inactivation. Here, we find that overexpression of mutant, Ca2+ -insensitive calmodulin (CaM) ablates Ca2+ -dependent inactivation in a \"dominant-negative\" manner. This result demonstrates that CaM is the actual Ca2+ sensor for inactivation and suggests that CaM is constitutively tethered to the channel complex. Inactivation is likely to occur via Ca2+ -dependent interaction of tethered CaM with an IQ-like motif on the carboxyl tail of alpha1c. CaM also binds to analogous IQ regions of N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels, suggesting that CaM-mediated effects may be widespread in the calcium channel family.","dc:creator":"Peterson BZ","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Calmodulin is the Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+ -dependent inactivation of L-type calcium channels."},"rdfs:label":"CALM3 function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:1b7fc965-a109-4448-94a0-00a9b078b484_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1de1e8b2-81ec-496f-9b1d-af27bcb7199c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46641db2-33b5-4afb-9a33-4b2ea8dd5a76","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In permeabilized cardiomyocytes, A103V-CaM (100 nmol/L) promoted spontaneous Ca wave and spark activity, a cellular phenotype of ryanodine receptor 2 activation.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27516456","rdfs:label":"A103V in cardiomyocytes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":3071,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":3.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ef43eb47-be10-4b0b-94ed-46158c05d689","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0017990","gene":"hgnc:1449","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.4","dc:description":"CALM3 was evaluated for autosomal dominant catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The CALM3 gene is located on chromosome 19 and encodes for calmodulin 3, a 149 amino acid protein that is identical in sequence to two other calmodulin genes (CALM1 on chromosome 14 and CALM2 on chromosome 2). All three CALM genes have been classified as Definitive for Long QT syndrome by the LQTS Gene Curation Expert Panel, noting that these genes tend to be associated with atypical features of LQTS (presentation in infancy or early childhood and with heart block and severe QT prolongation). The CALM genes have also been associated with CPVT phenotypes although less evidence has thus far been published for CPVT compared to LQTS. Evidence for the association of CALM genes to CPVT comes from the International Calmodulin Registry study (Crotti et al, 2019, PMID:31170290) and other genetic and experimental studies. Genetic evidence for the association of CALM3 with CPVT comes from an apparently de novo case in the Registry with the p.Asp132Glu variant - the same variant in the CALM2 gene was also detected de novo in a patient with mixed features of CPVT and LQTS (Crotti et al, 2019, PMID:31170290). The p.Ala103Val variant was detected in a CPVT patient with its pathogenicity supported by functional evidence (Gomez-Hurtado et al, 2016, PMID:27516456). Based on this genetic and experimental evidence, CALM3 scored with limited evidence of association with CPVT but was upgraded to a Moderate classification by the expert panel. However, the expert panel unanimously agreed that, the despite this classification and the modest amount of published evidence linking CALM3 variants with a CPVT phenotype, all three CALM genes have unequivocal evidence for causation of isolated CPVT, in addition to LQTS and hybrid phenotypes. The three CALM genes encode for identical proteins which are all expressed in heart tissue, and multiple identical variants in two or more of the CALM genes have been shown to cause the same phenotypes, e.g. the de novo variant p.Asp130Gly has been shown in all 3 CALM genes to provoke LQTS in children, which demonstrates the functional similarity of these genes/proteins. Collectively, the three CALM genes would have strong/definitive evidence for association with CPVT. CALM3 has previously been classified as a definitive gene for atypical LQTS, unambiguously demonstrating the pathogenicity of this gene for inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Finally, as described above, multiple patients with CALM3 variants have been shown to present with a classical CPVT phenotype. Therefore this gene should be included in CPVT genetic testing panels. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).\nThe expert panel unanimously agreed that CALM3 should be upgraded to Moderate (the reasons are outlined in the evidence summary).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1b7fc965-a109-4448-94a0-00a9b078b484"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
