One thousand four hundred twenty-five unrelated PD patients from movement disorder clinics in Oregon, Washington, and New York and 1,647 unrelated controls were studied. The G2019S mutation was detected using a TaqMan assay and verified by sequencing. Eighteen of 1,425 patients and one of 1,647 controls had the mutation.

We found that the most common LRRK2 mutation, LRRK2-G2019S, dramatically reduces the processivity of autophagosome transport in neurons in a kinase-dependent manner. This effect was consistent across an overexpression model, neurons from a G2019S knockin mouse, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons gene edited to express the G2019S mutation, and the effect was reversed by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2. Furthermore, LRRK2 hyperactivation induced by overexpression of Rab29, a known activator of LRRK2 kinase, disrupted autophagosome transport to a similar extent. Mechanistically, we found that hyperactive LRRK2 recruits the motor adaptor JNK-interacting protein 4 (JIP4) to the autophagosomal membrane, inducing abnormal activation of kinesin that we propose leads to an unproductive tug of war between anterograde and retrograde motors. Disruption of autophagosome transport correlated with a significant defect in autophagosome acidification, suggesting that the observed transport deficit impairs effective degradation of autophagosomal cargo in neurons.

Orally bioavailable, brain penetrant and potent LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are in the later stages of clinical development. Here, we describe a facile and robust assay to quantify LRRK2 kinase pathway activity by measuring LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 in human peripheral blood neutrophils. We use the selective MJFF-pRab10 monoclonal antibody recognising the Rab10 Thr73 phospho-epitope that is phosphorylated by LRRK2. We highlight the feasibility and practicability of using our assay in the clinical setting by studying a few patients with G2019S LRRK2 associated and sporadic Parkinson's as well as healthy controls. We suggest that peripheral blood neutrophils are a valuable resource for LRRK2 research and should be considered for inclusion in Parkinson's bio-repository collections as they are abundant, homogenous and express relatively high levels of LRRK2 as well as Rab10. In contrast, the widely used peripheral blood mononuclear cells are heterogeneous and only a minority of cells (monocytes and contaminating neutrophils) express LRRK2. While our LRRK2 kinase pathway assay could assist in patient stratification based on LRRK2 kinase activity, we envision that it may find greater utility in pharmacodynamic and target engagement studies in future LRRK2 inhibitor trials.","dc:creator":"Fan Y","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Interrogating Parkinson's disease LRRK2 kinase pathway activity by assessing Rab10 phosphorylation in human neutrophils."},"rdfs:label":"quantify LRRK2 kinase pathway activity by measuring LRRK2-me"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Results could not be confirmed by the authors for this variant in a follow-up study (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.21249614v1)"},{"id":"cggv:0db2cb7f-6026-4458-b392-e7dc39e6733d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:557db4f5-8b19-428a-ba18-41ffb332912a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"High (AUC=1 for LRRK2 mutations carriers vs. non-carriers)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26865512","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To test whether phosphorylated Ser-1292 LRRK2 levels in urine exosomes predicts LRRK2 mutation carriers (LRRK2+) and noncarriers (LRRK2-) with Parkinson disease (PD+) and without Parkinson disease (PD-).","dc:creator":"Fraser KB","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Urinary LRRK2 phosphorylation predicts parkinsonian phenotypes in G2019S LRRK2 carriers."},"rdfs:label":"LRRK2 autophosphorylation in urine exosomes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:2728e13a-b95a-4c55-8cba-082260094ecd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87fe4d0e-7e7d-42aa-8244-c7ac96c07e00","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cda5f1e2-daa2-4f2b-87d3-5c86e94101e8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The fly model recapitulates the findings in humans in terms of clinical phenotype, selective cell loss, and response to treatment with L-Dopa.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18258746","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) gene cause late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) with pleiomorphic pathology. Previously, we and others found that expression of mutant LRRK2 causes neuronal degeneration in cell culture. Here we used the GAL4/UAS system to generate transgenic Drosophila expressing either wild-type human LRRK2 or LRRK2-G2019S, the most common mutation associated with PD. Expression of either wild-type human LRRK2 or LRRK2-G2019S in the photoreceptor cells caused retinal degeneration. Expression of LRRK2 or LRRK2-G2019S in neurons produced adult-onset selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, locomotor dysfunction, and early mortality. Expression of mutant G2019S-LRRK2 caused a more severe parkinsonism-like phenotype than expression of equivalent levels of wild-type LRRK2. Treatment with l-DOPA improved mutant LRRK2-induced locomotor impairment but did not prevent the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo\"gain-of-function\" model which recapitulates several key features of LRRK2-linked human parkinsonism. These flies may provide a useful model for studying LRRK2-linked pathogenesis and for future therapeutic screens for PD intervention.","dc:creator":"Liu Z","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"A Drosophila model for LRRK2-linked parkinsonism."},"rdfs:label":"Expression of LRRK2-G2019S in neurons of Drosophila"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Highly convincing model with evidence on different levels (clinical phenotype, pathological phenotype, treatment response)"},{"id":"cggv:e6731a20-396e-4e4c-83d4-4c6f4a235af1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a0045337-19a2-4b64-9ba6-eabb6bb09b6e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In this paper, the authors show the same functional alterations in human IPSC-derived neurons and neurons from the knockin mouse model","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33765413","rdfs:label":"autophagic vesicle transport (G2019S knockin mouse neurons)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2933,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:398137a7-aa49-40aa-b995-9feb0b22c1dd","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005180","gene":"hgnc:18618","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"LRRK2 was first reported in relation to autosomal-dominant Parkinson´s disease in 2004 (Paisan-Ruiz et al., PMID: 15541308; Zimprich et al., PMID: 15541309). Parkinson´s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra, and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus are found in most cases. In patients with pathogenic LRRK2 variants, the typical Parkinson´s disease pathology with Lewy bodies can often been found (Ross et al. 2006, PMID: 16437559; Kalia et al. 2015, PMID: 25401511) but tau-immunopositive neurofibrillary tangles have also been reported (Rajput et al. 2006, PMID: 17060589). Signs and symptoms of Parkinson´s disease include tremor which is most pronounced during rest, muscle rigidity, slowing of the voluntary movements (bradykinesia), a tendency to fall back (postural instability). Several clearly pathogenic, missense variants have been reported in >1000 probands in >100 publications (for review see Trinh et al. 2018, PMID: 30357936, www.mdsgene.org) of which five publications are included in this curation. The most frequently found mutation is c.6055G>A/p.G2019S (NM_198578, ClinVar ID: 1940). The additional evidence from the literature was not included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Although the disease follows a clearly dominant mode of inheritance with age-dependent reduced penetrance, homozygous carriers of pathogenic variants have been reported with comparable phenotype to heterozygous carriers (Ishihara et al. 2006, PMID: 16966502). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be gain-of-function (GOF) with augmented kinase activity (West et al. 2005, PMID: 16269541). The gain-of-function mechanism is also underlined by the lack of Parkinson´s disease in carriers of truncating variants (Blauwendraat et al. 2018, PMID: 30039155). This gene-disease association is further supported by recurrent experimental evidence including animal models, in-vitro functional assays, and patient-derived cells (Giasson et al. 2006, PMID: 16437584; Jaleel et al. 2007, PMID: 17447891; Luzón-Toro et al. 2007, PMID: 17584768; Liu et al. 2008, PMID: 18258746; Fraser et al. 2016, PMID: 26865512; Boecker et al. 2021, PMID: 33765413). In summary, pathogenic variants in LRRK2 are definitively causing autosomal-dominant Parkinson´s disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Parkinson’s Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 3, 2021.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2728e13a-b95a-4c55-8cba-082260094ecd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
