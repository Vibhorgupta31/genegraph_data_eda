A recessive mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin has been shown to cause Naxos disease, a cardiocutaneous syndrome characterized by ARVC and abnormalities of hair and skin. Here, we report, for the first time, a dominant mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin in a German family with ARVC but no cutaneous abnormalities. The mutation (S39_K40insS) is predicted to insert an extra serine residue at position 39 in the N-terminus of plakoglobin. Analysis of a biopsy sample of the right ventricle from the proband showed markedly decreased localization of plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and connexin43 at intercalated discs in cardiac myocytes. A yeast-two-hybrid screen revealed that the mutant protein established novel interactions with histidine-rich calcium-binding protein and TGF beta induced apoptosis protein 2. Immunoblotting and confocal microscopy in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines transfected to stably express either wild-type or mutant plakoglobin protein showed that the mutant protein was apparently ubiquitylated and was preferentially located in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the S39_K40insS mutation may increase plakoglobin turnover via proteasomal degradation. HEK293 cells expressing mutant plakoglobin also showed higher rates of proliferation and lower rates of apoptosis than did cells expressing the wild-type protein. Electron microscopy showed smaller and fewer desmosomes in cells expressing mutant plakoglobin. Taken together, these observations suggest that the S39_K40insS mutation affects the structure and distribution of mechanical and electrical cell junctions and could interfere with regulatory mechanisms mediated by Wnt-signaling pathways. These results implicate novel molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ARVC.","dc:creator":"Asimaki A","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"A novel dominant mutation in plakoglobin causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17924338","rdfs:label":"A1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:691f4a61-de71-48e7-8f01-559c71ee089a_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:190c72f4-0cc6-4ef5-a189-2532ec757607_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:267df3af-1675-45ff-892f-aaca5ee82540","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Naxos","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:190c72f4-0cc6-4ef5-a189-2532ec757607_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:fd47330a-05c1-4e73-972e-efcdf98d26f3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002230.2(JUP):c.2038_2039delTG (p.Trp680Glyfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/13599"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10902626","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an autosomal dominant heart muscle disorder that causes arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death.

A subset of patients with AC have the autosomal recessive cardiocutaneous disorder Naxos disease, which is caused by a 2-base pair deletion in the plakoglobin-encoding gene JUP that results in a truncated protein with reduced expression. In mice, cardiomyocyte-specific plakoglobin deficiency recapitulates many aspects of human AC, and overexpression of the truncated Naxos-associated plakoglobin also results in an AC-like phenotype; therefore, it is unclear whether Naxos disease results from loss or gain of function consequent to the plakoglobin mutation. Here, we generated 2 knockin mouse models in which endogenous Jup was engineered to express the Naxos-associated form of plakoglobin. In one model, Naxos plakoglobin bypassed the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, resulting in normal levels of the truncated plakoglobin. Moreover, restoration of Naxos plakoglobin to WT levels resulted in normal heart function. Together, these data indicate that a gain of function in the truncated form of the protein does not underlie the clinical phenotype of patients with Naxos disease and instead suggest that insufficiency of the truncated Naxos plakoglobin accounts for disease manifestation. Moreover, these results suggest that increasing levels of truncated or WT plakoglobin has potential as a therapeutic approach to Naxos disease.","dc:creator":"Zhang Z","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Normalization of Naxos plakoglobin levels restores cardiac function in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Normalization of JUP levels"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:157bd383-b555-4a88-8958-8f29cede46e8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ff683cc-dbe1-4dbf-820e-b84e93956e5a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"As in Naxos disease, frameshift mutation in JUP which results in abnormal intercalated disc function.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25705887","rdfs:label":"JUP Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a9660a1e-57ae-4e1f-8767-7ae86e192b84","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d5de77a-0071-40ee-b186-20b891b9d4a1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mice displayed focal areas of inflammation and increased apoptotic cardiomyocytes compared with WT controls \nImmunoreactive signal for plakoglobin was absent at intercalated discs (IDs), and signal for Cx43 and synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) was substantially depressed\nDied at 1 year of age","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25705887","rdfs:label":"JUP Mouse model2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5943,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:16f3f94b-1646-43b5-8d43-89b4c1dbc9b2","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016587","gene":"hgnc:6207","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"Twenty-one papers were reviewed related to JUP and ARVC (2945574, 21668431, 2945574, 9610536, 18937352, 10902626, 15851108, 27170944, 11691526, 16893920, 29802319, 31275992, 25820315, 25820315, 25765472, 25705887, 25087486, 21668431, 20130592, 17924338, 20031617). The initial discovery of a homozygous two-nucleotide deletion (c.2038_2039delTG; p.Trp680Gly_fs) in JUP underlying Naxos disease, which includes ARVC with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, led to further focus on this and other desmosome genes in non-syndromic ARVC (McCoy et al, PMID 10902626).  Murine models support the functional, arrhythmic, and histopathologic cardiac effects from loss-of-function variants in Jup (PMID 27170944; 25705887). Heterozygous pathogenic variants in JUP account for a low percentage of non-syndromic ARVC (0.5%; PMID 25820315). Despite the relatively low percentage, null and missense variants have evidence of impact in multiple families with ARVC. This leads to strong genetic evidence for the role of pathogenic variants in JUP for dominant, non-syndromic ARVC (score 10.5).
