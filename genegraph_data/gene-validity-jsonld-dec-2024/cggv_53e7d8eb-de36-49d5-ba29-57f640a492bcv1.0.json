We investigated mutations in the GNPTA (MGC4170) gene, which codes for the alpha/beta subunits of phosphotransferase, and in the GNPTAG gene, which codes for its gamma subunits in five Korean patients with mucolipidosis type II or IIIA. We identified seven mutations in the GNPTA gene, but none in GNPTAG. The mutations in type II patients included p.Q104X (c.310C>T), p.R1189X (c.3565C>T), p.S1058X (c.3173C>G), p.W894X (c.2681G>A), and p.H1158fsX15 (c.3474_3475delTA), all of which are nonsense or frameshift mutations. However, a splicing site mutation, IVS13+1G>A (c.2715+1G>A) was detected along with a nonsense or a frameshift mutation (p.R1189X or p.E858fsX3 (c.2574_2575delGA)) in two mucolipidosis type IIIA patients.

Mutations in the phosphotransferase gamma subunit gene (GNPTAG) have been reported to be responsible for ML III. Here we report on a 14-year-old adolescent with a mild clinical phenotype of ML III. He presented with progressive joint stiffness and swelling. Urinary oligosaccharide and mucopolysaccharide excretion was normal. Lysosomal enzyme activities were significantly elevated in the serum and decreased in cultured fibroblasts. Impaired trafficking of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (CtsD) was confirmed by metabolic labeling of the patient's fibroblasts. Neither mutations in the GNPTAG gene nor alterations in the GNPTAG mRNA level were detected whereas the steady state concentration of the 97 kDa GNPTAG dimer was reduced. Most importantly, the patient is homozygous for a pathogenic nucleotide substitution and a polymorphism in the phosphotransferase alpha/beta subunit gene (GNPTA). The data indicate that defects in genes other than GNPTAG can be linked to ML III contributing to the variability of the phenotype.","dc:creator":"Tiede S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Missense mutations in N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase alpha/beta subunit gene in a patient with mucolipidosis III and a mild clinical phenotype."},{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16200072","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mucolipidosis II (ML II) is a fatal lysosomal storage disorder resulting from defects in the multimeric GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase responsible for the initial step in the generation of the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker. M6P residues on oligosaccharides of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are essential for efficient receptor-mediated transport to lysosomes. We used the recombinant GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase gamma subunit as an affinity matrix to purify an unknown protein identified as the product of GNPTA (encoding GNPTA, previously known as MGC4170). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,256 amino acids with two putative transmembrane domains and a complex preserved modular structure comprising at least six domains. The N-terminal domain of GNPTA, interrupted by a long insertion, shows similarities to bacterial capsule biosynthesis proteins. We identified seven mutations in GNPTA that lead to premature translational termination in six individuals with ML II. Retroviral transduction of fibroblasts from an individual with ML II resulted in the expression and localization of GNPTA in the Golgi apparatus, accompanied by the correction of hypersecretion of lysosomal enzymes. Our results provide evidence that GNPTA encodes a subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase defective in individuals with ML II.","dc:creator":"Tiede S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Mucolipidosis II is caused by mutations in GNPTA encoding the alpha/beta GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase."}],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:53e7d8eb-de36-49d5-ba29-57f640a492bc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1400ea6b-161c-4b9a-ac56-2958b13e5dd3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1400ea6b-161c-4b9a-ac56-2958b13e5dd3","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:0ed881c7-10e2-43a6-a789-6309b627aa22","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024312.5(GNPTAB):c.2808A>G (p.Arg936=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA481576789"}},{"id":"cggv:9207e582-1dbf-4fe0-af67-974ebe5e4b93","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024312.5(GNPTAB):c.3503_3504del (p.Leu1168GlnfsTer5)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA223755"}}],"detectionMethod":"Sequence analysis of the 21 exons of the GNPTAB gene, as well as the intron-exon\nboundaries and part of the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Clinical phenotype consistent with mucolipidosis II.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0004322","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"\"Biochemical diagnosis\" of mucolipisosis II or mucolipisosis III.\nIn plasma, elevated activity of β-glucuronidase (900; normal range 30-300 nmol/h/ml), total β– hexosaminidases activity (22155; 1000-13490 nmol/h/ml), iduronate-sulfatase (3038; 122-463 nmol/h/ml).\narylsulfatase A present in plasma (reference, absent).\nDermatan sulfate on TLC of urine GAGs.\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:8ddd7505-9b2e-46dc-a468-9f1af72b0b36_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0ed881c7-10e2-43a6-a789-6309b627aa22"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23566849","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mucolipidosis II and III (MLII and MLIII) alpha/beta are rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variations in the GNPTAB gene.

This disease is usually found to occur in individuals aged between 6 and 12 months, with a clinical phenotype resembling that of Hurler syndrome and radiological findings resembling those of dysostosis multiplex. However, we encountered a rare case of an infant with ML II who presented with prenatal skeletal dysplasia and typical clinical features of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism at birth. A female infant was born at 37(+1) weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 1,690 g (<3rd percentile). Prenatal ultrasonographic findings revealed intrauterine growth retardation and skeletal dysplasia. At birth, the patient had characteristic features of ML II, and skeletal radiographs revealed dysostosis multiplex, similar to rickets. In addition, the patient had high levels of alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone, consistent with severe secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism. The activities of β-D-hexosaminidase and α-N-acetylglucosaminidase were moderately decreased in the leukocytes but were 5- to 10-fold higher in the plasma. Examination of a placental biopsy specimen showed foamy vacuolar changes in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. The diagnosis of ML II was confirmed via GNPTAB genetic testing, which revealed compound heterozygosity of c.3091C>T (p.Arg1031X) and c.3456_3459dupCAAC (p.Ile1154GlnfsX3), the latter being a novel mutation.

This enzyme catalyzes the first step of the formation of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) on specific soluble lysosomal hydrolases. M6P is essential for the trafficking of these lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomes via M6P receptors. Without M6P, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are mis-sorted into the extracellular space and are unable to breakdown specific substrates in lysosomes (for reviews, see Velho et al, 2019, PMID: 30882951; and Khan and Tomatsu, 2020, PMID: 32957425). As a result, various macromolecules accumulate in the lysosomes in different tissues resulting in a spectrum of clinical symptoms (see LeRoy et al, 2019, PMID: 20301728 for review).  \n\nAt the most severe end of the GNPTAB-mucolipidosis clinical spectrum, individuals with mucolipiosis type II (also known as I-cell disease, Pacman disease; MIM# 252500; MONDO:0009650) have progressive features, evident at birth, and usually resulting in death in childhood. Characteristic features include skeletal abnormalities, postnatal growth retardation, contractures of the large joints, coarse facial features, hypertrophic gingiva, cardiac involvement (such as thickening of the mitral valve or aortic valve), and progressive respiratory insufficiency, which is the most common cause of death. At the milder end of the clinical spectrum, ML III alpha/beta (also known as Pseudo-Hurler-polydystrophy; MIM # 252600; MONDO:0018931) usually presents at around age 3 years with growth delay, short stature, joint stiffness, mild coarsening of facial features, and cognitive ability ranging from normal to mild intellectual disability. Death usually occurs in early to mid-adulthood from cardiorespiratory problems. Patients with symptoms intermediate between ML II and MLL III alpha/beta (also known as Webb mucolipidosis) have also been reported (LeRoy et al, 2019, PMID: 20301728). These disorders are all inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and all are caused by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase deficiency due to loss of function of the alpha/beta subunits. Therefore, for the purposes of this curation, these disorders have been lumped under \"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunit alpha/beta deficiency\" (MONDO:0100122; synonym GNPTAB-related disorders). In addition to this condition, recent studies have reported that variants in GNPTAB are associated with non-syndromic stuttering. The affected individuals were heterozygous, but the inheritance pattern is unclear (PMID: 20301728 and references therein). Stuttering has not been observed in individuals with GNPTAB-mucolipidosis (PMID: 20301728). Therefore, these data are not included in the current curation.\n\nOver 250 different GNPTAB variants have been identified in individuals with GNPTAB-mucolipidosis (Velho et al, 2019, PMID: 30882951). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Nineteen variants (including nonsense, frameshift, splicing, missense) reported in 14 probands in 4 publications (Paik et al, 2005, PMID: 16116615; Heo et al, 2012, PMID: 23227064; Cury et al, 2013, PMID: 23566849; Mao et al, 2022, PMID: 35463894) are included in this curation. Of note, the most common variant worldwide, c.3503_3504delTC, is a founder variant in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region in Quebec (Plante et al, 2008, PMID: 18190596; LeRoy et al, 2019, PMID: 20301728). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of the gene product, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical features of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunit alpha/beta deficiency (Kudo et al, 2005, PMID: 16120602; van Meel et al, 2016, PMID: 26833567), data from a GNPTAB siRNA knockdown study (Tiede et al, PMID: 34116066), and the clinical and biochemical features reported in a Gnptab knock out mouse (Gelfman et al, 2007, PMID: 17962477; Vogel et al, 2009, PMID: 19261645) and mouse with a knock-in GNPTAB patient variant (Koehne et al, 2017, PMID: 27239697). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\n\nIn summary, GNPTAB is definitively associated with autosomal recessive GNPTAB-mucolipidosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on April 28, 2023 (SOP v9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:53e7d8eb-de36-49d5-ba29-57f640a492bc"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
