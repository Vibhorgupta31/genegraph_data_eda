Through the understanding of the biological perturbations in individuals with NKD, requirements for the generation of terminally mature functional innate effector cells can be elucidated. Here, we report a cause of NKD resulting from compound heterozygous mutations in minichromosomal maintenance complex member 10 (MCM10) that impaired NK cell maturation in a child with fatal susceptibility to CMV. MCM10 has not been previously associated with monogenic disease and plays a critical role in the activation and function of the eukaryotic DNA replisome. Through evaluation of patient primary fibroblasts, modeling patient mutations in fibroblast cell lines, and MCM10 knockdown in human NK cell lines, we have shown that loss of MCM10 function leads to impaired cell cycle progression and induction of DNA damage-response pathways. By modeling MCM10 deficiency in primary NK cell precursors, including patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, we further demonstrated that MCM10 is required for NK cell terminal maturation and acquisition of immunological system function. Together, these data define MCM10 as an NKD gene and provide biological insight into the requirement for the DNA replisome in human NK cell maturation and function.","dc:creator":"Mace EM","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Human NK cell deficiency as a result of biallelic mutations in MCM10."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b68b9e6-cc1a-44ee-8860-319bc131e948_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4b68b9e6-cc1a-44ee-8860-319bc131e948_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5},{"id":"cggv:67d9d439-07aa-48f0-b786-94cd2c83957e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67d9d439-07aa-48f0-b786-94cd2c83957e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":20,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:16f0841b-5b13-44f9-b78e-d9537409e9d9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018518.5(MCM10):c.236del (p.Gly79GlufsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2499220195"}},{"id":"cggv:a15618d5-f273-452d-8ace-9502b088413f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018518.5(MCM10):c.764+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5411298"}}],"detectionMethod":"Exome sequencing of parents and proband, initially assessing cardiomyopathy associated genes without yield, then gene agnostic trio analysis undertaken with genome sequencing of the third affected fetus","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Histology of spleen showed autolyzed tissue with no specific pathological features, myocardial histology showed enlarged myofiber nuclear size and endocardial fibroelastosis consistent with cardiomyopathy, intrauterine death at 27 weeks, karyotyping on amniotic fluid normal\n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0034241","obo:HP_0030718","obo:HP_0001789","obo:HP_0000778","obo:HP_0010451","obo:HP_0001698","obo:HP_0001712","obo:HP_0001723"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Routine 12 week antenatal scan normal","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:caa07097-f154-460d-9003-beba8609d31b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a15618d5-f273-452d-8ace-9502b088413f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712616","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Minichromosome maintenance protein 10 (MCM10) is essential for eukaryotic DNA replication.

MCM10 deficiency causes chronic replication stress that reduces cell viability due to increased genomic instability and telomere erosion. Our data suggest that loss of MCM10 function constrains telomerase activity by accumulating abnormal replication fork structures enriched with single-stranded DNA.

Inheritance in all reported cases is compound heterozygous. This condition is characterized by early onset disease profound NK cell deficiency with impaired maturation, T and B cell lymphopenia and disseminated cytomegalovirus infection, as well as antenatal restrictive cardiomyopathy with thymic and splenic hypoplasia. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Of the 4 reported cases, the first presented age 16 months and succumbed to overwhelming CMV age 24 months, with compound heterozygous mutations (non-sense and missense) (PMID: 32865517). The remaining 3 were sibling identified antenatally all experienced perinatal mortality with compound heterozygous mutations (non-sense and cryptic splice acceptor) (PMID: 3371261). Both parents of each proband were healthy heterozygotes for a single variant, suggesting necessity of biallelic variants to cause disease.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function, expression studies, functional assays, a cell culture and a mouse model (PMIDs:15494305, 25613900, 33712616, 32865517). In healthy subjects, MCM10 is a conserved component of the eukaryotic replisome, and promotes initiation of DNA replication through interactions with CDC45, MCM2-7 and GINS (CMG) complex. After origin firing it controls fork stability to support elongation through recruitment of DNA POL alpha-1 and PCNA and stabilizes the replisome to prevent replication stress and promote gene stability (PMID: 28218679). In budding yeast expressing tagged MCM10, Ricke et al demonstrated that MCM10 remains at replication origins until activated but is displaced only after firing (PMID: 15494305), supporting its role in DNA replication. MCM10 is highly expressed in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues (PMID: 25613900). Transformed primary patient-derived fibroblasts showed aberrant cell cycle dynamics, whilst patient fibroblasts harbor increased DNA damage, nuclear area and proportions of S phase cells, suggesting cell cycle defects and replication stress (PMID 32865517). Late passage HCT116 MCM10+/- showed genomic instability, chromosomal rearrangements at common fragile sites and shorter early passage telomeres with erosion overtime (PMID: 33712616). A CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell MCM10KD model demonstrated an NK cell maturation defect similar to the stage 4 arrest seen in the Mace proband (PMID: 32865517). Finally, a murine model reconstituted with primary patient fibroblasts reprogramed to generate iPS, demonstrated enrichment of CD56bright NK cell subset in peripheral blood and spleen with evidence of DNA damage compared to healthy controls, again recapitulating the NK cell maturation arrest seen in Mace proband (PMID: 32865517).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Whilst more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date June 20th 2024 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4b68b9e6-cc1a-44ee-8860-319bc131e948"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
