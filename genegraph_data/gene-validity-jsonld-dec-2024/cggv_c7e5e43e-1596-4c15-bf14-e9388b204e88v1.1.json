A loss-of-function mutation of ankyrin-B identified in an extended kindred causes a dominantly inherited cardiac arrhythmia, initially described as type 4 long QT syndrome. Here we report the identification of eight unrelated probands harboring ankyrin-B loss-of-function mutations, including four previously undescribed mutations, whose clinical features distinguish the cardiac phenotype associated with loss of ankyrin-B activity from classic long QT syndromes. Humans with ankyrin-B mutations display varying degrees of cardiac dysfunction including bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and risk of sudden death. However, a prolonged rate-corrected QT interval was not a consistent feature, indicating that ankyrin-B dysfunction represents a clinical entity distinct from classic long QT syndromes. The mutations are localized in the ankyrin-B regulatory domain, which distinguishes function of ankyrin-B from ankyrin-G in cardiomyocytes. All mutations abolish ability of ankyrin-B to restore abnormal Ca(2+) dynamics and abnormal localization and expression of Na/Ca exchanger, Na/K ATPase, and InsP(3)R in ankyrin-B(+/-) cardiomyocytes. This study, considered together with the first description of ankyrin-B mutation associated with cardiac dysfunction, supports a previously undescribed paradigm for human disease due to abnormal coordination of multiple functionally related ion channels and transporters, in this case the Na/K ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, and InsP(3) receptor.","dc:creator":"Mohler PJ","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"A cardiac arrhythmia syndrome caused by loss of ankyrin-B function."},"rdfs:label":"ANK2 variants transfected into ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocytes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"It is not evident how these outcomes correlate to incidence of disease in humans."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c7e5e43e-1596-4c15-bf14-e9388b204e88_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:23034e2a-275e-4067-a084-1f7a1069e47f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8ea237e-d6a5-46d8-8de4-3f0365f6bbb0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Prolonged polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia immediately preceding death was recorded in two mice treated with exercise plus epinephrine (Fig. 2f).

Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in ankyrin-B are haploinsufficient and display arrhythmia similar to humans. Mutation of ankyrin-B results in disruption in the cellular organization of the sodium pump, the sodium/calcium exchanger, and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (all ankyrin-B-binding proteins), which reduces the targeting of these proteins to the transverse tubules as well as reducing overall protein level. Ankyrin-B mutation also leads to altered Ca2+ signalling in adult cardiomyocytes that results in extrasystoles, and provides a rationale for the arrhythmia. Thus, we identify a new mechanism for cardiac arrhythmia due to abnormal coordination of multiple functionally related ion channels and transporters.","dc:creator":"Mohler PJ","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Ankyrin-B mutation causes type 4 long-QT cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death."},"rdfs:label":"AnkB heterozygous null mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Less points than default were given because of the concomitant presence of other phenotypes, i.e., slowing of conduction interval.

ANK2, which encodes the ankyrin B protein, has been implicated in a number of arrhythmia phenotypes but has been classified as Disputed for both Brugada syndrome and Long QT syndrome by the respective Gene Curation Expert Panels. Variants in ANK2 have been detected in 3 patients/families with CPVT-like symptoms (Mohler et al, 2004, PMID:15178757; Mohler et al, 2007, PMID:17242276). However the population frequencies of these variants are too high to be an autosomal dominant cause of CPVT – p.Leu1622Ile (gnomAD max MAF = 0.034), p.Arg1788Trp (gnomAD max MAF = 0.002) and p.Val1516Asp (gnomAD max MAF = 0.004). AnkB heterozygous null mice have been shown to display exercise and epinephrine-induced polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias before death (Mohler et al, 2003, PMID:12571597). While this phenotype can be rescued with transfection of wild type ankyrin-B, mutant ankyrin-B with the human arrhythmia-associated variants described above (and variants associated with other arrhythmias) were unable to rescue this phenotype (Mohler et al, 2004, PMID:15178757; Mohler et al, 2007, PMID:17242276). Nevertheless, despite this experimental evidence, there is no convincing human genetic evidence to associate ANK2 as an autosomal dominant cause of CPVT and therefore this gene has been classified as Disputed. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).\nThere is no convincing human genetic evidence to associate ANK2 as an autosomal dominant cause of CPVT and therefore this gene has been classified as Disputed.
