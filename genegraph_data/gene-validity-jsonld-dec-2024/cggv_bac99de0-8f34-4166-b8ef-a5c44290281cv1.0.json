The U5 spliceosomal complex of eight highly conserved proteins is critical for pre-mRNA splicing. We identified biallelic mutations in TXNL4A, a member of this complex, in individuals with Burn-McKeown syndrome (BMKS). This rare condition is characterized by bilateral choanal atresia, hearing loss, cleft lip and/or palate, and other craniofacial dysmorphisms. Mutations were found in 9 of 11 affected families. In 8 families, affected individuals carried a rare loss-of-function mutation (nonsense, frameshift, or microdeletion) on one allele and a low-frequency 34 bp deletion (allele frequency 0.76%) in the core promoter region on the other allele. In a single highly consanguineous family, formerly diagnosed as oculo-oto-facial dysplasia, the four affected individuals were homozygous for a 34 bp promoter deletion, which differed from the promoter deletion in the other families. Reporter gene and in vivo assays showed that the promoter deletions led to reduced expression of TXNL4A. Depletion of TXNL4A (Dib1) in yeast demonstrated reduced assembly of the tri-snRNP complex. Our results indicate that BMKS is an autosomal-recessive condition, which is frequently caused by compound heterozygosity of low-frequency promoter deletions in combination with very rare loss-of-function mutations.","dc:creator":"Wieczorek D","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Compound heterozygosity of low-frequency promoter deletions and rare loss-of-function mutations in TXNL4A causes Burn-McKeown syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:6a64afa3-c007-4477-8ee7-502a00dce46d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:837f292f-f650-4b3c-9ec1-fb575891ba5d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434003"}],"rdfs:label":"BMKS007 II/1"},{"id":"cggv:be1b3eb1-4460-4ec6-b5af-7aa241644254","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:be1b3eb1-4460-4ec6-b5af-7aa241644254_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:be1b3eb1-4460-4ec6-b5af-7aa241644254_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Reporter gene and in vivo assays showed reduced promoter activity and reduced expression of TXNL4A\n"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded as this variant is a hypomorph and is recurrent in other patients"},{"id":"cggv:6a64afa3-c007-4477-8ee7-502a00dce46d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a64afa3-c007-4477-8ee7-502a00dce46d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"1.235 Mb del incl. entire gene and 11 other genes\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a5eac559-785c-4897-bf71-24af5622c451_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a5eac559-785c-4897-bf71-24af5622c451","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":43,"allele":{"id":"cggv:fcd757f4-de04-4cf8-97f2-8bdabab058e7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000018.10:g.79988607_79988640del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA199691"}},"detectionMethod":"Exome sequencing, targeted dideoxy DNA sequencing and segregation analysis","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Normal intelligence","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000272","obo:HP_0000322","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0004502","obo:HP_0000324","obo:HP_0000426","obo:HP_0000652","obo:HP_0000494"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:33fa1317-5ea8-439e-ba18-6692ab6ca652_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:fcd757f4-de04-4cf8-97f2-8bdabab058e7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32187816","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Burn-McKeown syndrome (BMKS) (MIM# 608572) is a rare condition caused by biallelic variants in TXNL4A.

Recently, causative compound heterozygous variants were identified in TXNL4A. We analyzed an individual with clinical features of BMKS and her parents by whole-genome sequencing and identified compound heterozygous variants in TXNL4A (a novel splice site variant (c.258-2A>G, (p.?)) and a 34 bp promoter deletion (hg19 chr18:g.77748581_77748614del (type 1Δ) in the proband). Subsequently, we tested a cohort of 19 individuals with (mild) features of BMKS and 17 individuals with isolated choanal atresia for causative variants in TXNL4A by dideoxy-sequence analysis. In one individual with BMKS unrelated to the first family, we identified the identical compound heterozygous variants. In an individual with isolated choanal atresia, we found homozygosity for the same type 1Δ promoter deletion, whilst in two cousins from a family with choanal atresia and other minor anomalies we found homozygosity for a different deletion within the promoter (hg19 chr18: g.77748604_77748637del (type 2Δ)).

BMKS is caused by biallelic variants in the pre-messenger RNA splicing factor TXNL4A. Most patients have a loss-of-function variant in trans with a 34-base pair (bp) deletion (type 1 Δ34) in the promoter region. Here, we identified two patients with BMKS. One individual has a TXNL4A c.93_94delCC, p.His32Argfs *21 variant combined with a type 1 Δ34 promoter deletion. The other has an intronic TXNL4A splice site variant (c.258-3C>G) and a type 1 Δ34 promoter deletion. We show the c.258-3C>G variant and a previously reported c.258-2A>G variant, cause skipping of the final exon of TXNL4A in a minigene splicing assay. Furthermore, we identify putative transcription factor binding sites within the 56 bp of the TXNL4A promoter affected by the type 1 and type 2 Δ34 and use dual luciferase assays to identify a 22 bp repeated motif essential for TXNL4A expression within this promoter region. We propose that additional variants affecting critical transcription factor binding nucleotides within the 22 bp repeated motif could be relevant to BMKS aetiology. Finally, our data emphasises the need to analyse the non-coding sequence in individuals where a single likely pathogenic coding variant is identified in an autosomal recessive disorder consistent with the clinical presentation.","dc:creator":"Wood KA","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Expanding the genotypic spectrum of TXNL4A variants in Burn-McKeown

The majority of affected individuals with BMKS have a 34 base pair deletion in the promoter region of one allele of TXNL4A combined with a loss-of-function variant on the other allele, resulting in reduced TXNL4A expression. However, it is unclear how reduced expression of this ubiquitously expressed spliceosome protein results in craniofacial defects during development. Here we reprogrammed peripheral mononuclear blood cells from a BMKS patient and her unaffected mother into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated the iPSCs into induced neural crest cells (iNCCs), the key cell type required for correct craniofacial development. BMKS patient-derived iPSCs proliferated more slowly than both mother- and unrelated control-derived iPSCs, and RNA-Seq analysis revealed significant differences in gene expression and alternative splicing. Patient iPSCs displayed defective differentiation into iNCCs compared to maternal and unrelated control iPSCs, in particular a delay in undergoing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). RNA-Seq analysis of differentiated iNCCs revealed widespread gene expression changes and mis-splicing in genes relevant to craniofacial and embryonic development that highlight a dampened response to WNT signalling, the key pathway activated during iNCC differentiation. Furthermore, we identified the mis-splicing of TCF7L2 exon 4, a key gene in the WNT pathway, as a potential cause of the downregulated WNT response in patient cells. Additionally, mis-spliced genes shared common sequence properties such as length, branch point to 3' splice site (BPS-3'SS) distance and splice site strengths, suggesting that splicing of particular subsets of genes is particularly sensitive to changes in TXNL4A expression. Together, these data provide the first insight into how reduced TXNL4A expression in BMKS patients might compromise splicing and NCC function, resulting in defective craniofacial development in the embryo.","dc:creator":"Wood KA","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Modelling the developmental spliceosomal craniofacial disorder Burn-McKeown syndrome using induced pluripotent stem cells."},"rdfs:label":"Functional alteration in patient iPSCs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.25},{"id":"cggv:bac99de0-8f34-4166-b8ef-a5c44290281c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:acf5316e-ad6b-4f10-bdd2-84dd8940d8f9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d20952d1-446e-4b7b-b2d6-e2754e4a7ba9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"The modified version of Xenopus Txnl4a restored the proportion of normal embryos from 14% to 62%.

BMKS is a rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by bilateral choanal atresia associated with characteristic cranio-facial dysmorphisms and generally normal intelligence. Other phenotypes may include hearing loss, cleft lip/palate, and cardiac defects. At least 10 unique variants (promoter, missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 14 probands in four publications (PMIDs: 25434003, 28905882, 32187816, 34713892) are included in this curation. Twelve out of the 14 probands were compound heterozygotes with a 34 bp promoter type 1 deletion (NM_006701.5:c.-222_-189del34) identified on one allele and a loss-of-function variant on the other. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by evidence of functional alteration, and an animal model in Xenopus (PMIDs: 25434003, 32735620, 35893124). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TXNL4A* and autosomal recessive Burn-McKeown syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic GCEP on the meeting date 2/16/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bac99de0-8f34-4166-b8ef-a5c44290281c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
