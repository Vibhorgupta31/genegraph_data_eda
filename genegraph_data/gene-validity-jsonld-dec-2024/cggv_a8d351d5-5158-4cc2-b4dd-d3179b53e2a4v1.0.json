Arylsulfatase A (encoded by ARSA) s a homo-octamer composed of a tetramer of dimers. It belongs to the family of sulfatases, enzymes that hydrolyze the sulfate ester bonds of various compounds. ARSA-mediated hydrolysis of substrates has been shown to be a multi-step mechanism involving nucleophile activation, nucleophilic attack, and S-O bond cleavage. pecifically, ARSA is involved in the degradation of sulfatides in the lysosomes. SapB is involved in the  presentation of sulfatide to the active site of ARSA.

The disease occurs due to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) or its sphingolipid activator protein B (SapB) and it clinically manifests as progressive motor and cognitive deficiency. ARSA and SapB protein deficiency are caused by mutations in the ARSA and PSAP genes, respectively. The severity of clinical course in metachromatic leukodystrophy is determined by the residual ARSA activity, depending on the type of mutation. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this disease. Clinical cases of bone marrow or cord blood transplantation have been reported, however the therapeutic effectiveness of these methods remains insufficient to prevent aggravation of neurological disorders. Encouraging results have been obtained using gene therapy for delivering the wild-type ARSA gene using vectors based on various serotypes of adeno-associated viruses, as well as using mesenchymal stem cells and combined gene-cell therapy.

Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected, examined for appropriate size inserts, and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA. Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations. One, a point mutation in exon 3, resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine. Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells. About 5% of the control expression was observed, suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA. The second mutation, a G-to-A transition, occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron. The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site. Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele, but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected. A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients, members of their families, and normal controls was screened for these mutations. Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample. Gene segregation in the original patient's family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data. No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified. However, combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease. The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme-null mutations, implying that it is completely silent enzymatically.","dc:creator":"Fluharty AL","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Two new arylsulfatase A (ARSA) mutations in a juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) patient."}},{"id":"cggv:a446f128-c6a4-4ec0-8e93-98128dd59ad2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:479e447f-b092-4306-b6bf-e79ac6250dee"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1684088"}],"rdfs:label":"Fluharty et al, 1991: Case report"},{"id":"cggv:a446f128-c6a4-4ec0-8e93-98128dd59ad2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a446f128-c6a4-4ec0-8e93-98128dd59ad2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a446f128-c6a4-4ec0-8e93-98128dd59ad2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"When expressed in BHK cells, the variant resulted in about 5% wild type ARSA activity.

ARSA encodes arylsufatase A, a lysosomal enzyme that breaks down cerebroside-3-sulfate (sulfatide) in the presence of its sphingolipid activator protein, SaposinB (Sap-B, enoded by PSAP). When arylsufatase A activity is deficient, sulfatides accumulate in the lysosomes of all cell types and are also excreted in the urine. Sulfatide accumulation results in progressive demyelination and dysfunction of the central and peripheral nervous systems, with progressive motor and cognitive deficiency. Symptoms include ataxia, gait disturbance, seizures, spasticity, vision and hearing loss, and behavioral and psychiatric issues in later onset patients. The age of onset and severity of clinical course determined by the residual ARSA activity. There are 3 subtypes. In the late infantile form, onset is usually between 1-2 years of age; in the juvenile form, onset is between 4-14 years; while the adult onset form presents after puberty and as late as the 4th or 5th decade of life (Cesani et al, 2016, PMID: 26462614; Gomez-Ospina et al, 2020, PMID: 20301309; Shaimardanova et al, 2020, PMID: 33195324).\n\nMLD is one of the most common leukodystrophies. The prevalence is 1 in 40,000–160,000 worldwide, but is much higher in some isolated populations, including Habbanite Jews (1 in 75), Navajo ( 1 in 2500), and Israel Arab groups (1 in 8,000) (Cesani et al, 2016, PMID: 26462614; Gomez-Ospina et al, 2020, PMID: 20301309). Over 150 ARSA variants have been identified in patients with MLD (Shaimardanova et al, 2020, PMID: 33195324). Four variants (c.465+1G>A, c.1210+1G>A, p.Pro428Leu, and p.Ile181Ser) account for 25%-50% of ARSA variants in patients with MLD of central and western European ancestry (Gomez-Ospina et al, 2020, PMID: 20301309).\n\nThe ARSA-pseudodeficiency (Pd) allele decreases ARSA activity but does not result in clinical symptoms because the residual enzymatic activity is sufficient for sulfatide break down. The ARSA-pseudodeficiency (Pd) allele is characterized by two variants in cis; c.1055A>G (p.Asn352Ser) (old nomenclature 1049A>G, Asn350Ser), which affects N-glycosylation position and leads to a partial enzyme mistargeting, and ∗96A>G transition, which occurs in the first functional polyadenylation signal, and results a reduction in ARSA mRNA (Cesani et al, 2016, PMID: 26462614; Gomez-Ospina et al, 2020, PMID: 20301309).\nIn addition, the older literature (published before the adoption of HGVS nomenclature) names variants based on the amino acid positions of the processed mature protein, which differs from the translated protein in six nucleotides at the 5’ end cDNA sequence and by two amino acids at the N-terminus (Cesani et al, 2016, PMID: 26462614). Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that the correct variant is being assessed.\n\nIn this curation, data on 14 variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense) in 13 patients from 5 publications were collected (Fluharty et al, 1991, PMID: 1684088; Grossi et al, 2008, PMID: 1670590; Amr et al, 2021; PMID: 33185815; Santhanakumaran et al, 2022, PMID: 36240581; Wang et al, 2022, PMID: 36324388). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical functional of arylsufatase A, which is consistent with the clinical and biochemical features observed in patients with MLD (Mehl and Jatzkewitz, 1968, PMID: 5646041; Shaimardanova et al, 2020, PMID: 33195324), the features of an Arsa knock out mouse model (Hess et al, 1996, PMID: 8962139), and the results of a cell-gene therapy clinical trial (Fumagalli et al, 2022, PMID: 35065785). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\nIn summary, ARSA is definitely associated with autosomal recessive metachromatic leukodystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Classification approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on June 15, 2023 (SOP v9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a8d351d5-5158-4cc2-b4dd-d3179b53e2a4"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
