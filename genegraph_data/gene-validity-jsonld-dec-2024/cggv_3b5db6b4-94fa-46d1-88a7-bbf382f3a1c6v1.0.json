This study demonstrates\nhow neural circuits responsible for these mental disorders are affected by IL1RAPL1 mutations.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28576939","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations and deletions of the interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein like 1 (IL1RAPL1) gene, located on the X chromosome, are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). IL1RAPL1 protein is located at the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses and plays a role in synapse formation and stabilization. Here, using primary neuronal cultures and Il1rapl1-KO mice, we characterized the role of IL1RAPL1 in regulating dendrite morphology. In Il1rapl1-KO mice we identified an increased number of dendrite branching points in CA1 and CA2 hippocampal neurons associated to hippocampal cognitive impairment. Similarly, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from a patient carrying a null mutation of the IL1RAPL1 gene had more dendrites. In hippocampal neurons, the overexpression of full-length IL1RAPL1 and mutants lacking part of C-terminal domains leads to simplified neuronal arborization. This effect is abolished when we overexpressed mutants lacking part of N-terminal domains, indicating that the IL1RAPL1 extracellular domain is required for regulating dendrite development. We also demonstrate that PTPδ interaction is not required for this activity, while IL1RAPL1 mediates the activity of IL-1β on dendrite morphology. Our data reveal a novel specific function for IL1RAPL1 in regulating dendrite morphology that can help clarify how changes in IL1RAPL1-regulated pathways can lead to cognitive disorders in humans.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Abnormalities in the architecture of dendrites have been observed in a variety of neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we show that the X-linked intellectual disability protein interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein like 1 (IL1RAPL1) regulates dendrite morphology of mice hippocampal neurons and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from a patient carrying a null mutation of IL1RAPL1 gene. We also found that the extracellular domain of IL1RAPL1 is required for this effect, independently of the interaction with PTPδ, but IL1RAPL1 mediates the activity of IL-1β on dendrite morphology. Our data reveal a novel specific function for IL1RAPL1 in regulating dendrite morphology that can help clarify how changes in IL1RAPL1-regulated pathways can lead to cognitive disorders in humans.","dc:creator":"Montani C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"The X-Linked Intellectual Disability Protein IL1RAPL1 Regulates Dendrite Complexity."},"rdfs:label":"Il1rapl1 knockout mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Entirety of the human phenotype not captured in mice but significant overlap compelling nevertheless."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3b5db6b4-94fa-46d1-88a7-bbf382f3a1c6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3b5db6b4-94fa-46d1-88a7-bbf382f3a1c6_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3b5db6b4-94fa-46d1-88a7-bbf382f3a1c6_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2942693c-7fdd-4510-8433-89db5d9ad534_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d0a0c285-9836-4c17-a5ec-413bb3e9603e","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis localized to Xp11.4-pter.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001249","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2942693c-7fdd-4510-8433-89db5d9ad534_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:1588af76-3fb7-467c-8ca6-76efac763d1f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014271.4(IL1RAPL1):c.1460G>A (p.Trp487Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/11481"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16470793","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a genetically heterogeneous condition, due to mutations in at least 50 genes, involved in functioning of the central nervous system and located on the X chromosome. Nonspecific XLMR (MRX) is characterized essentially by mental retardation transmitted by X-linked inheritance. More than 80 extended MRX pedigrees have been reported to date, which have been distinguished exclusively by physical position of the corresponding gene on the X chromosome, established by linkage analysis. One such family, MRX21, which was described by us in 1993 and localized to Xp11.4-pter, has now been reanalyzed with additional markers and after one more affected individual had became available. This extra information allowed a significant reduction of the linkage interval and, eventually, identification of the mutant gene. A stop mutation in exon 10 of the IL1RAPL1 gene (in Xp21) was found in the four affected males and in obligate carriers, allowing conclusive counseling of other family members of uncertain carrier status. The W487X mutation results in the production of a truncated IL1RAPL protein, comprised of the extracellular Ig-like domain and transmembrane tract, but lacking the last 210 aminoacids of the cytoplasmic domain. MRX21 is the first extended MRX family with a point mutation in IL1RAPL1 and the second with a stop mutation, which had been previously found only in a small family. Our report confirms the role of the IL1RAPL1 gene in causing nonspecific mental retardation in males and underlines the importance of detailed linkage analysis before candidate gene mutational screening.","dc:creator":"Tabolacci E","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"A truncating mutation in the IL1RAPL1 gene is responsible for X-linked mental retardation in the MRX21 family."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16470793","rdfs:label":"Proband 1 from MRX21"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The W487X mutation results in the production of a truncated IL1RAPL protein, comprised of the extracellular Ig-like domain and transmembrane tract, but lacking the last 210 aminoacids of the cytoplasmic domain."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3b5db6b4-94fa-46d1-88a7-bbf382f3a1c6_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:29b2e6a2-68dd-4b39-8a0b-708d9c242725_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54c31962-fbe8-4364-8e82-883928d8291c","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"NGS panel targeting 565 known or candidate intellectual disability genes","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001249","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"CGH microarray\nFragile X\nMethylation status for Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:29b2e6a2-68dd-4b39-8a0b-708d9c242725_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:9f4eafee-58e7-49cb-b9d6-dbc8f265c959","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014271.4(IL1RAPL1):c.148C>T (p.Arg50Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA412632964"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350204","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To identify genetic causes of intellectual disability (ID), we screened a cohort of 986 individuals with moderate to severe ID for variants in 565 known or candidate ID-associated genes using targeted next-generation sequencing.

This modeling is clinically relevant as 28% of all UK families with dependent children are single parent households. In conclusion, to diagnose patients with ID in the absence of parental DNA, we recommend investigation of all LoF variants in known genes that cause ID and assessment of a limited list of proven pathogenic missense variants in these genes.

Linkage studies in extended pedigrees followed by mutational analysis of known MRX genes in the linked interval are often the only way to identify a genetic cause of the disorder. We performed linkage analysis in several MRX families, and in one family with four males with MR we mapped the disease to an interval encompassing Xp21.2-22.11 (with a maximum LOD score of 2.71).
