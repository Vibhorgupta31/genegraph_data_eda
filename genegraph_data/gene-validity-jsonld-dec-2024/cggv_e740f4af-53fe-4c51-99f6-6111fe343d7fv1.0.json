Multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), a severe form of asthenoteratozoospermia, are characterized by immotile spermatozoa with malformed and/or absent flagella in the ejaculate. Previous studies indicated genetic heterogeneity in MMAF. To further define genetic factors underlying MMAF, we performed whole-exome sequencing in a cohort of 90 Chinese MMAF-affected men. Two cases (2.2%) were identified as carrying bi-allelic missense DNAH8 variants, variants which were either absent or rare in the control human population and were predicted to be deleterious by multiple bioinformatic tools. Re-analysis of exome data from a second cohort of 167 MMAF-affected men from France, Iran, and North Africa permitted the identification of an additional male carrying a DNAH8 homozygous frameshift variant. DNAH8 encodes a dynein axonemal heavy-chain component that is expressed preferentially in the testis. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and electron microscopy analyses of the spermatozoa from men harboring bi-allelic DNAH8 variants showed a highly aberrant morphology and ultrastructure of the sperm flagella. Immunofluorescence assays performed on the spermatozoa from men harboring bi-allelic DNAH8 variants revealed the absent or markedly reduced staining of DNAH8 and its associated protein DNAH17. Dnah8-knockout male mice also presented typical MMAF phenotypes and sterility. Interestingly, intracytoplasmic sperm injections using the spermatozoa from Dnah8-knockout male mice resulted in good pregnancy outcomes.

However, the MMAF-associated genes identified to date cannot explain all the human MMAF cases. Herein, a loss-of-function mutation of DNAH8 was identified in an asthenozoospermia patient with MMAF. Moreover, the negative effect of this mutation on DNAH8 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting.

Their structural and/or functional defects are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disease characterized by chronic respiratory-tract infections and in which most males are infertile due to asthenozoospermia. Among the well-characterized axonemal protein complexes, the outer dynein arms (ODAs), through ATPase activity of their heavy chains (HCs), play a major role for cilia and flagella beating. However, the contribution of the different HCs (γ-type: DNAH5 and DNAH8 and β-type: DNAH9, DNAH11, and DNAH17) in ODAs from both organelles is unknown. By analyzing five male individuals who consulted for isolated infertility and displayed a loss of ODAs in their sperm cells but not in their respiratory cells, we identified bi-allelic mutations in DNAH17. The isolated infertility phenotype prompted us to compare the protein composition of ODAs in the sperm and ciliary axonemes from control individuals. We show that DNAH17 and DNAH8, but not DNAH5, DNAH9, or DNAH11, colocalize with α-tubulin along the sperm axoneme, whereas the reverse picture is observed in respiratory cilia, thus explaining the phenotype restricted to sperm cells. We also demonstrate the loss of function associated with DNAH17 mutations in two unrelated individuals by performing immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses on sperm cells; these analyses indicated the absence of DNAH17 and DNAH8, whereas DNAH2 and DNALI, two inner dynein arm components, were present. Overall, this study demonstrates that mutations in DNAH17 are responsible for isolated male infertility and provides information regarding ODA composition in human spermatozoa.","dc:creator":"Whitfield M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Mutations in DNAH17, Encoding a Sperm-Specific Axonemal Outer Dynein Arm Heavy Chain, Cause Isolated Male Infertility Due to Asthenozoospermia."},"rdfs:label":"Immunostaining of DNAH8 in Spermatozoa "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b6a12a52-ab68-4a28-8be6-70cc94b8b435","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bca55a08-7eeb-4ccc-9863-47a82ebb2dba","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"DNAH8 mRNA is expressed in testis of normal controls","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613900","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease.

In previous studies, a locus responsible for hybrid sterility in the genus Mus,Hst-4, was mapped to the distal inversion of the t complex on chromosome 17. Here we report the identification and characterization of two additional hybrid sterility loci, Hst-5 and Hst-6, that map to the same inversion. We further show that an abnormality in sperm flagellar curvature deriving from interactions between t haplotypes and the M. spretus allele of Hst-6 is indistinguishable from one exhibited by sperm from mice carrying two t haplotypes. Additionally, we demonstrate that this latter phenotype maps to the distal inversion of t haplotypes. Morphological and functional studies of Hst-6 mutant sperm also imply that the product(s) of Hst-6 is a spermatogenic-specific protein, important for assembly and function of the sperm axoneme. Thus, Hst-6 provides direct access to the molecular basis of t haplotype-specific alterations in sperm function that emanate from the t complex distal inversion.","dc:creator":"Pilder SH","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Hybrid sterility-6: a mouse t complex locus controlling sperm flagellar assembly and movement."},"rdfs:label":"Infertility in DNAHC8-/- mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:853dc16b-c769-4c71-bf84-a18b189a45d5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38f5c461-5322-4042-b9e2-a956f760176a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), including absent, short, coiled, and irregular-caliber flagella in mice and in humans\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32619401","rdfs:label":"Infertility in Dnah8-KO mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Strong","sequence":4689,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6ae1fa71-a93c-494e-8f67-d82a047980df","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0033673","gene":"hgnc:2952","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Spermatogenic failure 46 (SPGF46) is characterized by male infertility due to morphologic abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), including flagella that are absent, short, coiled, angulated, and/or of irregular caliber (Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401 and Yang et al., 2020, PMID: 32681648).\n\nMutations in DNAH8 were first reported in 2020 in association with SPGF46 (OMIM: 619095, MONDO:0033673) involving morphologic abnormalities of the flagella (Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401 and Yang et al., 2020, PMID: 32681648). DNAH8 belongs to the axonemal outer dynein arm DHC group and is expressed in sperm flagella but not in the lungs nor the Fallopian tubes (Whitfield et al., 2019, PMID:31178125, Uhlen et al., 2015, PMID: 25613900 and Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401).\n\nOnly one case reported as a Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia patient had a homozygous nonsense mutation in DNAH8 (Watson et al., 2014, PMID: 24307375). The gender/sex, fertility status, and clinical features of the patient were not detailed (Watson et al., 2014, PMID: 24307375).\n \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group we found different molecular  mechanisms. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two entities: SPGF46 (OMIM: 619095, MONDO:0033673) and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.\n\nEvidence from 7 probands in 4 publications were included in this curation (Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401, Yang et al., 2020, PMID: 32681648, Zhou et al., 2021, PMID: 33611675 and Weng et al., 2021, PMID: 33704367) representing 14 unique variants (6 missense, 3 frameshift and 2 splicing). The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence. Abundant data confirms the expression of DNAH8 mRNA (Uhlen et al., 2015, PMID: 25613900) and protein (Whitfield et al., 2019, PMID:31178125, Uhlen et al., 2015, PMID: 25613900 and Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401) in sperm flagella.  DNAH8 immunostaining signal was absent from the sperm flagella from subjects harboring bi-allelic DNAH8 mutations (Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401). Moreover, sperm from these patients (patient’s cells) present abnormal morphology and motility including absent, short, coiled, and irregular-caliber flagella (Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401).\n\nIn mice (Mus musculus), the t haplotype (t complex) is a structural rearrangement naturally occurring in the proximal third of chromosome 17. A t-containing chromosome 17 presents four large nonoverlapping inversion polymorphisms spanning nearly the entire t complex region (Pilder, Olds-Clarke, Phillips, & Silver, 1993, PMID: 8405685). The t complex encompasses two Dynein light chains coding genes (Tctex1 and Tctex2) and the mice homologous of the human DNAH8 gene (DNAHC8). Mice harboring a homozygous t-complex are sterile and exhibit, through C2+ induced arrest, a characteristic sperm tail curvature phenotype called “curlicue”. Compared to the wild-type, the t complex version of DNAHC8 carries seventeen (17) missense mutations at highly conserved positions and may be capable of substantially altering normal DNAHC8 function (null allele) (Samant et al., 2005, PMID: 16054618).\n\nA series of backcrosses have generated null-DNAHC8 mice. Homozygous null-DNAHC8 mice are sterile and present sperm with no flagella (like in humans). Heterozygotes (t/null-DNAHC8) mice are also sterile but exhibit the “curlicue” sperm flagella phenotype (Pilder, Olds-Clarke, Phillips, & Silver, 1993, PMID: 8405685). All these results argue that DNAHC8 plays a key role in the process of generating the sperm flagella and suggests that the “curlicue” phenotype is a multigenic phenomenon.\n\nDNAH8-knockout mice (DNAH8-/-) were generated through the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401). Diminished sperm movement was observed in DNAH8-/- male mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed significantly higher rates of abnormal flagella in the knockout mice, including absent, short, coiled, bent, and/or irregularly shaped flagella, which reminds the phenotype observed in MMAF-affected men with biallelic DNAH8 mutations (Liu et al., 2020, PMID: 32619401).\n\nIn summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between DNAH8 and autosomal recessive Spermatogenic failure 46. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on June 9, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e740f4af-53fe-4c51-99f6-6111fe343d7f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
