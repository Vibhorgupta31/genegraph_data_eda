Copy number variants or gross chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 48.8% (n = 20) of the diagnosed cases, including a mosaic trisomy and suspected derivative chromosomes.

Missense mutations with gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects are associated with CSS, whereas inactivating mutations, leading to loss of SMARCA4 expression, have been exclusively found in SCCOHT. We applied whole-exome sequencing to study a 15-year-old patient with mild CSS who concomitantly developed SCCOHT at age 13 years. Interestingly, our patient also showed congenital microphthalmia, which has never previously been reported in CSS patients. We detected a de novo germline heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 19 of SMARCA4 (c.2935C > T;p.Arg979*), and a somatic frameshift mutation in exon 6 (c.1236_1236delC;p.Gln413Argfs*88), causing complete loss of SMARCA4 immunostaining in the tumour. The immunohistochemical findings are supported by the observation that the c.2935C > T mutant transcript was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at a much lower level than the wild-type allele in whole blood and the lymphoblastoid cell line of the proband, confirming nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Accordingly, immunoblotting demonstrated that there was approximately half the amount of SMARCA4 protein in the proband's cells as in controls. This study suggests that SMARCA4 constitutional mutations associated with CSS are not necessarily non-truncating, and that haploinsufficiency may explain milder CSS phenotypes, as previously reported for haploinsufficient ARID1B. In addition, our case supports the dual role of chromatin remodellers in developmental disorders and cancer, as well as the involvement of SMARCA4 in microphthalmia, confirming previous findings in mouse models and the DECIPHER database. Finally, we speculate that mild CSS might be under-recognized in a proportion of SCCOHT patients harbouring SMARCA4 mutations. © 2017 The Authors.

BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes are polymorphic assemblies that use energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to regulate transcription through the control of chromatin structure and the placement of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across the genome. Several proteins dedicated to this multisubunit complex, including BRG1 (also known as SMARCA4) and BAF250a (also known as ARID1A), are mutated at frequencies similar to those of recognized tumour suppressors. In particular, the core ATPase BRG1 is mutated in 5-10% of childhood medulloblastomas and more than 15% of Burkitt's lymphomas. Here we show a previously unknown function of BAF complexes in decatenating newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. We find that deletion of Brg1 in mouse cells, as well as the expression of BRG1 point mutants identified in human tumours, leads to anaphase bridge formation (in which sister chromatids are linked by catenated strands of DNA) and a G2/M-phase block characteristic of the decatenation checkpoint. Endogenous BAF complexes interact directly with endogenous topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) through BAF250a and are required for the binding of TOP2A to approximately 12,000 sites across the genome. Our results demonstrate that TOP2A chromatin binding is dependent on the ATPase activity of BRG1, which is compromised in oncogenic BRG1 mutants. These studies indicate that the ability of TOP2A to prevent DNA entanglement at mitosis requires BAF complexes and suggest that this activity contributes to the role of BAF subunits as tumour suppressors.","dc:creator":"Dykhuizen EC","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"BAF complexes facilitate decatenation of DNA by topoisomerase IIα."},"rdfs:label":"SMARCA4 encodes a catalytic subunit of the BAF complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgrade score due to strength of evidence: It is known that germline mutations disrupting functions of several other BAF complex subunits cause Coffin-Siris syndrome"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:61d29c73-9a30-4664-9df2-2f5831219221_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20e88019-7ed9-41ba-8084-264667021a88","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a5e99a8-8e8c-4993-9a71-3707cc80d440","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Brg1 deletion in neurons led to neurological defects ( hydrocephalus) in mouse which recapitulate some features of Coffin Siris syndrome","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26459759","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Synapse development requires normal neuronal activities and the precise expression of synapse-related genes. Dysregulation of synaptic genes results in neurological diseases such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Mutations in genes encoding chromatin-remodeling factor Brg1/SmarcA4 and its associated proteins are the genetic causes of several developmental diseases with neurological defects and autistic symptoms. Recent large-scale genomic studies predicted Brg1/SmarcA4 as one of the key nodes of the ASD gene network. We report that Brg1 deletion in early postnatal hippocampal neurons led to reduced dendritic spine density and maturation and impaired synapse activities. In developing mice, neuronal Brg1 deletion caused severe neurological defects. Gene expression analyses indicated that Brg1 regulates a significant number of genes known to be involved in synapse function and implicated in ASD. We found that Brg1 is required for dendritic spine/synapse elimination mediated by the ASD-associated transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and that Brg1 regulates the activity-induced expression of a specific subset of genes that overlap significantly with the targets of MEF2. Our analyses showed that Brg1 interacts with MEF2 and that MEF2 is required for Brg1 recruitment to target genes in response to neuron activation. Thus, Brg1 plays important roles in both synapse development/maturation and MEF2-mediated synapse remodeling. Our study reveals specific functions of the epigenetic regulator Brg1 in synapse development and provides insights into its role in neurological diseases such as ASD.","dc:creator":"Zhang Z","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Autism-Associated Chromatin Regulator Brg1/SmarcA4 Is Required for Synapse Development and Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2-Mediated Synapse Remodeling."},"rdfs:label":"Smarca4 is required for synapse development and remodeling"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"downgrade to 1 because neuron-specific model only recapitulate some features of the of Coffin Siris syndrome"},{"id":"cggv:7cfbd19b-24a6-40e4-830d-1191fdbdc453","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee4493fe-78d2-47da-9831-a5577e3ca750","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Cardiovascular defects (immature cerebral vessels, aberrant pharyngeal arch arteries (PAA) patterning, and shortened cardiac outflow tract (OFT)) observed in Brg1 null neural crest cells (NCC) embryos, is similar to heart defects (ex. malposition of great arteries) observed in 42% of Coffin-siris cases with SMARCA4 mutation (PMID: 25168959). \n\nBrg1 is required for cardiovascular development.

Little is known about how mammalian NCC development is orchestrated by gene programming at the chromatin level, however. Here we show that Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), an ATPase subunit of the Brg1/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is required in NCCs to direct cardiovascular development. Mouse embryos lacking Brg1 in NCCs display immature cerebral vessels, aberrant PAA patterning, and shortened OFT. Brg1 suppresses an apoptosis factor, Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), and a cell cycle inhibitor, p21(cip1), to inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation of NCCs, thereby maintaining a multipotent cell reservoir at the neural crest. Brg1 also supports Myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11) expression to allow NCCs to develop into mature vascular smooth muscle cells of cerebral vessels. Within NCCs, Brg1 partners with chromatin remodeler Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) on the PlexinA2 promoter to activate PlexinA2, which encodes a receptor for semaphorin to guide NCCs into the OFT. Our findings reveal an important role for Brg1 and its downstream pathways in the survival, differentiation, and migration of the multipotent NCCs critical for mammalian cardiovascular development.","dc:creator":"Li W","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Brg1 governs distinct pathways to direct multiple aspects of mammalian neural crest cell development."},"rdfs:label":"Cardiovascular defects: Brg1 null neural crest cells embryos"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Downgrade since cardiovascular defects observed in model system did not recapitulate most or all of the classical coffin-siris phenotypes observed in human."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1031,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:e292b3bf-310e-4d4f-8f38-8bda91486844","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015452","gene":"hgnc:11100","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Variants in SMARCA4 were first reported in humans with autosomal dominant Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) as early as 2012 (PMID: 22426308). Pathogenic variants in several genes encoding components of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, including ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SMARCC2, SMARCD1, SMARCE1, and DPF2, cause Coffin-Siris syndrome (PMIDs: 25168959, 31530938). Heterozygous SMARCA4 pathogenic variants cause ~12% of CSS cases (PMID: 30123105). At least 15 unique de novo missense or in-frame variants (PMIDs: 22426308, 23815551, 23929686, 30123105) and one frameshift SMARCA4 variant (PMID: 28608987) have been reported in individuals with CSS. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Almost all pathogenic missense variants reported in Coffin-Siris syndrome cases are localized in the middle of the gene (within or near functional domain: HAS, DEXDc, and HELICc) and are expected to exert a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect. SMARCA4 is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation.  Although pathogenic variants have been shown to alter transcriptional activation of development regulator genes (PMID: 23319608), the mechanism by which SMARCA4 pathogenic variants cause CSS is not clear. In summary, there is sufficient evidence to support a definitive gene-disease relationship between SMARCA4 and Coffin-Siris syndrome. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 06/17/20 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:61d29c73-9a30-4664-9df2-2f5831219221"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
