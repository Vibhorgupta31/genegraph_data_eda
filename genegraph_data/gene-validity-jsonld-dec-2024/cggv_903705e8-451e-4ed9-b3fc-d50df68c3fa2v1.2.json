Here, we describe a human syndrome featuring craniosynostosis, maxillary hypoplasia, delayed tooth eruption, and supernumerary teeth. We performed homozygosity mapping in three unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families and localized the syndrome to a region in chromosome 9. Mutational analysis of candidate genes in the region revealed that all affected children harbored homozygous missense mutations (c.662C>G [p.Pro221Arg], c.734C>G [p.Ser245Cys], or c.886C>T [p.Arg296Trp]) in IL11RA (encoding interleukin 11 receptor, alpha) on chromosome 9p13.3. In addition, a homozygous nonsense mutation, c.475C>T (p.Gln159X), and a homozygous duplication, c.916_924dup (p.Thr306_Ser308dup), were observed in two north European families. In cell-transfection experiments, the p.Arg296Trp mutation rendered the receptor unable to mediate the IL11 signal, indicating that the mutation causes loss of IL11RA function. We also observed disturbed cranial growth and suture activity in the Il11ra null mutant mice, in which reduced size and remodeling of limb bones has been previously described. We conclude that IL11 signaling is essential for the normal development of craniofacial bones and teeth and that its function is to restrict suture fusion and tooth number. The results open up the possibility of modulation of IL11 signaling for the treatment of craniosynostosis.","dc:creator":"Nieminen P","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Inactivation of IL11 signaling causes craniosynostosis, delayed tooth eruption, and supernumerary teeth."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:903705e8-451e-4ed9-b3fc-d50df68c3fa2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a2dd422-58a0-460b-af8b-4200aa2124f0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6a2dd422-58a0-460b-af8b-4200aa2124f0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d1107d32-5f83-44a0-8c06-d5d961612e41","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142784.3(IL11RA):c.907ACCTGGAGC[3] (p.Ser308_Pro309insThrTrpSer)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/30140"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"craniosynostosis; Papilloedema; sagittal synostosis; ADHD; increased digital markings/copper beating; metopic, cranial, and lambdoid craniosynostosis; hypertelorism, ridge of sagittal suture; flat forehead; maxillary hypoplasia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011330","obo:HP_0004443","obo:HP_0004442","obo:HP_0000327","obo:HP_0007018"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a3d76018-ca97-49a1-8c43-206b76265d1c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d1107d32-5f83-44a0-8c06-d5d961612e41"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21741611"},"rdfs:label":"7 year old male, Dutch origin, duplication"},{"id":"cggv:a3d76018-ca97-49a1-8c43-206b76265d1c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3d76018-ca97-49a1-8c43-206b76265d1c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6176d8a9-2147-46ac-83a1-a7145756b3d1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6176d8a9-2147-46ac-83a1-a7145756b3d1","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:3f3e1647-885d-4d89-bce4-5cd402d35043","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142784.3(IL11RA):c.598C>A (p.Pro200Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5036522"}},{"id":"cggv:be76ed31-8b8b-447d-8096-03ae435100d0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142784.3(IL11RA):c.710G>C (p.Arg237Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA373289722"}}],"phenotypeFreeText":"CRSDA; craniosynostosis; midface hypoplasia; mild exophthalmos; hypertelorism; edge-to-edge bite; mild developmental delay","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011800","obo:HP_0001363","obo:HP_0000316"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"cggv:cdcff5ec-31c4-4946-bf9c-7a87c4a00809_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3f3e1647-885d-4d89-bce4-5cd402d35043"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24498618","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have characterized a novel autosomal recessive Crouzon-like craniosynostosis syndrome in a 12-affected member family from Antakya, Turkey, the presenting features of which include: multiple suture synostosis, midface hypoplasia, variable degree of exophthalmos, relative prognathism, a beaked nose, and conductive hearing loss. Homozygosity mapping followed by targeted next-generation sequencing identified a c.479+6T>G mutation in the interleukin 11 receptor alpha gene (IL11RA) on chromosome 9p21. This donor splice-site mutation leads to a high percentage of aberrant IL11RA mRNA transcripts in an affected individual and altered mRNA splicing determined by in vitro exon trapping. An extended IL11RA mutation screen was performed in a cohort of 79 patients with an initial clinical diagnosis of Crouzon syndrome, pansynostosis, or unclassified syndromic craniosynostosis. We identified mutations segregating with the disease in five families: a German patient of Turkish origin and a Turkish family with three affected sibs all of whom were homozygous for the previously identified IL11RA c.479+6T>G mutation; a family with pansynostosis with compound heterozygous missense mutations, p.Pro200Thr and p.Arg237Pro; and two further Turkish families with Crouzon-like syndrome carrying the homozygous nonsense mutations p.Tyr232* and p.Arg292*. Using transient coexpression in HEK293T and COS7 cells, we demonstrated dramatically reduced IL11-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation for all mutations. Immunofluorescence analysis of mouse Il11ra demonstrated specific protein expression in cranial mesenchyme which was localized around the coronal suture tips and in the lambdoidal suture. In situ hybridization analysis of adult zebrafish also detected zfil11ra expression in the coronal suture between the overlapping frontal and parietal plates. This study demonstrates that mutations in the IL11RA gene cause an autosomal recessive Crouzon-like craniosynostosis.","dc:creator":"Keupp K","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutations in the interleukin receptor IL11RA cause autosomal recessive Crouzon-like craniosynostosis."}},{"id":"cggv:54bcad40-9646-4ea5-88ad-9c6439982db2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:be76ed31-8b8b-447d-8096-03ae435100d0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24498618"}],"rdfs:label":"p.Pro200Thr and p.Arg237Pro"},{"id":"cggv:cdcff5ec-31c4-4946-bf9c-7a87c4a00809","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cdcff5ec-31c4-4946-bf9c-7a87c4a00809_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cdcff5ec-31c4-4946-bf9c-7a87c4a00809_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The mutation dramatically decreased IL11-regulated STAT3 phosphorylation in HEK293T/COS7 cells."}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:54bcad40-9646-4ea5-88ad-9c6439982db2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54bcad40-9646-4ea5-88ad-9c6439982db2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:54bcad40-9646-4ea5-88ad-9c6439982db2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The mutation dramatically decreased IL11-regulated STAT3 phosphorylation in HEK293T/COS7 cells."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:98bda0d4-9caf-46b8-b83c-9570bf8a3e1c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:98bda0d4-9caf-46b8-b83c-9570bf8a3e1c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ebcbb8d0-22c3-4c7f-9787-2bbad294e84d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142784.3(IL11RA):c.662C>G (p.Pro221Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA128969"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"CRSDA;

This was done by in-situ hybridization in embryonic and early postnatal mice. In embryonic day 14 embryos, pretty uniform expression was evident in mesenchymal tissues. At day 17, the expression in mesenchymal cells was overall greater and particularly high in the dental papilla of the molar/incisor tooth germs. The osteogenic mesenchyme around the developing mandibular, maxillary, and calvarial bones had very high expression, yet the differentiated osteoblasts linked to the bone matrix were deficient in transcripts in all bones. During postnatal day 4, there was still strong expression in the dental papilla mesenchyme but less in the differentiated odontoblasts. There was lots of expression in the mesenchyme impacting the cranial and facial bones, especially in each studied suture, such as the midpalatal, frontal, and sagittal sutures. Expression of IL11RA was evident in the mesenchyme surrounding the osteogenic fronts of calvarial bones but decreased while the terminal differentiation of the osteoblasts happened.

(PMID: 21741611). Fifteen variants (missense, duplications, nonsense) that have been reported in over 15 probands in two publications (PMIDs: 21741611, 24498618) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (mice models, cell cultures, and expression level evidence; PMID: 21741611). Mice models and cell cultures with mutated/homozygous null Il11ra exhibit the phenotype of craniosynostosis with dental anomalies, and the gene has been shown to be expressed in areas of interest in mice. In summary, *IL11RA* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive craniosynostosis with dental anomalies (CRSDA). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniomalformations GCEP on the meeting date 4/20/2023 (SOP Version 9). \nThere is additional genetic evidence, noted in the slides for the curation presentation, but I just added the evidence required to reach 12 points.
