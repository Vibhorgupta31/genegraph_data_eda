We do not see significantly greater numbers of de novo missense mutations in affected versus unaffected children, but gene-disrupting mutations (nonsense, splice site, and frame shifts) are twice as frequent, 59 to 28. Based on this differential and the number of recurrent and total targets of gene disruption found in our and similar studies, we estimate between 350 and 400 autism susceptibility genes. Many of the disrupted genes in these studies are associated with theÂ fragile X protein, FMRP, reinforcing links between autism and synaptic plasticity. We find FMRP-associated genes are under greater purifying selection than the remainder of genes and suggest they are especially dosage-sensitive targets of cognitive disorders.","dc:creator":"Iossifov I","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"De novo gene disruptions in children on the autistic spectrum."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7250b506-97ab-49c9-9d7c-71c88003854e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:7250b506-97ab-49c9-9d7c-71c88003854e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8063,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d62d74b9-3a26-4714-a121-d4c565976ddc","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0800439","gene":"hgnc:16966","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*ZMYND11* was first reported in relation to autism in 2012 (Iossifov et al PMID:22542183), and in relation to an autosomal dominant syndromic complex disorder in 2014 (Coe et al PMID:25217958, Cobben et al PMID:25281490). Commonly reported features include developmental delay/intellectual disability, seizures, autistic behaviors, delayed speech and language development, behavioral issues (ADHD and aggressive behavior), dysmorphic facies (broad nose, thin lips, low set or posteriorly rotated ears, hypertelorism or deeply set eyes), and hand, foot, and digital abnormalities. Phenotypic features and severity are variable between probands. Twenty-five heterozygous predicted null, loss of function variants and 11 missense variants have been reported in 11 publications and are included in this curation (PMIDs: 34216016, 27626064, 22542183, 25217958, 25281490, 28933030, 32097528, 31337854, 38397245, 29158550, 35172867). The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is most likely haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship does not have supporting experimental evidence. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ZMYND11* and autosomal dominant syndromic complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on March 28, 2024 (SOP 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7250b506-97ab-49c9-9d7c-71c88003854e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
