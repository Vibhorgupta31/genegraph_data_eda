Our results show an important decrease in the levels of intact complex I in patients harboring mutations in nuclear-encoded complex I subunits, indicating that complex I assembly and/or stability is compromised.

By knocking down ND-18, the unique Drosophila ortholog of NDUFS4, an accessory subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), we developed and characterized several dNDUFS4 models that recapitulate key features of mitochondrial disease. Like in humans, the dNDUFS4 KD flies display severe feeding difficulties, an aspect of mitochondrial disorders that has so far been largely ignored in animal models. The impact of this finding, and an approach to overcome it, will be discussed in the context of interpreting disease model characterization and intervention studies.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.","dc:creator":"Foriel S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Feeding difficulties, a key feature of the Drosophila NDUFS4 mitochondrial disease model."},"rdfs:label":"NDUFS4 Fly knockdown"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Utilized model scoring system developed for Leigh syndrome experimental evidence"},{"id":"cggv:a86656ee-d2f9-4297-85e8-9f95cc75b47f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3da34f16-62d2-48a8-a2d0-76b35c9283a4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Model system demonstrated MRI findings consistent with human Leigh syndrome.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22653057","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy with gliosis in several brain regions that usually results in infantile death. Loss of murine Ndufs4, which encodes NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 4, results in compromised activity of mitochondrial complex I as well as progressive neurodegenerative and behavioral changes that resemble LS. Here, we report the development of breathing abnormalities in a murine model of LS. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense bilateral lesions in the dorsal brain stem vestibular nucleus (VN) and cerebellum of severely affected mice. The mutant mice manifested a progressive increase in apnea and had aberrant responses to hypoxia. Electrophysiological recordings within the ventral brain stem pre-Bötzinger respiratory complex were also abnormal. Selective inactivation of Ndufs4 in the VN, one of the principle sites of gliosis, also led to breathing abnormalities and premature death. Conversely, Ndufs4 restoration in the VN corrected breathing deficits and prolonged the life span of knockout mice. These data demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction within the VN results in aberrant regulation of respiration and contributes to the lethality of Ndufs4-knockout mice.","dc:creator":"Quintana A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Fatal breathing dysfunction in a mouse model of Leigh syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"NDUFS4 exon 2 knock out mouse (MRI findings)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Utilized model scoring system developed for Leigh syndrome experimental evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":446,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:3298d7f6-f9bd-44cd-9365-6d4ee4dcfd90","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:7711","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between NDUFS4 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 11, 2019. 18 articles were reviewed. NDUFS4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1998 (Van den Heuvel et al 1998 PMID: 9463323). At least 12 unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 6 publications (PMID 27079373, 14765537, 27671926, 24020637, 22326555, 12616398). This gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction, expression, alterations in patient cell lines, and animal models. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between NDUFS4 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. More than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 11, 2019 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1ed6ae7f-8c64-4ca3-a71b-6e97ae21d71d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
