By northern-blot analysis, we found that mouse Arfgef2 mRNA levels are highest during embryonic periods of ongoing neuronal proliferation and migration, and by in situ hybridization, we found that the mRNA is widely distributed throughout the embryonic central nervous system (CNS). ARFGEF2 encodes the large (>200 kDa) brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited GEF2 protein (BIG2), which is required for vesicle and membrane trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Inhibition of BIG2 by BFA, or by a dominant negative ARFGEF2 cDNA, decreases cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting a cell-autonomous regulation of neural expansion. Inhibition of BIG2 also disturbed the intracellular localization of such molecules as E-cadherin and beta-catenin by preventing their transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface.

Mutations in the vesicle transport ADP-ribosylation factor guanine exchange factor 2 gene (ARFGEF2) or the actin-binding Filamin A (FLNA) gene cause PH. Previous studies have shown that FLNA expression is developmentally regulated, with strongest expression observed along the ventricular zone (VZ) and to a lesser degree in postmitotic neurons in the cortex. Here we characterize the expression patterns for ARFGEF2 within the central nervous systems of human and mouse in order to better understand their potential roles in causing PH. ARFGEF2 mRNA was widely expressed in all cortical layers, especially in the neural precursors of the ventricular and subventricular zones (SVZ) during development, with persistent but diminished expression in adulthood. ARFGEF2 encodes for the protein brefeldin-inhibited guanine exchange factor 2 (BIG2). BIG2 protein immunoreactivity was most strongly localized to the neural progenitors along the neuroependymal lining of the VZ during development, with decreased expression in adulthood. Furthermore, overlapping BIG2 and FLNA expression was greatest in these same neuroependymal cells of human embryonic brain and was co-expressed in progenitors by Western blot. Finally, transfection of a dominant-negative construct of ARFGEF2 in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells partially blocked FLNA transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane. These results suggest that mutations in ARFGEF2 may impair targeted transport of FLNA to the cell surface within neural progenitors along the neuroependyma and that disruption of these cells could contribute to PH formation.","dc:creator":"Lu J","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Overlapping expression of ARFGEF2 and Filamin A in the neuroependymal lining of the lateral ventricles: insights into the cause of periventricular heterotopia."},"rdfs:label":"BIG2 and FLNA co-localization in neuroependymal progenitors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ad9cf19e-838e-4da1-a69a-73c29cc5c913","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2fca7b4-0275-49ed-98f4-74e3837008b3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"BIG2 and FLNA co-localization in neuroependymal progenitors; Immunohistochemistry conducted with double FLNA/BIG2 labeling on isolated neuroependymal progenitors from both mouse and human.

Common phenotypes for individuals with ARFGEF2 - periventricular heterotopia with microcephaly include progressive microcephaly, severe GDD/ID, hypotonia, spasticity, hyperkinetic movement disorder, epilepsy, failure to thrive, cardiomyopathy, corpus callosum thinning, and putamen T2 hyperintensity/atrophy. \n\nNine unique variants of different types (3 frameshift, 2 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 canonical splice site) reported in seven probands have been included in this curation (PMID:14647276, 19384555, 23755938, 23812912, 25160555, 26126837). The presumed mechanism is loss of function. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by functional alteration, protein interaction, and expression data (PMID:16320251, 14647276). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between ARFGEF2 and autosomal recessive periventricular heterotopia with microcephaly. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
