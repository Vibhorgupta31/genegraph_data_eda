A dominant-negative effect of this mutation is strongly suspected, since patients with TBL1XR1 deletion and other variants predicting loss of function do not share the same phenotype. We report two patients with typical Pierpont-like syndrome features. Exome sequencing allowed identifying a de novo heterozygous missense TBL1XR1 variant in both patients, different from those already reported: p.Cys325Tyr and p.Tyr446His.

Whole exome sequencing of the patient and her parents revealed a de novo TBL1XR1 mutation [c.209 G>A (p.Gly70Asp)] occurring at an evolutionarily conserved amino acid in an F-box-like domain.
