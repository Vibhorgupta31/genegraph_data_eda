Three unrelated PH1 patients, who possess a novel complex phenotype, are described. At the enzymological level, this phenotype is characterized by a complete, or nearly complete, absence of AGT catalytic activity and reduced AGT immunoreactivity. Unlike normal individuals in whom the AGT is confined to the peroxisomal matrix, the immunoreactive AGT in these three patients was distributed approximately equally between the peroxisomes and mitochondria. The peroxisomal AGT appeared to be aggregated into amorphous core-like structures in which no other peroxisomal enzymes could be identified. Mutational analysis of the AGT gene showed that two of the three patients were compound heterozygotes for two previously unrecognized point mutations which caused Gly41-->Arg and Phe152-->Iso amino acid substitutions. The third patient was shown to be a compound heterozygote for the Gly41-->Arg mutation and a previously recognized Gly170-->Arg mutation. All three patients were homozygous for the Pro11-->Leu polymorphism that had been found previously with a high allelic frequency in normal populations. It is suggested that the Phe152-->Iso and Gly170-->Arg substitutions, which are only eighteen residues apart and located in the same highly conserved internal region of 58 amino acids, might be involved in the inhibition of peroxisomal targeting and/or import of AGT and, in combination with the Pro11-->Leu polymorphism, be responsible for its aberrant mitochondrial compartmentalization. On the other hand, the Gly41-->Arg substitution, either in combination with the Pro11-->Leu polymorphism or by itself, is predicted to be responsible for the intraperoxisomal aggregation of the AGT protein.","dc:creator":"Danpure CJ","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Enzymological and mutational analysis of a complex primary hyperoxaluria type 1 phenotype involving alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase peroxisome-to-mitochondrion mistargeting and intraperoxisomal aggregation."}},{"id":"cggv:dd9d170c-afed-4e38-a629-e444f810954b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:72b675e6-6966-4ee2-a3f2-7da088bf8610"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8101040"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:dd9d170c-afed-4e38-a629-e444f810954b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd9d170c-afed-4e38-a629-e444f810954b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:dd9d170c-afed-4e38-a629-e444f810954b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Variant predicted to be responsible for interperoxisomal aggregation of AGXT protein either by itself or in conjunction with p.Pro11Leu (PMID: 8101040), Also shown to have 7% residual activity when expressed alone on the background of the major AGT allele (PMID: 10960483)"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Parents confirmed heterozygous (parent 1a carrying c.121G>A and parent 1b carrying c.576T>A), both patient and parents were also homozygous for c.32C>T (p.Pro11Leu) p.Gly41Arg on major allele, gnomAD frequency = 0.00001213"},{"id":"cggv:c36ca582-d48c-40e8-bac6-7f60fa1d6ea8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c36ca582-d48c-40e8-bac6-7f60fa1d6ea8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:c36ca582-d48c-40e8-bac6-7f60fa1d6ea8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Variant predicted to be responsible for interperoxisomal aggregation of AGXT protein either by itself or in conjunction with p.Pro11Leu (PMID: 8101040), Also shown to have 7% residual activity when expressed alone on the background of the major AGT allele (PMID: 10960483)"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Parents confirmed heterozygous (parent 1a carrying c.121G>A and parent 1b carrying c.576T>A), both patient and parents were also homozygous for c.32C>T (p.Pro11Leu) p.Gly41Arg on major allele, gnomAD frequency = 0.00001213.p.Phe152Ile on minor allele, gnomAD frequency = 0.00008271"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:650401ef-1fd3-4f56-8bd6-84acf505b517_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:650401ef-1fd3-4f56-8bd6-84acf505b517","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":18,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f4b58d0b-6f21-47b4-816e-b8cc1a565646","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000030.3(AGXT):c.733_734del (p.Lys245ValfsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915940274"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequence analyses of AGXT gene were performed by using 25 ng PCR product, 3 pmol primer and BigDye Terminator","phenotypeFreeText":"bilateral nephrocalcinosis;

Pathogenic mutations of AGXT were mostly reported in Caucasian but infrequently in Asian, especially in Chinese. To update the genotypes of PH1 in the Chinese population, we collected and identified 7 Chinese probands with PH1 from 2013 to 2017 in our center, five of whom had delayed diagnosis and failed in kidney transplantation. Samples of peripheral blood DNA from the 7 patients and their family members were collected and sequencing analysis was performed to test the mutations of gene AGXT. Western blotting and enzyme activity analysis were conducted to evaluate the function of the mutations. Furthermore, a systematic review from 1998 to 2017 was performed to observe the genetic characteristics between Chinese and Caucasian. The results showed that a total of 12 mutations were identified in the 7 pedigrees. To the best of our knowledge, 2 novel variants of AGXT, p.Gly41Trp and p.Leu33Met, were first reported. Bioinformatics and functional analysis showed that only 7 mutations led to a reduced expression of alanine-glyoxylate amino transferase (AGT) at a protein level. The systematic review revealed significant population heterogeneity in PH1. In conclusion, new genetic subtypes and genetic characteristics of PH1 are updated in the Chinese population. Furthermore, a genotype-phenotype correlation is found in PH1.","dc:creator":"Du DF","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Updated Genetic Testing of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 in a Chinese Population: Results from a Single Center Study and a Systematic Review."}},{"id":"cggv:0f7a63ac-6955-48f4-85bd-d1438852bc1e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8506797b-7006-46cc-87bb-4c2f0554b194"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30341509"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient V-3"},{"id":"cggv:9db9c84b-84ce-40fb-81f8-b7c5a824294a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9db9c84b-84ce-40fb-81f8-b7c5a824294a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9db9c84b-84ce-40fb-81f8-b7c5a824294a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Western blot showed variant resulted in 100% loss of AGT protein expression (Fig. 2) and mass spec showed 100% loss of protein activity"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Scored as zero due to no evidence of variants being in trans. p.Lys12fs: stated to be heterozygous, absent from gnomAD,"},{"id":"cggv:0f7a63ac-6955-48f4-85bd-d1438852bc1e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f7a63ac-6955-48f4-85bd-d1438852bc1e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0f7a63ac-6955-48f4-85bd-d1438852bc1e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Western blot showed variant resulted in 16.7% expression of AGXT protein compared to WT (Fig. 2) and mass spec showed variant resulted in partial loss of protein activity (Fig. 3)"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Scored as zero due to no evidence of variants being in trans. p.Arg360Gln: stated to be heterozygous, gnomAD = 0.000005914"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:07c4b1c0-fc97-48c1-8b29-0d315953a546_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:07c4b1c0-fc97-48c1-8b29-0d315953a546","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:4743300f-b8b4-4de0-9fda-81351ce59ca6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000030.3(AGXT):c.302T>C (p.Leu101Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/188866"}},"detectionMethod":"genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood, entire AGXT coding sequence PCR amplified, Sanger sequencing; both parents and unaffected sibling also tested","phenotypeFreeText":"at exam: weight = 5Kg, head circumference = 38.6cm, length = 60cm.

In cases in which no mutation was identified, linkage analysis can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis in other siblings. We present a family in which a sibling of the index case predicted to have primary hyperoxaluria type 1 by means of linkage analysis failed to show hyperoxaluria during the following 7 years, putting the diagnosis into question. Whole-gene sequence analysis identified 2 causative mutations in the index case, of which only 1, c.646A (Gly216Arg), was inherited. The other sequence change, c.33_34insC, was a de novo mutation occurring on the paternal allele. This particular mutation is a relatively common cause of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. It occurs in a run of 8 cytosines and therefore potentially is susceptible to polymerase slippage. This case illustrates 2 important points. First, biochemical confirmation of a genetic diagnosis should always be made in siblings diagnosed by using genetic tests. Second, de novo mutations should be considered as a potential, albeit rare, cause of primary hyperoxaluria type 1.","dc:creator":"Williams EL","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"A de novo mutation in the AGXT gene causing primary hyperoxaluria type 1."}},{"id":"cggv:c5726775-efd5-400e-a935-59c9b98a1afd_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f34451f8-1c6e-4567-ad23-2feab877a79f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16931222"}],"rdfs:label":"II-1"},{"id":"cggv:c5726775-efd5-400e-a935-59c9b98a1afd","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c5726775-efd5-400e-a935-59c9b98a1afd_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Both parents tested: Mother heterozygous for p.Gly216Arg (gnomAD frequency = 0.000003982), c.33dup (absent in gnomAD) absent in father (paternity confirmed via microsatellite) therefore variant was asserted to be de novo on the paternal allele in the proband"},{"id":"cggv:8c3037c0-fcf2-433e-aa31-c30eb65aeff8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c3037c0-fcf2-433e-aa31-c30eb65aeff8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Both parents tested: Mother heterozygous for p.Gly216Arg (gnomAD frequency = 0.000003982), c.33dup (absent in gnomAD) absent in father (paternity confirmed via microsatellite) therefore variant was asserted to be de novo on the paternal allele in the proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:51169a04-5b8b-4977-8906-3f2bc6958006_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:51169a04-5b8b-4977-8906-3f2bc6958006","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":27,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d2f8c610-784b-426c-83d3-aaf0badbc3a8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000030.3(AGXT):c.245G>A (p.Gly82Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/5643"}},"detectionMethod":"first strand cDNA synthesized from total liver RNA from patient to be used as template for PCR of the coding region of AGXT cDNA, PCR product cloned into pBluescript and was sequenced and compared to normal AGT, exon 2 of AGXT was amplified via PCR and sequenced from 14 clones from 2 amplifications to confirm variant (Fig. 2b)","phenotypeFreeText":"AGT enzymatic activity <2% of mean normal level, normal amount of immunoreactive AGT protein, Northern blot showed presence of normal molecular weight and abundance of AGXT mRNA","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c4ebd5ff-1b6e-4d7f-ac24-ebc305966b5b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d2f8c610-784b-426c-83d3-aaf0badbc3a8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1349575","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We have synthesized and sequenced alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT; HGMW-approved symbol for the gene--AGXT) cDNA from the liver of a primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) patient who had normal levels of hepatic peroxisomal immunoreactive AGT protein, but no AGT catalytic activity. This revealed the presence of a single point mutation (G----A at cDNA nucleotide 367), which is predicted to cause a glycine-to-glutamate substitution at residue 82 of the AGT protein. This mutation is located in exon 2 of the AGT gene and leads to the loss of an AvaI restriction site. Exon 2-specific PCR followed by AvaI digestion showed that this patient was homozygous for this mutation. In addition, three other PH1 patients, one related to and two unrelated to, but with enzymological phenotype similar to that of the first patient, were also shown to be homozygous for the mutation. However, one other phenotypically similar PH1 patient was shown to lack this mutation.

At least 28 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Summary of Case Level and Experimental Data: 16.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 26383609, 8101040, 30341509, 27915025, 27659337, 2039493, 1349575, 18810341, 16931222).\nVariants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. The gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies. In summary, *AGXT* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8460f17d-4d94-4a0c-ac46-41c86ce32e83"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
