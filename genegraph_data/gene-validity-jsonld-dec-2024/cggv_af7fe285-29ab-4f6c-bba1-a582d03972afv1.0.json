Though acellular, nonvital, and without capacity for turnover or repair, it can nevertheless last a lifetime. Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a collective term for failure of normal enamel development, covering diverse clinical phenotypes that typically show Mendelian inheritance patterns. One subset, known as hypomaturation AI, is characterised by near-normal volumes of organic enamel matrix but with weak, creamy-brown opaque enamel that fails prematurely after tooth eruption. Mutations in genes critical to enamel matrix formation have been documented, but current understanding of other key events in enamel biomineralization is limited. We investigated autosomal-recessive hypomaturation AI in a consanguineous Pakistani family. A whole-genome SNP autozygosity screen identified a locus on chromosome 15q21.3. Sequencing candidate genes revealed a point mutation in the poorly characterized WDR72 gene. Screening of WDR72 in a panel of nine additional hypomaturation AI families revealed the same mutation in a second, apparently unrelated, Pakistani family and two further nonsense mutations in Omani families. Immunohistochemistry confirmed intracellular localization in maturation-stage ameloblasts. WDR72 function is unknown, but as a putative beta propeller is expected to be a scaffold for protein-protein interactions. The nearest homolog, WDR7, is involved in vesicle mobilization and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis at synapses. Vesicle trafficking is important in maturation-stage ameloblasts with respect to secretion into immature enamel and removal of cleaved enamel matrix proteins via endocytosis. This raises the intriguing possibility that WDR72 is critical to ameloblast vesicle turnover during enamel maturation.","dc:creator":"El-Sayed W","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in the beta propeller WDR72 cause autosomal-recessive hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af7fe285-29ab-4f6c-bba1-a582d03972af_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af7fe285-29ab-4f6c-bba1-a582d03972af_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72a92967-9d56-4ad6-833a-d0cd3216481a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a71fcbc-0365-43dd-8df0-947d052c57eb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Hypomineralised teeth ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26247047","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Defects in WDR72 (WD repeat-containing protein 72) cause autosomal recessive hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta. We generated and characterized Wdr72-knockout/lacZ-knockin mice to investigate the role of WDR72 in enamel formation. In all analyses, enamel formed by Wdr72 heterozygous mice was indistinguishable from wild-type enamel. Without WDR72, enamel mineral density increased early during the maturation stage but soon arrested. The null enamel layer was only a tenth as hard as wild-type enamel and underwent rapid attrition following eruption. Despite the failure to further mineralize enamel deposited during the secretory stage, ectopic mineral formed on the enamel surface and penetrated into the overlying soft tissue. While the proteins in the enamel matrix were successfully degraded, the digestion products remained inside the enamel. Interactome analysis of WDR72 protein revealed potential interactions with clathrin-associated proteins and involvement in ameloblastic endocytosis. The maturation stage mandibular incisor enamel did not stain with methyl red, indicating that the enamel did not acidify beneath ruffle-ended ameloblasts. Attachment of maturation ameloblasts to the enamel layer was weakened, and SLC24A4, a critical ameloblast calcium transporter, did not localize appropriately along the ameloblast distal membrane. Fewer blood vessels were observed in the papillary layer supporting ameloblasts. Specific WDR72 expression by maturation stage ameloblasts explained the observation that enamel thickness and rod decussation (established during the secretory stage) are normal in the Wdr72 null mice. We conclude that WDR72 serves critical functions specifically during the maturation stage of amelogenesis and is required for both protein removal and enamel mineralization.

The hypomaturation enamel phenotype has been described for mutations involved in the later stage of enamel formation, including Klk4, Mmp20, C4orf26, and Wdr72. Using a candidate gene approach we discovered a novel Wdr72 human mutation in association with AI to be a 5-base pair deletion (c.806_810delGGCAG; p.G255VfsX294). To gain insight into the function of WDR72, we used computer modeling of the full-length human WDR72 protein structure and found that the predicted N-terminal sequence forms two beta-propeller folds with an alpha-solenoid tail at the C-terminus. This domain iteration is characteristic of vesicle coat proteins, such as beta'-COP, suggesting a role for WDR72 in the formation of membrane deformation complexes to regulate intracellular trafficking. Our Wdr72 knockout mouse model (Wdr72(-/-)), containing a LacZ reporter knock-in, exhibited hypomineralized enamel similar to the AI phenotype observed in humans with Wdr72 mutations. MicroCT scans of Wdr72(-/-) mandibles affirmed the hypomineralized enamel phenotype occurring at the onset of the maturation stage. H&E staining revealed a shortened height phenotype in the Wdr72(-/-) ameloblasts with retained proteins in the enamel matrix during maturation stage. H(+)/Cl(-) exchange transporter 5 (CLC5), an early endosome acidifier, was co-localized with WDR72 in maturation-stage ameloblasts and decreased in Wdr72(-/-) maturation-stage ameloblasts. There were no obvious differences in RAB4A and LAMP1 immunostaining of Wdr72(-/-) mice as compared to wildtype controls. Moreover, Wdr72(-/-) ameloblasts had reduced amelogenin immunoreactivity, suggesting defects in amelogenin fragment resorption from the matrix. These data demonstrate that WDR72 has a major role in enamel mineralization, most notably during the maturation stage, and suggest a function involving endocytic vesicle trafficking, possibly in the removal of amelogenin proteins.

Accordingly, we performed whole exome sequencing and genetic studies of the members of a family with autosomal recessive dRTA of an unknown genetic etiology. Here, we report compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in tryptophan-aspartate repeat domain 72 (WDR72) (c.1777A>G [p.R593G] and c.2522T>A [p.L841Q]) in three affected siblings of a family with dRTA.

Homologous modeling and in silico mutagenesis indicated that R593G and L841Q alter the H-bond formations in the nearby residues, affecting the WDR72 protein structure. All these evidences indicate that the identified WDR72 variations were probably to have caused hereditary dRTA in the reported family. In addition, homozygous nonsense mutation (c.2686C>T [p.R896X]) was identified in another family, strongly supporting the causal role of WDR72 in dRTA.

This protein is important in vesicle trafficking in enamel-producing ameloblasts that control the ionic and organic composition of enamel, and is also involved in the localisation of the Ca transporter, SLC24A4 (mutations in which also cause amelogenesis imperfecta) to the ameloblast cell membrane. WDR72 is also expressed in both the proximal and distal tubular cells of the kidneys. \n*WDR72* mutation was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive amelogenesis imperfecta in 2009 (El-Sayed PMID: 19853237), and in relation to autosomal recessive amelogenesis imperfecta with distal renal tubular acidosis in 2018 (Rungroj PMID:30028003). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern, and noted phenotypic overlap. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Amelogenesis imperfecta, type IIA3 (OMIM: 613211) and Amelogenesis imperfecta with distal renal tubular acidosis (no OMIM record). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘Amelogenesis imperfecta with or without distal renal tubular acidosis - *WDR72*’.\nMany variants have been reported in *WDR72* including mainly null variants, but also missense changes, in many publications and public databases. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) was reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including expression data and a knockout mouse model.\nIn summary, *WDR72* is definitively associated with Amelogenesis imperfecta with or without distal renal tubular acidosis. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic setting, and has been upheld over time.
