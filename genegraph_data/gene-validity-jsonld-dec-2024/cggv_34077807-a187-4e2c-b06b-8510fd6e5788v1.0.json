During embryogenesis, parts of the heart and craniofacial muscles arise from pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) progenitors. Here, we reveal a hierarchical regulatory network of a set of transcription factors expressed in the PM that initiates heart and craniofacial organogenesis. Genetic perturbation of this network in mice resulted in heart and craniofacial muscle defects, revealing robust cross-regulation between its members. We identified Lhx2 as a previously undescribed player during cardiac and pharyngeal muscle development. Lhx2 and Tcf21 genetically interact with Tbx1, the major determinant in the etiology of DiGeorge/velo-cardio-facial/22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Furthermore, knockout of these genes in the mouse recapitulates specific cardiac features of this syndrome. We suggest that PM-derived cardiogenesis and myogenesis are network properties rather than properties specific to individual PM members. These findings shed new light on the developmental underpinnings of congenital defects.","dc:creator":"Harel I","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Pharyngeal mesoderm regulatory network controls cardiac and head muscle morphogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"TCF21 knockout mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":9167,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":2,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5c8a7d8e-2853-4ed6-98c8-93a727b6e8df","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:11632","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000005"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*TCF21* was first reported in relation to congenital heart disease in 2017 (Yang Liping et al., PMID: 28346832). One single genotype analysis of rs12190287 case control is included in this curation (PMID: 28346832). However, this case control was not scored due to the variant being relatively frequent in the population. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model (PMID: 23112163). No evidence for a causal role for *TCF21* in congenital heart disease has been reported. Although this gene-disease relationship is supported by a mouse model, no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans.
