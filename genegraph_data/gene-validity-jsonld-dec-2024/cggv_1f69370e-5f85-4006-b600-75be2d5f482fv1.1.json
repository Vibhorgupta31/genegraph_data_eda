Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in thrombopoietin (THPO, c.112C>T) in both affected siblings. This mutation encodes an arginine to cysteine substitution at residue 38 or residue 17 excluding the 21-amino acid signal peptide of THPO receptor binding domain (RBD). THPO has 4 conserved cysteines in its RBD that form 2 disulfide bonds. Our in silico modeling predicts that introduction of a fifth cysteine may disrupt normal disulfide bonding to cause poor receptor binding. In functional assays, the mutant-THPO-containing media shows two- to threefold reduced ability to sustain UT7-TPO cells, which require THPO for proliferation. Both parents and a sibling with heterozygous R17C change have reduced platelet counts, whereas a sibling with wild-type sequence has normal platelet count. Thus, the R17C partial loss-of-function allele results in aplastic anemia in the homozygous state and mild thrombocytopenia in the heterozygous state in our family. Together with the recent identification of THPO receptor (MPL) mutations and the effects of THPO agonists in aplastic anemia, our results have clinical implications in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with aplastic anemia and highlight a role for the THPO-MPL pathway in hematopoiesis in vivo.

However, studies have also shown that the extracellular domain of Mpl (Mpl-EC) interacts with human (h) NUDC, a protein previously characterized as a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein. This study was undertaken to further delineate the putative binding domain on the Mpl receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that within the Mpl-EC domain 1 (Mpl-EC-D1), amino acids 102-251 were strongly involved in ligand binding. We subsequently expressed five subdomains within this region with T7 phage display. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays identified a short stretch of peptide located between residues 206 and 251 as the minimum binding domain for both TPO and hNUDC. A series of sequential Ala replacement mutations in the region were subsequently used to identify the specific residues most involved in ligand binding. Our results point to two hydrophobic residues, Leu(228) and Leu(230), as having substantial effects on hNUDC binding. For TPO binding, mutations in residues Asp(235) and Leu(239) had the largest effect on binding efficacy. In addition, deletion of the conservative motif WGSWS reduced binding capacity for hNUDC but not for TPO. These separate binding sites on the Mpl receptor for TPO and hNUDC raise interesting implications for the cytokine-receptor interactions.","dc:creator":"Chen WM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Identification of the residues in the extracellular domain of thrombopoietin receptor involved in the binding of thrombopoietin and a nuclear distribution protein (human NUDC)."},"rdfs:label":"Chen_Interaction with MPL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:d6b37c2c-fc03-4ee1-9816-09daaa8b154c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f172055-02fd-4846-8f23-e3569e85d56b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"THPO is directly involved in thrombopoiesis and loss of function variants in THPO lead to decrease in platelet counts.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23594368","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Megakaryocytopoiesis involves the commitment of haematopoietic stem cells, proliferation and terminal differentiation of megakaryocytic progenitors (MK-p) and maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs) to produce functional platelets. This complex process occurs in specialized niches in the bone marrow where MKs align adjacent to vascular endothelial cells, form proplatelet projections and release platelets into the circulation. Thrombopoietin (THPO, TPO) is the primary growth factor for the MK lineage and necessary at all stages of development. THPO is constitutively produced in the liver, and binds to MPL (c-Mpl) receptor on platelets and MKs. This activates a cascade of signalling molecules, which induce transcription factors to drive MK development and thrombopoiesis. Decreased turnover rate and platelet number result in increased levels of free THPO, which induces a concentration-dependent compensatory response of marrow-MKs to enhance platelet production. Newly developed thrombopoietic agents operating via MPL receptor facilitate platelet production in thrombocytopenic states, primarily immune thrombocytopenia. Other drugs are available for attenuating malignant thrombocytosis.

The disease mechanism is loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidence (case-level data) and experimental evidence (biochemical functions, protein interaction and animal model).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 4.4 points: Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 29191945, 24085763, 28559357). Five additional individuals from two publications (PMIDs: 28466964, 32150607) have been noted to have monoallelic loss of function variants. These individuals have been added to this gene-disease record, but not scored. The H/T GCEP is aware that there is published (5 cases) and unpublished (at least one individual with heterozygous nonsense variant, along with GFI1b C168F variant) evidence to suggest that there may be a semi-dominant mode of inheritance for the thrombocytopneia phenotype caused by *THPO* variants as heterozygous carrier relatives of probands with homozygous alterations also display reduced platelet counts (PMIDs: 24085763, 29191945); however, there has not been overwhelming evidence at this time to confirm that *THPO*-associated thrombocytopenia is indeed inherited in a semi-dominant manner. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 3.5 points: This gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays. *THPO* is involved in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, and loss of function variants in *THPO* lead to decrease in platelet counts (PMID: 23594368). Chen et al. showed that *THPO* physically interacts with MPL. (PMID: 20529857). A knock-out mouse model was generated by Sauvage et al, wherein homozygous KO mice recapitulated the thrombocytopenia phenotype while the heterozygous mice showed a significant reduction in platelet counts (PMID: 8627177)\n\nIn summary, the level of evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *THPO* and autosomal recessive congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on March 24, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1f69370e-5f85-4006-b600-75be2d5f482f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
