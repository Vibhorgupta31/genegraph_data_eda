We recently reported on a family with autosomal-recessive mental retardation with anterior maxillary protrusion and strabismus (MRAMS) syndrome. One of the reported patients with ID did not have dysmorphic features but did have temporal lobe epilepsy and psychosis. We report on the identification of a truncating mutation in the SOBP that is responsible for causing both syndromic and nonsyndromic ID in the same family. The protein encoded by the SOBP, sine oculis binding protein ortholog, is a nuclear zinc finger protein. In mice, Sobp (also known as Jxc1) is critical for patterning of the organ of Corti; one of our patients has a subclinical cochlear hearing loss but no gross cochlear abnormalities. In situ RNA expression studies in postnatal mouse brain showed strong expression in the limbic system at the time interval of active synaptogenesis. The limbic system regulates learning, memory, and affective behavior, but limbic circuitry expression of other genes mutated in ID is unusual. By comparing the protein content of the +/jc to jc/jc mice brains with the use of proteomics, we detected 24 proteins with greater than 1.5-fold differences in expression, including two interacting proteins, dynamin and pacsin1. This study shows mutated SOBP involvement in syndromic and nonsyndromic ID with psychosis in humans.","dc:creator":"Birk E","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"SOBP is mutated in syndromic and nonsyndromic intellectual disability and is highly expressed in the brain limbic system."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:b603cec3-6d79-449a-964d-31715ccfe3af_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b603cec3-6d79-449a-964d-31715ccfe3af","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"cggv:e33ee5c8-4e79-445b-b3d7-24fab1154615","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018013.4(SOBP):c.1981C>T (p.Arg661Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA113783"}},"detectionMethod":"SNP genotyping using Affymetrix Human Mapping","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001388","obo:HP_0011095","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0001249"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Molecular testing for fragile X syndrome, G-banded karyotype, and FISH analysis for subtelomeric rearrangements also gave normal results.

Affected individuals in this family exhibited intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and strabismus. The condition was referred to by the authors as MRAMS syndrome (for mental retardation, anterior maxillary protrusion, and strabismus, OMIM: 613671) (Vanagaite et al., PMID: 17618476). Given the phenotypic variability of the syndromic neurodevelopmental features of affected individuals, we opted to curate this gene for “syndromic intellectual disability” and disease entities related to SOBP variants have been lumped into one disease entity.\nAt this time, a single nonsense variant has been reported in one proband (PMID: 21035105). This variant segregated with disease in six additional family members. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Expert Panel on October 18, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
