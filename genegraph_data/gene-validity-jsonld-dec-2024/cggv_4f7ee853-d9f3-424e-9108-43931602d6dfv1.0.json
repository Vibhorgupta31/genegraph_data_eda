Transporters associated with antigen presentation (TAP) are thought to be responsible for conveying intracellular peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for complex formation with class I MHC and subsequent recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In this study, we evaluated 79 human solid tumours and cell lines for genetic abnormalities in TAP1 that might have led to an acquired loss of antigen presenting ability. A novel sequence (R659Q) was discovered near the ATP binding site in a human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line, H1436. This cell line is heterozygous for this allele, but only the R659Q allele is transcribed into RNA. Even though the R659Q protein is expressed, these cells act as if they were TAP deficient by peptide binding and antigen presentation studies, which are restored after transfection of a functional TAP1 allele. This is the first evidence for a naturally occuring protein structural defect resulting in defective peptide transport in a human solid tumour.","dc:creator":"Chen HL","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"A functionally defective allele of TAP1 results in loss of MHC class I antigen presentation in a human lung cancer."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f7ee853-d9f3-424e-9108-43931602d6df_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f7ee853-d9f3-424e-9108-43931602d6df_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f3f5d840-d369-48a5-b0fc-fdcb9c6f92d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:52b471e4-d4a5-4047-b418-f7455f948d1c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Following IL-2, IL-12 and IL-15 stimulation for 3 days, neither NK nor LAK activity against targets lacking class I molecules was induced, suggesting defective recognition of class 1 deficient target cells.

In this study, we investigated the HLA class I-recognizing NK receptor expressions and the NK and LAK activities of the lymphocytes of a TAP1-deficient patient. The patient had a normal number of NK cells. Although the lymphocytes showed LAK activity against class I expressing targets following IL-2, IL-12 and IL-15 stimulation for 3 days, neither NK nor LAK activity against targets lacking class I molecules was induced. The NK cells of the patient expressed class I-recognizing NK receptors, although the percentages of such cells were low. However, no differences were observed in the expression levels of inhibitory and activating NK receptors between lymphocytes of the patient and those of healthy controls, suggesting that the modulation of the NK receptor expression is not primarily responsible for this tolerance. These results also suggest that the lymphocytes of the patient are defective in the recognition of class I-deficient target cells in order to promote the induction of self tolerance.","dc:creator":"Furukawa H","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Tolerance of NK and LAK activity for HLA class I-deficient targets in a TAP1-deficient patient (bare lymphocyte syndrome type I)."},"rdfs:label":"defective recognition of class I-deficient target cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:893cdb31-9084-448e-841c-01e1ab4cfc6d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f35f430-c80a-40c3-82a7-b31a6c7f6c92","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"This study examined the maturation and assembly of HLA class I molecules in cell lines derived from the patients.

An absence of sialyation indicates that HLA class I molecules cannot reach the distal Golgi compartments and must therefore be blocked in upstream compartments. HLA class I–deficient cells, the quantity of labeled HLA class I molecules decreased during the 4 hours of chase and a barely detectable number (if any; the faint band seen may have been an artifact) of the heavy chains became Endo H–resistant.

In the present study, we analyzed two cases displaying not only the typical lung syndrome of HLA class I deficiency but also skin lesions, and found these patients to be TAP1-deficient. This defect leads to unstable HLA class I molecules and their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the absence of TAP1 is compatible with life and does not seem to result in higher susceptibility to viral infections than TAP2 deficiency.

This condition is characterized by chronic upper and lower respiratory bacterial infections, chronic sinusitis, and ulcerating granulomatous skin disease in some cases. Affected individuals typically have normal immunoglobulins, low CD8+ alpha-beta T cells, and activation of natural killer and CD8+ gamma-delta T-cells. Seven variants (nonsense and frameshift) that have been reported in 7 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 30189467, 28161407, 18668571, 16624613, 16299152, 10074495) are included in this curation. Variants segregated with disease in three families (PMIDs: 16624613, 28161407, 16299152). Heterozygous parents were unaffected. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models, in vitro functional assays, and rescue in patient cells.) (PMIDs: 9952025, 10074495, 11118151). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TAP1 and autosomal recessive MHC class I deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date [July 20, 2023] (SOP Version [9]).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4f7ee853-d9f3-424e-9108-43931602d6df"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
