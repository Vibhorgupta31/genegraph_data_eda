muscular atrophies (SMAs) are a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular diseases characterized by loss of motor neurons, muscle weakness, hypotonia and muscle atrophy, with different modes of inheritance; however, the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene is predominantly involved. The aims of the current study were to clarify the genetic basis of SMA and determine the mutation spectrum of SMN1 and other associated genes, in order to provide molecular information for more accurate diagnosis and future prospects for treatment. We performed a comprehensive analysis of 5q SMA in 1765 individuals including 528 patients from 432 unrelated families with at least one child with suspected clinical presentation of SMA. Copy number variations of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes and linkage analysis were performed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and short tandem repeat (STR) markers linked to the SMN1 gene. Cases without mutation in the SMA locus on 5q were analyzed for the DNAJB2, IGHMBP2, SIGMAR1 and PLEKHG5 genes using linked STR markers. Sanger sequencing of whole genes was performed for cases with homozygous haplotypes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome analysis was conducted for some of the remaining cases. Mutations in the SMN1 gene were identified in 287 (66.43%) families including 269 patients (62.26%) with homozygous deletion of the entire SMN1 gene. Only one of the patients had a homozygous point mutation in the SMN1 gene. Among the remaining families, three families showed mutations in either the DNAJB2, SIGMAR1 or PLEKHG5 genes, which were linked using STR analysis and Sanger sequencing. From 10 families who underwent WGS, we found six homozygous point mutations in six families for either the TNNT1, TPM3, TTN, SACS or COL6A2 genes. Two mutations in the PLA2G6 gene were also found in another patient as compound heterozygous. This rather large cohort allowed us to identify genotype patterns in Iranian 5q SMA patients. The process of identifying 11 mutations (9 novel) in 9 different genes among non-5q SMA patients shows the diversity of genes involved in non-5q SMA in Iranians. Genotyping of patients with SMA is essential for prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and may be very helpful for guiding treatment, with the advent of new, more effective, albeit very expensive, therapies. Also, combining linkage analysis was shown to be beneficial in many ways, including sample authenticity and segregation analysis, and for ruling out maternal cell contamination during prenatal diagnosis (PND).","dc:creator":"Sharifi Z","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Comprehensive Mutation Analysis and Report of 12 Novel Mutations in a Cohort of Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Iran."}},"rdfs:label":"V.1"},{"id":"cggv:9fa3f31b-89be-47f8-b61f-1d0da23ed5eb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9fa3f31b-89be-47f8-b61f-1d0da23ed5eb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9fa3f31b-89be-47f8-b61f-1d0da23ed5eb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Recurrent variant in different population, functional evidence (patient fibroblasts) provided in other paper (PMID: 25274842)"}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f17cca3e-c53b-479b-9f3d-c8f5b8c3deae_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f17cca3e-c53b-479b-9f3d-c8f5b8c3deae","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":19,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3d404566-4013-413f-95f0-f8503230fc4b"},"detectionMethod":"Patients and Methods section of article ","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002936","obo:HP_0001288","obo:HP_0009027","obo:HP_0001284","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0000007"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:95f8caa9-a81e-4320-b386-c1eccd18ffad_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3d404566-4013-413f-95f0-f8503230fc4b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27083531"},"rdfs:label":"II.4"},{"id":"cggv:95f8caa9-a81e-4320-b386-c1eccd18ffad","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95f8caa9-a81e-4320-b386-c1eccd18ffad_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Recurrent variant, reported several times in the same population (Spain)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5b25884f-ef21-4032-af37-27f4280578fb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b25884f-ef21-4032-af37-27f4280578fb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":20,"allele":{"id":"cggv:3d404566-4013-413f-95f0-f8503230fc4b"},"detectionMethod":"Haplotyping to a shared homozygous region with subsequent Sanger sequencing of 9 selected genes in the 7.6Mb region.

After performing homozygosity mapping and whole genome sequencing, we identified a 3.8 kb deletion, spanning the entire DnaJ domain of the HSJ1 protein, as the disease-segregating mutation. By performing functional assays, we showed that HSJ1b-related DnaJ domain deletion leads to loss of HSJ1b mRNA and protein levels, increased HSJ1a mRNA and protein expressions, increased cell death, protein aggregation, and enhanced autophagy. Given the role of HSJ1 proteins in the degradation of misfolded proteins, we speculated that enhanced autophagy might be promoted by the elevated HSJ1a expression seen in HSJ1b-deficient cells. We also observed a significant reduction in both tau and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, which may explain the dopaminergic deficits seen in one of the affected siblings. We concluded that HSJ1b deficiency leads to a complex neurological phenotype, possibly due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, caused by the lack of the DnaJ domain activity. We thus expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrums associated with DNAJB2 disease and suggest relevant disease-associated mechanisms.","dc:creator":"Sanchez

nervous system, has been recently reported to be up-regulated in human skeletal muscle during its recovery from damage. Here we identified DNAJB2 expression in regenerating fibers in skeletal muscles of the dystrophic mdx mouse and patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Surprisingly, in both dystrophic and control mice and patients, DNAJB2 was also expressed in non-regenerating fibers at the postsynaptic side of the neuromuscular junction. DNAJB2 functions as an adaptor molecule for the evacuation and degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and overexpression of DNAJB2 in models of the neurodegenerative disease spinobulbar muscular atrophy was shown to result in the reduction of protein inclusions. We therefore studied the possible relation of DNAJB2 expression to protein inclusion formation in skeletal muscle in biopsies of several muscle pathologies associated with protein aggregation and found in all of them a strong immunoreactivity with anti-DNAJB2 in aggregates and vacuoles. We conclude that DNAJB2 is expressed in mouse and human skeletal muscle at the neuromuscular junction of normal fibers, in the cytoplasm and membrane of regenerating fibers, and in protein aggregates and vacuoles in protein aggregate myopathies. Therefore, we propose a role for DNAJB2 in protein turnover processes in skeletal muscle.","dc:creator":"Claeys KG","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"DNAJB2 expression in normal and diseased human and mouse skeletal muscle."},"rdfs:label":"Immunostaining"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c39e1348-560a-4d7e-8703-faa5e0cf93c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3edc514d-0be7-41ee-9ac9-dae93df49eec","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"E.g.

The   same homozygous  splice  mutation,  functionally  leading  to  reduced  protein  expression  in  patient fibroblasts  (PMID:22522442),  was  later  reported  in  several  Spanish  families  with  a  CMT2 phenotype (PMIDs: 33369814, 2708353). Another, likewise recurrent splice mutation leading to decreased  protein  expression  was  further  described  in  a  Turkish  (PMID:25274842)  and  an Iranian  (PMID:33481221)  family.  Besides  the  most  common  splice  variants,  a  3.8kb  spanning deletion in the DNAJB2 gene caused a mixed spinal muscular atrophy and CMT2 phenotype in a consanguineous  Iranian  family,  the  proband  of  which  showed  additional  extrapyramidal  signs (PMID:  27449489).  A  homozygous  missense  variant  was  reported  in  an  Austrian  family  with  a CMT2 phenotype (PMID: 25274842, 24627108), however, the functional mechanism of disease has not been investigated here.DNAJB2 is  highly  expressed  in  peripheral  nerves  (PMID: 20395441)  andencodes  a  co-chaperone protein with two isoforms, one responsible for the unfolding of misfolded proteins and the  other  one  promoting  the  release  of  neurotrophic  factors  to  prevent  cell  death.  Like  other neuropathy associated genes, it therefore prevents aggregation, which among other models has been investigated in motor neuron-like cells co-transfected with functional and dysfunctional HSJ1and aggregation-prone SOD1 variants (PMID: 22522442). In   summary, DNAJB2 is definitively   associated   with   autosomal   recessive   axonal   motor neuropathy,   both   with   and   without   additional   sensory   symptoms.   This   was   repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6d726e4f-6edb-4d04-b2ae-2cd05ecdd8db"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
