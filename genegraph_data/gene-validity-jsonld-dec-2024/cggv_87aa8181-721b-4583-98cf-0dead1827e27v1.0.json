BACH1 is necessary for efficient double-strand break repair in a manner that depends on its association with BRCA1. Moreover, some women with early-onset breast cancer and no abnormalities in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 carry germline BACH1 coding sequence changes, suggesting that abnormal BACH1 function contributes to tumor induction. Here, we show that BACH1 is both a DNA-dependent ATPase and a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase.

Recent studies implicate BRIP1 as a moderate/low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility gene. However, the phenotypic effects of BRIP1 dysfunction and its role in breast cancer tumorigenesis remain unclear. To explore the function of BRIP1 in acinar morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells, we generated BRIP1-knockdown MCF-10A cells by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RNA interference and examined its effect in a three-dimensional culture model. Genome-wide gene expression profiling by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to identify alterations in gene expression in BRIP1-knockdown cells compared with control cells. The microarray data were further investigated using the pathway analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for pathway identification. BRIP1 knockdown in non-malignant MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells by RNA interference induced neoplastic-like changes such as abnormal cell adhesion, increased cell proliferation, large and irregular-shaped acini, invasive growth, and defective lumen formation. Differentially expressed genes, including MCAM, COL8A1, WIPF1, RICH2, PCSK5, GAS1, SATB1, and ELF3, in BRIP1-knockdown cells compared with control cells were categorized into several functional groups, such as cell adhesion, polarity, growth, signal transduction, and developmental process. Signaling-pathway analyses showed dysregulation of multiple cellular signaling pathways, involving LPA receptor, Myc, Wnt, PI3K, PTEN as well as DNA damage response, in BRIP1-knockdown cells. Loss of BRIP1 thus disrupts normal mammary morphogenesis and causes neoplastic-like changes, possibly via dysregulating multiple cellular signaling pathways functioning in the normal development of mammary glands.","dc:creator":"Daino K","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Loss of the BRCA1-interacting helicase BRIP1 results in abnormal mammary acinar morphogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Model 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"While the knock-down model in the cell line showed alterations as noted: \"We observed that the acini formed by BRIP1-knockdown cells were significantly larger than the control acini after 4 days of culture (Fig. 1B and C).

This curation focuses on refuting the association with hereditary breast cancer. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data and experimental data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point** \nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 6 case-control studies at the aggregate and single variant levels. In 2021, two large case-control studies [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) and BCAC (PMID: 33471991); both with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *BRIP1* and breast cancer. Likewise, another large case-control study published in 2017 screened breast cancer cases from commercial laboratories and did not find significant association of pathogenic mutations in *BRIP1* with breast cancer (PMID: 28418444). In addition, three other case-control studies (PMIDs: 17504528, 26921362, 34672684), with case populations ranging from 571 to 13078 did not show an association of LOF variants with breast cancer. \n \n**Summary of Experimental Data: 1 point**\nWhile case-control studies did not support the gene-disease association, there is experimental evidence showing that BRIP1 physically interacts with BRCA1 (PMID: 14576433). Another study showed that two missense *BRIP1* variants altered the \nprotein functions (PMID: 14983014). Daino et al. (PMID: 24040146) also showed that *BRIP1*-knockout cells had a 3-fold higher rate of proliferation than the controls. However, the Daino et al. paper reported no tumor formation in the knockout mouse model.  \n \n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *BRIP1* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as refuted by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 5/10/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).\nGiven the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between BRIP1 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.
