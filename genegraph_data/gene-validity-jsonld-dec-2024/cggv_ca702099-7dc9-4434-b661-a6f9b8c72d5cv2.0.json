Homozygous mutations in PHGDH, a gene involved in the first and limiting step in L-serine biosynthesis, were recently identified as the cause of the disease in three families. By studying a cohort of 12 unrelated families affected by NLS, we provide evidence that NLS is genetically heterogeneous and can be caused by mutations in all three genes encoding enzymes of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway. Consistent with recently reported findings, we could identify PHGDH missense mutations in three unrelated families of our cohort. Furthermore, we mapped an overlapping homozygous chromosome 9 region containing PSAT1 in four consanguineous families. This gene encodes phosphoserine aminotransferase, the enzyme for the second step in L-serine biosynthesis. We identified six families with three different missense and frameshift PSAT1 mutations fully segregating with the disease. In another family, we discovered a homozygous frameshift mutation in PSPH, the gene encoding phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step of L-serine biosynthesis. Interestingly, all three identified genes have been previously implicated in serine-deficiency disorders, characterized by variable neurological manifestations. Our findings expand our understanding of NLS as a disorder of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway and suggest that NLS represents the severe end of serine-deficiency disorders, demonstrating that certain complex syndromes characterized by early lethality could indeed be the extreme end of the phenotypic spectrum of already known disorders.

In this study, we performed metabolomic profiling on 4 children with serine biosynthesis defects; 3 with PGDH deficiency and 1 with PSAT deficiency. The evaluations were performed at baseline and with serine and glycine supplementation. Metabolomic profiling performed at baseline showed low phospholipid species, including glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, and sphingomyelin. All children had low serine and glycine as expected. Low glycerophosphocholine compounds were found in 4 children, low glycerophosphoethanolamine compounds in 3 children, and low sphingomyelin species in 2 children. Metabolic profiling with serine and glycine supplementation showed normalization of most of the low phospholipid compounds in the 4 children. Phospholipids are the major component of plasma and intracellular membranes, and phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid of all mammalian cell types and subcellular organelles. Phosphatidylcholine is of particular importance for the nervous system, where it is essential for neuronal differentiation. The observed low phosphatidylcholine species in children with serine biosynthesis defects that improved after serine supplementation, supports the role of serine as a significant precursor for phosphatidylcholine. The vital role that phosphatidylcholine has during neuronal differentiation and the pronounced neurological manifestations in serine biosynthesis defects suggest that phosphatidylcholine deficiency occurring secondary to serine deficiency may have a significant contribution to the development of the neurological manifestations in individuals with serine biosynthesis defects.","dc:creator":"Glinton KE","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Disturbed phospholipid metabolism in serine biosynthesis defects revealed by metabolomic profiling."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29269105","rdfs:label":"Individual 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The proband is compound heterozygous for a predicted null variant, Asp145Metfs, and a missense variant, Ala15Val.

A total of 1019 tests were performed in the period of March 2016-December 2016 comprising 972 solo (index only), 14 duo (parents or affected siblings only), and 33 trio (index and parents). Multigene panels accounted for 672 tests, while whole exome sequencing (WES) represented the remaining 347 tests. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that explain the clinical indications were identified in 34% (27% in panels and 43% in exomes), spanning 279 genes and including 165 novel variants. While recessive mutations dominated the landscape of solved cases (71% of mutations, and 97% of which are homozygous), a substantial minority (27%) were solved on the basis of dominant mutations. The highly consanguineous nature of the study population also facilitated homozygosity for many private mutations (only 32.5% of the recessive mutations are founder), as well as the first instances of recessive inheritance of previously assumed strictly dominant disorders (involving ITPR1, VAMP1, MCTP2, and TBP). Surprisingly, however, dual molecular diagnosis was only observed in 1.5% of cases. Finally, we have encountered candidate variants in 75 genes (ABHD6, ACY3, ADGRB2, ADGRG7, AGTPBP1, AHNAK2, AKAP6, ASB3, ATXN1L, C17orf62, CABP1, CCDC186, CCP110, CLSTN2, CNTN3, CNTN5, CTNNA2, CWC22, DMAP1, DMKN, DMXL1, DSCAM, DVL2, ECI1, EP400, EPB41L5, FBXL22, GAP43, GEMIN7, GIT1, GRIK4, GRSF1, GTRP1, HID1, IFNL1, KCNC4, LRRC52, MAP7D3, MCTP2, MED26, MPP7, MRPS35, MTDH, MTMR9, NECAP2, NPAT, NRAP, PAX7, PCNX, PLCH2, PLEKHF1, PTPN12, QKI, RILPL2, RIMKLA, RIMS2, RNF213, ROBO1, SEC16A, SIAH1, SIRT2, SLAIN2, SLC22A20, SMDT1, SRRT, SSTR1, ST20, SYT9, TSPAN6, UBR4, VAMP4, VPS36, WDR59, WDYHV1, and WHSC1) not previously linked to human phenotypes and these are presented to accelerate post-publication matchmaking. Two of these genes were independently mutated in more than one family with similar phenotypes, which substantiates their link to human disease (AKAP6 in intellectual disability and UBR4 in early dementia). If the novel candidate disease genes in this cohort are independently confirmed, the yield of WES will have increased to 83%, which suggests that most \"negative\" clinical exome tests are unsolved due to interpretation rather than technical limitations.","dc:creator":"Monies D","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"The landscape of genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia based on the first 1000 diagnostic panels and exomes."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28600779","rdfs:label":"16W-0250/16N-0116"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant Gly78Ala was identified in a fetus with suspected Neu-Laxova syndrome, however confirmation of the diagnosis and additional phenotypic information was not provided.

HsPSAT alpha has a predicted open reading frame comprising 324 amino acids, encoding a 35.2 kDa protein (PSAT alpha), whereas HsPSAT beta consists of an open reading frame comprising 370 amino acids that encodes a 40 kDa protein (PSAT beta). PSAT alpha is identical with PSAT beta, except that it lacks 46 amino acids between Val(290) and Ser(337) of PSAT beta, which is encoded by the entire exon 8 (138 bp). Both PSAT alpha and PSAT beta can functionally rescue the deletion mutation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterpart. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of PSAT beta mRNA was more dominant when compared with PSAT alpha mRNA in all human cell lines tested. PSAT beta was easily detected in proportion to the level of mRNA; however, PSAT alpha was detected only in K562 and HepG2 cells as a very faint band. The relative enzyme activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PSAT beta expressed in Escherichia coli appeared to be 6.8 times higher than that of GST-PSAT alpha. PSAT mRNA was expressed at high levels (approx. 2.2 kb) in the brain, liver, kidney and pancreas, and very weakly expressed in the thymus, prostate, testis and colon. In U937 cells, the levels of PSAT mRNA and protein appeared to be up-regulated to support proliferation. Accumulation of PSAT mRNA reached a maximum in the S-phase of Jurkat T-cells. These results demonstrate that although two isoforms of human PSAT can be produced by alternative splicing, PSAT beta rather than PSAT alpha is the physiologically functional enzyme required for the phosphorylated pathway, and indicate that the human PSAT gene is regulated depending on tissue specificity as well as cellular proliferation status with a maximum level expression in the S-phase.","dc:creator":"Baek JY","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Characterization of human phosphoserine aminotransferase involved in the phosphorylated pathway of L-serine biosynthesis."},"rdfs:label":"Northern blot"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"High levels of mRNA expression were observed in the brain which is a highly affected tissue in neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency (with common phenotypes including microcephaly and intellectual disability).

Phenotypes resulting from knockouts of these genes in mice have provided tremendous insight into gene function and congenital disorders. As part of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium effort to generate and phenotypically characterize 5,000 knockout mouse lines, here we identify 410 lethal genes during the production of the first 1,751 unique gene knockouts. Using a standardized phenotyping platform that incorporates high-resolution 3D imaging, we identify phenotypes at multiple time points for previously uncharacterized genes and additional phenotypes for genes with previously reported mutant phenotypes. Unexpectedly, our analysis reveals that incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are common even on a defined genetic background. In addition, we show that human disease genes are enriched for essential genes, thus providing a dataset that facilitates the prioritization and validation of mutations identified in clinical sequencing efforts.","dc:creator":"Dickinson ME","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"High-throughput discovery of novel developmental phenotypes."},"rdfs:label":"PSAT1 Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"MGI:2183441 PSAT1 knockout mouse had phenotypes consistent with those observed in human patients with serine deficiency particularly those diagnosed with Neu-Laxova syndrome which often results in stillbirth."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":927,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d0c3cebf-14f1-486a-b984-3a79da6ea83d","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018162","gene":"hgnc:19129","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"PSAT1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency in 2007 (Hart CE, et al., PMID: 17436247; reported as phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency). At least 14 unique variants (missense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 26610677, 26960553, 25152457, 17436247, 29269105, 28600779, 31903955, 32579715). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family member. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of PSAT1 as a phosphoserine aminotransferase (PMID: 12633500), its tissue enhanced expression in the brain (PMID: 12633500), and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 27626380). Of note, this gene has been implicated in two neurometabolic disorders due to serine deficiency, phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency and Neu-Laxova syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no reported difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern and current assertions in the field suggest one broad phenotypic spectrum associated with serine biosynthesis defects encompassing both disorders (PMIDs: 28653176, 27161889, 26960553, 25152457). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency. In summary, PSAT1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ca702099-7dc9-4434-b661-a6f9b8c72d5c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
