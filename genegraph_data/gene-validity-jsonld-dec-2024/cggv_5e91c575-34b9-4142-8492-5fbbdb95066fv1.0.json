SAM is the predominant methyl-group donor for most cellular methylation processes, of which SAH is produced as a by-product. Pathogenic, biallelic SLC25A26 variants are a recognized cause of mitochondrial disease in children, with a severe neonatal onset caused by decreased SAM transport activity. Here, we describe two, unrelated adult cases, one of whom presented with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain and metabolic decompensation with lactic acidosis. Both patients had exercise intolerance and mitochondrial myopathy associated with biallelic variants in SLC25A26, which led to marked respiratory chain deficiencies and mitochondrial histopathological abnormalities in skeletal muscle that are comparable to those previously described in early-onset cases. We demonstrate using both mouse and fruit fly models that impairment of SAH, rather than SAM, transport across the mitochondrial membrane is likely the cause of this milder, late-onset phenotype. Our findings associate a novel pathomechanism with a known disease-causing protein and highlight the quests of precision medicine in optimizing diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and prognosis.","dc:creator":"Schober FA","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Pathogenic SLC25A26 variants impair SAH transport activity causing mitochondrial disease."}},{"id":"cggv:10115729-3d58-4f57-a7cb-77ee3acc2892_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7dfeab9d-7ffd-4f41-9570-91ba3992400a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35024855"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:10115729-3d58-4f57-a7cb-77ee3acc2892","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:10115729-3d58-4f57-a7cb-77ee3acc2892_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:10115729-3d58-4f57-a7cb-77ee3acc2892_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant) + 0.4 (combined oxphos deficiency I (4%), II+III (10%), IV (4%)) +0.4 (Absent NDUFB8 by SDS PAGE, reduced UQCRC2 and COX1)"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant) + 0.4 (combined oxphos deficiency I (4%), II+III (10%), IV (4%)) +0.4 (Absent NDUFB8 by SDS PAGE, reduced UQCRC2 and COX1)"},{"id":"cggv:73902e88-eb2e-4e6a-a167-588e4330d021","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73902e88-eb2e-4e6a-a167-588e4330d021_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:73902e88-eb2e-4e6a-a167-588e4330d021_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant) + 0.4 (results in exon 3 being spliced out) + 0.4 (combined oxphos deficiency I (4%), II+III (10%), IV (4%)) + 0.4 (Absent NDUFB8 by SDS PAGE, reduced UQCRC2 and COX1)"}],"strengthScore":1.25,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant) + 0.4 (results in exon 3 being spliced out) + 0.4 (combined oxphos deficiency I (4%), II+III (10%), IV (4%)) + 0.4 (Absent NDUFB8 by SDS PAGE, reduced UQCRC2 and COX1)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:5e91c575-34b9-4142-8492-5fbbdb95066f_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:57e1ce6f-3148-428e-b084-10403dae356b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:57e1ce6f-3148-428e-b084-10403dae356b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:522fa8fe-1645-473d-bd41-8c123ee16191","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001379210.1(SLC25A26):c.443T>G (p.Val148Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA351631"}},"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping, followed by exome sequencing with sanger confirmation \np.V148G absent in gnomAD v3.1.2\nParents confirmed carriers (consanguineous)","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"slight developmental delays ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0002092","obo:HP_0003128","obo:HP_0002027"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Sanger sequencing was performed of the complete mtDNA isolated from muscle and the PDHA1,\nPOLG, and TK2 genes from DNA isolated from blood, without positive findings","secondTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:7de159c2-3c20-4df5-903d-fc801ad1dc91_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:522fa8fe-1645-473d-bd41-8c123ee16191"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26522469","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the predominant methyl group donor and has a large spectrum of target substrates.

We report a syndrome in three families affected by reduced intra-mitochondrial methylation caused by recessive mutations in the gene encoding the only known mitochondrial SAM transporter, SLC25A26. Clinical findings ranged from neonatal mortality resulting from respiratory insufficiency and hydrops to childhood acute episodes of cardiopulmonary failure and slowly progressive muscle weakness.

Therefore, the intramitochondrial SAM-dependent methyltransferases require the import of SAM and export of SAH for recycling. Orthologous mitochondrial transporters belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family have been identified to catalyze this antiport transport step: Sam5p in yeast, SLC25A26 (SAMC) in humans, and SAMC1-2 in plants. In mitochondria SAM is used by a vast number of enzymes implicated in the following processes: the regulation of replication, transcription, translation, and enzymatic activities; the maturation and assembly of mitochondrial tRNAs, ribosomes and protein complexes; and the biosynthesis of cofactors, such as ubiquinone, lipoate, and molybdopterin. Mutations in SLC25A26 and mitochondrial SAM-dependent enzymes have been found to cause human diseases, which emphasizes the physiological importance of these proteins.","dc:creator":"Monné M","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Mitochondrial transport and metabolism of the major methyl donor and versatile cofactor S-adenosylmethionine, and related diseases: A review"},"rdfs:label":"Versatile implications of mitoSAM"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes associated with the impact of combined oxidative phosphorylation defect caused by disrupted SAM/SAH transport"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5e91c575-34b9-4142-8492-5fbbdb95066f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc0e4d5a-9b68-42bd-b979-6d5d74ccd5b4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af8b5aa4-b4cd-4410-8ac6-e7b3e04e03e7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Each mutation impaired SAM flux into mitochondria and lowered mitoSAM levels (Fig. 1A and fig.

Intramitochondrial SAM plays critical roles in cofactor biosynthesis (lipoate and coenzyme Q10), nucleic acid methylation, and protein methylation (PMID: 35730628). There is also some evidence indicating that SAH:SAM transport flux also plays a critical role in a variety of mitochondrial processes (PMID: 33608280).    \n\n*SLC25A26* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2015 (PMID:26522469), in three children with neonatal profound lactic acidosis and respiratory insufficiency. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SLC25A26*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SLC25A26* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Seven variants (five unique missense variants and two intronic variants impacting splicing) from five probands in two publications were included in this curation (PMIDs: 26522469, 35024855). Of note, an adult case that matched the phenotype was excluded from scoring given that the identified variants were missense without supporting functional evidence and segregation analysis was not performed (PMID: 34375635). Affected individuals have a range of features including the profound neonatal lactic acidosis and respiratory insufficiency described in the first case report, as well as lactic acidosis and myopathy in adulthood. Muscle biopsies in both the neonatal and adult forms show combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies with reductions in lipoylated proteins such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by the known interaction of this protein with others including those important in coenzyme Q10 synthesis, lipoylation, methylation of mitochondrial nucleic acids, and protein methylation (PMID: 35730628) and animal models (knock-in of specific variants in *Drosophila*, conditional knockout study in embryonic mouse fibroblasts models; PMID: 33608280). Additional yeast models and cloned human cDNA into Escherichia coli were reviewed but not included in scoring as a maximum score was reached (PMIDs: 14674884, 37130856). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *SLC25A26* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 31, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
