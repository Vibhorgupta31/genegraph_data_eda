MST1-deficient T cells poorly expressed the transcription factor FOXO1, the IL-7 receptor, and BCL2. Conversely, FAS expression and the FAS-mediating apoptotic pathway were up-regulated. These abnormalities suggest that increased cell death of naive and proliferating T cells is the main mechanism underlying this novel immunodeficiency. Our results characterize a new mechanism in primary T-cell immunodeficiencies and highlight a role of the MST1/FOXO1 pathway in controlling the death of human naive T cells.","dc:creator":"Nehme NT","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"MST1 mutations in autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by defective naive T-cell survival."}},"rdfs:label":"F2P1"},{"id":"cggv:00a8aab9-f8c1-4912-8309-2b6ed180b119","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00a8aab9-f8c1-4912-8309-2b6ed180b119_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The Met368ArgfsTer2 variant is homozygous by consanguinity.

In this study, we show that MST1 and MST2 are direct substrates of caspase-3 both in vivo and in vitro. cDNA cloning of MST homologues in mouse and nematode shows that caspase-cleaved sequences are evolutionarily conserved. Human MST1 has two caspase-cleavable sites, which generate biochemically distinct catalytic fragments. Staurosporine activates MST either caspase-dependently or independently, whereas Fas ligation activates it only caspase-dependently. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that MST is localized in the cytoplasm. During Fas-mediated apoptosis, cleaved MST translocates into the nucleus before nuclear fragmentation is initiated, suggesting it functions in the nucleus. Transiently expressed MST1 induces striking morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis in both nucleus and cytoplasm, which is independent of caspase activation. Furthermore, when stably expressed in HeLa cells, MST highly sensitizes the cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis by accelerating caspase-3 activation.

Mst1 is most abundant in lymphoid tissues. Mice lacking Mst1 exhibit markedly reduced levels of the Mst1 regulatory protein Nore1B/RAPL in lymphoid cells, whereas Mst2 abundance is unaltered. Mst1-null mice exhibit normal T cell development but low numbers of mature naïve T cells with relatively normal numbers of effector/memory T cells. In vitro, the Mst1-deficient naïve T cells exhibit markedly greater proliferation in response to stimulation of the T cell receptor whereas the proliferative responses of the Mst1-null effector/memory T cell cohort is similar to wild type. Thus, elimination of Mst1 removes a barrier to the activation and proliferative response of naïve T cells. The levels of Mst1 and Nore1B/RAPL in wild-type effector/memory T cells are approximately 10% those seen in wild-type naïve T cells, which may contribute to the enhanced proliferative responses of the former. Freshly isolated Mst1-null T cells exhibit high rates of ongoing apoptosis, a likely basis for their low numbers in vivo; they also exhibit defective clustering of LFA-1, as previously observed for Nore1B/RAPL-deficient T cells. Among known Mst1 substrates, only the phosphorylation of the cell cycle inhibitory proteins MOBKL1A/B is lost entirely in TCR-stimulated, Mst1-deficient T cells. Mst1/2-catalyzed MOBKL1A/B phosphorylation slows proliferation and is therefore a likely contributor to the anti-proliferative action of Mst1 in naïve T cells.

Serine/threonine kinase 4 (*STK4*), encodes mammalian Sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1; distinct from the gene *MST1* or macrophage stimulating 1) which is involved in cell death, following caspase-cleavage, it enters the nucleus and induces chromatin condensation followed by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. It is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in organ size control and tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. *STK4* deficiency is characterized by a progressive loss of naive T cells, the consequences of which include recurrent bacterial and viral infections and autoimmune manifestations. Curated evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship includes 6 probands plus 6 additional affected family members, with biallelic loss of function (nonsense and frameshift) variants,  reported in 5 publications (PMIDs: 22294732, 22174160, 22952854, 26117625, 26801501). Parents and healthy siblings were heterozygous for the mutation, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance (PMID: 22294732), with no evidence of dominant disease by haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including its enhanced expression in hematopoietic tissues (PMID: 22174160) and its function in apoptosis (PMID: 11278283), which is consistent with increased cell death of naive and proliferating T cells leading to lymphopenia in patients. This function is altered in patient cells (PMID: 22294732), which also have altered expression of Foxo1, Il7Rα, L-selectin, and CCR7, which can cause altered T-cell homing to secondary lymphoid organs (PMID: 22174160). Models have recapitulated the T lymphopenia with profound loss of naïve T cells in both knockout and cell-specific knockout mice (PMIDs: 19073936, 19692642). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score was reached. In summary, *STK4* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
