HME is genetically heterogeneous, with at least three loci, on 8q24.1 (EXT1), 11p11-p13 (EXT2), and 19p (EXT3). Both the EXT1 and EXT2 genes have been cloned recently and define a new family of potential tumor suppressor genes. This is the first study in which mutation screening has been performed for both the EXT1 and EXT2 genes prior to any linkage analysis. We have screened 17 probands with the HME phenotype, for alterations in all translated exons and flanking intronic sequences, in the EXT1 and EXT2 genes, by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis. We found the disease-causing mutation in 12 families (70%), 7 (41%) of which have EXT1 mutations and 5 (29%) EXT2 mutations. Together with the previously described 1-bp deletion in exon 6, which is present in 2 of our families, we report five new mutations in EXT1. Two are missense mutations in exon 2 (G339D and R340C), and the other three alterations (a nonsense mutation, a frameshift, and a splicing mutation) are likely to result in truncated nonfunctional proteins. Four new mutations are described in EXT2. A missense mutation (D227N) was found in 2 different families; the other three alterations (two nonsense mutations and one frameshift mutation) lead directly or indirectly to premature stop codons. The missense mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 may pinpoint crucial domains in both proteins and therefore give clues for the understanding of the pathophysiology of this skeletal disorder.","dc:creator":"Philippe C","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Mutation screening of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes in patients with hereditary multiple exostoses."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9326317","rdfs:label":"Family 6 IIIP"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Heinritz et al.

We also determined subcellular localization and quantitation of EXT1 and EXT2 proteins by immunocytochemistry using antibodies raised against unique peptide epitopes. In an isolated non-HME exostosis, we detected three genetic hits: deletion of one EXT1 gene, a net 21-bp deletion within the other EXT1 gene and a deletion in intron 1 causing loss of gene product. Diminished levels of EXT1 and EXT2 protein were found in 9 (82%) and 5 (45%) exostosis chondrocyte strains, respectively, and 4 (36%) were deficient in levels of both proteins.

Recent mouse studies have indicated that formation of stereotypic exostoses requires a complete loss of Ext expression, suggesting that a similar local loss of EXT function may underlie exostosis formation in patients. To further test this possibility and gain greater insights into pathogenic mechanisms, we created heterozygous Ext1(+/-) and compound Ext1(+/-)/Ext2(+/-) mice. Like Ext2(+/-) mice described previously (Stickens et al. Development 132:5055), Ext1(+/-) mice displayed rib-associated exostosis-like outgrowths only. However, compound heterozygous mice had nearly twice as many outgrowths and, more importantly, displayed stereotypic growth plate-like exostoses along their long bones. Ext1(+/-)Ext2(+/-) exostoses contained very low levels of immuno-detectable heparan sulfate, and Ext1(+/-)Ext2(+/-) chondrocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts in vitro produced shortened heparan sulfate chains compared to controls and responded less vigorously to exogenous factors such as FGF-18. We also found that rib outgrowths formed in Ext1(f/+)Col2Cre and Ext1(f/+)Dermo1Cre mice, suggesting that ectopic skeletal tissue can be induced by conditional Ext ablation in local chondrogenic and/or perichondrial cells. The study indicates that formation of stereotypic exostoses requires a significant, but not complete, loss of Ext expression and that exostosis incidence and phenotype are intimately sensitive to, and inversely related to, Ext expression. The data also indicate that the nature and organization of ectopic tissue may be influenced by site-specific anatomical cues and mechanisms.","dc:creator":"Zak BM","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Compound heterozygous loss of Ext1 and Ext2 is sufficient for formation of multiple exostoses in mouse ribs and long bones."},"rdfs:label":"Loss of Ext1 AND Ext2 form ME in mouse long bone"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Compound heterozygous mice had nearly twice as many outgrowths and, more importantly, displayed stereotypic growth plate-like exostoses along their long bones.

HME results from mutations in EXT1 and EXT2, genes that encode glycosyltransferases that synthesize heparan sulfate chains. To study the relationship of the disease to mutations in these genes, we generated Ext2-null mice by gene targeting. Homozygous mutant embryos developed normally until embryonic day 6.0, when they became growth arrested and failed to gastrulate, pointing to the early essential role for heparan sulfate in developing embryos. Heterozygotes had a normal lifespan and were fertile; however, analysis of their skeletons showed that about one-third of the animals formed one or more ectopic bone growths (exostoses). Significantly, all of the mice showed multiple abnormalities in cartilage differentiation, including disorganization of chondrocytes in long bones and premature hypertrophy in costochondral cartilage. These changes were not attributable to a defect in hedgehog signaling, suggesting that they arise from deficiencies in other heparan sulfate-dependent pathways. The finding that haploinsufficiency triggers abnormal cartilage differentiation gives insight into the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the development of exostoses.","dc:creator":"Stickens D","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Mice deficient in Ext2 lack heparan sulfate and develop exostoses."},"rdfs:label":"EXT2 deficient mice lack heparan sulfate & develop exostoses"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Exostoses formed in Ext2 heterozygote mice with all of the features found in human exostoses."},{"id":"cggv:1690ced0-2ae6-4af4-a0b0-b3802851a64f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9790bfc1-40d4-42b4-b6fe-c38a524c4876","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"During bone development in the ext2−/− zebrafish, chondrocytes fail to undergo terminal differentiation; and pre-osteoblasts do not differentiate toward osteoblasts.
