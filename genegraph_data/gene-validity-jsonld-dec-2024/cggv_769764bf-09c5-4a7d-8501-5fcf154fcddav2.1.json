Despite recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of MADD, a number of cases remain unexplained. Here, we report clinically relevant variants in FLAD1, which encodes FAD synthase (FADS), as the cause of MADD and respiratory-chain dysfunction in nine individuals recruited from metabolic centers in six countries. In most individuals, we identified biallelic frameshift variants in the molybdopterin binding (MPTb) domain, located upstream of the FADS domain. Inasmuch as FADS is essential for cellular supply of FAD cofactors, the finding of biallelic frameshift variants was unexpected. Using RNA sequencing analysis combined with protein mass spectrometry, we discovered FLAD1 isoforms, which only encode the FADS domain. The existence of these isoforms might explain why affected individuals with biallelic FLAD1 frameshift variants still harbor substantial FADS activity. Another group of individuals with a milder phenotype responsive to riboflavin were shown to have single amino acid changes in the FADS domain. When produced in E. coli, these mutant FADS proteins resulted in impaired but detectable FADS activity; for one of the variant proteins, the addition of FAD significantly improved protein stability, arguing for a chaperone-like action similar to what has been reported in other riboflavin-responsive inborn errors of metabolism. In conclusion, our studies identify FLAD1 variants as a cause of potentially treatable inborn errors of metabolism manifesting with MADD and shed light on the mechanisms by which FADS ensures cellular FAD homeostasis.

Flavin adenine dinucleotide synthase (FADS) deficiency caused by mutations in FLAD1 was recently reported as a novel riboflavin metabolism disorder resembling MADD. Here, we describe a Japanese boy with FADS deficiency due to a novel mutation (p.R249*) in FLAD1. In the asymptomatic male infant born at full term, newborn screening showed positive results with elevated C5 and C14:1 acylcarnitine levels and an increased C14:1/C2 ratio. Biochemical studies were unremarkable except for lactic acidosis (pH 7.197, lactate 61 mg/dL). A diagnosis of MADD was suspected because of mild abnormalities of the acylcarnitine profile and apparent abnormalities of urinary organic acids, although mutations in the ETFA, ETFB, ETFDH, and riboflavin transporter genes (SLC52A1, SLC52A2, and SLC52A3) were not detected. Administration of riboflavin and L-carnitine was initiated at one month of age based on the diagnosis of \"biochemical MADD\" despite a lack of symptoms. Nevertheless, the acylcarnitine profile was not normalized. Symptoms resembling bulbar palsy, such as vocal cord paralysis and dyspnea with stridor, were present from 3 months of age. At 4 months of age, he became bedridden because of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to fulminant respiratory failure with aspiration pneumonia. At 2 years and 5 months of age, a homozygous c.745C > T (p.R249*) mutation in the FLAD1 gene was identified, confirming the diagnosis of FADS deficiency. His severe clinical course may be caused by this nonsense mutation associated with poor responsiveness to riboflavin. Persistent lactic acidosis and neuropathy, such as bulbar palsy, may be important for diagnosing FADS deficiency. Although the biochemical findings in FADS deficiency are similar to those in MADD, their clinical symptoms and severity may not be identical.","dc:creator":"Yamada K","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Flavin adenine dinucleotide synthase deficiency due to FLAD1 mutation presenting as multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency-like disease: A case report."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982706","rdfs:label":"Yamada Patient"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The homozygous nonsense variant Arg249Ter has not been functionally evaluated, however it has been shown that one of the truncated isoforms of FAD synthase, which consists solely of the C-terminal FAD synthase domain, could produce FAD so this may not result in complete LOF.

Presentations range from a severe neonatal form with hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hepatomegaly with or without congenital anomalies to later-onset lipid storage myopathy. Genetic testing for MADD traditionally comprises analysis of ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH. Patients may respond to pharmacological doses of riboflavin, particularly those with late-onset MADD due to variants in ETFDH. Increasingly other genes involved in riboflavin transport and flavoprotein biosynthesis are recognized as causing a MADD phenotype. Flavin adenine dinucleotide synthase (FADS) deficiency caused by biallelic variants in FLAD1 has been identified in nine previous cases of MADD. FLAD1 missense mutations have been associated with a riboflavin-responsive phenotype; however the effect of riboflavin with biallelic loss of function FLAD1 mutations required further investigation. Herein we describe a novel, truncating variant in FLAD1 causing MADD in an 8-year-old boy. Fibroblast studies showed a dramatic reduction in FADS protein with corresponding reduction in the FAD synthesis rate and FAD cellular content, beyond that previously documented in FLAD1-related MADD. There was apparent biochemical and clinical response to riboflavin treatment, beyond that previously reported in cases of biallelic loss of function variants in FLAD1.
