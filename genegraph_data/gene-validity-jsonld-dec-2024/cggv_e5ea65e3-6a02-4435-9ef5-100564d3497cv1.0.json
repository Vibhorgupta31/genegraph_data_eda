Polarographic and spectrophotometric analyses in fibroblasts and liver revealed a respiratory chain (RC) dysfunction. Surprisingly, we identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in the GM3 synthase gene by using exome sequencing. GM3 synthase catalyzes the formation of GM3 ganglioside from lactosylceramide, which is the first step in the synthesis of complex ganglioside species. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the complete absence of GM3 ganglioside and its biosynthetic derivatives was associated with an upregulation of the alternative globoside pathway in fibroblasts. The accumulation of Gb3 and Gb4 globosides likely has a role in RC dysfunction and in the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential leading to apoptosis, which we observed in fibroblasts. We show for the first time that GM3 synthase deficiency, responsible for early-onset epilepsy syndrome, leads to a secondary RC dysfunction. Our study highlights the role of secondary mitochondrial disorders that can interfere with the diagnosis and the evolution of other metabolic diseases.","dc:creator":"Fragaki K","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Refractory epilepsy and mitochondrial dysfunction due to GM3 synthase deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"Fragaki Proband "},{"id":"cggv:0cdb952f-e5c1-46b4-8113-415ed5502b62","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0cdb952f-e5c1-46b4-8113-415ed5502b62_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0cdb952f-e5c1-46b4-8113-415ed5502b62_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Mass spectrometry in fibroblasts from patient V-5\nMitochondrial dysfunction secondary to GM3 synthase deficiency in patient’s fibroblasts/decreased  mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptosis."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3a0013dd-8c65-4e9d-89f0-3c3bfe573b7e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a0013dd-8c65-4e9d-89f0-3c3bfe573b7e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3683d0c3-44f5-48e2-bc65-b92b35f212ef","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003896.4(ST3GAL5):c.1024G>A (p.Gly342Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/828145"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Severe neonatal jaundice, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, severe psychomotor delay, strabismus, central visual damage, vomiting, mildly abnormal plasma alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, blood pyruvate and bloodand urinary lactate.

Here we report a novel homozygous ST3GAL5 variant, p.Gly342Ser, in a patient suffering from failure to thrive, severe hearing, visual, motor, and cognitive impairment, and respiratory chain dysfunction. A GM3 synthase assay towards the natural acceptor substrate lactosylceramide was performed upon transfection in HEK-293T cells of expression plasmids carrying wild type and mutated ST3GAL5 cDNAs. The assay revealed a complete loss of enzyme activity. Identical results were obtained with the other four ST3GAL5 variants which have been reported to be pathogenic. HEK-293T clones permanently expressing HaloTag-ST3GAL5 carrying each of the five variants were assessed by quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, western blotting and confocal microscopy. The results indicated that transcription, translation, stability and intracellular localization of the tagged protein were identical to those of the wild type construct. Compared with the very mild phenotype of st3gal5 KO mouse models, the results suggest that unknown mechanisms, in addition to the lack of a-b-c-series gangliosides, contribute to the syndrome. Direct enzyme assay upon transfection in model cells appears to be an effective tool for characterizing variants of glycosyltransferases involved in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis.","dc:creator":"Indellicato R","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Total loss of GM3 synthase activity by a normally processed enzyme in a novel variant and in all ST3GAL5 variants reported to cause a distinct congenital disorder of glycosylation."}},"rdfs:label":"Indellicato Proband"},{"id":"cggv:45ff8336-1015-4c50-882d-8566fd1a96fe","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:45ff8336-1015-4c50-882d-8566fd1a96fe_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:45ff8336-1015-4c50-882d-8566fd1a96fe_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"A GM3 synthase assay was in HEK-293T cells –complete loss of enzyme activity for all variants.(c.1024G>A ,c.584G>C and c.601G>A,c.862C>T, c.1063G>A)"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:6f6249ea-b5ec-4250-a60e-7799d384a0da_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f6249ea-b5ec-4250-a60e-7799d384a0da","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:270cebeb-9946-4cf3-93fb-3f2952070564"},"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000618","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002510","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0001252"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:749ed983-1b72-4e59-8c38-f45477eb2bd5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:270cebeb-9946-4cf3-93fb-3f2952070564"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25131622","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Whole exome sequencing (WES) represents a significant breakthrough in clinical genetics as a powerful tool for etiological discovery in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Autosomal recessive “Salt and pepper developmental regression syndrome”, or GM3 synthase deficiency, was initially described in 1983 and is characterized by severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, midface hypoplasia, prominent lower face, scoliosis, choreoathetosis and spasticity. Phenotypic variability has been reported  concerning mainly the occurrence of seizures and  the presence of abnormal skin pigmentation (scattered hyper- and hypo- pigmented macules) at early stages. The most common underlying mechanism involves biparentally inherited loss-of-function *ST3GAL5* variants leading to GM3 synthase deficiency. One recurrent nonsense variant was detected in 14 probands (PMIDs: 15502825, 22990144, 25131622, 30185102) and additional variants include one frameshift alteration (PMID: 34385424) and four missense variants in 8 probands (PMIDs: 24026681, 27232954, 30576498). \n\nFunctional studies indicated the absence of GM3 and derivatives in plasma samples (PMIDs: 15502825, 22990144, 24026681, 27232954) and fibroblasts (PMID: 24026681) from patients;  as well as the complete loss of enzyme activity in transfected HEK-293T cells of expression plasmids carrying wild type and mutated *ST3GAL5* cDNAs (PMID: 30576498). \n\nIn summary, *ST3GAL5* is definitively associated with the autosomal recessive GM3 synthase deficiency as it has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
