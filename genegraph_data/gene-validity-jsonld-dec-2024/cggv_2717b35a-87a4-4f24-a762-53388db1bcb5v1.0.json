Its product is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoplasmic assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, pre-mRNA processing and activation of transcription. Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMARD) is clinically and genetically distinct from SMA. Here we demonstrate that SMARD type 1 (SMARD1) results from mutations in the gene encoding immunoglobulin micro-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2; on chromosome 11q13.2-q13.4). In six SMARD1 families, we detected three recessive missense mutations (exons 5, 11 and 12), two nonsense mutations (exons 2 and 5), one frameshift deletion (exon 5) and one splice donor-site mutation (intron 13). Mutations in mouse Ighmbp2 (ref. 14) have been shown to be responsible for spinal muscular atrophy in the neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mouse, whose phenotype resembles the SMARD1 phenotype. Like the SMN1 product, IGHMBP2 colocalizes with the RNA-processing machinery in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Our results show that IGHMBP2 is the second gene found to be defective in spinal muscular atrophy, and indicate that IGHMBP2 and SMN share common functions important for motor neuron maintenance and integrity in mammals.","dc:creator":"Grohmann K","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations in the gene encoding immunoglobulin mu-binding protein 2 cause spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1."}},"rdfs:label":"Family 3 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:9879a929-6c4b-4398-b428-b0f7efab5283","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9879a929-6c4b-4398-b428-b0f7efab5283_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e3122b6b-c998-4ef7-a532-d89e7bc857cc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3122b6b-c998-4ef7-a532-d89e7bc857cc","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:54bd9c88-b634-419e-b397-4e9e68fa21c5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002180.3(IGHMBP2):c.2611+1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254655"}},"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:d6a95255-c5f0-429d-bff4-e089e246641f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:54bd9c88-b634-419e-b397-4e9e68fa21c5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11528396"},"rdfs:label":"Family 6 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:d6a95255-c5f0-429d-bff4-e089e246641f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d6a95255-c5f0-429d-bff4-e089e246641f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:62db03f7-8ae4-48e1-a916-3f81b626e143_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62db03f7-8ae4-48e1-a916-3f81b626e143","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:3abddb86-54ea-4575-b72b-8851770141f6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002180.3(IGHMBP2):c.138T>A (p.Cys46Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA346109"}},{"id":"cggv:a576b685-f357-4aee-b40e-07c5cac11e43","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002180.3(IGHMBP2):c.2911_2912del (p.Arg971GlufsTer4)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA211916"}}],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:047ea98a-5c4f-498c-8a37-2fd47903d3f2_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a576b685-f357-4aee-b40e-07c5cac11e43"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439726","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis, we investigated an English family with two affected siblings in their 40s with recessive Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2). Compound heterozygous mutations in the immunoglobulin-helicase-Î¼-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2) gene were identified. Further sequencing revealed a total of 11 CMT2 families with recessively inherited IGHMBP2 gene mutations. IGHMBP2 mutations usually lead to spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), where most infants die before 1 year of age. The individuals with CMT2 described here, have slowly progressive weakness, wasting and sensory loss, with an axonal neuropathy typical of CMT2, but no significant respiratory compromise. Segregating IGHMBP2 mutations in CMT2 were mainly loss-of-function nonsense in the 5' region of the gene in combination with a truncating frameshift, missense, or homozygous frameshift mutations in the last exon. Mutations in CMT2 were predicted to be less aggressive as compared to those in SMARD1, and fibroblast and lymphoblast studies indicate that the IGHMBP2 protein levels are significantly higher in CMT2 than SMARD1, but lower than controls, suggesting that the clinical phenotype differences are related to the IGHMBP2 protein levels.","dc:creator":"Cottenie E","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Truncating

muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is caused by recessive mutations of the IGHMBP2 gene. The role of IGHMBP2 (immunoglobulin mu-binding protein 2) in the pathomechanism of motor neuron disease is unknown. We have generated antibodies against Ighmbp2 and showed that low levels of Ighmbp2 immunoreactivity are present in the nucleus of spinal motor neurons and high levels in cell bodies, axons and growth cones. Ighmbp2 protein levels are strongly reduced in neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mice, the mouse model of SMARD1. Mutant mice show severe motor neuron degeneration before first clinical symptoms become apparent. The loss of motor neuron cell bodies in lumbar spinal cord is followed by axonal degeneration in corresponding nerves such as the femoral quadriceps and sciatic nerve and loss of axon terminals at motor endplates. Motor neuron degeneration and clinical symptoms then slowly progress until the mice die at the age of 3-4 months. In addition, myopathic changes seem to contribute to muscle weakness and especially to respiratory failure, which is characteristic of the disorder in humans. Cultured motor neurons from embryonic nmd mice did not show any abnormality with respect to survival, axonal growth or growth cone size, thus differing from motor neurons derived from, e.g. Smn (survival motor neuron) deficient mice, the model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Our data suggest that the pathomechanism in SMARD1 is clearly distinct from other motor neuron diseases such as classic SMA.","dc:creator":"Grohmann K","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Characterization of Ighmbp2 in motor neurons and implications for the pathomechanism in a mouse model of human spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1)."},"rdfs:label":"Subcellular distribution of IGHMBP2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5ff871ff-30dc-4f9f-9339-bebad37c1064","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f330834e-43fa-4128-8030-0f32cd8d7d7f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Patients with variants causing CMT2S show a partial loss-of-function of IGHMBP2 and therefore a reduction in protein expression.

It is caused by mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene (11q13) and presently has no cure. Recently, adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated gene therapy has been shown to rescue the phenotype of animal models of another lower motor neuron disorder, spinal muscular atrophy 5q, and a clinical trial with this strategy is ongoing. We report rescue of the disease phenotype in a SMARD1 mouse model after therapeutic delivery via systemic injection of an AAV9 construct encoding the wild-type IGHMBP2 to replace the defective gene. AAV9-IGHMBP2 administration restored protein levels and rescued motor function, neuromuscular physiology, and life span (450% increase), ameliorating pathological features in the central nervous system, muscles, and heart. To test this strategy in a human model, we transferred wild-type IGHMBP2 into human SMARD1-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons; these cells exhibited increased survival and axonal length in long-term culture. Our data support the translational potential of AAV-mediated gene therapies for SMARD1, opening the door for AAV9-mediated therapy in human clinical trials.","dc:creator":"Nizzardo M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Gene therapy rescues disease phenotype in a spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) mouse model."},"rdfs:label":"Rescue of nmd SMARD1 mouse with AAV9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f9ca4c9f-92be-4f52-9559-0270fc669e5c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e14e91b-2057-481a-9219-4e46902f1a53","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Human phenotype includes muscle degeneration, abnormal diaphragm morphology, and premature death.

In 2014, variants in IGHMBP2 were reported in patients with autosomal recessive Charcot Marie Tooth disease, axonal, type 2S (CMT2S) who displayed no signs of respiratory distress (Cottenie et al., 2014; PMID: 25439726). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group, SMARD1 (OMIM: 604320) and CMT2S (OMIM: 616155) were lumped into the single disease entity, hereditary peripheral neuropathy (MONDO:0020127), to account for the disease spectrum associated with variants in this gene. No discrepancies were found between the inheritance pattern and the molecular mechanism, as both were identified as autosomal recessive and loss-of-function. This mechanism of pathogenicity is reinforced by functional evidence derived from Western blot analysis showing a significant reduction in protein expression (PMID: 25439726). IGHMBP2 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicase that binds DNA from the immunoglobulin mu chain switch region. It is highly conserved and believed to be involved in the regulation of DNA replication, pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and translation. Included in this curation are two publications that report a total of eleven variants within nine probands, giving a max score of 12 points for genetic evidence (PMID: 11528396, PMID: 25439726). Pathogenic variants were comprised of homozygous or compound heterozygous nonsense, missense, frameshift, and splice donor variants. Additionally, the gene-disease association was further supported by experimental evidence including expression data in motor neurons and patients, mouse models with neuromuscular degeneration phenotypes, and rescue in mouse models via AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy, providing a functional score of 5 points. (PMID: 7749225, PMID: 26601156, PMID: 15269181, PMID: 25439726).\n\nIn summary, IGHMBP2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2717b35a-87a4-4f24-a762-53388db1bcb5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
