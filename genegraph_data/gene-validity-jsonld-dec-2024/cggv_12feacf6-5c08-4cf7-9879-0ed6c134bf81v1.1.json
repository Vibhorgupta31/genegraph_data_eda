The most frequent form of inherited retinopathy is retinitis pigmentosa (RP), with an approximate incidence of 1 in 3,500 individuals worldwide. RP is characterized by night blindness and progressive degeneration of the midperipheral retina, accompanied by bone spicule-like pigmentary deposits and a reduced or absent electroretinogram (ERG). The disease process culminates in severe reduction of visual fields or blindness. RP is genetically heterogeneous, with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked forms. Here we have identified two mutations in a novel retina-specific gene from chromosome 8q that cause the RP1 form of autosomal dominant RP in three unrelated families. The protein encoded by this gene is 2,156 amino acids and its function is currently unknown, although the amino terminus has similarity to that of the doublecortin protein, whose gene (DCX) has been implicated in lissencephaly in humans. Two families have a nonsense mutation in codon 677 of this gene (Arg677stop), whereas the third family has a nonsense mutation in codon 679 (Gln679stop).

Recently we identified the gene responsible for the RP1 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) at 8q11-12 and found two different nonsense mutations in three families previously mapped to 8q. The RP1 gene is an unusually large protein, 2156 amino acids in length, but is comprised of four exons only. To determine the frequency and range of mutations in RP1 we screened probands from 56 large adRP families for mutations in the entire gene. After preliminary results indicated that mutations seem to cluster in a 442 nucleotide segment of exon 4, an additional 194 probands with adRP and 409 probands with other degenerative retinal diseases were tested for mutations in this region alone. We identified eight different disease-causing mutations in 17 of the 250 adRP probands tested. All of these mutations are either nonsense or frameshift mutations and lead to a severely truncated protein. Two of the eight different mutations, Arg677X and a 5 bp deletion of nucleotides 2280-2284, were reported previously, while the remaining six mutations are novel. We also identified two rare missense changes in two other families, one new polymorphic amino acid substitution, one silent substitution and a rare variant in the 5'-untranslated region that is not associated with disease. Based on this study, mutations in RP1 appear to cause at least 7% (17/250) of adRP. The 5 bp deletion of nucleotides 2280-2284 and the Arg677X nonsense mutation account for 59% (10/17) of these mutations. Further studies will determine whether missense changes in the RP1 gene are associated with disease, whether mutations in other regions of RP1 can cause forms of retinal disease other than adRP and whether the background variation in either the mutated or wild-type RP1 allele plays a role in the disease phenotype.","dc:creator":"Bowne SJ","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutations in the RP1 gene causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"M1614"},{"id":"cggv:a3bb6aa0-42cd-4e42-a904-d041c1b79aef","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3bb6aa0-42cd-4e42-a904-d041c1b79aef_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b22242b3-813f-4f23-be6f-f53693ab13c9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b22242b3-813f-4f23-be6f-f53693ab13c9","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:c9963d5a-89c2-45b7-89d3-cb52f04245df"},"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:c40b3f3d-a26f-467b-9b11-2379cb0008fc_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c9963d5a-89c2-45b7-89d3-cb52f04245df"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10391211"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"II2"},{"id":"cggv:c40b3f3d-a26f-467b-9b11-2379cb0008fc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c40b3f3d-a26f-467b-9b11-2379cb0008fc_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:12feacf6-5c08-4cf7-9879-0ed6c134bf81_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5655,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":12.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:beab6ffd-b6b0-4e32-b0d4-262d6d3024f4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0800400","gene":"hgnc:10263","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"*RP1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant (or semidominant) retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in 1999 (Pierce et al., PMID: 10391211 & Sullivan et al. PMID: 10391212). *RP1* was later reported in relation to autosomal recessive RP in 2005 (Khaliq et al., PMID: 15863674). It appears that the majority of *RP1* variants located in the region encoding the middle of the RP1 protein between c.1981 (p.661) to c.2749 (p.917) are associated with dominant RP, while the variants in the N-terminal portion from c.1 (p.1) to c.1837 (p.613) and the C-terminal from c.2816 (p.939) to c.6471 (p.2157) are mostly associated with recessive RP (summarized in Wang et al., PMID: 33681214). Patients with recessive RP generally exhibit much more severe phenotypes than patients with dominant RP. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we split retinitis pigmentosa 1 (OMIM: 180100) into two disease entities, RP1-related dominant retinopathy (MONDO:0800400) and RP1-related recessive retinopathy. The split curation for RP1-related recessive retinopathy has been curated separately. The RP1 protein is a member of the doublecortin family and is present in the ciliary axoneme of both rods and cones (reviewed in Nikopoulos et al, PMID: 31253780). Several nonsense and frameshift variants have been curated. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The variants in RP1-related dominant retinopathy are thought to escape nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and their mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be dominant negative (reviewed in Nanda et al., PMID: 30731082). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies. In summary, *RP1* is definitively associated with RP1-related dominant retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on September 1st, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:12feacf6-5c08-4cf7-9879-0ed6c134bf81"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
