Although more than 50 monogenic causes of SRNS have been described, a large proportion of SRNS remains unexplained. Recently, it was discovered that mutations of NUP93 and NUP205, encoding 2 proteins of the inner ring subunit of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), cause SRNS. Here, we describe mutations in genes encoding 4 components of the outer rings of the NPC, namely NUP107, NUP85, NUP133, and NUP160, in 13 families with SRNS. Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that certain pathogenic alleles weakened the interaction between neighboring NPC subunits. We demonstrated that morpholino knockdown of nup107, nup85, or nup133 in Xenopus disrupted glomerulogenesis. Re-expression of WT mRNA, but not of mRNA reflecting mutations from SRNS patients, mitigated this phenotype. We furthermore found that CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of NUP107, NUP85, or NUP133 in podocytes activated Cdc42, an important effector of SRNS pathogenesis. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of nup107 or nup85 in zebrafish caused developmental anomalies and early lethality. In contrast, an in-frame mutation of nup107 did not affect survival, thus mimicking the allelic effects seen in humans. In conclusion, we discovered here that mutations in 4 genes encoding components of the outer ring subunits of the NPC cause SRNS and thereby provide further evidence that specific hypomorphic mutations in these essential genes cause a distinct, organ-specific phenotype.","dc:creator":"Braun DA","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mutations in multiple components of the nuclear pore complex cause nephrotic syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2bf3146d-c384-4697-9bf0-09659ac6aec0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2bf3146d-c384-4697-9bf0-09659ac6aec0_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:00cb9885-e802-4462-92e7-d7ff9b566c75_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00cb9885-e802-4462-92e7-d7ff9b566c75","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:dec11ddd-198a-4257-8af9-92d47560075d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018230.3(NUP133):c.2922T>G (p.Ser974Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345148234"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012588","obo:HP_0031266","obo:HP_0003774"],"secondTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9cd38a0e-041d-41c4-a61e-d67b977d5d4f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:dec11ddd-198a-4257-8af9-92d47560075d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30179222"},"rdfs:label":"F797-21"},{"id":"cggv:9cd38a0e-041d-41c4-a61e-d67b977d5d4f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9cd38a0e-041d-41c4-a61e-d67b977d5d4f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9cd38a0e-041d-41c4-a61e-d67b977d5d4f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"coIP experiment using N-terminally FLAG-tagged WT or mutant NUP133 cDNA demonstrates that the missense variant c.2922T>G (p.Ser974Arg) weakens the interaction with endogenous NUP107."}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Reduced score for 0.5 points total."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ec0c41fe-da3d-45d4-81c1-34f4b9ec45b7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec0c41fe-da3d-45d4-81c1-34f4b9ec45b7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:577d9dc9-8c21-4473-bd9f-594bf6e42841","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018230.3(NUP133):c.182+387T>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1226157368"}},{"id":"cggv:aa4efe24-0e16-4c78-b2a1-af987375d4c8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018230.3(NUP133):c.2898G>C (p.Lys966Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345148578"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Laboratory tests indicated serum albumin of 14.3 g/L, total cholesterol of 9.91 mmol/L, and total 24-h urinary protein of 14.71 g.

Nucleoporin 133 is involved in poly(A)+ RNA transport and nephrogenesis (PMID:30179222). It also forms part of the Nup160 subcomplex in the nuclear pore which is composed of *NUP160*, *NUP133*, *NUP107* and *NUP96*. This complex plays a role in RNA export and in tethering *NUP98* and *NUP153* to the nucleus. It is expressed throughout the body, with disease-relevant expression noted in the kidney and brain. \n\nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Nephrotic syndrome, type 18 (OMIM:618177) and Galloway-Mowat syndrome 8 (OMIM:\t618349). These two disease entities were lumped as part of the same spectrum of disease involving nephrotic syndrome with or without additional, extrarenal syndromic features.\n\n*NUP133* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome in 2018 (Braun et al., PMID: 30179222). Clinical presentation is generally characterized by nephrotic syndrome, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria with or without additional neural phenotypes such as microcephaly and brain anomalies. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nSix variants (missense and intronic variants leading to frameshift) have been reported in four probands in three publications (PMIDs: 30179222, 30427554, 37041680) included in this curation. A total of 3.8/12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached, considering case-level data and segregation data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional studies, expression studies, in vitro assays in non-patient cells, and animal models. Morpholino knockdown of *nup133* in Xenopus embryos and *Nup133* in Zebrafish demonstrated abnormal pronephros morphology and phenocopied nephrotic syndrome respectively (PMIDs: 30179222, 30894603). Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9–mediated knockout of *NUP133* increased the formation of filopodia in immortalized human podocytes, suggesting that loss of function of *NUP133* alters the podocyte’s cytoskeleton (PMID: 30179222). Finally, *NUP133* expression was demonstrated in the brain and kidney using a TaqMan assay (PMID: 30427554) and protein interaction with *NUP107* was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation with the *NUP160* subcomplex (PMID: 11564755). A total of 5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *NUP133* and autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Glomerulopathy GCEP on the meeting date June 25, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2bf3146d-c384-4697-9bf0-09659ac6aec0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
