Genetic evidence supporting SLC4A3 as a SQTS-causing gene is derived from a single publication in which exome sequencing was performed in 2 families, including one large pedigree (PMID 29167417). The same rare genetic variant (p.Arg370His, c.1109G>A) was identified in both families, suggesting they are possibly distantly related. Experimental evidence from in vitro and zebrafish models suggests reduced membrane localization of the mutated protein leads to intracellular alkalinization and shortening of the cardiomyocyte action potential duration.  The genetic evidence, including the unbiased gene discovery approach of whole exome sequencing and segregation of the identified genetic variant with a large number of affected individuals within the presented pedigree, was considered strong.  However, lack of other publications supporting this gene-disease relationship led to a score in the “moderate” range using the gene curation template. The Expert Panel discussed upgrading the final classification but was divided on this issue with 4 panelists voting for “strong” and 5 for “moderate”.
