As cells from Ops1 showed normal levels in DNA repair synthesis in vivo (unscheduled DNA synthesis and recovery of RNA synthesis after ultraviolet irradiation), we performed a postreplication repair assay and recovery of replicative DNA synthesis after ultraviolet irradiation to investigate if Ops1 cells belonged to a xeroderma pigmentosum variant pattern. Ops1 cells were normal, but there was an incomplete pattern repair in (6-4) photoproducts in contrast to a normal pattern repair in cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers by repair kinetics using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, Ops1 cells were defective in a damage-specific DNA binding protein and carried a non-sense mutation in the DDB2 gene.

The major form of XP is defective in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and comprises seven complementation groups (A-G). The genes defective in all groups have been identified unambiguously with the exception of group E. The cells of some XP-E patients are deficient in a protein complex (consisting of two subunits: p127/DDBI and p48/DDB2) which binds to UV-damaged DNA (UV-DDB) and is specifically involved in the removal of photoproducts from the non-transcribed regions of the genome. However, other XP-E patients have been reported not to lack UV-damaged DNA binding activity (DDB(+)). Here we describe several genetically unrelated XP-E patients, not previously analyzed in depth, each carrying two mutated alleles for DDB2, causing either a single amino acid change or a protein truncation or internal deletion. These defects result in a severe decrease of detectable p48 protein, abolish interaction with the p127 subunit, and produce a deficiency in UV-DDB binding activity (DDB(-)). The role of p48 in the repair defect of these patients was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Investigation of four DDB(+) cell strains from patients previously assigned to XP-E, allowed us to reclassify all of them into other groups and to show that they do not share the molecular and biochemical features typical for XP-E. Besides confirming that the true XP-E phenotype is DDB(-), resulting from defects in a single gene, DDB2, our results identify the functional domains of the corresponding p48 protein.","dc:creator":"Rapić-Otrin V","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"True XP group E patients have a defective UV-damaged DNA binding protein complex and mutations in DDB2 which reveal the functional domains of its p48 product."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12812979","rdfs:label":"XP25PV"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"A 1094G-T transversion in the DDB2 gene, resulting in an asp307-to-tyr (D307Y) substitution.

Also, the DDB2-deficient mice exhibited a significantly reduced life span compared to their wild-type littermates. Moreover, unlike other XP-deficient mice, the DDB2-deficient mice developed spontaneous malignant tumors at a high rate between the ages of 20 and 25 months. The observations suggest that, in addition to DNA repair, the other interactions of DDB2 are significant in its tumor suppression function.","dc:creator":"Yoon T","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Tumor-prone phenotype of the DDB2-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Tumor-prone phenotype of the DDB2-deficient mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:82f3120c-2441-4b2f-be3a-91edaeaf979d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c557d849-f343-4b9d-a4a6-3240d7f48ef4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The mice exhibited significantly enhanced skin carcinogenesis in response to UV-irradiation, and cells from the DDB2\u0001-/-\u0001 mice were abnormally resistant to killing by the radiation and had diminished UV induced, p53-mediated apoptosis.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14769931","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the human DDB2 gene give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum group E, a disease characterized by increased skin tumorigenesis in response to UV-irradiation. Cell strains derived from xeroderma pigmentosum group E individuals also have enhanced resistance to UV-irradiation due to decreased p53-mediated apoptosis. To further address the precise function(s) of DDB2 and the consequence of non-naturally occurring DDB2 mutations, we generated mice with a disruption of the gene. The mice exhibited significantly enhanced skin carcinogenesis in response to UV-irradiation, and cells from the DDB2(-/-) mice were abnormally resistant to killing by the radiation and had diminished UV-induced, p53-mediated apoptosis. Notably, the cancer-prone phenotype and the resistance to cellular killing were not observed after exposure to the chemical carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), to which mice carrying defective nucleotide excision repair genes respond with enhanced tumors and cell killing. Although cells from heterozygous DDB2(+/-) mice appeared normal, these mice had enhanced skin carcinogenesis after UV-irradiation, so that XP-E heterozygotes might be at risk for carcinogenesis. In sum, these results demonstrate that DDB2 is well conserved between humans and mice and functions as a tumor suppressor, at least in part, by controlling p53-mediated apoptosis after UV-irradiation.","dc:creator":"Itoh T","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"DDB2 gene disruption leads to skin tumors and resistance to apoptosis after exposure to ultraviolet light but not a chemical carcinogen."},"rdfs:label":"DDB2 gene disruption leads to skin tumors"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":21,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5c32874b-7e0e-462b-8f72-1c3a2dece16f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010213","gene":"hgnc:2718","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"There is abundant evidence published associating the DDB2 gene with xeroderma pigmentosum group E since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Nichols et al. (1996). Multiple case level studies have been performed with XPE patients that have variants in the DDB2 gene. 8 complementation groups genes (XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, XPG, and XP variant (XPV)) in Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway were reported to cause Xeroderma Pigmentosum. Multiple DDB2 deficient mouse models have been established to show consistent phenotypes with XPG patients, including significantly enhanced skin carcinogenesis in response to UV-irradiation, reduced life span and the development of spontaneous malignant tumors. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the DDB2 gene and xeroderma pigmentosum group E.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cf2a4254-51ec-467a-9194-3962d39a6b20"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
