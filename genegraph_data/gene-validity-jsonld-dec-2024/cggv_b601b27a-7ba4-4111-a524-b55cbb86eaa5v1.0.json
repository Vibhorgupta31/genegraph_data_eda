These mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein core. The cartilage matrix from these patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies. Biochemically, truncated perlecan was not secreted by the patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller fragments within the cells. Thus, DDSH is caused by a functional null mutation of HSPG2.

Because of its strategic position and unique structure, perlecan has been implicated in modulating the activity of various growth factors required for normal development and tissue homeostasis. To gain insights into the potential function of perlecan in vivo, we examined the spatiotemporal distribution of its mRNA and protein core during murine embryogenesis. We utilized a new affinity-purified antibody that recognizes specifically the protein core of perlecan together with an in situ RT-PCR approach to perform a systematic analysis of perlecan expression and deposition during murine ontogeny. Perlecan appeared early (E10.5) in tissues of vasculogenesis including heart, pericardium, and major blood vessels. Its early expression coincided with the development of the cardiovascular system. Subsequently (E11-13), the greatest deposition of perlecan occurred within the developing cartilage, especially the cartilage undergoing endochondral ossification, where it remained elevated throughout all the developmental stages, and up to adulthood. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of perlecan were always higher in all the vascularized tissues, principally within endothelial cells, while chondrocytes displayed relatively low mRNA levels. This suggests a higher biosynthesis and turnover rates in the blood vessels vis-Ã -vis those of cartilaginous and other mesenchymal tissues. During later stages of development (E13-17.5) perlecan mRNA levels progressively increased and its expression correlated with the onset of tissue differentiation of various parenchymal organs including the developing kidneys, lungs, liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. The central nervous system showed no perlecan expression with the exception of the calvaria and choroid plexus. Collectively, the results indicate that perlecan may play crucial roles not only in vasculogenesis but also in the maturation and maintenance of differentiated tissues, including cartilage.","dc:creator":"Handler M","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Developmental expression of perlecan during murine embryogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Perlecan spatiotemporal distribution in murine embryogenesis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b601b27a-7ba4-4111-a524-b55cbb86eaa5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c5986bd9-069e-4eed-89a2-6301e25b4e52","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06653c5b-3146-40d2-9bbf-b99abf6349ce","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"The bone sizes of the Hspg2-/--Tg mice were similar to those of wild type mice (Fig 7A).

However, the function of perlecan in endochondral ossification is not clear. Here, we report the critical role of perlecan in VEGF signaling and angiogenesis in growth plate formation. The Hspg2(-/-) growth plate was significantly wider but shorter due to severely impaired endochondral bone formation. Hypertrophic chondrocytes were differentiated in Hspg2(-/-) growth plates; however, removal of the hypertrophic matrix and calcified cartilage was inhibited. Although the expression of MMP-13, CTGF, and VEGFA was significantly upregulated in Hspg2(-/-) growth plates, vascular invasion into the hypertrophic zone was impaired, which resulted in an almost complete lack of bone marrow and trabecular bone. We demonstrated that cartilage perlecan promoted activation of VEGF/VEGFR by binding to the VEGFR of endothelial cells. Expression of the perlecan transgene specific to the cartilage of Hspg2(-/-) mice rescued their perinatal lethality and growth plate abnormalities, and vascularization into the growth plate was restored, indicating that perlecan in the growth plate, not in endothelial cells, is critical in this process. These results suggest that perlecan in cartilage is required for activating VEGFR signaling of endothelial cells for vascular invasion and for osteoblast migration into the growth plate.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism AND phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, type 1 (OMIM:255800), and Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (OMIM:224410). The split curation for autosomal recessive Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, type 1 has been curated separately. 8 variants (including nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants) have been reported in 6 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 11279527; Rieubland et al., 2010, PMID: 20542149; Ladhani et al., 2013, PMID: 23836246; Basalom et al., 2018, PMID: 29526034) and are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function null variants. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies (Handler et al., 1997, PMID: 9337134), functional alteration (Ishijima et al., 2012, PMID: 22421594), animal models (Costell et al., 1999, PMID: 10579729) and rescue experiments (PMID: 22421594). In summary, HSPG2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
