Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which reverse the process of ubiquitination, are important regulators of the ubiquitin system. OTUD6B encodes a member of the ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes. Herein, we report biallelic pathogenic variants in OTUD6B in 12 individuals from 6 independent families with an intellectual disability syndrome associated with seizures and dysmorphic features. In subjects with predicted loss-of-function alleles, additional features include global developmental delay, microcephaly, absent speech, hypotonia, growth retardation with prenatal onset, feeding difficulties, structural brain abnormalities, congenital malformations including congenital heart disease, and musculoskeletal features. Homozygous Otud6b knockout mice were subviable, smaller in size, and had congenital heart defects, consistent with the severity of loss-of-function variants in humans. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an affected subject showed reduced incorporation of 19S subunits into 26S proteasomes, decreased chymotrypsin-like activity, and accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Our findings suggest a role for OTUD6B in proteasome function, establish that defective OTUD6B function underlies a multisystemic human disorder, and provide additional evidence for the emerging relationship between the ubiquitin system and human disease.","dc:creator":"Santiago-Sim T","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Biallelic Variants in OTUD6B Cause an Intellectual Disability Syndrome Associated with Seizures and Dysmorphic Features."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffc7d8a3-b72f-4081-8c09-045c095c4f20_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ffc7d8a3-b72f-4081-8c09-045c095c4f20","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"allele":{"id":"cggv:e4ee1d1e-522e-4745-a590-c731bdfc6cd7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016023.5(OTUD6B):c.343C>T (p.Arg115Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4804760"}},"detectionMethod":"Authors noted exome sequencing was performed though they do not comment if it was trio or proband only sequencing.

Here, we report the clinical and molecular characterization of five additional patients (from two unrelated Egyptian families) with ID due to homozygous OTUD6B variants. In Family I, the two affected brothers had additional retinal degeneration, a symptom not yet reported in OTUD6B-related ID. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel nonsense variantÂ in OTUD6B (c.271C>T, p.(Gln91Ter)), but also a nonsense variant in RP1L1 (c.5959C>T, p.(Gln1987Ter)), all in homozygous state. Biallelic pathogenic variants in RP1L1 cause autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa type 88 (RP88). Thus, RP1L1 dysfunction likely accounts for the visual phenotype in this family with two simultaneous autosomal recessive disorders. In Family II, targeted sequencing revealed a novel homozygous missense variant (c.767G>T, p.(Gly256Val)), confirming the clinically suspected OTUD6B-related ID. Consistent with the clinical variability in previously reported OTUD6B patients, our patients showed inter- and intrafamilial differences with regard to the clinical and brain imaging findings. Interestingly, various orodental features were present including macrodontia, dental crowding, abnormally shaped teeth, and thick alveolar ridges. Broad distal phalanges (especially the thumbs and halluces) with prominent interphalangeal joints and fetal pads were recognized in all patients and hence considered pathognomonic. Our study extends the spectrum of the OTUD6B-associated phenotype. Retinal degeneration, albeit present in both patients from Family I, was shown to be unrelated to OTUD6B, demonstrating the need for in-depth analysis of WES data in consanguineous families to uncover simultaneous autosomal recessive disorders.","dc:creator":"Abdel-Salam GMH","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"OTUD6B-associated intellectual disability: novel variants and genetic exclusion of retinal degeneration as part of a refined phenotype."}},"rdfs:label":"Abdel-Salam_Patient I.1"},{"id":"cggv:a9f48f50-f476-4a77-aeb5-2b17ea1c64aa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9f48f50-f476-4a77-aeb5-2b17ea1c64aa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Homozygous variants are also seen in an affected sibling in the same manuscript.

The mother is heterozygous for OTUD6B variant and father is heterozygous for deletion including OTUD6B. Patient's father is asymptomatic but we will still choose not to score due to ZMIZ1 gene variant.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002194","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0011304","obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0001627"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Karyotype and FISH analysis of 7q11.23, which demonstrated 46,XX and no deletion observed by FISH.","secondTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:7af0245d-a081-4141-ab73-e68694caaf47_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ce36ef64-de75-44c5-a568-16cad65b74a0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34680978","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The OTUD6B and ZMIZ1 genes were recently identified as causes of syndromic intellectual disability (ID) with shared phenotypes of facial dysmorphism, distal limb anomalies, and seizure disorders. OTUD6B- and ZMIZ1-related ID are inherited in autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant patterns, respectively. We report a 5-year-old girl with developmental delay, facial phenotypes resembling Williams syndrome, and cardiac defects. The patient also had terminal broadening of the fingers and polydactyly. Cytogenomic microarray (CMA), whole exome sequencing (WES), and mRNA analysis were performed. The CMA showed a paternally inherited 0.118 Mb deletion of 8q21.3, chr8:92084087-92202189, with OTUD6B involved. The WES identified a hemizygous OTUD6B variant, c.873delA (p.Lys291AsnfsTer3). The mother was heterozygous for this allele. The WES also demonstrated a heterozygous ZMIZ1 variant, c.1491 + 2T > C, in the patient and her father. This ZMIZ1 variant yielded exon 14 skipping, as evidenced by mRNA study. We suggest that Williams syndrome-like phenotypes, namely, periorbital edema, hanging cheek, and long and smooth philtrum represent expanded phenotypes of OTUD6B-related ID. Our data expand the genotypic spectrum of OTUD6B- and ZMIZ1-related disorders. This is the first reported case of a compound heterozygote featuring point mutation, chromosomal microdeletion of OTUD6B, and the unique event of OTUD6B, coupled with ZMIZ1 variants.","dc:creator":"Phetthong T","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Compound Heterozygote of Point Mutation and Chromosomal Microdeletion Involving "}},"rdfs:label":"Phetthong_Patient"},{"id":"cggv:7af0245d-a081-4141-ab73-e68694caaf47","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7af0245d-a081-4141-ab73-e68694caaf47_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"There is no family history of consanguinity.

Individuals with variants in *OTUD6B*  have been reported to present with intellectual disability, speech delay, seizures, microcephaly, gross motor delay, intrauterine growth restriction, feeding difficulties, facial dysmorphism, and various, nonspecific abnormalities of the fingers/toes.  This curation includes seven predicted null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice) from 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28343629, 34354232, 32181568, 30364145). Additional evidence (including individuals with putative loss of function and missense variants) has been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 30364145, 35707595, 35707595, 35430327, 32924626, 31147255), but these cases were not scored as the maximum for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Segregation of variants with disease in multiple families also supports this gene-disease relationship (PMIDs: 28343629, 34354232). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including an animal model and functional alteration studies using patient cells (PMID: 28343629). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *OTUD6B* and autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
