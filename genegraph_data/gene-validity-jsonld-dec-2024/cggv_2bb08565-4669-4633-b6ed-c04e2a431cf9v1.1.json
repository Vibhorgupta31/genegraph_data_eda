Webbed neck, chest deformity, cryptorchidism, mental retardation and bleeding diatheses also are frequently associated with this disease. This syndrome is relatively common, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000-2,500 live births. It has been mapped to a 5-cM region (NS1) [corrected] on chromosome 12q24.1, and genetic heterogeneity has also been documented. Here we show that missense mutations in PTPN11 (MIM 176876)-a gene encoding the nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains-cause Noonan syndrome and account for more than 50% of the cases that we examined. All PTPN11 missense mutations cluster in interacting portions of the amino N-SH2 domain and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase domains, which are involved in switching the protein between its inactive and active conformations. An energetics-based structural analysis of two N-SH2 mutants indicates that in these mutants there may be a significant shift of the equilibrium favoring the active conformation. This implies that they are gain-of-function changes and that the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome arises from excessive SHP-2 activity.","dc:creator":"Tartaglia M","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations in PTPN11, encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11704759","rdfs:label":"NS-L II:4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This study screened 2 NS families (NS-C and NS-L) and 22 unrelated individuals for variants in PTPN11.

The marrow findings and a significantly elevated plasma thrombopoietin (Tpo) level were consistent with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia; we sought a genetic mutation that could explain this phenotype. No mutations were identified in c-MPL (the Tpo receptor gene). Microarray analysis of peripheral blood did not reveal an abnormality. DNA sequencing of the PTPN11 gene showed a heterozygous C>T nucleotide substitution in exon 3 (c.218C>T) predicted to result in a threonine-to-isoleucine change at residue 73 (T73I). A 6-week trial of eltrombopag (an agonist of the Tpo receptor) failed to increase the platelet count. We propose this specific PTPN11 mutation results in abnormalities of the protein product SHP-2, which, because of its role in signal transduction, results in severe congenital thrombocytopenia refractory to c-MPL agonists.

Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies.

Expression of the mutant proteins in HEK293T cells documented their activating role on MAPK signaling.

To study the effects of disease-associated PTPN11 alleles, we generated transgenic fruitflies with GAL4-inducible expression of wild-type or mutant csw, the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. All three transgenic mutant CSWs rescued a hypomorphic csw allele's eye phenotype, documenting activity. Ubiquitous expression of two strong csw mutant alleles were lethal, but did not perturb development from some CSW-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Ubiquitous expression of the weaker N308D allele caused ectopic wing veins, identical to the EGFR GOF phenotype. Epistatic analyses established that csw(N308D)'s ectopic wing vein phenotype required intact EGF ligand and receptor, and that this transgene interacted genetically with Notch, DPP and JAK/STAT signaling. Expression of the mutant csw transgenes increased RAS-MAP kinase activation, which was necessary but not sufficient for transducing their phenotypes. The findings from these fly models provided hypotheses testable in mammalian models, in which these signaling cassettes are largely conserved.
