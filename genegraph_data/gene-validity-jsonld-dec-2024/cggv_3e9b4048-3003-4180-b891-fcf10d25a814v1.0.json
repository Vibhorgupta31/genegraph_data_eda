The hypothesis that the divergent phenotypes of these two cardiomyopathies are associated with fundamental differences in the molecular mechanics and thin filament regulation of the underlying actin mutation was tested using the in vitro motility and laser trap assays. In the presence of troponin (Tn) and tropomyosin (Tm), beta-cardiac myosin moved both E99K and R312H thin filaments at significantly (p<0.05) slower velocities than wild type (WT) at maximal Ca(++). At submaximal Ca(++), R312H thin filaments demonstrated significantly increased Ca(++) sensitivity (pCa(50)) when compared to WT. Velocity as a function of ATP concentration revealed similar ATP binding rates but slowed ADP release rates for the two actin mutants compared to WT. Single molecule laser trap experiments performed using both unregulated (i.e. actin) and regulated thin filaments in the absence of Ca(++) revealed that neither actin mutation significantly affected the myosin's unitary step size (d) or duration of strong actin binding (t(on)) at 20 microM ATP. However, the frequency of individual strong-binding events in the presence of Tn and Tm, was significantly lower for E99K than WT at comparable myosin surface concentrations.

Molecular dynamics studies revealed possible actin polymerization defects as G247D mutation resides at the juncture of side-chain interaction, which was indeed confirmed by in vitro actin polymerization assays. Since polymerization/de-polymerization is important for the activation of Rho-GTPase-mediated serum response factor (SRF)-signaling, we studied the effect of G247D mutation using luciferase assay. Overexpression of native human ACTC1 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRVCMs) strongly activated SRF-signaling both in C2C12 cells and NRVCMs, whereas, G247D mutation abolished this activation.

However, it is still poorly understood how altered ACTC structure affects cardiovascular physiology and results in the development of distinct congenital disorders. A zebrafish mutant (s434 mutation) was identified that displays blood regurgitation in a dilated heart and lacks endocardial cushion (EC) formation. We identified the mutation as a single nucleotide change in the alpha-cardiac actin 1a gene (actc1a), resulting in a Y169S amino acid substitution. This mutation is located at the W-loop of actin, which has been implicated in nucleotide sensing. Consequently, s434 mutants show loss of polymerized cardiac actin. An analogous mutation in yeast actin results in rapid depolymerization of F-actin into fragments that cannot reanneal. This polymerization defect can be partially rescued by phalloidin treatment, which stabilizes F-actin. In addition, actc1a mutants show defects in cardiac contractility and altered blood flow within the heart tube. This leads to downregulation or mislocalization of EC-specific gene expression and results in the absence of EC development. Our study underscores the importance of the W-loop for actin functionality and will help us to understand the structural and physiological consequences of ACTC mutations in human congenital disorders.","dc:creator":"Glenn NO","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"The W-loop of alpha-cardiac actin is critical for heart function and endocardial cushion morphogenesis in zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"phalloidin in embryos"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"these fish were homozygous for the mutation whereas human ACTC related DCM is heterozygous"},{"id":"cggv:d898b988-9107-482c-ad23-871a300d5b81","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:842ba1f7-581e-4a7d-b42c-562ee0a67f4a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mutant embryos developed pericardial edema, hearts were dilated and blood regurgitates between the atrium and ventricle, lack of endocardial cushion formation.

There was no significant difference in sliding speed, fraction of filaments motile or Ca(2+)-sensitivity (ratio EC(50) E361G/NTG=0.95+/-0.08). The Ca(2+)-sensitivity of force in skinned trabeculae from ACTC E361G mice was slightly higher than NTG (EC(50) E361G/NTG=0.78+/-0.04).

The majority ( approximately 56%) of the mice lacking cardiac alpha-actin do not survive to term, and the remainder generally die within 2 weeks of birth. Increased expression of vascular smooth muscle and skeletal alpha-actins is observed in the hearts of newborn homozygous mutants and also heterozygotes but apparently is insufficient to maintain myofibrillar integrity in the homozygous mutants. Mice lacking cardiac alpha-actin can be rescued to adulthood by the ectopic expression of enteric smooth muscle gamma-actin using the cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. However, the hearts of such rescued cardiac alpha-actin-deficient mice are extremely hypodynamic, considerably enlarged, and hypertrophied. Furthermore, the transgenically expressed enteric smooth muscle gamma-actin reduces cardiac contractility in wild-type and heterozygous mice.

No differences in cardiac dimensions or systolic function were observed in young mice, whereas young adult mice exhibited only mild diastolic abnormalities. Dobutamine had an inotropic and lusitropic effect on the mouse heart. In papillary muscle at 37°C, dobutamine increased relaxation rates [∼50% increase of peak rate of force decline normalized to force (dF/dtmin/F), 25% reduction of time to 90% relaxation (t90) in nontransgenic (NTG) mice], but in the ACTC E361G mouse, dF/dtmin/F was increased 20-30%, and t90 was only reduced 10% at 10 Hz. Pressure-volume measurements showed increases in maximum rate of pressure decline and decreases in time constant of left ventricular pressure decay in the ACTC E361G mouse that were 25-30% of the changes in the NTG mouse, consistent with blunting of the lusitropic response. The inotropic effect of dobutamine was also blunted in ACTC E361G mice, and the dobutamine-stimulated increase in cardiac output (CO) was reduced from 2,100 to 900 μl/min. Mice were treated with high doses of ANG II for 4 wk. The chronic stress treatment evoked systolic dysfunction in ACTC E361G mice but not in NTG.

Ejection fraction and CO were reduced in the ACTC E361G mouse, indicating DCM. In vitro DCM-causing mutations uncouple the relationship between Ca(2+) sensitivity and troponin I phosphorylation.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relation includes case-level data and segregation data.  One study of a large family identified the presence of an ACTC1 variant in 15 individuals with atrial septal defect (ASD) and/or DCM.  The variant was absent in 63 unaffected individuals.  Five of the 15 individuals had ASD and DCM, while one individual had DCM without ASD. Those with DCM were older individuals. Some older individuals with the variant did not have DCM, but no younger individuals with the variant had DCM, suggesting that there may be age-related penetrance. LOD score was not sufficient to yield points for segregation but this may be an underestimate since phenotypic data was taken from a table and individuals were not delineated in the pedigree (Frank et al, 2019, PMID: 31430208). Vasilescu et al (2018, PMID: 30384889), showed a rare ACTC1 variant segregating in two small families. One family showed segregation in an affected parent and two affected children. A third genotype positive child did not have DCM. The second family had a variant segregating in an affected father and child, though there was another child and the father’s sister who both had left ventricular dilatation and the rare variant. These two individuals were excluded. In addition, this gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence, including expression data and animal models. There are functional studies in mutant cells that implicate ACTC1 in the pathology of heart disease (Debold et al, 2010, PMID: 19799913; Frank et al, 2019, PMID: 31430208). There are multiple animal models including knock-out mice and zebrafish and transgenic mouse models for ACTC1 mutations previously reported in affected individuals (Abdelwahid et al, 2004, PMID: 14605248; Song et al, 2010, PMID: 20600154; Glenn et al, 2012, PMID: 22751927; Kumar et al, 1997, PMID: 9114002; Wilkinson et al, 2015, PMID: 26432839). The knock-out studies showed DCM-like phenotypes, with findings such as abnormal histology, apoptosis in the ventricles, enlarged ventricular cavities, while there were no significant differences between heterozygotes and wild type. Transgenic mice did not show a phenotype until stress was introduced. Wilkinson et al (2015, PMID: 26432839) showed that transgenic mice (E361G) that were chronically stressed showed contractile dysfunction and reduced EF and cardiac output. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
