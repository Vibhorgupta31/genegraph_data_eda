Here, we report four new patients with a novel TUBB4A variant (p.K324T) and three new patients with previously reported variants (p.Q292K, p.V255I, p.E410K). The individual carrying the novel p.K324T variant exhibits epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), while the other three have isolated hypomyelination phenotype. We also present a study of the cellular effects of TUBB4A variants responsible for H-ABC (p.D249N), DYT4 (p.R2G), a severe combined phenotype with combination of hypomyelination and EIMFS (p.K324T), and isolated hypomyelination (p.Q292K and p.E410K) on microtubule stability and dynamics, neurite outgrowth, dendritic spine development, and kinesin binding. Cellular-based assays reveal that all variants except p.R2G increase microtubule stability, decrease microtubule polymerization rates, reduce axonal outgrowth, and alter the density and shape of dendritic spines. We also find that the p.K324T and p.E410K variants perturb the binding of TUBB4A to KIF1A, a neuron-specific kinesin required for transport of synaptic vesicle precursors. Taken together, our data suggest that impaired microtubule stability and dynamics, defected axonal growth, and dendritic spine development form the common molecular basis of TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy. Impairment of TUBB4A binding to KIF1A is more likely to be involved in the isolated hypomyelination phenotype, which suggests that alterations in kinesin binding may cause different phenotypes. In conclusion, our study extends the spectrum of TUBB4A mutations and related phenotypes and provides insight into why different TUBB4A variants cause distinct clinical phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Xiao H","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Functional Investigation of TUBB4A Variants Associated with Different Clinical Phenotypes."},"rdfs:label":"Reduced TUBB4A mRNA Levels in Patients’ Lymphocytes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:37d63695-b5d4-48e2-8c20-38cfafaea017_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:327edd51-fa4e-44c4-bd80-f89004a1ea08","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cb87141f-1595-4f3b-b0fb-9e94634b4279","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"This is the first model to demonstrate both neuronal and oligodendroglial defects, and replicate the behavioral and neurodegenerative features of classical H-ABC disease.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen\nLumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular\nmechanism(s), inheritance pattern, and found that the spectrum of phenotypic variability could exist between the described disease entities. Therefore, the prior disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, TUBB4A Related Neurologic Disorder (MONDO: 0800470). Clinical characteristics include a variable age of onset with a spectrum of physical and radiographical findings. \n\nThe TUBB4A gene encodes a protein that is a member of the highly conserved β-tubulin protein family that forms heterodimers with α-tubulins and then in turn forms copolymers that assemble into microtubules, an essential component of the cytoskeleton and is primarily expressed in the nervous system. Eleven missense variants reported in fifteen probands across five publications (PMIDs: 25085639, 32943487, 23582646, and 33597727) including one with linkage analysis (PMID: 23595291) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is gain-of-function. Gene-disease relationship is supported by cellular-based expression studies (PMID: 35668344) and animal models including a mouse model (PMID: 32463361). More evidence exists in the literature, but the maximum required score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, definitive evidence supports the relationship between TUBB4A and autosomal dominant TUBB4A Related Neurologic Disorder, with rigorous and reproducible evidence in research and clinical diagnostic settings. This gene-disease curation based on ClinGen criteria was approved by the Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP via email communications on March 6, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:37d63695-b5d4-48e2-8c20-38cfafaea017"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
