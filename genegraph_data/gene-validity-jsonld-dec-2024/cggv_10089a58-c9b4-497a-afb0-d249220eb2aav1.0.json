While the full genotype-phenotype spectrum remains to be explored, pathogenic variants in MSTO1 have recently been reported in a small number of patients presenting with a phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, congenital muscle involvement with histologic findings ranging from myopathic to dystrophic and pigmentary retinopathy. The proposed underlying pathogenic mechanism of MSTO1-related disease is suggestive of impaired mitochondrial fusion secondary to a loss of function of MSTO1. Disorders of mitochondrial fusion and fission have been shown to also lead to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, linking them to the mtDNA depletion syndromes, a clinically and genetically diverse class of mitochondrial diseases characterized by a reduction of cellular mtDNA content. However, the consequences of pathogenic variants in MSTO1 on mtDNA maintenance remain poorly understood. We present extensive phenotypic and genetic data from 12 independent families, including 15 new patients harbouring a broad array of bi-allelic MSTO1 pathogenic variants, and we provide functional characterization from seven MSTO1-related disease patient fibroblasts. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in MSTO1 manifest clinically with a remarkably consistent phenotype of childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, corticospinal tract dysfunction and early-onset non-progressive cerebellar atrophy. MSTO1 protein was not detectable in the cultured fibroblasts of all seven patients evaluated, suggesting that pathogenic variants result in a loss of protein expression and/or affect protein stability. Consistent with impaired mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial networks in fibroblasts were found to be fragmented. Furthermore, all fibroblasts were found to have depletion of mtDNA ranging from 30 to 70% along with alterations to mtDNA nucleoids. Our data corroborate the role of MSTO1 as a mitochondrial fusion protein and highlight a previously unrecognized link to mtDNA regulation. As impaired mitochondrial fusion is a recognized cause of mtDNA depletion syndromes, this novel link to mtDNA depletion in patient fibroblasts suggests that MSTO1-deficiency should also be considered a mtDNA depletion syndrome. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into the disease pathogenesis associated with MSTO1 mutations and further define the clinical spectrum and the natural history of MSTO1-related disease.","dc:creator":"Donkervoort S","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"MSTO1 mutations cause mtDNA depletion, manifesting as muscular dystrophy with cerebellar

Despite its significance for mitochondrial functions, human MSTO1 gene is rarely studied before 2017. As of late, MSTO1 mutations have been reported to cause clinical manifestations such as myopathy, cerebellar atrophy and ataxia, motor developmental delay, and pigmentary retinopathy. Here we have performed a whole-exome sequencing in a family which includes two brothers showing cerebellar atrophy and ataxia, intellectual disability, and myopathy. As a result, two mutations were identified. One of these mutations has been identified as a missense mutation, c.836G > A; p. (Arg279His) and a novel frameshift variant, c.1259delG; p. (Gly420ValfsTer2). So, the two brothers both had compound heterozygous mutations with a combination of protein-truncation mutation and missense mutation. These findings suggested an association of MSTO1 mutations with the early onset of symptoms and revealed the genotype-phenotype correlation between different mutation cases. In this case, the two brothers both have pes planus which is not reported in other cases. This might suggest that the novel mutation is responsible for dysmorphia. Thus, the recessive and novel MSTO1 mutations enriches genetic information on the pathogenicity of MSTO1 in humans.","dc:creator":"Li K","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing identifies

After silencing of Misato, the filamentous mitochondrial network disappeared and fragmented mitochondria were observed, indicating human Misato has a role in mitochondrial fusion.

In order to further confirm that the cellular phenotypes were in fact due to the loss of MSTO1, we transiently expressed wild-type MSTO1 in two of the patient cell lines (P4 and P7) (Fig. 7a, b). Similar to previous reports [16, 35], we found that expression of wild-type MSTO1 restored mitochondrial morphology after 48 h (Fig. 7c). Notably, we also observed more fused mitochondrial networks in control cells overexpressing MSTO1, further validating the role of MSTO1 in promoting fusion. In addition, we also see that lysosome abnormalities are restored (Fig. 7d). While we observed a significant rescue in MSTO1 fibroblasts with regard to mtDNA nucleoid size (Fig. 7e), the number of mtDNA nucleoids did not change in MSTO1 fibroblasts (Fig. 7f). A potential confounding factor is that the transfection protocol itself causes a decrease in mtDNA nucleoid counts, which could be masking a rescue. However, mtDNA copy number was also not rescued after only 48 h (Fig. 7g). This incomplete rescue of mtDNA nucleoid abundance and copy number likely reflects the fact that it may take longer than 48 h for the mtDNA copy number to be re-established.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31463572","rdfs:label":"Rescue of Mitochondrial Fusion in P4's cells with WTMSTO1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"0.5 rescuing mitochondrial fusion, 0.5 for rescuing mitochondrial morphology, 0.5 rescuing mtDNA nucleiod size "},{"id":"cggv:5a9b7602-cdb1-4477-85f8-1b6cd46acc4f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:03984798-8acf-423b-b629-9a74868e1da0","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In this study, we have shown that depletion of mst in the whole muscle tissues specifically impaired intestinalfunctions while skeletal muscles remained unaffected.\n\nHaving shown that depletion of mst in the Drosophila visceral muscle elicits a series of intestinal phenotypes, we wondered whether genetic restoration of mst expression in mef2 > mst RNAi flies would rescue the phenotypes.

Mst expression was detected in the adult intestine with its prominent localization to actin filaments and was required for maintenance of intestinal tubulin and actomyosin structures. Consistent with the subcellular localization of Mst, the intestinal defects induced by mst depletion were dramatically rescued by exogenous expression of an actin member.

The consequences for morphogenesis are that mutant larvae are almost devoid of imaginal disk tissue, have a reduction in brain size, and die before the late third-instar larval stage. To analyze these findings, we isolated cDNAs in and around the misato locus, mapped the breakpoints of chromosomal deficiencies, determined which transcript corresponded to the misato gene, rescued the cell division defects in transgenic organisms, and sequenced the genomic DNA. Database searches revealed that misato codes for a novel protein, the N-terminal half of which contains a mixture of peptide motifs found in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tubulins, as well as a motif related to part of the myosin heavy chain proteins. The sequence characteristics of misato indicate either that it arose from an ancestral tubulin-like gene, different parts of which underwent convergent evolution to resemble motifs in the conventional tubulins, or that it arose by the capture of motifs from different tubulin genes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome lacks a true homolog of the misato gene, and this finding highlights the emerging problem of assigning functional attributes to orphan genes that occur only in some evolutionary lineages.","dc:creator":"Miklos GL","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"An essential cell division gene of Drosophila, absent from Saccharomyces, encodes an unusual protein with tubulin-like and myosin-like peptide motifs."},"rdfs:label":"Null Misato Drosophila"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Drosophila study (reduction in brain size corresponds to phenotype and early lethality)\nSince drosophila model only score 0.5\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6839,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"cggv:bb8d63ac-09eb-4662-8b5d-79d55a971f1f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:29678","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *MSTO1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 18, 2023. *MSTO1* encodes Misato mitochondrial distribution and morphology regulator 1, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that plays a role in mitochondrial fusion. \n\nThe *MSTO1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2017 (PMID: 28544275), in two infants with cerebellar atrophy, developmental delay, myopathy, and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. Subsequent publications have shown a highly consistent phenotype of infantile onset (<2 years) cerebellar atrophy, myopathy, mild serum CK elevations, developmental delays, and ataxia with or without retinitis pigmentosa. Notably, at the same time of the initial report, a case with proposed dominant inheritance was reported (PMID:2855494), however, since no subsequent dominant cases have been reported (and 22 autosomal recessive cases with a clear and consistent phenotype have been reported), this GCEP elected to curate this gene-disease relationship as an autosomal recessive condition. The possibility of different mechanisms of action leading to both dominant and recessive inheritance cannot be excluded, but additional cases are needed to support autosomal dominant inheritance of *MSTO1*-related disease. Furthermore, while various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MSTO1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MSTO1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 13 unique variants (including one nonsense, one frameshift, two splicing, and nine missense variants) in eight probands (although more than 20 probands have been reported in the medical literature) across at least five publications from 2017-2021 (PMIDs: 28544275, 29339779, 30684668, 31463572, 33612823). Loss-of-function is implicated as a mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by numerous Drosophila melanogaster models (PMIDs: 29255146, 9144213), functional alteration in non-patient cells showing mitochondrial fragmentation (PMID: 17349998), absence of wild type MSTO1 expression in affected patients but not controls (PMID: 31463572), and rescue of mitochondrial morphology and fusion deficits in patients’ cells transduced with wild type MSTO1 (PMID: 31463572). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MSTO1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on on May 18, 2023. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:10089a58-c9b4-497a-afb0-d249220eb2aa"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
