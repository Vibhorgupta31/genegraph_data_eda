We have disrupted the Cln7/Mfsd8 gene in mice by targeted deletion of exon 2 generating a novel knockout (KO) mouse model for CLN7 disease, which recapitulates key features of human CLN7 disease pathology. Cln7 KO mice showed increased mortality and a neurological phenotype including hind limb clasping and myoclonus. Lysosomal dysfunction in the brain of mutant mice was shown by the storage of autofluorescent lipofuscin-like lipopigments, subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase and saposin D and increased expression of lysosomal cathepsins B, D and Z. By immunohistochemical co-stainings, increased cathepsin Z expression restricted to Cln7-deficient microglia and neurons was found. Ultrastructural analyses revealed large storage bodies in Purkinje cells of Cln7 KO mice containing inclusions composed of irregular, curvilinear and rectilinear profiles as well as fingerprint profiles. Generalized astrogliosis and microgliosis in the brain preceded neurodegeneration in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex and cerebellum in Cln7 KO mice. Increased levels of LC3-II and the presence of neuronal p62- and ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates suggested that impaired autophagy represents a major pathomechanism in the brain of Cln7 KO mice. The data suggest that loss of the putative lysosomal transporter Cln7 in the brain leads to lysosomal dysfunction, impaired constitutive autophagy and neurodegeneration late in disease.

Although clinically rather uniform, variant late-infantile onset NCL (vLINCL) is genetically heterogeneous with four major underlying genes identified so far. We evaluated the genetic background underlying vLINCL in 119 patients, and specifically analysed the recently reported CLN7/MFSD8 gene for mutations in 80 patients. Clinical data were collected from the CLN7/MFSD8 mutation positive patients. Eight novel CLN7/MFSD8 mutations and seven novel mutations in the CLN1/PPT1, CLN2/TPP1, CLN5, CLN6 and CLN8 genes were identified in patients of various ethnic origins. A significant group of Roma patients originating from the former Czechoslovakia was shown to bear the c.881C>A (p.Thr294Lys) mutation in CLN7/MFSD8, possibly due to a founder effect. With one exception, the CLN7/MFSD8 mutation positive patients present a phenotype indistinguishable from the other vLINCL forms. In one patient with an in-frame amino acid substitution mutation in CLN7/MFSD8, the disease onset was later and the disease course less aggressive than in variant late-infantile NCL. Our findings raise the total number of CLN7/MFSD8 mutations to 14 with the majority of families having private mutations. Our study confirms that CLN7/MFSD8 defects are not restricted to the Turkish population, as initially anticipated, but are a relatively common cause of NCL in different populations. CLN7/MFSD8 should be considered a diagnostic alternative not only in variant late-infantile but also later onset NCL forms with a more protracted disease course. A significant number of NCL patients in Turkey exist, in which the underlying genetic defect remains to be determined.","dc:creator":"Kousi M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations in CLN7/MFSD8 are a common cause of variant late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19201763","rdfs:label":"11"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Default for biallelic null variants"},{"id":"cggv:6cc4472d-e1b6-47dc-a080-ad8220e1e5fb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7df4975d-ff15-4a00-9cd0-e13697aeec57","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Targeted sequencing list of candidate genes","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0000488","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0032794"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:6cc4472d-e1b6-47dc-a080-ad8220e1e5fb_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b5948be2-15d6-44b4-bbeb-7045dd9de87b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001371596.2(MFSD8):c.103C>T (p.Arg35Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/846459"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19201763"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19201763","rdfs:label":"270Pa"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Default for biallelic null variants"},{"id":"cggv:afe3ebd5-921e-4e1f-838e-20f8346245c4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8c485e0-5d84-41aa-8f4f-18524eef8b10","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0000488","obo:HP_0032794"],"secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:afe3ebd5-921e-4e1f-838e-20f8346245c4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4c3ec0be-93c3-4191-8976-9a5f2ec98a6e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001371596.2(MFSD8):c.894T>G (p.Tyr298Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251661"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17564970","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The late-infantile-onset forms are the most genetically heterogeneous group among the autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorders, the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs).

However, Turkish variant LINCL was recently found to be genetically heterogeneous, because mutations in two genes, CLN6 and CLN8, were identified to underlie the disease phenotype in a subset of patients. After a genomewide scan with single-nucleotide-polymorphism markers and homozygosity mapping in nine Turkish families and one Indian family, not linked to any of the known NCL loci, we mapped a novel variant LINCL locus to chromosome 4q28.1-q28.2 in five families. We identified six different mutations in the MFSD8 gene (previously denoted \"MGC33302\"), which encodes a novel polytopic 518-amino acid membrane protein that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporter proteins. MFSD8 is expressed ubiquitously, with several alternatively spliced variants. Like the majority of the previously identified NCL proteins, MFSD8 localizes mainly to the lysosomal compartment. However, the function of MFSD8 remains to be elucidated. Analysis of the genome-scan data suggests the existence of at least three more genes in the remaining five families, further corroborating the great genetic heterogeneity of
