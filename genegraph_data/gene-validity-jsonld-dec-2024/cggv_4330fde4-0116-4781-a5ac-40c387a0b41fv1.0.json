Human MutS homologs, hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutSalpha), bind to the mismatches and initiate the repair on the daughter DNA strands. Human MYH is physically associated with hMSH2/hMSH6 via the hMSH6 subunit. The interaction of hMutSalpha and hMYH is not observed in several mismatch repair-defective cell lines. The hMutSalpha binding site is mapped to amino acid residues 232-254 of hMYH, a region conserved in the MutY family. Moreover, the binding and glycosylase activities of hMYH with an A/7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine mismatch are enhanced by hMutSalpha.

In the present study, a systematic histologic examination revealed that more spontaneous tumors had developed in MUTYH-null mice (72 of 121; 59.5%) than in the wild type (38 of 109; 34.9%). The increased incidence of intestinal tumors in MUTYH-null mice (11 tumors in 10 of 121 mice) was statistically significant compared with the wild type (no intestinal tumors in 109 mice). Two adenomas and seven adenocarcinomas were observed in the small intestines, and two adenomas but no carcinomas were found in the colons. In MUTYH-null mice treated with KBrO(3), the occurrence of small intestinal tumors dramatically increased. The mean number of polyps induced in the small intestines of these mice was 61.88 (males, 72.75; females, 51.00), whereas it was 0.85 (males, 0.50; females, 1.00) in wild-type mice.

MUTYH has been noted to be associated with both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant MUTYH-related attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, this curation focuses solely on autosomal recessive MUTYH-related attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (MONDO:0012041) due to the difference in inheritance pattern and phenotype differences. This autosomal recessive condition causes an increased risk of colorectal adenomas and colon cancer (see Nielsen et al. PMID:23035301 for clinical phenotype). At least 7 cases from Jones et al contributed homozygous truncating or missense, or compound heterozygous alleles, and Al-Tassan reported on a larger pedigree with three siblings segregating biallelic alleles consistent with recessive inheritance. A case control study by Cleary et al (PMID: 19245865, 2009) identified 27 homozygous or compound heterozygous cases (with 1 control subject carrying a homozygous variant) through a large case-control study. Through cases, segregation and case-control, the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points) although more evidence is available in the literature. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (5.5 points) including MUTYH colonic tissue expression (PMID:22876359, PMID:25613900), a mouse model developing colonic polyps (PMID: 17638869), biochemical function of MUTYH in base excision repair deficiency (PMID: 15199168), and MUTYH knockout in mouse ES cells disrupting DNA glycosylase activity (and base excision repair) (PMID: 12917422). In summary, MUTYH recessive variants are definitively associated (17.5 points) with MUTYH-related attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (MONDO:0012041), also known as MUTYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4330fde4-0116-4781-a5ac-40c387a0b41f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
