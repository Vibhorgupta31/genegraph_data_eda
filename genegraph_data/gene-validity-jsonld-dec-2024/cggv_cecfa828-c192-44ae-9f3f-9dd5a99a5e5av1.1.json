Recently, mutations in the ANO5 gene, which encodes a putative calcium-activated chloride channel belonging to the Anoctamin family of proteins, were identified in five families with one of two previously identified disorders, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2L and non-dysferlin Miyoshi muscular dystrophy. We screened a candidate group of 64 patients from 59 British and German kindreds and found the truncating mutation, c.191dupA in exon 5 of ANO5 in 20 patients, homozygously in 15 and in compound heterozygosity with other ANO5 variants in the rest. An intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism and an extragenic microsatellite marker are in linkage disequilibrium with the mutation, suggesting a founder effect in the Northern European population. We have further defined the clinical phenotype of ANO5-associated muscular dystrophy. Patients show adult onset proximal lower limb weakness with highly raised serum creatine kinase values (average 4500 IU/l) and frequent muscle atrophy and asymmetry of muscle involvement. Onset varies from the early 20 s to 50 s and the weakness is generally slowly progressive, with most patients remaining ambulant for several decades. Distal presentation is much less common but a milder degree of distal lower limb weakness is often observed. Upper limb strength is only mildly affected and cardiac and respiratory function is normal. Females appear less frequently affected. In the North of England population we have identified eight patients with ANO5 mutations, suggesting a minimum prevalence of 0.27/100,000, twice as common as dysferlinopathy. We suggest that mutations in ANO5 represent a relatively common cause of adult onset muscular dystrophy with high serum creatine kinase and that mutation screening, particularly of the common mutation c.191dupA, should be an early step in the diagnostic algorithm of adult limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients.","dc:creator":"Hicks D","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A founder mutation in Anoctamin 5 is a major cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy."}},{"id":"cggv:9df0a00b-481c-40cb-8f6d-a108ccbb0fa1_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:89aef7dd-8816-40a9-b1b3-080c18c37072"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21186264"}],"rdfs:label":"Hicks2011_patientG2"},{"id":"cggv:38fed2de-6e48-4b76-9504-ce41d52218f5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:38fed2de-6e48-4b76-9504-ce41d52218f5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:38fed2de-6e48-4b76-9504-ce41d52218f5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"NMD expected"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"NMD expected, known founder"},{"id":"cggv:9df0a00b-481c-40cb-8f6d-a108ccbb0fa1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9df0a00b-481c-40cb-8f6d-a108ccbb0fa1_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9df0a00b-481c-40cb-8f6d-a108ccbb0fa1_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The impact of the missense variant is widely accepted to be deleterious (classified as Pathogenic in ClinVar and the literature: PMID: 27911336, 22402862, 21739273, 21186264, 20096397, 22980763).

To date, the only reported human mutations in this family of genes are dominant mutations in ANO5 (TMEM16E, GDD1) in the rare skeletal disorder gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia. We have identified recessive mutations in ANO5 that result in a proximal limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2L) in three French Canadian families and in a distal non-dysferlin Miyoshi myopathy (MMD3) in Dutch and Finnish families. These mutations consist of a splice site, one base pair duplication shared by French Canadian and Dutch cases, and two missense mutations. The splice site and the duplication mutations introduce premature-termination codons and consequently trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting an underlining loss-of-function mechanism. The LGMD2L phenotype is characterized by proximal weakness, with prominent asymmetrical quadriceps femoris and biceps brachii atrophy. The MMD3 phenotype is associated with distal weakness, of calf muscles in particular. With the use of electron microscopy, multifocal sarcolemmal lesions were observed in both phenotypes. The phenotypic heterogeneity associated with ANO5 mutations is reminiscent of that observed with Dysferlin (DYSF) mutations that can cause both LGMD2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MMD1). In one MMD3-affected individual, defective membrane repair was documented on fibroblasts by membrane-resealing ability assays, as observed in dysferlinopathies. Though the function of the ANO5 protein is still unknown, its putative calcium-activated chloride channel function may lead to important insights into the role of deficient skeletal muscle membrane repair in muscular dystrophies.","dc:creator":"Bolduc V","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Recessive mutations in the putative calcium-activated chloride channel Anoctamin 5 cause proximal LGMD2L and distal MMD3 muscular dystrophies."}},"rdfs:label":"Bolduc2010_ptIX_II4"},{"id":"cggv:66c4237f-cc64-4c13-a7e1-962525c442ac","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:66c4237f-cc64-4c13-a7e1-962525c442ac_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:66c4237f-cc64-4c13-a7e1-962525c442ac_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Shown to create a putative splice donor site within exon 13.

By combining NGS and Sanger sequencing, we identified 33/786 (4%) patients carrying putative pathogenic changes in both alleles and 23 ANO5 heterozygotes (3%). The phenotypic spectrum is broader than expected, from hyperCKemia to myopathies, with lack of genotype/phenotype correlations. In particular, this is currently the largest screening of the ANO5 gene. The large number of heterozygotes for damaging mutations suggests that anoctaminopathies should be frequent and often nonpenetrant. We propose the multiple genetic testing by targeted NGS as a first step to analyze patients with nonspecific myopathic presentations. This represents a straightforward approach to overcome the difficulties of clinical heterogeneity of ANO5 patients, and to test, at the same time, many other genes involved in neuromuscular disorders.

However, the molecular role of ANO5 is unclear and ANO5 knockout mouse models show conflicting requirements of ANO5 in muscle. To study the role of ANO5 in human muscle cells we generated a myoblast line from a MMD3-patient carrying the c.2272C>T mutation, which we find causes the mutant protein to be degraded. The patient myoblasts exhibit normal myogenesis, but are compromised in their plasma membrane repair (PMR) ability.

Expression of wild-type ANO5 or pharmacological prevention of injury-triggered cytosolic Ca2+ overload enable injured patient muscle cells to repair. A homology model of ANO5 shows that several of the known LGMD2L/MMD3 patient mutations line the transmembrane region of the protein implicated in its channel activity.

One mechanism of muscle repair involves muscle cell fusion, a process requiring phosphatidylserine exposure to the outer leaflet of plasma membrane that is performed by phospholipid scrablases. In this study, the authors show that Ano5−/−muscle cells exhibit perturbed Ca2+- phospholipid scrambling as well as the associated ionic current.

Here, we show that heterologous overexpression of ANO5 confers Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scrambling to HEK-293 cells and that scrambling is associated with the simultaneous development of a nonselective ionic current. MPCs isolated from adult Ano5-/- mice exhibit defective cell fusion in culture and produce muscle fibers with significantly fewer nuclei compared with controls. This defective fusion is associated with a decrease of Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure on the surface of Ano5-/- MPCs and a decrease in the amplitude of Ca2+-dependent outwardly rectifying ionic currents. Viral introduction of ANO5 in Ano5-/- MPCs restores MPC fusion competence, ANO5-dependent phospholipid scrambling, and Ca2+-dependent outwardly rectifying ionic currents. ANO5-rescued MPCs produce myotubes having numbers of nuclei similar to wild-type controls. These data suggest that ANO5-mediated phospholipid scrambling or ionic currents play an important role in muscle repair.","dc:creator":"Whitlock JM","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Anoctamin 5/TMEM16E facilitates muscle precursor cell fusion."},"rdfs:label":"Whitlock2018_FunctionalAlteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:cecfa828-c192-44ae-9f3f-9dd5a99a5e5a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d1b7c423-9353-4a89-af67-d55197077c77","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fd275e72-fedd-44e0-b76c-85cc308651f4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"ANO5-GFP expression ameliorated the poor repair phenotype of MMD3 patient myoblasts, since dye entry exclusion following focal injury became similar to that of healthy cells.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. The ANO5 gene is located on chromosome 11p14.3, spanning 90kb. The reference transcript, NM_213599.3, is 86.7kb long with 22 exons encoding a 913-amino acid protein. More than 70 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive LGMD are recorded in ClinVar and LOVD, ranging from small deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing to missense variants. \nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive weakness in muscles including, but not limited to, the proximal muscles of the pelvic and shoulder girdle, which can lead to difficulty walking. It is also accompanied by an elevated serum creatine kinase. ANO5 has been reported in association with autosomal recessive LGMD as early as 2010 by Bolduc et al (PMIDs: 20096397). Summary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 6 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 20096397, 21820307, 22336395, 21186264, 25891276). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 7 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature (PMIDs: 22402862, 22980763, 22742934, 22499103, 23041008, 26627873, 29970176, 21739273, 27854218, 25864073, 23670307, and others), but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for disease has been reported to be biallelic loss-of-function. Summary of Experimental Data (6 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, functional assays and rescue evidence. ANO5 is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in muscles (PMIDs:15124103, 17418107, 28489263), mostly localized in intracellular vesicles in muscle cells (PMID:17418107, 22075693). However, a transient localization of ANO5 at plasma membrane cannot be excluded since a small fraction of ANO5 is trafficked to the plasma membrane in heterologous systems (PMID:29124309, 30257928). Even though the exact function of ANO5 is not clear, it has been shown to play a role in muscle cell membrane repair possibly through its phospholipid scrambling activity (PMID:30257928, 20096397, 26911675,  31341644,  26667038,  28559311). Several studies reported rescue of membrane repair and phospholipid scramblase defects in muscle cells from patients and animal models (PMIDs:31341644, 30257928). ANO5 co-localizes with CAV3, another protein associated with muscular dystrophy (PMID:32736698). Two different lines of mice with complete absence of ANO5 do not have any muscle defect (PMIDs:26693275, 26667038), while three animal models with truncating mutations show a muscular dystrophy phenotype (PMIDs: 29789544, 26911675, 30712070). In summary, the ANO5-autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on 09/09/20 (SOP Version 7). \n\nThis gene curation was re-approved and published on 11/14/24 by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP to reflect the change in the panel's name from LGMD GCEP to MDM GCEP. As part of this process, the genetic evidence was re-scored in accordance with SOP version 11.\n\nLumping & Splitting Consideration: OMIM disease entities: Miyoshi muscular dystrophy 3 (613319); Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 12 (611307); Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia (166260). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability between Miyoshi muscular dystrophy 3 and Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 12. Therefore, these two disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (MONDO:0015152). Due to differences in molecular mechanisms AND inheritance pattern, Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia disease entity was split from the two disorders involving muscular dystrophy. Gene-Disease association between Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia and ANO5 will be curated by a different GCEP.  \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:cecfa828-c192-44ae-9f3f-9dd5a99a5e5a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
