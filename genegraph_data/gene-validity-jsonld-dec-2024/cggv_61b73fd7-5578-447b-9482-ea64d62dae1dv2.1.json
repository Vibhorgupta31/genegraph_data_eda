Western blot analysis of glycoproteins enriched by WGA shows glycosylated α-Dag1 (IIH6; 76–102 kDa) and β-Dag1 (43 kDa) in the sibling, but not dag1 −/− embryos (120 hpf). Equivalent protein loading is demonstrated by detection of tubulin. Damaged muscle fibers and lesions in dag1 embryos are infiltrated by EBD. A complete absence of dystroglycan leads to dislocated dystrophin-associated with free ends of broken muscle fibers, despite residual dystrophin detected at myoseptum. Laminin-1 localization remains intact at the myoseptum in the dag1 −/− background, where β-Dag1 is not detected and aberrant morphology of nuclei is associated with dystrophic muscle.\n\nDue to the onset of muscular dystrophy, the shapes of vertical myosepta become distorted in dag1 −/− embryos (Fig. 1K and L). The absence of dystroglycan leading to dislocated dystrophin reflects the muscle pathology of dag1 −/− embryos, in which muscle fiber detachment first occurs within the basement membrane, followed by disruption of sarcolemma integrity.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21317159","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Allelic mutations in putative glycosyltransferase genes, fukutin and fukutin-related protein (fkrp), lead to a wide range of muscular dystrophies associated with hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan, commonly referred to as dystroglycanopathies. Defective glycosylation affecting dystroglycan-ligand interactions is considered to underlie the disease pathogenesis. We have modelled dystroglycanopathies in zebrafish using a novel loss-of-function dystroglycan allele and by inhibition of Fukutin family protein activities. We show that muscle pathology in embryos lacking Fukutin or FKRP is different from loss of dystroglycan. In addition to hypoglycosylated α-dystroglycan, knockdown of Fukutin or FKRP leads to a notochord defect and a perturbation of laminin expression before muscle degeneration. These are a consequence of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), preceding loss of dystroglycan-ligand interactions. Together, our results suggest that Fukutin family proteins may play important roles in protein secretion and that the UPR may contribute to the phenotypic spectrum of some dystroglycanopathies in humans.","dc:creator":"Lin YY","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Zebrafish Fukutin family proteins link the unfolded protein response with dystroglycanopathies."},"rdfs:label":"Novel dystroglycan nonsense mutation in Zebrafish"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Novel dystroglycan nonsense mutation allele (dag1hu3072), obtained from the Sanger Institute Zebrafish Mutation Resource, carries a C1568T change, which causes a premature termination of translation (R398 > Stop) within the mucin domain of α-dystroglycan (Fig. 1A and D).

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: qualitative or quantitative defects of alpha-dystroglycan (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0018282).\nSummary of Genetic Evidence (7 points): At least 9 unique variants (missense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least five probands with *DAG1*-associated muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy in at least five publications (PMID: 30450679, PMID: 25503980, PMID: 24052401, PMID: 21388311, PMID: 25934851). Phenotypes described in these probands range in severity and age of onset, with some patients presenting with Walker-Warburg syndrome surviving only days after birth, to individuals with later onset presenting with milder limb-girdle muscular dystrophy or without intellectual disability. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (6 points): This gene-disease association is supported by tissue expression studies, protein interaction experiments, functional studies in patient cells, and multiple animal models (PMID: 12230980, PMID: 21317159, PMID: 21388311). Abnormal glycosylation of *DAG1* results in several forms of congenital muscular dystrophy that range phenotypically from severe forms with brain and eye anomalies to milder limb-girdle types. Kanagawa M et al., 2004 (PMID: 15210115) demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of α-DG is recognized by LARGE to form the enzyme-substrate intermediate, which is necessary for subsequent glycosylation. Molecular recognition of dystroglycan by LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature and functional dystroglycan. Cohn RD, et al., 2002 (PMID: 12230980) and Hara Y, et al., 2011 (PMID: 21388311) performed experiments in mice with patient variants showing phenotype recapitulation of secondary dystroglycanopathies in humans. More experimental evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached.\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, and it has been replicated over time. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:61b73fd7-5578-447b-9482-ea64d62dae1d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
