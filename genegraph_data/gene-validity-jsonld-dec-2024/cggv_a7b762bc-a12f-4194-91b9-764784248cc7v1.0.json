Many patients with this disease have both liver and muscle involvement, whereas others have only liver involvement without clinical or laboratory evidence of myopathy. To improve our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease, debranching enzyme was purified 238-fold from porcine skeletal muscle. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the purified enzyme gave a single band with a relative molecular weight of 160,000 that migrated to the same position as purified rabbit-muscle debranching enzyme. Antiserum against porcine debranching enzyme was prepared in rabbit. The antiserum reacted against porcine debranching enzyme with a single precipitin line and demonstrated a reaction having complete identity to those of both the enzyme present in crude muscle and the enzyme present in liver extracts. Incubation of antiserum with purified porcine debranching enzyme inhibited almost all enzyme activity, whereas such treatment with preimmune serum had little effect. The antiserum also inhibited debranching-enzyme activity in crude liver extracts from both pigs and humans to the same extent as was observed in muscle. Immunoblot analysis probed with anti-porcine-muscle debranching-enzyme antiserum showed that the antiserum can detect debranching enzyme in both human muscle and human liver. The bands detected in human samples by the antiserum were the same size as the one detected in porcine muscle. Five patients with Type III and six patients with other types of glycogen storage disease were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Although anti-porcine antiserum detected specific bands in all liver and muscle samples from patients with other types of glycogen storage disease (Types I, II, and IX), the antiserum detected no cross-reactive material in any of the liver or muscle samples from patients with Type III glycogen storage disease. These data indicate (1) immunochemical similarity of debranching enzyme in liver and muscle and (2) that deficiency of debranching-enzyme activity in Type III glycogen storage disease is due to absence of debrancher protein in the patients that we studied.","dc:creator":"Chen YT","dc:date":"1987","dc:title":"Glycogen debranching enzyme: purification, antibody characterization, and immunoblot analyses of type III glycogen storage disease."},"rdfs:label":"GDE Immunoblot Analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:40c821eb-c527-45fb-a64b-4cff0ff96e28","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af576d8b-7613-447e-b828-923e3ac5b9b4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Altered resides within the active site of GAA led to decreased glucosidase activity in COS cells (Table IV).

A competitive mode of inhibition is obtained with glycogen as natural and 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside as artificial substrate. The inactivation of the enzyme is time and concentration dependent and results in the covalent binding of CBE. Catalytic activity is required for binding to occur. CBE-labeled peptides containing the catalytic residue of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase were isolated and identified by microsequencing and amino acid analysis. The peptides appeared to originate from a protein domain which is highly conserved among alpha-amylases, maltase, glucoamylases, and transglucanosylases. Based on the sequence similarity and the mechanism of CBE binding, Asp-518 is predicted to be the essential carboxylate in the active site of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. The functional importance of Asp-518 and other residues around the catalytic site was studied by expression of in vitro mutagenized alpha-glucosidase cDNA in transiently transfected COS cells.

GDE deficiency leads to the pathogenic accumulation of phosphorylase limit dextrin (PLD), an abnormal glycogen, in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. To further investigate the pathological mechanisms behind this disease and develop novel therapies to treat this disease, we generated a GDE-deficient mouse model by removing exons after exon 5 in the Agl gene. GDE reduction was confirmed by western blot and enzymatic activity assay. Histology revealed massive glycogen accumulation in the liver, muscle, and heart of the homozygous affected mice. Interestingly, we did not find any differences in the general appearance, growth rate, and life span between the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous affected mice with ad libitum feeding, except reduced motor activity after 50 weeks of age, and muscle weakness in both the forelimb and hind legs of homozygous affected mice by using the grip strength test at 62 weeks of age. However, repeated fasting resulted in decreased survival of the knockout mice. Hepatomegaly and progressive liver fibrosis were also found in the homozygous affected mice. Blood chemistry revealed that alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were significantly higher in the homozygous affected mice than in both wild-type and heterozygous mice and the activity of these enzymes further increased with fasting. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity was normal in young and adult homozygous affected mice. However, the activity was significantly elevated after fasting. Hypoglycemia appeared only at a young age (3 weeks) and hyperlipidemia was not observed in our model. In conclusion, with the exception of normal lipidemia, these mice recapitulate human GSD IIIa; moreover, we found that repeated fasting was detrimental to these mice.

Most GSD-III patients are GDE deficient in both liver and muscle (type IIIa), and some GSD-III patients have GDE absent in liver but retained in muscle (type IIIb). The molecular basis for this enzymatic variability is largely unknown. In the present study, the analysis of the GDE gene in three GSD-IIIb patients by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), DNA sequencing, restriction analysis, and family studies, revealed each of them as being a compound heterozygote for two different mutations. The first mutant alleles in all three patients involved mutations in exon 3 at amino acid codon 6 of the GDE protein. Two had an AG deletion at nucleotides 17 and 18 of the GDE cDNA (17delAG) which resulted in change of subsequent amino acid sequence and a truncated protein (25X); the other had a C to T transition at nucleotide 16 of the cDNA which changed a Glutamine codon to a stop codon (Q6X). The 17delAG mutation was also found in 8 of the 10 additional GSD-IIIb patients. The Q6X mutation was found in one of the remaining two GSD-IIIb patients. These two mutations were not found in any of the 31 GSD-IIIa patients, 2 GSD-IIId patients, nor 28 unrelated normal controls. The second mutant alleles in each of the three GSD-IIIb patients were R864X, R1228X, and W68OX. The R864X and R1228X were not unique for GSD-IIIb as they were also found in GSD-IIIa patients (frequency of 10.3% and 5.2% in Caucasian patients, respectively). Our data demonstrated that both IIIa and IIIb had mutations in the same GDE gene and established for the first time the molecular basis of GSD-III that differentially expressed in liver and muscle. The striking and specific association of exon 3 mutations with GSD-IIIb may provide insight into mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of the GDE gene. The identification of exon 3 mutations has clinical significance as well because it distinguished GSD-IIIb from IIIa hence permitting diagnosis from a blood sample rather than a more invasive muscle biopsy.","dc:creator":"Shen J","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Mutations in exon 3 of the glycogen debranching enzyme gene are associated with glycogen storage disease type III that is differentially expressed in liver and muscle."}},{"id":"cggv:36ea7ef3-42ca-4514-b720-ac1054e458c3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d9c612c5-49de-4df9-9003-ff2388b21d4c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8755644"}],"rdfs:label":"Shen_1996_3"},{"id":"cggv:63d17720-1e81-4c31-a5cd-e3b319461dfa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63d17720-1e81-4c31-a5cd-e3b319461dfa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This variant was scored in Sentner_2012_1.

In childhood, it is characterized by hepatomegaly, keto-hypoglycemic episodes after short periods of fasting, and hyperlipidemia. In adulthood, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and liver cirrhosis are the main complications. To determine the genotype of the GSD III patients (n = 14) diagnosed and treated in our center, mutation analysis was performed by either denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis or full gene sequencing. We developed, validated and applied both methods, and in all patients a mutation was identified on both alleles. Five novel pathogenic mutations were identified in seven patients, including four missense mutations (c.643G>A, p.Asp215Asn; c.655A>G, p.Asn219Asp; c.1027C>T, p.Arg343Trp; c.1877A>G, p.His626Arg) and one frameshift mutation (c.3911delA, p.Asn1304fs). The c.643G>A, p.Asp215Asn mutation is related with type IIIa, as this mutation was found homozygously in two type IIIa patients. In addition to five novel mutations, we present new genotype-phenotype relationships for c.2039G>A, p.Trp680X; c.753_756delCAGA, p.Asp251fs; and the intron 32 c.4260-12A>G splice site mutation. The p.Trp680X mutation was found homozygously in four patients, presenting a mild IIIa phenotype with mild skeletal myopathy, elevated CK values, and no cardiomyopathy. The p.Asp251fs mutation was found homozygously in one patient presenting with a severe IIIa phenotype, with skeletal myopathy, and severe symptomatic cardiomyopathy. The c.4260-12A>G mutation was found heterozygously, together with the p.Arg343Trp mutation in a severe IIIb patient who developed liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, necessitating an orthotopic liver transplantation.","dc:creator":"Sentner CP","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutation Analysis in Glycogen Storage Disease Type III Patients in the Netherlands: Novel Genotype-Phenotype Relationships and Five Novel Mutations in the AGL Gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Sentner_2012_1"},{"id":"cggv:7a37bd49-9900-4a61-a1d3-de30d119073a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a37bd49-9900-4a61-a1d3-de30d119073a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:52f93ad7-800f-4055-8b3f-cb9a1c04a6bb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:52f93ad7-800f-4055-8b3f-cb9a1c04a6bb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:803d6ee2-741b-4782-832f-4073017058b5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000642.3(AGL):c.1423+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341346839"}},{"id":"cggv:b7348ae7-0f40-4845-8413-2dfa5db69ae5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000642.3(AGL):c.2681+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA966854"}}],"detectionMethod":"CES + Sanger","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001638","obo:HP_0003236","obo:HP_0001943"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:f16ca253-334d-4834-9b2c-2ba01b9aebfa_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:803d6ee2-741b-4782-832f-4073017058b5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913919"},{"id":"cggv:7c8c3f33-951d-49c2-9bb0-8c76f25e5ac3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b7348ae7-0f40-4845-8413-2dfa5db69ae5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913919"}],"rdfs:label":"Vega_2016_P6"},{"id":"cggv:7c8c3f33-951d-49c2-9bb0-8c76f25e5ac3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c8c3f33-951d-49c2-9bb0-8c76f25e5ac3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:f16ca253-334d-4834-9b2c-2ba01b9aebfa","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f16ca253-334d-4834-9b2c-2ba01b9aebfa_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:944975f8-6c00-41fe-b2d0-c4bb17f8f4e7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:944975f8-6c00-41fe-b2d0-c4bb17f8f4e7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":38,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f17dbed6-c7f3-43af-ad38-b80b0f775829","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000642.3(AGL):c.1169_1172del (p.Asn390IlefsTer26)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16040828"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003236","obo:HP_0003701","obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0001712","obo:HP_0001640"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"negligible transferase activity ","secondTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:099e41c5-e4f9-4b16-8628-83bafcdc3799_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f17dbed6-c7f3-43af-ad38-b80b0f775829"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11757581","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report the molecular genetic abnormalities of a patient with GSD IIId presenting with progressive myopathy and cardiopathy leading to a fatal outcome.

GSD III is diagnosed by finding a lack of GDE activity in patient cells or through identifying biallelic pathogenic variants in *AGL*. \n\nClinical manifestations of GSD III include excess glycogen in the liver, hepatomegaly, hepatic fibrosis, and hypoglycemia. Skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle involvement is also common in patients diagnosed with subtype IIIa, while patients with IIIb tend to only demonstrate liver involvement (GeneReviews). Furthermore, the c.16C>T (p.Q6X) and c.18_19delAG (p.Gln6HisfsX20) variants in exon 3 are exclusively associated with the GSD IIIb subtype (PMID:20648714). Although the genotypic and phenotypic differences behind the IIIa and IIIb subtypes is not fully understood, one explanation is that *AGL* isoforms are differentially expressed in liver and muscle tissues, and exon 3 could be bypassed in the muscle-specific isoforms. There are also cases of subtypes IIIc and IIId reported in the literature, which are suspected to be caused by the isolated loss of either glucosidase (IIIc) or transferase (IIId) activity in the GDE (PMID:20648714). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability (apart from the variable phenotypes caused by isoforms). Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity (GSD III): GSD IIIa, GSD IIIb, GSD IIIc, GSD IIId. \n\nOver 100 individual *AGL* variants have been identified in GSD III patients (reviewed in Goldstein et al. 2010, PMID: 20648714). 15 variants (1 missense, 6 nonsense, 5 frameshift, 3 splicing) that have been reported in 11 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 26913919, 23430490, 19834502, 11757581, 25602008, 8755644) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF.\n \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical assays, expression studies, and animal models (PMIDs: 24613482, 1856189, 2961257). First, biochemical experiments have demonstrated that AGL breaks down glycogen into glucose, which is consistent with the hallmark phenotype of excess glycogen observed in patient cells (PMID:2961257). Secondly, an experiment by Hermans et al. established that a similar protein, GAA, also acts as a glucosidase (PMID:1856189). *GAA* was classified as definitively associated with GSD II by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel in 2019. As a result, a similar gene being implicated in a similar disease is evidence that supports the relationship between *AGL* and GSD III. Next, an immunoblot analysis showed the presence of GDE in the muscle and liver tissues of controls, but was absent in patients diagnosed with GSD III. Finally, an *Agl* knockout mouse model demonstrated similar phenotypes to human patients including hepatomegaly, excess glycogen levels, liver fibrosis, muscle weakness, and elevated CK levels when fasted (PMID: 24613482). \n\nIn summary, *AGL* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive GSD III. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General IEM GCEP on the meeting date 2/24/23 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a7b762bc-a12f-4194-91b9-764784248cc7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
