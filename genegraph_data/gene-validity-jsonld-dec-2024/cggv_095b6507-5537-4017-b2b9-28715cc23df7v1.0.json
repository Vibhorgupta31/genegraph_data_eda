This \"Ca2+ receptor\" (CaR) serves as the primary physiological regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion. Alterations in the CaR have been proposed to underlie the increases in Ca2+ set-point seen in primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma. We have isolated human CaR cDNAs from an adenomatous parathyroid gland. The cloned receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, responds to extracellular application of physiologically relevant concentrations of Ca2+ and other CaR agonists. The rank order of potency of CaR agonists displayed by the native receptor (Gd3+ > neomycin B > Ca2+ > Mg2+) is maintained by the expressed receptor. The nucleotide sequence of the human CaR cDNA predicts a protein of 1078 amino acids with high sequence similarity to a bovine CaR, and displays seven putative membrane-spanning regions common to G protein-coupled receptors. The deduced protein sequence shows potential sites for N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation by protein kinase C and has a low level of sequence similarity to the metabotropic glutamate receptors. Comparison of the cDNA sequence to that of the normal human CaR gene showed no alteration in the coding region sequence of the CaR in this particular instance of parathyroid adenoma. Human cDNA clones with differing 5'-untranslated regions were isolated, suggesting alternative splicing of the parathyroid CaR mRNA. A rare variant cDNA clone representing a 10 amino acid insertion into the extracellular domain was also isolated. Northern blot analysis of normal and adenomatous parathyroid gland mRNA identified a predominant transcript of approximately 5.4 kilobases, and less abundant transcripts of approximately 10, 4.8 and 4.2 kilobases in RNA from the adenoma. While there is no evidence for alteration of the primary amino acid sequence of the CaR in this adenoma, modulation of CaR biosynthesis through alternative RNA processing may play a role in set-point alterations.","dc:creator":"Garrett JE","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Molecular cloning and functional expression of human parathyroid calcium receptor cDNAs."},"rdfs:label":"Human CaSR cDNA isolation from parathyroid tissue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:095b6507-5537-4017-b2b9-28715cc23df7_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f23cbda-fc71-4c73-bab5-b2faea55214f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6221021-afd6-4743-a208-33c866e48350","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Increase in EC50 set-point noted compared with wild-type cells ","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8878438","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a key role in extracellular calcium ion homeostasis.

Because there are multiple mutations that affect the CASR gene in different ways, treatment with cinacalcet as an alternative to surgery may be valuable in homozygous cases that are caused by different mutations than the reported case.","dc:creator":"García Soblechero E","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Neonatal hypercalcemia due to a homozygous mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor: failure of cinacalcet."}},"rdfs:label":"1"},{"id":"cggv:6388986f-759b-4094-875f-4b0837abbef3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6388986f-759b-4094-875f-4b0837abbef3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:682ac67b-b0d8-42fe-9fba-0baac7c15d19_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:682ac67b-b0d8-42fe-9fba-0baac7c15d19","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":20,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2d4f01cd-e621-44e0-8a75-5df75823abe6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000388.4(CASR):c.2364del (p.Phe789SerfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2580618220"}},"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0f48b594-23d1-4c10-b8b9-ea179ad3cac0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2d4f01cd-e621-44e0-8a75-5df75823abe6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35380381","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism is a rare disorder arising from inherited defects in the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) that presents early in life with severe hypercalcemia, failure to thrive, and developmental retardation.

We studied family members of a Nova Scotian deme expressing both FHH and NSHPT and found, by PCR amplification of CaR gene exons, that FHH individuals were heterozygous and NSHPT individuals were homozygous for an abnormally large exon 7. This is due to an insertion at codon 877 of an Alu-repetitive element of the predicted-variant/human-specific-1 subfamily. It is in the opposite orientation to the CaR gene and contains an exceptionally long poly(A) tract. Stop signals are introduced in all reading frames within the Alu sequence, leading to a predicted shortened mutant CaR protein. The loss of the majority of the CaR carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain would dramatically impair its signal transduction capability. Identification of the specific mutation responsible for the FHH/NSHPT phenotype in this community will allow rapid testing of at-risk individuals.","dc:creator":"Janicic N","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Insertion of an Alu sequence in the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor gene in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism."}},"rdfs:label":"1"},{"id":"cggv:ce0f20e3-f035-43ee-b814-2b9ac450d8bc","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ce0f20e3-f035-43ee-b814-2b9ac450d8bc_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7111,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:9635ed6c-c32c-44fe-9bfa-63718eb507a0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009397","gene":"hgnc:1514","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The CASR gene is located on chromosome 3 at q13.33-q21.1and encodes the calcium-sensing receptor that determines extracellular calcium concentration and is predominantly expressed in PTH-producing chief cells of the parathyroid gland and the cortical thick ascending limb of the kidney tubule. Multiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their inheritance pattern and phenotypic spectrum, with implications for clinical management. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities and curated separately: autosomal recessive hyperparathyroidism, neonatal (OMIM:239200), autosomal dominant hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, type I (OMIM:145980), and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (OMIM:601198) lumped with Hypocalcemia, autosomal dominant, with Bartter syndrome (OMIM:601198). The preferred disease name suggested for this entity is ‘autosomal recessive neonatal hyperparathyroidism - *CASR*’. \n\nCASR was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neonatal hyperparathyroidism in 1993 (Pollak et al., PMID: 7916660). The mechanism of pathogenicity is predominantly reported to be loss of function. There have been isolated reports of monoallelic variants associated with neonatal hyperparathyroidism with a dominant negative mechanism of disease postulated (Pearce et al., PMID: 8675635).  However, these are isolated case reports, a dominant-negative disease mechanism has not been proven, and a second causative variant in trans cannot be excluded. Therefore, our curation focuses exclusively on autosomal recessive neonatal hyperparathyroidism. Autosomal recessive neonatal hyperparathyroidism is characterised by severe neonatal hypercalcemia, elevated parathyroid hormone levels, enlargement of the parathyroid glands, failure to thrive and hyperparathyroid bone disease leading to multiple fractures, ribcage deformities and respiratory distress. This condition is usually fatal without parathyroidectomy early in life. At least 11 variants (3 missense, 2 nonsense, 3 frameshift, 2 canonical splice site, 1 complex insertional variant) have been reported in 10 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 7916660, 37246686, 7717399, 35380381, 34887979, 34111698, 30376845, 29354167, 24735972, 23817301) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level and segregation data. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, in vitro assays in non-patient cells and expression studies. Homozygous Casr-/- mice had marked reduction in growth from day 2 of life, progressive lethargy and death at day 3 to 30 of life with elevated serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels and significant hypocalciuria, recapitulating the human phenotype and supporting loss-of-function as a disease mechanism (Ho et al., PMID: 7493018).  HEK-293 cells cultured and transfected with CASR variants reported in individuals with neonatal hyperparathyroidism showed an increase in EC50 set-point compared with wild-type cells (Pearce et al., PMID: 8878438). Human CaSR cDNA was able to be isolated from an adenomatous parathyroid gland and healthy parathyroid tissue. The cloned receptor when expressed in Xenopus oocytes responded to extracellular application of physiologically relevant concentrations of calcium and other calcium receptor agonists with the same rank order of potency compared with water-injected control oocytes. This demonstrates both expression of CaSR in parathyroid tissue and its biochemical function (Garrett et al., PMID:7759551).  A total of 3/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CASR and autosomal recessive neonatal hyperparathyroidism. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:095b6507-5537-4017-b2b9-28715cc23df7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
