Recurrent mutations in three main genes (SCN1A, SCN1B and GABRG2) have been identified that cause febrile seizures with or without epilepsy.

Whole-exome sequencing in independent large pedigrees identified cosegregating STX1B mutations predicted to cause an early truncation or an in-frame insertion or deletion. Three additional nonsense or missense mutations and a de novo microdeletion encompassing STX1B were then identified in 449 familial or sporadic cases. Video and local field potential analyses of zebrafish larvae with antisense knockdown of stx1b showed seizure-like behavior and epileptiform discharges that were highly sensitive to increased temperature. Wild-type human syntaxin-1B but not a mutated protein rescued the effects of stx1b knockdown in zebrafish.

This increase in Pvr in STX1BV216E expressing neurons was accompanied by a \u000440% increase in miniature EPSC frequency and an almost 2-fold increase in miniature EPSC rate. An increase in Pvr induces a faster depletion of the pool of\nthe vesicles upon high-frequency stimulation of the neurons.

SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion is assisted by Munc18-1, which recruits STX1B in the auto-inhibited conformation, while Munc13 catalyses the fast and efficient pairing of helices during SNARE complex formation. Mutations within the STX1B gene are associated with epilepsy. Here we analysed three STX1B mutations by biochemical and electrophysiological means. These three paradigmatic mutations cause epilepsy syndromes of different severity, from benign fever-associated seizures in childhood to severe epileptic encephalopathies. An insertion/deletion (K45/RMCIE, L46M) mutation (STX1BInDel), causing mild epilepsy and located in the early helical Habc domain, leads to an unfolded protein unable to sustain neurotransmission. STX1BG226R, causing epileptic encephalopathies, strongly compromises the interaction with Munc18-1 and reduces expression of both proteins, the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, and Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release when expressed in STX1-null neurons. The mutation STX1BV216E, also causing epileptic encephalopathies, only slightly diminishes Munc18-1 and Munc13 interactions, but leads to enhanced fusogenicity and increased vesicular release probability, also in STX1-null neurons. Even though the synaptic output remained unchanged in excitatory hippocampal STX1B+/- neurons exogenously expressing STX1B mutants, the manifestation of clear and distinct molecular disease mechanisms by these mutants suggest that certain forms of epilepsies can be conceptualized by assigning mutations to structurally sensitive regions of the STX1B-Munc18-1 interface, translating into distinct neurophysiological phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Vardar G","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Epilepsy-causing STX1B mutations translate altered protein functions into distinct phenotypes in mouse neurons."},"rdfs:label":"Synaptic transmission in STX1-null neurons"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Variant-level experimental evidence"},{"id":"cggv:a81ea6cb-3e85-4614-8931-15df3dbd6fe1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3373363d-6b8f-4f49-91b1-98f078054707","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The circular dichroism (CD) spectra recordings of assembled and purified SNARE complexes showed that Both STX1BWT and STX1BInDel displayed the typical spectra of helical proteins with the minima at wavelengths of both 208 and 222 nm, with the latter being less pronounced for STX1BInDel.

Typical phenotypes of individuals affected with GEFS+ include infantile/childhood-onset febrile and afebrile seizures, which are well-controlled with or without anti-epileptic drugs; intelligence is typically unaffected (PMIDs: 25362483, 27781031, 30737342). However, some individuals in the GEFS+ spectrum of disease may be more severely affected, with phenotypes including infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy with developmental delays and/or intellectual disability (PMID: 30737342).  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern or molecular mechanism between individuals presenting with typical GEFS+ and those presenting with the more severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, these individuals are being curated together under the single disease term GEFS+ (MONDO:0018214). \n\nTen variants (missense, small in-frame indels, truncations, and frameshift) reported in 10 probands in three publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 25362483, 27781031, and 30737342). In two of the families, the variants segregated with a total LOD score of 6.38. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knockout mouse model that showed heat-induced seizures (PMID: 32858780).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *STX1B* and autosomal dominant GEFS+. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
