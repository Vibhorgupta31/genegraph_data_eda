Individuals bearing inactivating mutations in components of this response exhibit clinical symptoms that include cellular radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. The archetype for such disorders is Ataxia-Telangiectasia caused by biallelic mutation in ATM, a central component of the DNA damage response. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is mutated in the RIDDLE syndrome, a recently discovered immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity disorder. We show that RNF168 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by binding to ubiquitylated histone H2A. RNF168 acts with UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitylation by targeting H2A-type histones and by promoting the formation of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates. These RNF168-dependent chromatin modifications orchestrate the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DNA lesions, and their loss is the likely cause of the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with RIDDLE syndrome.","dc:creator":"Stewart GS","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"The RIDDLE syndrome protein mediates a ubiquitin-dependent signaling cascade at sites of DNA damage."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2eab353f-d7ed-4f22-883e-0b62c7bc4f9b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2eab353f-d7ed-4f22-883e-0b62c7bc4f9b_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.5},{"id":"cggv:f4a4ca24-b59c-4720-a483-e5166939adab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f4a4ca24-b59c-4720-a483-e5166939adab","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:6ac1109c-3a90-466d-a1bb-d196125802b4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152617.4(RNF168):c.397dup (p.Ala133fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/487"}},{"id":"cggv:79582766-2d8f-4a45-8cab-f6a027b02780","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152617.4(RNF168):c.1323_1326del (p.Gln442fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/488"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004313","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0001328","obo:HP_0002721","obo:HP_0002275","obo:HP_0010997","obo:HP_0004322"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:e0537e09-facd-45aa-a899-2f76a1a4ad6f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6ac1109c-3a90-466d-a1bb-d196125802b4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19203578"},{"id":"cggv:26888644-f278-47f7-b53e-8ade99880c26_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:79582766-2d8f-4a45-8cab-f6a027b02780"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19203578"}],"rdfs:label":"15-9BI"},{"id":"cggv:26888644-f278-47f7-b53e-8ade99880c26","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:26888644-f278-47f7-b53e-8ade99880c26_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"c.1323_1326del (p.Gln442fs) is absent in gAD but is not anticipated to undergo NMD as it occurs in the last exon."},{"id":"cggv:e0537e09-facd-45aa-a899-2f76a1a4ad6f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0537e09-facd-45aa-a899-2f76a1a4ad6f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"c.397dup (p.Ala133fs) is absent in gAD and is expected to undergo NMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:bb97a489-466b-4163-86fe-f9eac6791a8e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bb97a489-466b-4163-86fe-f9eac6791a8e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"allele":{"id":"cggv:876d9f40-1658-44dc-924e-932843218564","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152617.4(RNF168):c.295del (p.Glu99LysfsTer18)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573130181"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002275","obo:HP_0001009","obo:HP_0004313","obo:HP_0006254","obo:HP_0010997"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:4bc8245c-3d67-4415-88b9-6ebf9ea60c71_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:876d9f40-1658-44dc-924e-932843218564"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29255463","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Germline mutations in the RING finger protein gene ","dc:creator":"Pietrucha B","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Clinical and Biological Manifestation of RNF168 Deficiency in Two Polish Siblings."}},"rdfs:label":"HA592"},{"id":"cggv:4bc8245c-3d67-4415-88b9-6ebf9ea60c71","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4bc8245c-3d67-4415-88b9-6ebf9ea60c71_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"absent in gnomad;

A multiprotein cascade operates at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to recognize, signal and repair damage. RNF168 (ring-finger nuclear factor) contributes to this emerging pathway of several E3 ubiquitin ligases that perform sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes, chromatin modifications essential for aggregation of repair complexes at the DSB sites. Here, we report the clinical and cellular phenotypes associated with a newly identified homozygous nonsense mutation in the RNF168 gene of a patient with a syndrome mimicking ataxia-telangiectasia. The mutation eliminated both of RNF168's ubiquitin-binding motifs, thus blocking progression of the ubiquitylation cascade and retention of repair proteins including tumor suppressors 53BP1 and BRCA1 at DSB sites, consistent with the observed defective DNA damage checkpoints/repair and pronounced radiosensitivity. Rapid screening for RNF168 pathway deficiency was achieved by scoring patients' lymphoblastoid cells for irradiation-induced nuclear foci containing 53BP1, a robust assay we propose for future diagnostic applications. The formation of radiation-induced DSB repair foci was rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type RNF168 in patient's cells, further causally linking the RNF168 mutation with the pathology. Clinically, this novel syndrome featured ataxia, telangiectasia, elevated alphafetoprotein, immunodeficiency, microcephaly and pulmonary failure and has implications for the differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive ataxias.","dc:creator":"Devgan SS","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Homozygous deficiency of ubiquitin-ligase ring-finger protein RNF168 mimics the radiosensitivity syndrome of ataxia-telangiectasia."}},"rdfs:label":"RS66"},{"id":"cggv:1580fd72-3753-483e-a8ce-9e2520a34686","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1580fd72-3753-483e-a8ce-9e2520a34686_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"3 alleles in gnomad; NMD+"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.5},{"id":"cggv:2eab353f-d7ed-4f22-883e-0b62c7bc4f9b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2eab353f-d7ed-4f22-883e-0b62c7bc4f9b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:674b71ee-568c-45c9-a5b1-c8074af3011e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1ee4a294-be0f-48c9-a2f2-e537c2f57e7c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Individuals with RIDDLE syndrome due to RNF168 exhibit increased cellular radiosensitivity.

In addition, RNF168 mutations have been causally linked to the human RIDDLE syndrome. In this study, we report that Rnf168(-/-) mice are immunodeficient and exhibit increased radiosensitivity. Rnf168(-/-) males suffer from impaired spermatogenesis in an age-dependent manner. Interestingly, in contrast to H2a.x(-/-), Mdc1(-/-), and Rnf8(-/-) cells, transient recruitment of 53bp1 to DNA double-strand breaks was abolished in Rnf168(-/-) cells. Remarkably, similar to 53bp1 inactivation, but different from H2a.x deficiency, inactivation of Rnf168 impairs long-range V(D)J recombination in thymocytes and results in long insertions at the class-switch junctions of B-cells. Loss of Rnf168 increases genomic instability and synergizes with p53 inactivation in promoting tumorigenesis.

RIDDLE syndrome is named for its clinical features which include Radiosensitivity, ImmunoDeficiency, Dysmorphic features, and LEarning difficulties. Four variants (nonsense and frameshift) that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 19203578, 21394101, 29255463). Information regarding the phenotype of heterozygous carriers is limited; however, one parent of a proband was noted to have B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 19203578). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by biochemical studies, functional and rescue assays, and an animal model (PMIDs: 19203578, 17940005, 29255463, 21394101, 21552324). RNF168 is critical for double stranded break repair (PMID: 19203578), and RIDDLE syndrome patient cells show defects in 53BP1-mediated DNA damage signaling (PMID: 17940005, 29255463). These defects are rescued by wild type RNF168 (PMID: 19203578, 21394101). RNF168 knockout mice have radiosensitivity and immunodeficiency consistent with RIDDLE syndrome (PMID: 21552324).\n\nIn summary, RNF168 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RIDDLE syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date July 21, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2eab353f-d7ed-4f22-883e-0b62c7bc4f9b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
