Heterozygous mutations in HRAS are responsible for Costello syndrome, with more than 80% of the patients harboring the specific p.Gly12Ser variant. These individuals show a homogeneous phenotype. The clinical characteristics of the Costello syndrome individuals harboring rarer HRAS mutations are less understood, due to the small number of reported cases. Here, we describe the phenotypic spectrum of five additional individuals with HRAS c.38G>A; p.Gly13Asp, including one with somatic mosaicism, and review five previously described cases. The facial and hair abnormalities of the HRAS p.Gly13Asp individuals differ from the typical pattern observed in those showing the common HRAS (p.Gly12Ser) mutation, with less coarse facial features and slow growing, sparse hair with abnormal texture, the latter resembling the pattern observed in Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair and individuals harboring another amino acid substitution in HRAS (p.Gly13Cys). Although some individuals with HRAS p.Gly13Asp developed papillomata and vascular proliferation lesions, no malignant tumors occurred, similar to what was reported for individuals harboring the HRAS p.Gly13Cys. The fact that no malignant tumors were described in these individuals does not allow definitive conclusions about the risk for cancer development. It remains to be determined if substitutions of amino acid 13 in HRAS (p.Gly13Asp and p.Gly13Cys) increase the risk of tumor development.","dc:creator":"Bertola D","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Phenotypic spectrum of Costello syndrome individuals harboring the rare HRAS mutation p.Gly13Asp."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28371260","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This case cannot be scored because the final diagnosis was Costello syndrome in the literature.

This study identified five patients with sparse, loose anagen hair and p.Gly13Asp/p.Gly13Cys variants in HRAS. The authors note that no malignant tumors have been identified in these patients, however only one patient was older than 15 yrs (28 yrs) at the time of report, and it remains to be determined if the alteration of p.Gly13 in HRAS increases risk of tumor development. These patients did develop papillomata and vascular proliferation lesions as well as other features more consistent with Costello syndrome (CS), which led to the authors concluding that these cases expand the phenotypic spectrum of CS rather than support that HRAS causes NS/LAH. Therefore, the evidence for this association is Disputed. Of note, HRAS has been definitively associated with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating HRAS with Noonan syndrome (NS), NS with multiple lentigines, or cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/25/18 (SOP Version 5).\nAn association has been suggested, but the claim by the authors was not strong.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:94630309-c540-48b3-a27f-0ee1891091c1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
