Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.","dc:creator":"Takahara M","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"CED1 missense variant affect interaction with IFT-A subunits"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The experiment outlined provides evidence for the detrimental effect of various CED1 associated missense variants on the interactions between IFT122 and other componants of IFT-A complex (IFT121 and IFT43), which is responsible for intracilial transport."},{"id":"cggv:bdf31ea5-e17d-41db-bdd0-79609419f875","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9848a207-cd39-4d67-8f1d-52f742eb2f60","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Primary Cilia in Control and CED Patient Fibroblasts\nPatient fibroblasts showed significantly reduced frequency and length of primary cilia in patient cells compared to controls.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493458","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) is a disorder characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and ectodermal abnormalities. Most cases reported to date are sporadic, but a few familial cases support an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern. Aiming at the elucidation of the genetic basis of CED, we collected 13 patients with CED symptoms from 12 independent families. In one family with consanguineous parents two siblings were affected, permitting linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping. This revealed a single region of homozygosity with a significant LOD score (3.57) on chromosome 3q21-3q24. By sequencing candidate genes from this interval we found a homozygous missense mutation in the IFT122 (WDR10) gene that cosegregated with the disease. Examination of IFT122 in our patient cohort revealed one additional homozygous missense change in the patient from a second consanguineous family. In addition, we found compound heterozygosity for a donor splice-site change and a missense change in one sporadic patient. All mutations were absent in 340 control chromosomes. Because IFT122 plays an important role in the assembly and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia, we investigated patient fibroblasts and found significantly reduced frequency and length of primary cilia as compared to controls. Furthermore, we transiently knocked down ift122 in zebrafish embryos and observed the typical phenotype found in other models of ciliopathies. Because not all of our patients harbored mutations in IFT122, CED seems to be genetically heterogeneous.

To date, four genes have been shown to underlie the syndrome, namely, IFT122 (WDR10), WDR35 (IFT121), IFT43 (C14orf179), and WDR19 (IFT144). Clinical characterization of a larger cohort of patients with CED has been undertaken previously. Nevertheless, there are too few molecularly confirmed patients reported in the literature to determine precise genotype-phenotype correlations. To date, biallelic IFT122 mutations have been described in only five families. We therefore studied three unrelated Argentinian patients with typical features of CED using a 4813 next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel, which we call the \"Mendeliome.\" The three patients had different, novel, compound heterozygous mutations in IFT122. Consequently, we compared these three patients to those previously described with IFT122 mutations. Thus, our report serves to add 6 novel mutations to the IFT122 mutation spectrum and to contribute to the IFT122-related clinical characterization.","dc:creator":"Moosa

To identify and analyze causative genetic variants in nine unrelated probands mainly manifested as syndromic craniosynostosis, we reviewed the relevant medical information of the patients and performed the whole exome sequencing, further verified with Sanger sequencing and parental background. Bioinformatics analysis was used to evaluate the potential deleterious or benign effect of each genetic variant through evolutionary conservation alignment, multi-lines of computer predication and the allele frequency in population dataset (control and patient). The Standards and guidelines from American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics was used to classify and interpret the pathogenicity for each genetic variant. All the nine probands were found to carry the possibly causative variants, among which three variants including two missense mutations (c.3385C>T in IFT122 gene, c.3581A>G in SMC1A gene) and a frameshift mutation (c.434dupA in TWIST1 gene) have never been reported in patients before. We suggested Cornelia de Lange syndrome caused by SMC1A variant is a neglected syndromic craniosynostosis. Our study not only expanded genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of the rare syndromes, but also confirmed that there existed an underlying genetic mechanism. We emphasized that deliberate selection of both the potential candidates and comprehensive detection methods for genetic analysis is important to increase the genetic diagnosis yield of syndromic craninosynostosis.","dc:creator":"Xu Y","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Identification and analysis of the genetic causes in nine unrelated probands with syndromic craniosynostosis."}},{"id":"cggv:7ee44481-96ce-4626-bcb9-0e599619f058_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bd300036-c411-4ade-9e2b-3b8df16c8bce"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29037998"}],"rdfs:label":"Proband 7"},{"id":"cggv:7ee44481-96ce-4626-bcb9-0e599619f058","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ee44481-96ce-4626-bcb9-0e599619f058_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"This missense variant meets ACGM PM2 & PP3 criteria."},{"id":"cggv:34e8f9ab-02c4-44a0-8384-d04abc501d9d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:34e8f9ab-02c4-44a0-8384-d04abc501d9d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"This missense variant meets ACGM PM2 & PP3 criteria."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ebd3ff46-cad7-4861-af10-b57d300d07ab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ebd3ff46-cad7-4861-af10-b57d300d07ab","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c8ff8bb4-3161-498f-9f1e-e095049f8ed3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052989.3(IFT122):c.1715G>T (p.Gly572Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA236202"}},"detectionMethod":"The case has consanguineous parents (first cousins).

This is a multisystem ciliopathy, with skeletal and ectodermal involvement. \nSeventeen variants (10 missense, 4 frameshift, 1 deletion, 2 intronic) have been reported in 10 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 20493458, 24689072, 26792575, 29037998, 23826986, 33717254).  These variants support autosomal recessive inheritance and have been included in this curation. There is insufficient data available to score segregation in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF.  \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by mouse and zebra fish animal models (PMIDs: 19000668, 20493458). In vitro functional assays in patient and non-patients cells were supportive for the role of IFT122 gene in the number and length of cilia (PMID: 20493458, 24689072) and reduced interaction with IFT-A subunits in cells with CED1 missense variants (PMID: 29220510). \nIn summary, IFT122 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Cranioectodermal dysplasia 1 (OMIM:218330). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time (2010 to 2021).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6e4b420a-5df1-4c3c-aca8-a5359de25a5d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
