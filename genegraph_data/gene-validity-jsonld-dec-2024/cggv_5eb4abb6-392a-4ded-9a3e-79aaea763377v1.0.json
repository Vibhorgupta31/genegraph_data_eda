Individuals of apparently unrelated non consanguineous Israeli families of Jewish Indian (Mumbai) ancestry presented with isolated foveal hypoplasia associated with congenital nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping followed by fine mapping defined a 830 Kb disease-associated locus (LOD score 3.5). Whole-exome sequencing identified a single missense mutation in the homozygosity region: c.95T>G, p.(Ile32Ser), in a conserved amino acid within the first predicted transmembrane domain of SLC38A8. The mutation fully segregated with the disease-associated phenotype, demonstrating an ∼10% carrier rate in Mumbai Jews. SLC38A8 encodes a putative sodium-dependent amino-acid/proton antiporter, which we showed to be expressed solely in the eye.

We show that SLC38A8 has preference for transporting L-glutamine, L-alanine, L-arginine, L-histidine and L-aspartate using a Na+-dependent transport mechanism and that the functional characteristics of SNAT8 have highest similarity to the known System A transporters. We also provide a comprehensive central nervous system expression profile in mouse brain for the Slc38a8 gene and the SNAT8 protein. We show that Slc38a8 (SNAT8) is expressed in all neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, in mouse brain using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, proximity ligation assay shows highly similar subcellular expression of SNAT7 and SNAT8. In conclusion, the neuronal SLC38A8 has a broad amino acid transport profile and is the first identified neuronal System A transporter.

SLC38A8 is a putative glutamine transporter with strong expression within the photoreceptor layer in the retina. Previous studies have been limited due to lack of quantitative data on retinal development and nystagmus characteristics. In this multi-centre study, a custom-targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel was used to identify SLC38A8 mutations from a cohort of 511 nystagmus patients. We report 16 novel SLC38A8 mutations. The sixth transmembrane domain is most frequently disrupted by missense SLC38A8 mutations. Ninety percent of our cases were initially misdiagnosed as PAX6-related phenotype or ocular albinism prior to NGS. We characterized the retinal development in vivo in patients with SLC38A8 mutations using high-resolution optical coherence tomography. All patients had severe grades of arrested retinal development with lack of a foveal pit and no cone photoreceptor outer segment lengthening. Loss of foveal specialization features such as outer segment lengthening implies reduced foveal cone density, which contributes to reduced visual acuity. Unlike other disorders (such as albinism or PAX6 mutations) which exhibit a spectrum of foveal hypoplasia, SLC38A8 mutations have arrest of retinal development at an earlier stage resulting in a more under-developed retina and severe phenotype.","dc:creator":"Kuht HJ","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"SLC38A8 mutations result in arrested retinal development with loss of cone photoreceptor specialization."}},{"id":"cggv:7fa4384b-a366-4640-ab56-0640407b3d7d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:e89bb36c-208a-4d80-8073-a94d81884b17"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32744312"}],"rdfs:label":"Kuht F6"},{"id":"cggv:e34120ef-3593-454d-8e91-f9a47b198ef1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e34120ef-3593-454d-8e91-f9a47b198ef1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Absent from gnomAD from all populations.

Patients with the disorder often present with foveal hypoplasia, nystagmus, reduced visual accuity, and chiasmal misrouting. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 19 variants (frameshift, splice site, nonsense, in-frame deletion, and missense) have been reported in 16 probands from 3 publications (PMID:32744312, PMID:24290379, PMID:24045842). A summed LOD score of 7.06 was calculated from two seperate publications (PMID:24290379, PMID:24045842).\n\nThe gene *SLC38A8* encodes SNAT8 (sodium coupled neutral amino acid transporter) 8, which is expressed in all neurons and has a broad substrate profile for a number of amino acids. Due to its expression in the central nervous system and as a transporter of glutamine, it may be involved in glutamate/glutamine (GABA) cycling. This gene-disease association is further supported by its biochemical function as an amino acid transporter (PMID:25451601) and in SLC38A8 kock-down Medaka (PMID:24290379), which showed microphthalmia, coloboma, and lens defects.\n\nA classification of definitive was reached on 1/27/2022 by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5eb4abb6-392a-4ded-9a3e-79aaea763377"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
