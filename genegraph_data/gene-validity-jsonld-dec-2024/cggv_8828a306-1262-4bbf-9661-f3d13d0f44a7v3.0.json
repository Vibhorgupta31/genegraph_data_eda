We mapped an additional 40 consanguineous families segregating nonsyndromic hearing loss to the DFNB39 locus and refined the obligate interval to 1.2 Mb. The coding regions of all genes in this interval were sequenced, and no missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations were found. We sequenced the noncoding sequences of genes, as well as noncoding genes, and found three mutations clustered in intron 4 and exon 5 in the hepatocyte growth factor gene (HGF). Two intron 4 deletions occur in a highly conserved sequence that is part of the 3' untranslated region of a previously undescribed short isoform of HGF. The third mutation is a silent substitution, and we demonstrate that it affects splicing in vitro. HGF is involved in a wide variety of signaling pathways in many different tissues, yet these putative regulatory mutations cause a surprisingly specific phenotype, which is nonsydromic hearing loss. Two mouse models of Hgf dysregulation, one in which an Hgf transgene is ubiquitously overexpressed and the other a conditional knockout that deletes Hgf from a limited number of tissues, including the cochlea, result in deafness. Overexpression of HGF is associated with progressive degeneration of outer hair cells in the cochlea, whereas cochlear deletion of Hgf is associated with more general dysplasia.","dc:creator":"Schultz JM","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Noncoding mutations of HGF are associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, DFNB39."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8828a306-1262-4bbf-9661-f3d13d0f44a7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8828a306-1262-4bbf-9661-f3d13d0f44a7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0c34823-64c3-435b-9743-418b57c91a19","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64ca19a5-458e-49d6-a3c0-af15ebc9470b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Hgf was expressed in the mouse cochlear duct as early as E15.5.

During mouse embryonic development, a subpopulation of neural crest cell-derived melanocytes migrates and incorporates into a subregion of the cochlear epithelium, forming the intermediate cell layer of the stria vascularis. The relation of this developmental process to stria vascularis function is currently unknown. In characterizing the molecular differentiation of developing peripheral auditory structures, we discovered that hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf) is expressed in the future stria vascularis of the cochlear epithelium. Its receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, is expressed in the cochlear epithelium and melanocyte-derived intermediate cells in the stria vascularis. Genetic dissection of HGF signaling via c-MET reveals that the incorporation of the melanocytes into the future stria vascularis of the cochlear duct requires c-MET signaling. In addition, inactivation of either the ligand or receptor developmentally resulted in a profound hearing loss at young adult stages. These results suggest a novel connection between HGF signaling and deafness via melanocyte deficiencies.","dc:creator":"Shibata S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Hepatocyte Growth Factor-c-MET Signaling Mediates the Development of Nonsensory Structures of the Mammalian Cochlea and Hearing."},"rdfs:label":"Shibata Expressioin"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:33c826e3-12ef-4269-bc17-b7b2b8d52564","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ad6892f5-dd8e-444d-a076-b34819361310","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Phenotype is the same as in humans.

At least three unique variants (silent, deep intronic deletions) that have been reported in 3 probands in one publication are included in this curation (PMID: 19576567). One of the deep intronic deletions is a founder variant in Pakistan and is present in at least 36 families with hearing loss (PMID: 19576567). Variants in this gene also segregated with disease in at least 41 additional individuals in 22 families (PMID: 19576567). The mechanism for disease is likely loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression and biochemical function studies, along with at least four mouse models, one of which recapitulates the deafness phenotype with the same 10 bp deletion of *Hgf* in the intron in humans (27488639, 19576567, 32152201). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 1/16/2018 as per SOP v5. It was reevaluated on 5/3/2024 using SOP v10. No new evidence has been reviewed or added.
