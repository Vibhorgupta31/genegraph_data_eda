Genomic rearrangements of TADs have been shown to cause gene misexpression and disease, but genome-wide depletion of CTCF has no drastic effects on transcription. Here, we investigate TAD function in vivo in mouse limb buds at the Sox9-Kcnj2 locus. We show that the removal of all major CTCF sites at the boundary and within the TAD resulted in a fusion of neighboring TADs, without major effects on gene expression. Gene misexpression and disease phenotypes, however, were achieved by redirecting regulatory activity through inversions and/or the repositioning of boundaries. Thus, TAD structures provide robustness and precision but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. Aberrant disease-related gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation but requires CTCF-dependent redirection of enhancer-promoter contacts.","dc:creator":"Despang A","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Functional dissection of the Sox9-Kcnj2 locus identifies nonessential and instructive roles of TAD architecture."},"rdfs:label":"Functional dissection of the Sox9â€“Kcnj2 locus"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:a1fdeca1-a725-4ccb-a7f6-e77c2d6158aa_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3a0e26b-780f-4ce8-b612-4af68d0d30f3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:37f729df-3f5d-439a-94b3-06137b1c1cfe","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"These are overlapping phenotypes described as \"typical Cooks syndrome phenotypes\".","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27706140","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Chromosome conformation capture methods have identified subchromosomal structures of higher-order chromatin interactions called topologically associated domains (TADs) that are separated from each other by boundary regions. By subdividing the genome into discrete regulatory units, TADs restrict the contacts that enhancers establish with their target genes. However, the mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. Here we show by chromosome conformation capture (capture Hi-C and 4C-seq methods) that genomic duplications in patient cells and genetically modified mice can result in the formation of new chromatin domains (neo-TADs) and that this process determines their molecular pathology. Duplications of non-coding DNA within the mouse Sox9 TAD (intra-TAD) that cause female to male sex reversal in humans, showed increased contact of the duplicated regions within the TAD, but no change in the overall TAD structure. In contrast, overlapping duplications that extended over the next boundary into the neighbouring TAD (inter-TAD), resulted in the formation of a new chromatin domain (neo-TAD) that was isolated from the rest of the genome. As a consequence of this insulation, inter-TAD duplications had no phenotypic effect. However, incorporation of the next flanking gene, Kcnj2, in the neo-TAD resulted in ectopic contacts of Kcnj2 with the duplicated part of the Sox9 regulatory region, consecutive misexpression of Kcnj2, and a limb malformation phenotype. Our findings provide evidence that TADs are genomic regulatory units with a high degree of internal stability that can be sculptured by structural genomic variations. This process is important for the interpretation of copy number variations, as these variations are routinely detected in diagnostic tests for genetic disease and cancer. This finding also has relevance in an evolutionary setting because copy-number differences are thought to have a crucial role in the evolution of genome complexity.","dc:creator":"Franke M","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Formation of new chromatin domains determines pathogenicity of genomic duplications."},"rdfs:label":"Dup-C2 mice indicate misexpression of Kcnj2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Data suggests misexpression of Kcnj2 causes Cooks syndrome."},{"id":"cggv:9e93b97a-67b3-4e9e-82d9-bd895ada867f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:779b79e5-0e3b-4fb2-b18f-281167f7d8e5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"These are overlapping phenotypes indicating a relationship between the variant and Cooks syndrome.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27706140","rdfs:label":"Cooks syndrome mouse model Dup-C"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The duplication extends beyond SOX9 and therefore cannot be attributed to this curation."},{"id":"cggv:d2b74a9c-fb51-4687-97ed-273f23bc26b1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1a1ebbb4-64b8-485c-9da0-5135bb227e7c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Inversion of the Sox9 regulation domain including the TAD boundary (InvC) resulted in Sox9 LOF and Kcnj2 GOF.

(PMID: 3978841). It was later associated with SOX9 (PMIDs: 19639023, 27706140, 31358994, 32470376). Evidence supporting this gene disease relationship includes segregation data and expression data. Large duplications at the 17q24.3 locus involving the coding regions of KCNJ2 and KCNJ16 as well as the regulatory region of SOX9 have been reported in patients with Cooks syndrome (PMIDs: 32583964, 32470376, 19639023). The mechanism of disease is thought to be misexpression of Kcnj2 due to a position effect which places the gene under the regulation of a SOX9 enhancer (PMID: 27706140, 32470376).  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
