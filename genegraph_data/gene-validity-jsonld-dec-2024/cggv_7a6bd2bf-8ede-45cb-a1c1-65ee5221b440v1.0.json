Given that whirlin has no known actin-regulatory activity, it remains unclear how these proteins work together to influence stereocilia length. Here we show that the actin-regulatory protein Eps8 [5] interacts with MyoXVa and that mice lacking Eps8 show short stereocilia compared to MyoXVa- and whirlin-deficient mice. We show that Eps8 fails to accumulate at the tips of stereocilia in the absence of MyoXVa, that overexpression of MyoXVa results in both elongation of stereocilia and increased accumulation of Eps8 at stereocilia tips, and that the exogenous expression of MyoXVa in MyoXVa-deficient hair cells rescues Eps8 tip localization. We find that Eps8 also interacts with whirlin and that the expression of both Eps8 and MyoXVa at stereocilia tips is reduced in whirlin-deficient mice. We conclude that MyoXVa, whirlin, and Eps8 are integral components of the stereocilia tip complex, where Eps8 is a central actin-regulatory element for elongation of the stereocilia actin core.","dc:creator":"Manor U","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Regulation of stereocilia length by myosin XVa and whirlin depends on the actin-regulatory protein Eps8."},"rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1f0b2643-d35d-4041-b227-85a9a9df70c3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dbb52f32-0afd-4f69-bd61-8ec972402421","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Immunofluorescent localization showed EPS8 concentrated at stereociliary tips, consistent with all other reports.

The transduction of sound waves into electrical signals depends upon mechanosensitive hair bundles that project from the cell's apical surface. Each stereocilium within a hair bundle is composed of uniformly polarized and tightly packed actin filaments. Several stereociliary proteins have been shown to be associated with hair bundle development and function and are known to cause deafness in mice and humans when mutated. The growth of the stereociliar actin core is dynamically regulated at the actin filament barbed ends in the stereociliary tip. We show that Eps8, a protein with actin binding, bundling, and barbed-end capping activities in other systems, is a novel component of the hair bundle. Eps8 is localized predominantly at the tip of the stereocilia and is essential for their normal elongation and function. Moreover, we have found that Eps8 knockout mice are profoundly deaf and that IHCs, but not OHCs, fail to mature into fully functional sensory receptors. We propose that Eps8 directly regulates stereocilia growth in hair cells and also plays a crucial role in the physiological maturation of mammalian cochlear IHCs. Together, our results indicate that Eps8 is critical in coordinating the development and functionality of mammalian auditory hair cells.","dc:creator":"Zampini V","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Eps8 regulates hair bundle length and functional maturation of mammalian auditory hair cells."},"rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence labeling"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e84761bd-3fa4-4a7b-8c01-f3cf9b899184","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5f345b7f-3a8d-4050-84c9-adcf8b4912d6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"In EPS8 KO mice, whirlin-S immunofluorescence was not detected at the tips of the tallest row of IHC or OHC stereocilia, but was present in shorter rows in OHCs only, indicating EPS8 functions to localize WHRN-S to stereocilia tips.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27117407","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"WHRN (DFNB31) mutations cause diverse hearing disorders: profound deafness (DFNB31) or variable hearing loss in Usher syndrome type II.

Lack of both isoforms causes abnormally short stereocilia and profound deafness and vestibular dysfunction. WHRN-S expression, however, is sufficient to maintain stereocilia bundle morphology and function in a subset of hair cells, resulting in some auditory response and no overt vestibular dysfunction. WHRN-S interacts with EPS8, and both are required at stereocilia tips for normal length regulation. WHRN-L localizes midway along the shorter stereocilia, at the level of inter-stereociliary links.

Of these, 70 (42.9%) variants identified in 29 genes are novel. As expected from genetic studies of disorders segregating in consanguineous families, the majority of affected individuals (94.4%) are homozygous for HL-associated variants, with the other variants being compound heterozygotes. The five most common HL genes in the Pakistani population are SLC26A4, MYO7A, GJB2, CIB2 and HGF, respectively. Our study provides a profile of the genetic etiology of HL in Pakistani families, which will allow for the development of more efficient genetic diagnostic tools, aid in accurate genetic counseling, and guide application of future gene-based therapies. These findings are also valuable in interpreting pathogenicity of variants that are potentially associated with HL in individuals of all ancestries.
