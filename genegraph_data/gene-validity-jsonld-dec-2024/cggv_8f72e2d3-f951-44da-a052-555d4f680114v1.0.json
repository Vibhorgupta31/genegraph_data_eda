Currently, there are over 400 known mutations in 14 different genes, leading to five overlapping clinical variants of NCL. A large portion of these mutations lead to premature stop codons (PTCs) and are predicted to predispose mRNA transcripts to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Nonsense-mediated decay is associated with a number of other genetic diseases and is an important regulator of disease pathogenesis. We contend that NMD targets PTCs in NCL gene transcripts for degradation. A number of PTC mutations in CLN1, CLN2 and CLN3 lead to a significant decrease in mRNA transcripts and a corresponding decrease in protein levels and function in patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines. Inhibiting NMD leads to an increased transcript level, and where protein function is known, increased activity. Treatment with read-through drugs also leads to increased protein function. Thus, NMD provides a promising therapeutic target that would allow read-through of transcripts to enhance protein function and possibly ameliorate Batten disease pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Miller JN","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"The role of nonsense-mediated decay in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."},"rdfs:label":"Endogenous expression of PPT1 in patients with infantile NCL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8f72e2d3-f951-44da-a052-555d4f680114_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:213276d6-df16-4f73-a442-e7879bea76b7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c6938fe-a417-4e3a-a5ad-3eed61de6ca8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinose (NCL) is a neurodegenerative disorder in children characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material within the lysosomes, astrocytosis and microglial activation, and significant loss of neurons within the retina and central nervous system.

Patients with mutations in CLN1 primarily manifest with infantile NCL (INCL or Haltia-Santavuori disease), which is second only to congenital NCL for its age of onset and devastating progression. CLN1 encodes a lysosomal enzyme, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). Nonsense mutations in CLN1 account for 52.3% of all disease causing alleles in infantile NCL, the most common of which worldwide is the p.R151X mutation. Previously, we have shown how nonsense-mediated decay is involved in the degradation of CLN1 mRNA transcripts containing the p.R151X mutation in human lymphoblast cell lines. We have also shown how the read-through drugs gentamicin and ataluren (PTC124) increase CLN1 (PPT1) enzyme activity. Here, we provide the initial characterization of the novel Cln1(R151X) mouse model of infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis that we have generated. This nonsense mutation model recapitulates the molecular, histological and behavioral phenotypes of the human disease. Cln1(R151X) mice showed a significant decrease in Cln1 mRNA level and PPT1 enzyme activity, accumulation of autofluorescent storage material, astrocytosis and microglial activation in the brain. Behavioral characterization of Cln1(R151X) mice at 3 and 5 months of age revealed significant motor deficits as measured by the vertical pole and rotarod tests.

The disease results in blindness, motor and cognitive deterioration, and seizures. Characteristic inclusion bodies (granular osmiophilic deposits [GROD]) are found in the brain and other tissues. The vast majority of Finnish cases are homozygous for a missense mutation (R122W) that severely affects PPT enzyme activity, and the clinical course in Finnish children is uniformly rapidly progressive and fatal. To define the clinical, biochemical, and molecular genetic characteristics of subjects with PPT deficiency in a broader population, we collected blood samples from U.S. and Canadian subjects representing 32 unrelated families with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis who had GROD documented morphologically. We measured PPT activity and screened the coding region of the PPT gene for mutations. In 29 of the families, PPT deficiency was found to be responsible for the neurodegenerative disorder, and mutations were identified in 57 out of 58 PPT alleles. One nonsense mutation (R151X) accounted for 40% of the alleles and was associated with severe disease in the homozygous state. A second mutation (T75P) accounted for 13% of the alleles and was associated with a late onset and protracted clinical course. A total of 19 different mutations were found, resulting in a broader spectrum of clinical presentations than previously seen in the Finnish population. Symptoms first appeared at ages ranging from 3 mo to 9 yr, and about half of the subjects have survived into the second or even third decades of life.","dc:creator":"Das AK","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Molecular genetics of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase deficiency in the U.S."}},"rdfs:label":"Infantile NCL 9"},{"id":"cggv:b2112d49-8176-45c3-940f-c9b2a527d77e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b2112d49-8176-45c3-940f-c9b2a527d77e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b2112d49-8176-45c3-940f-c9b2a527d77e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This nonsense mutation model recapitulates the molecular, histological and behavioral phenotypes of the human disease.

NCL is a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material in different patterns ultrastructurally. NCL presents with visual deficits due to retinal degeneration that gradually progresses to severe visual impairment. Many variants (variant types including missense, nonsense, splicing) have been described in literature (PMID:9664077). Of all variants described, one nonsense mutation, p.Arg151*, was described to account for 40% of the alleles and was associated with severe infantile-onset form of disease in the homozygous state (PMID: 9664077). The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) have been reached based on the abundance of patients with homozygous p.Arg151*. But more evidence is available in literature. This gene-disease association is supported by in-vitro and in-vivo studies. In patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines, those with the homozygous p.Arg151* mutation had a 6.76-fold decrease in PPT1 mRNA abundance and a corresponding decrease in PPT1 enzyme activity (PMID:23539563). A mouse model with the same homozygous nonsense mutation (PMID: 25205113) also recapitulates the molecular, histological and behavioral phenotypes of the human disease. The mouse model has a significant decrease in PPT1 mRNA and enzyme activity as well as an accumulation of autofluorescent storage material, astrocytosis and microglial activation in the brain(PMID: 25205113). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. In summary, PPT1 is definitely associated with autosomal recessive NCL. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on September 2, 2021.\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8f72e2d3-f951-44da-a052-555d4f680114"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
