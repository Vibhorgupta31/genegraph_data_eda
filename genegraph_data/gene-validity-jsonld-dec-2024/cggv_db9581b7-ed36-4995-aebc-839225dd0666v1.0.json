Out of a cohort of 1647 idiopathic PAH cases, 3 rare predicted deleterious missense variants were identified in 6 unrelated individuals with one variant recurrent in four individuals. The relationship between FBLN2 and PAH is also supported by expression evidence from GTEx bulk tissue expression. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
