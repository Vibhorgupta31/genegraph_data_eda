Biallelic loss of function variants in TECRL were first reported in 2016 (Devalla et al, 2016, PMID:27861123), with a homozygous missense variant (p.Arg196Gln) detected in two unrelated patients of French Canadian origin and a homozygous splice donor variant (c.331+1G>A) detected in a large consanguineous Sudanese pedigree where 7/13 children (all homozygous) has exercise-induces arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death (LOD=4.36). Another report described compound heterozygous variants in a 13 year old child with CPVT (p.Arg196Gln and c.918+3T>G), although the effect of the splice region variant was not proven (Xie et al, 2019, PMID:30790670). A multi-centre review published in 2020 provided an update on these cases and described two additional CPVT cases (homozygous p.Tyr197Ter nonsense variant and homozygous exon 2 deletion) and a family with three children with sudden cardiac death, where one was homozygous for the c.331+1G>A splice donor variant (Webster et al, 2020, PMID:33367594). Finally, another study described 4 CPVT cases with TECRL variants detected by diagnostic sequencing, including homozygous missense (p.Pro290His) and nonsense variants (p.Gln139Ter), compound heterozygous variants (p.Ser309Ter/p.Val298Ala) and a large homozygous duplication that covered the TECRL gene (the effect of this variant on TECRL gene expression is unknown and the scoring was downgraded accordingly) (Mosku-Gregor et al, 2020, PMID:32173957). These cases presented with phenotypic features typical of CPVT, including exercise and emotion induced syncope and cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmias during exercise testing. A mild prolonged QT interval was observed in several cases, especially after stimulation by epinephrine or exercise, although overall the phenotypes are much more typical of CPVT than LQTS. The association of TECRL with CPVT is also supported by experimental evidence with clear functional effects observed in iPSC derived cardiomyocytes generated from a patient with the homozygous c.331+1G>A variant. In summary, TECRL variants are definitively associated with autosomal recessive CPVT. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6889dc44-eef0-4a4d-8fdb-aef2dc570f29"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
