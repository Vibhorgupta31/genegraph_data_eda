We have identified two proteins, Mpc1 and Mpc2, as essential for mitochondrial pyruvate transport in yeast, Drosophila, and humans. Mpc1 and Mpc2 associate to form an ~150-kilodalton complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Yeast and Drosophila mutants lacking MPC1 display impaired pyruvate metabolism, with an accumulation of upstream metabolites and a depletion of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Loss of yeast Mpc1 results in defective mitochondrial pyruvate uptake, and silencing of MPC1 or MPC2 in mammalian cells impairs pyruvate oxidation. A point mutation in MPC1 provides resistance to a known inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier. Human genetic studies of three families with children suffering from lactic acidosis and hyperpyruvatemia revealed a causal locus that mapped to MPC1, changing single amino acids that are conserved throughout eukaryotes. These data demonstrate that Mpc1 and Mpc2 form an essential part of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.","dc:creator":"Bricker DK","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A mitochondrial pyruvate carrier required for pyruvate uptake in yeast, Drosophila, and humans."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de4dba62-51ef-4e0b-942a-a2175d3f9fb1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de4dba62-51ef-4e0b-942a-a2175d3f9fb1_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.2},{"id":"cggv:97ccfaee-5ae0-4d97-b003-0b2bbb040e97_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97ccfaee-5ae0-4d97-b003-0b2bbb040e97","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:71ccf836-3594-4c8e-bfd2-33f53656f1db","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016098.4(MPC1):c.208G>A (p.Ala70Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA366398355"}},{"id":"cggv:202a1485-49fc-4320-ad79-42ae79b669f6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016098.4(MPC1):c.290G>A (p.Arg97Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA366398178"}}],"phenotypeFreeText":"This is a Chinese boy with Leigh-like syndrome.

The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) plays a vital role in transporting pyruvate from the cytosol into the organelle. In humans, MPC is a hetero-oligomeric complex formed by the MPC1 and MPC2 paralogs that are both necessary to stabilize each other and form a functional MPC. MPC deficiency (OMIM#614741) due to pathogenic MPC1 variants is a rare autosomal recessive disease involving developmental delay, microcephaly, growth failure, and increased serum lactate and pyruvate. To date, two MPC1 variants in four cases have been reported, though only one with a detailed clinical description. Herein, we report three novel pathogenic MPC1 variants in six patients from three unrelated families, identified within European, Kuwaiti, and Chinese mitochondrial disease patient cohorts, one of whom presented as a Leigh-like syndrome. Functional analysis in primary fibroblasts from the patients revealed decreased expression of MPC1 and MPC2. We rescued pyruvate-driven oxygen consumption rate in patient's fibroblasts by reconstituting with wild-type MPC1. Complementing homozygous MPC1 mutant cDNA with CRISPR-deleted MPC1 C2C12 cells verified the mechanism of variants: unstable MPC complex or ablated pyruvate uptake activity. Furthermore, we showed that glutamine and beta-hydroxybutyrate were alternative substrates to maintain mitochondrial respiration when cells lack pyruvate. In conclusion, we expand the clinical phenotypes and genotypes associated with MPC deficiency, with our studies revealing glutamine as a potential therapy for MPC deficiency.","dc:creator":"Jiang H","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Identification and characterization of novel MPC1 gene variants causing mitochondrial pyruvate carrier deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:73ba3482-792a-43aa-b0d2-15e1e9741f2d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:202a1485-49fc-4320-ad79-42ae79b669f6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873722"}],"rdfs:label":"Jiang_F1-1"},{"id":"cggv:756c3e96-541f-487c-ad8e-9012930f5c8a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:756c3e96-541f-487c-ad8e-9012930f5c8a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:756c3e96-541f-487c-ad8e-9012930f5c8a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In his fibroblasts, cellular extracts from the patient exhibited significantly reduced protein levels of MPC1 in F1-I, and MPC2 protein levels were also reduced in F1-I compared to healthy controls. \n\nMPC1 mRNA analysis targeting exon 3 was used to identify the expression of all MPC1 transcripts (full-length transcripts with missense variants and truncated transcripts), while mRNA analysis targeting exon 4 was used to evaluate the full-length transcripts harboring missense variants.

Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Metabolite transport"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Function shared with 2-5 gene products previously associated with PMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:de4dba62-51ef-4e0b-942a-a2175d3f9fb1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30d84cda-ff0c-4669-ac93-99501e901f18","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:24ebb4d8-4609-470e-a666-d8fcac1d1e2e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Authors performed MPC1 knock out in C2C12 cells.

This gene encodes mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 that mediates the uptake of pyruvate into the mitochondria.\n\n*MPC1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2012 (PMID: 22628558) although the first reported family was described in 2003 (PMID: 12649063), in three families with a defect in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. The first family, initially described in 2003, had the most severely affected individuals with neonatal encephalopathy and elevated lactate while the other two families were less severely affected and had variable developmental delay and cognitive impairment. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MPC1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MPC1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven unique missense variants identified in 14 affected individuals from nine kindreds from three publications (PMIDs: 22628558, 36079864, 34873722). Age of onset was early in life, ranging from the prenatal period to the first couple months of life. Outcomes were also variable, ranging from death at 19 months of age to an individual being alive at 20-years-old at the time of report. Of note, one individual was treated with the ketogenic diet (PMID: 36079864) and another with L-glutamine (PMID: 34873722), with clinical improvement reported. Features in affected individuals include intrauterine growth restriction, encephalopathy, severe developmental delay, hypotonia, infantile spasms, refractory epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, microcephaly, diabetes, hearing loss, and growth failure, and there is one report of Leigh-like syndrome (PMID: 34873722). Muscle biopsy showed decreased pyruvate oxidation. Brain imaging ranged from normal to cerebral atrophy and features of the Leigh syndrome spectrum. Metabolic labs showed elevated pyruvate (blood), lactate (blood/cerebrospinal fluid); and 3-OH-butyric, alpha-ketoglutaric, 4-OH-phenylactic, and 4-OH-phenylpyruvic acids in urine.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function (PMID: 33340416), functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMID: 34873722), and yeast, drosophila, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMID: 22628558).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MPC1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 20, 2023 (SOP Version 10).
