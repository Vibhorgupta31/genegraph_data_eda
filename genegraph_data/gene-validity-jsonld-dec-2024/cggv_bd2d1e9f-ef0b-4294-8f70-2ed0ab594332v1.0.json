Six variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense) that have been reported in six probands in four publications (PMIDs: 20420808, 22067973, 29261186, 30232381) are included in this curation, but only one variant (nonsense) was scored, as the other variants were present in unaffected family members and/or too frequent in population databases. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (NCBI fetal expression data). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
