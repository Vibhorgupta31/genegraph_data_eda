With the recent discovery of the cblJ defect in two patients with phenotypes mimicking the cblF defect, there are nine genes known to be involved in cobalamin metabolism. The new defect is caused by mutations in the ABCD4 gene, encoding an ABC transporter. At the moment, there is no clear distinction between the cblJ and cblF defects either clinically or biochemically, and both defects result in blocks in the transport of cobalamin from the lysosome to the cytoplasm. A patient was diagnosed with hyperhomocysteinemia and methylmalonic aciduria at the age of 8 years. Incorporations of both [(14)C]propionate and [(14)C]methyltetrahydrofolate in cultured fibroblasts were within reference ranges and thus too high to allow for complementation analysis. We observed decreased synthesis of both adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin and accumulation of unmetabolized cyanocobalamin. Exome sequencing was performed to identify causative mutation(s) and Sanger re-sequencing was performed to validate segregation of mutation in the family. By this approach, a homozygous mutation, c.423C>G, in the ABCD4 gene was identified. Here, we report the successful application of exome sequencing for diagnosis of a rare inborn error of vitamin B(12) metabolism in a patient whose unusual presentation precluded diagnosis using standard biochemical and genetic approaches. The patient represents only the third known patient with the cblJ disorder.","dc:creator":"Kim JC","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Late onset of symptoms in an atypical patient with the cblJ inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism: diagnosis and novel mutation revealed by exome sequencing."}},"rdfs:label":"Kim 2012 - Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:ecf85679-db25-4f45-9fb5-acbec384260b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ecf85679-db25-4f45-9fb5-acbec384260b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ecf85679-db25-4f45-9fb5-acbec384260b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"[From PMID: 28572511] This variant disrupts the interaction between ABCD4 and LMBD1, as demonstrated by high-throughput FACS + FRET measurements and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4A, B).

Using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing, we identified causal mutations in ABCD4, a gene that codes for an ABC transporter, which was previously thought to have peroxisomal localization and function. Our results show that ABCD4 colocalizes with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and LMBD1, the latter of which is deficient in the cblF defect.

Utilizing whole-exome sequencing, we found two novel MTR variants c.871C>T (p.Pro291Ser) and c.1771C>T (p.Arg591*) in Patient 1, and a ABCD4 homozygous variant c.423C>G (p.Asn141Lys) in Patient 2. Our study identified the first cblG patient and cblJ patient in mainland China, and highlighted comprehensive metabolic analyses and genetic tests in patients suspected of cbl defects. It also indicated that supplementary MS/MS assay for tHCY in DBS may be practical for early diagnosis of homocysteinemia, without repeated blood sampling.","dc:creator":"Liu Y","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Patients with cobalamin G or J defect missed by the current newborn screening program: diagnosis and novel mutations."}},"rdfs:label":"Liu 2019 - Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:4f1f5336-d504-4dae-93b2-14f2b2c655e1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f1f5336-d504-4dae-93b2-14f2b2c655e1_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:4f1f5336-d504-4dae-93b2-14f2b2c655e1_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"From PMID: 28572511 -- This variant disrupts the interaction between ABCD4 and LMBD1, as demonstrated by high-throughput FACS + FRET measurements and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4A, B).

Mutations in several genes, involving predominantly the KIT ligand/c-Kit and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways, have been implicated in a spectrum of diseases in which there is hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation or both. Here, we report on a 12-year-old girl from Taiwan with a 6-year history of diffuse progressive skin hyperpigmentation resulting from a different aetiology: an inborn metabolic disorder of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), designated cblJ. Using whole-exome sequencing we identified a homozygous mutation in ABCD4 (c.423C>G; p.Asn141Lys), which encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter with a role in the intracellular processing of cobalamin. The patient had biochemical and haematological evidence of cobalamin deficiency but no other clinical abnormalities apart from a slight lightening of her previously black hair. Of note, she had no neurological symptoms or signs. Treatment with oral cobalamin (3 mg daily) led to metabolic correction and some reduction in the skin hyperpigmentation at the 3-month follow-up. This case demonstrates that defects or deficiencies of cobalamin should be remembered in the differential diagnosis of diffuse hyperpigmentary skin disorders.","dc:creator":"Takeichi T","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Progressive hyperpigmentation in a Taiwanese child due to an inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism (cblJ)."}},"rdfs:label":"Takeichi 2015 - Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:3caa65e2-6271-4398-a4b8-6784382986e9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3caa65e2-6271-4398-a4b8-6784382986e9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3caa65e2-6271-4398-a4b8-6784382986e9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"[From PMID: 28572511] This variant disrupts the interaction between ABCD4 and LMBD1, as demonstrated by high-throughput FACS + FRET measurements and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4A, B).

A similar phenotype is caused by mutations in LMBRD1, which encodes the lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1. These findings suggested to us that ABCD4 translocated from the ER to lysosomes in association with LMBD1. In this report, it is demonstrated that ABCD4 interacts with LMBD1 and then localizes to lysosomes, and this translocation depends on the lysosomal targeting ability of LMBD1. Furthermore, endogenous ABCD4 was localized to both lysosomes and the ER, and its lysosomal localization was disturbed by knockout of LMBRD1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that the subcellular localization of the ABC transporter is determined by its association with an adaptor protein.","dc:creator":"Kawaguchi K","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Translocation of the ABC transporter ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes requires the escort protein LMBD1."},"rdfs:label":"ABCD4 - LMBD1 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:568266fc-ca9f-4fa0-972f-57fe2c41b824","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c97c9a3-622b-4d60-92e3-aec57c7c6852","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"ABCD4 is involved in cobalamin uptake, performing the final step of transporting cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane and into the cytosol.

The primary features of this condition include elevated methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine in blood and/or urine. However, the presentation can be variable and may include hypotonia, anemia, and pigmentation abnormalities of the skin and hair. The underlying mechanism is a failure to transport cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane during uptake, leading to reduced intracellular levels of the enzyme cofactors AdoCbl and MeCbl (PMID: 20301503).\n\nNine variants (missense, in-frame indel, frameshift) that have been reported in eight probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 22922874; 23141461; 25234635; 28572511; 30293248; 30651581; 33729671) are included in this curation. Co-segregation with disease has not been observed. Of note, the recurrent variant c.423C>G p.(Asn141Lys) has been reported in a homozygous state in three East Asian probands, and is associated with hyperpigmentation of the skin. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by in vitro functional assays, interactions with other proteins involved in cobalamin transport, a zebrafish model, and transgenic rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 22922874; 27456980; 31113616; 33845046). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
