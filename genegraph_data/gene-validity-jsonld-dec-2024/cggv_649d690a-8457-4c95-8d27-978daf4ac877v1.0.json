Currently mutations in five genes CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C and PDE6H have been implicated in ACHM. We performed homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis in a consanguineous Pakistani ACHM family and mapped the locus to a 15.12-Mb region on chromosome 1q23.1-q24.3 with a maximum LOD score of 3.6. A DNA sample from an affected family member underwent exome sequencing. Within the ATF6 gene, a single-base insertion variant c.355_356dupG (p.Glu119Glyfs*8) was identified, which completely segregates with the ACHM phenotype within the family. The frameshift variant was absent in public variant databases, in 130 exomes from unrelated Pakistani individuals, and in 235 ethnically matched controls. The variant is predicted to result in a truncated protein that lacks the DNA binding and transmembrane domains and therefore affects the function of ATF6 as a transcription factor that initiates the unfolded protein response during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Immunolabeling with anti-ATF6 antibodies showed localization throughout the mouse neuronal retina, including retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptor cells, inner nuclear layer, inner and outer plexiform layers, with a more prominent signal in retinal ganglion cells. In contrast to cytoplasmic expression of wild-type protein, in heterologous cells ATF6 protein with the p.Glu119Glyfs*8 variant is mainly confined to the nucleus. Our results imply that response to ER stress as mediated by the ATF6 pathway is essential for color vision in humans.","dc:creator":"Ansar M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Mutation of ATF6 causes autosomal recessive achromatopsia."},"rdfs:label":"RT-PCR, Western, and immunolocalization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:649d690a-8457-4c95-8d27-978daf4ac877_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bc2ac97-defc-4028-a6c2-dd51b2832cf5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bedc7aa3-d5d7-42a6-9d90-ed29caefd654","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Transfected HEK293 cells with DHFR fusion constructs for WT or p.Arg324Cys ATF (described above).

Here, we performed genetic sequencing in 3 patients from 2 families with ACHM, identifying and functionally characterizing 2 mutations in the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) gene. We identified a homozygous deletion covering exons 8-14 of the ATF6 gene from 2 siblings from the same family.

We recently identified activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) as a genetic cause of achromatopsia. ATF6 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response. In response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ATF6 migrates from the ER to Golgi to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis to release a cytosolic domain containing a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcriptional activator. The cleaved ATF6 fragment migrates to the nucleus to transcriptionally up-regulate protein-folding enzymes and chaperones. ATF6 mutations in patients with achromatopsia include missense, nonsense, splice site, and single-nucleotide deletion or duplication changes found across the entire gene. Here, we comprehensively tested the function of achromatopsia-associated ATF6 mutations and found that they group into three distinct molecular pathomechanisms: class 1 ATF6 mutants show impaired ER-to-Golgi trafficking and diminished regulated intramembrane proteolysis and transcriptional activity; class 2 ATF6 mutants bear the entire ATF6 cytosolic domain with fully intact transcriptional activity and constitutive induction of downstream target genes, even in the absence of ER stress; and class 3 ATF6 mutants have complete loss of transcriptional activity because of absent or defective bZIP domains. Primary fibroblasts from patients with class 1 or class 3 ATF6 mutations show increased cell death in response to ER stress. Our findings reveal that human ATF6 mutations interrupt distinct sequential steps of the ATF6 activation mechanism. We suggest that increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced damage during retinal development underlies the pathology of achromatopsia in patients with ATF6 mutations.","dc:creator":"Chiang WC","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Achromatopsia mutations target sequential steps of ATF6 activation."},"rdfs:label":"Transcriptional activity in fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:8dfcc6ad-26d9-46d8-9965-0b3f5cc40cac","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42a27f26-00c5-4eb4-9bdf-d8246d4f236b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Exposed fibroblasts to tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation that causes protein misfolding in the ER and potently activates ATF6A.

Here, we present findings from a cohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease, who have had whole-genome sequencing (n = 605), whole-exome sequencing (n = 72), or both (n = 45) performed, as part of the NIHR-BioResource Rare Diseases research study. We identified pathogenic variants (single-nucleotide variants, indels, or structural variants) for 404/722 (56%) individuals. Whole-genome sequencing gives unprecedented power to detect three categories of pathogenic variants in particular: structural variants, variants in GC-rich regions, which have significantly improved coverage compared to whole-exome sequencing, and variants in non-coding regulatory regions. In addition to previously reported pathogenic regulatory variants, we have identified a previously unreported pathogenic intronic variant in CHM in two males with choroideremia. We have also identified 19 genes not previously known to be associated with inherited retinal disease, which harbor biallelic predicted protein-truncating variants in unsolved cases. Whole-genome sequencing is an increasingly important comprehensive method with which to investigate the genetic causes of inherited retinal disease.","dc:creator":"Carss KJ","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Comprehensive Rare Variant Analysis via Whole-Genome Sequencing to Determine the Molecular Pathology of Inherited Retinal Disease."}},"rdfs:label":"W000143"},{"id":"cggv:9f4b2056-dce1-44f4-9203-1cb15c288029","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9f4b2056-dce1-44f4-9203-1cb15c288029_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:353884b7-6438-4d3f-8044-a10a59e3b7b1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:353884b7-6438-4d3f-8044-a10a59e3b7b1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":16,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f4ab63cd-681b-4bbd-a962-54b5d3e3c78d"},"detectionMethod":"Haplotype analysis followed by homozygosity mapping; two candidate intervals identified; one of chromosome 1 and one on chromosome 7.

The term ATF6-related retinopathy is used here to describe the disease entity associated with this gene. Achromatopsia is an early-onset retinal dystrophy characterized by impaired color vision, photophobia, nystagmus, reduced visual acuity. Additional features on ocular exam include foveal hypoplasia and cone photoreceptor dysfunction. Twelve variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, splice site) that have been reported in sixteen probands in five publications (PMIDs: 26070061, 26029869; 26063662, 28041643, 31237654) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. For example, of note, two multi-exon deletions in ATF6 were reported by Lee et al. (PMID: 32271167) as causative for autosomal recessive achromatopsia in two families, though these variants were not scored as part of this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including animal studies, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 26063662, 26029869, 26070061, 32271167, 28028229, 34561305). ATF6 has been shown to be expressed in mouse retina (PMID: 26070061). While wildtype ATF6 has been shown in vitro to have expression throughout the cytoplasm and localization to the ER, mutant ATF6 had significantly reduced localization in the cytoplasm (PMID: 26063662). In addition, ATF6 variants have been shown to impaired transcriptional activity in vitro (PMID: 32271167). Knockout Atf6 mice have functional deficits in photoreceptor cells (PMID: 26029869. However, the phenotype of Atf6 knock out mice does not completely recapitulate the features of human achromatopsia, as alterations in photoreceptor function are only seen at an older age in mice. Retinal organoids derived from human iPSCs with ATF6 variants are shown to have abnormal cone photoreceptor cells, lacking inner and outer segments, but typical rod photoreceptors (PMID: 34561305). In summary, ATF6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ATF6 retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on the meeting date 10/07/2021 (SOP Version #8). This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the General GCEP on 11/16/2016 and reevaluated by the Retina GCEP in 2021. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed. The original classification was Strong and it was re-classified to Definitive due to additional genetic and experimental evidence and the demonstration of evidence for this gene-disease relationship over six years. This classification was approved by the Retina GCEP on Oct 7, 2021.\nBased on the number of points awarded.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:649d690a-8457-4c95-8d27-978daf4ac877"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
