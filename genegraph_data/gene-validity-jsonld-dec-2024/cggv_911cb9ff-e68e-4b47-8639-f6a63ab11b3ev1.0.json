While many rare variants in synaptic proteins have been identified in patients with ASD, little is known about their effects at the synapse and their interactions with other genetic variations. Here, following the discovery of two de novo SHANK2 deletions by the Autism Genome Project, we identified a novel 421 kb de novo SHANK2 deletion in a patient with autism. We then sequenced SHANK2 in 455 patients with ASD and 431 controls and integrated these results with those reported by Berkel et al. 2010 (n = 396 patients and n = 659 controls). We observed a significant enrichment of variants affecting conserved amino acids in 29 of 851 (3.4%) patients and in 16 of 1,090 (1.5%) controls (P = 0.004, OR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.23-4.70). In neuronal cell cultures, the variants identified in patients were associated with a reduced synaptic density at dendrites compared to the variants only detected in controls (P = 0.0013). Interestingly, the three patients with de novo SHANK2 deletions also carried inherited CNVs at 15q11-q13 previously associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. In two cases, the nicotinic receptor CHRNA7 was duplicated and in one case the synaptic translation repressor CYFIP1 was deleted. These results strengthen the role of synaptic gene dysfunction in ASD but also highlight the presence of putative modifier genes, which is in keeping with the \"multiple hit model\" for ASD. A better knowledge of these genetic interactions will be necessary to understand the complex inheritance pattern of ASD.","dc:creator":"Leblond CS","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Genetic and functional analyses of SHANK2 mutations suggest a multiple hit model of autism spectrum disorders."},"rdfs:label":"SHANK2 isoforms are differentially expressed in human tissue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c15f819a-a8fd-49f4-9c5f-4007609bb896","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5ee2883-db4c-4e41-9098-a173cb9c22c8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"This is a review on SHANK genes which describes the conserved domains and the pathways these genes are involved.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28179641","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Several large-scale genomic studies have supported an association between cases of autism spectrum disorder and mutations in the genes SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 1 (SHANK1), SHANK2 and SHANK3, which encode a family of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins that are present at glutamatergic synapses in the CNS.

Particularly challenging are those disorders rare enough to have eluded recognition as a discrete clinical entity, those with highly variable clinical manifestations, and those that are difficult to distinguish from other, very similar, disorders. Here we demonstrate the power of using an unbiased genotype-driven approach to identify subsets of patients with similar disorders. By studying 1,133 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders, and their parents, using a combination of exome sequencing and array-based detection of chromosomal rearrangements, we discovered 12 novel genes associated with developmental disorders. These newly implicated genes increase by 10% (from 28% to 31%) the proportion of children that could be diagnosed. Clustering of missense mutations in six of these newly implicated genes suggests that normal development is being perturbed by an activating or dominant-negative mechanism.

The diagnostic potential of a targeted panel of ASD genes has only been evaluated in small cohorts to date and is especially understudied in the Chinese population. Here, we designed a capture panel with 358 genes (111 syndromic and 247 nonsyndromic) for ASD and sequenced a Chinese cohort of 539 cases evaluated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) as well as 512 controls. ASD cases were found to carry significantly more ultra-rare functional variants than controls. A subset of 78 syndromic and 54 nonsyndromic genes was the most significantly associated and should be given high priority in the future screening of ASD patients. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were detected in 9.5% of cases. Variants in SHANK3 and SHANK2 were the most frequent, especially in females, and occurred in 1.2% of cases. Duplications of 15q11-13 were detected in 0.8% of cases. Variants in CNTNAP2 and MEF2C were correlated with epilepsy/tics in cases. Our findings reveal the diagnostic potential of ASD genetic panel testing and new insights regarding the variant spectrum. Genotype-phenotype correlations may facilitate the diagnosis and management of ASD.","dc:creator":"Zhou WZ","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Targeted resequencing of 358 candidate genes for autism spectrum disorder in a Chinese cohort reveals diagnostic potential and genotype-phenotype correlations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30763456","rdfs:label":"AU074003"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This score was downgraded to 1.5 because targeted panel based testing was used and the details of other testing are not available."},{"id":"cggv:ab0cb92b-0263-47c9-947f-910f45256d6b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8dfe47e6-1746-4f92-bda4-e72ab61b1a53","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":37,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"37 year old male, ASD, ID, developmental delay (speech), repetitive behavior, attentional problems, febrile seizures infancy","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000729","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Karyotype, XY","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ab0cb92b-0263-47c9-947f-910f45256d6b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:66a6fcff-2011-43f6-a47d-56bd8f00f96f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012309.4(SHANK2):c.1854-3C>G (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA381957529"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30564305","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We previously performed targeted sequencing of autism risk genes in probands from the Autism Clinical and Genetic Resources in China (ACGC) (phase I).

Currently, only missense changes have been reported in individuals with schizophrenia; therefore, these variants and this phenotype are not included as part of this curation. Due to observations of loss of function (LOF) variants in both ASD and ID, this gene has been curated using the more comprehensive disease term “complex neurodevelopmental disorder” (MONDO:0100038).  \nSHANK2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder (specifically, ASD & ID) in 2010 (Berkel et al., 20473310). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. The mechanism for disease is proposed to be haploinsufficiency based on the presence of de novo LoF variants in affected individuals and functional studies from cells derived from an ASD affected individual (30911184). At least 10 unique LoF variants (3 exonic deletions, 5 nonsense, and 2 frameshift variants) have been reported in affected individuals and were used for scoring (30763456, 22495306, 30564305, 28554332, 30911184, 26350204, 20531469, 20473310). The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. Please note that all the scored variants were part of large cohort studies that did not necessarily include detailed descriptions of each individual’s phenotype. Missense variants have been observed in individuals with ASD and/or ID (22346768); however, most of these variants have been inherited from reportedly unaffected parents. These missense changes are currently classified as variants of uncertain significance and were not scored as part of this curation; additional evidence is needed to understand their role in disease causality. Further, both DGV and Gnomad have no exonic deletions covering SHANK2 gene. \nIn regards to experimental data, this gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function (28179641), expression studies (22346768), induced pluripotent stem cell models and rescue (30911184), and mouse models (30072871). In summary, SHANK2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/17/2019 (SOP Version 6).\n\nNote: A de novo 67.9kb intragenic SHANK2 deletion (PMID: 20531469, 22346768) was not scored for this curation (default score of 2) as the Clingen Allele registry in its current version is unable to provide a CA ID for variants >10kb. However this variant is a positive evidence supportive of SHANK2’s role in causing a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:911cb9ff-e68e-4b47-8639-f6a63ab11b3e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
