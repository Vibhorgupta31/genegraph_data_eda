Phenotypic variations and loss of retinal ganglion cells, as found in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), have suggested possible mitochondrial impairment. The OPA1 gene has been localized to 3q28-q29 (refs 13-19). We describe here a nuclear gene, OPA1, that maps within the candidate region and encodes a dynamin-related protein localized to mitochondria.

The predominant locus for this disorder (OPA1; MIM 165500) has been mapped to a 1.4-cM interval on chromosome 3q28-q29 flanked by markers D3S3669 and D3S3562 (ref. 3). We established a PAC contig covering the entire OPA1 candidate region of approximately 1 Mb and a sequence skimming approach allowed us to identify a gene encoding a polypeptide of 960 amino acids with homology to dynamin-related GTPases. The gene comprises 28 coding exons and spans more than 40 kb of genomic sequence. Upon sequence analysis, we identified mutations in seven independent families with ADOA. The mutations include missense and nonsense alterations, deletions and insertions, which all segregate with the disease in these families. Because most mutations probably represent null alleles, dominant inheritance of the disease may result from haploinsufficiency of OPA1. OPA1 is widely expressed and is most abundant in the retina. The presence of consensus signal peptide sequences suggests that the product of the gene OPA1 is targeted to mitochondria and may exert its function in mitochondrial biogenesis and stabilization of mitochondrial membrane integrity.","dc:creator":"Alexander C","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"OPA1, encoding a dynamin-related GTPase, is mutated in autosomal dominant optic atrophy linked to chromosome 3q28."}],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc3f3ec8-0394-4732-bb4b-d75aaa5bdbcb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:53b19fec-3c10-4d46-a3e5-f6236d13aec7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:53b19fec-3c10-4d46-a3e5-f6236d13aec7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:1c3ba182-41b5-46a6-8a16-ded23800d8a0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000003.12:g.193666294A>C (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA355795979"}},{"id":"cggv:b3156ee9-9bec-4ffc-88cc-641773bb39c6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_130837.3(OPA1):c.2809C>T (p.Arg937Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2759754"}}],"detectionMethod":"The patient and family members were subjected to mitochondrial DNA sequencing, a next-generation sequencing panel (SpastoPlex 2.0) analyzing 72 genes with known links to hereditary spastic paraparesis, spastic ataxias or other motor diseases. and confirmation of candidate pathogenic variants in OPA1 by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient was diagnosed with Behr syndrome but exhibited Leigh-like neuroimaging features.

Recently, some cases were reported to be caused by biallelic mutations in OPA1. We describe an 11-year-old girl (Pt1) and a 7-year-old boy (Pt2) with cognitive delay, ataxic gait and clinical signs suggestive of a peripheral neuropathy, with onset in early infancy. In Pt1 ocular fundus examination revealed optic disk pallor whereas Pt2 exhibited severe optic atrophy. In both children neuroimaging detected a progressive cerebellar involvement accompanied by basal ganglia hyperintensities and pathological peak levels of lactate. In both patients, muscle biopsy showed diffuse reduction of cytochrome c oxidase stain, some atrophic fibers and type II fiber grouping. Using a targeted resequencing panel in next generation sequencing, we identified the homozygous c.1180G>A/p.Ala394Thr mutation in Pt1 and the c.2779-2A>C mutation in compound heterozygosity with the c.2809C>T/p.Arg937Cys mutation in Pt2. All variants were novel and segregated in the healthy parents. Expression of OPA1 protein was significantly reduced in muscle tissues of both patients by Western blotting. We also observed in patients' fibroblasts a higher proportion of fragmented and intermediate mitochondria upon galactose treatment compared to controls, as already seen in other patients harboring mutations in OPA1. The presence of Leigh-like neuroimaging features is a novel finding in Behr syndrome and further adds to the complex genotype-phenotype correlations in OPA1-associated disorders.","dc:creator":"Rubegni A","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Leigh-like neuroimaging features associated with new biallelic mutations in OPA1."}},{"id":"cggv:3af4d503-bd9f-458d-a40f-cc275caac6af_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1c3ba182-41b5-46a6-8a16-ded23800d8a0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28442211"}],"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Rubegni_2017_PT2"},{"id":"cggv:3af4d503-bd9f-458d-a40f-cc275caac6af","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3af4d503-bd9f-458d-a40f-cc275caac6af_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3af4d503-bd9f-458d-a40f-cc275caac6af_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"OPA1 western blotting in patient muscle tissues revealed protein levels reduced by approximately 50%.

The five OPA1 mutations associated with these DOA 'plus' phenotypes were all mis-sense point mutations affecting highly conserved amino acid positions and the nuclear genes previously known to induce mtDNA multiple deletions such as POLG1, PEO1 (Twinkle) and SLC25A4 (ANT1) were ruled out.

To study the primary function of MGM1, we characterized new temperature sensitive MGM1 alleles. Examination of mitochondrial morphology in mgm1 cells indicates that fragmentation of mitochondrial reticuli is the primary phenotype associated with loss of MGM1 function, with secondary aggregation of mitochondrial fragments. This mgm1 phenotype is identical to that observed in cells with a conditional mutation in FZO1, which encodes a transmembrane GTPase required for mitochondrial fusion, raising the possibility that Mgm1p is also required for fusion. Consistent with this idea, mitochondrial fusion is blocked in mgm1 cells during mating, and deletion of DNM1, which encodes a dynamin-related GTPase required for mitochondrial fission, blocks mitochondrial fragmentation in mgm1 cells. However, in contrast to fzo1 cells, deletion of DNM1 in mgm1 cells restores mitochondrial fusion during mating. This last observation indicates that despite the phenotypic similarities observed between mgm1 and fzo1 cells, MGM1 does not play a direct role in mitochondrial fusion. Although Mgm1p was recently reported to localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane, our studies indicate that Mgm1p is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Based on our localization data and Mgm1p's structural homology to dynamin, we postulate that it functions in inner membrane remodeling events. In this context, the observed mgm1 phenotypes suggest that inner and outer membrane fission is coupled and that loss of MGM1 function may stimulate Dnm1p-dependent outer membrane fission, resulting in the formation of mitochondrial fragments that are structurally incompetent for fusion.","dc:creator":"Wong ED","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"The dynamin-related GTPase, Mgm1p, is an intermembrane space protein required for maintenance of fusion competent mitochondria."},"rdfs:label":"The OPA1 ortholog promotes mitochondrial fusion in yeast"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"These data demonstrate a function of the yeast OPA1 ortholog Mgm1 in directly promoting mitochondrial inner membrane remodeling and mitochondrial fusion, which helps explain the cellular abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology and function that characterize the human disease state."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fc3f3ec8-0394-4732-bb4b-d75aaa5bdbcb_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4f93362f-95ac-4f51-8a44-48bd8fff7ff9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fb2c45b0-ddf5-4b5e-842b-1121fcc31fd6","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Analysis of annexin-V-positive cells shows that overexpression of wild-type OPA1 protects against cellular apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway, while OPA1 variants do not (Figure 1).

Cases with this diagnosis share the phenotype of optic atrophy and are characterized by other ocular features such as progressive visual loss, central scotoma, and color vision abnormalities, with pediatric onset and abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Subsequent reports have expanded the phenotypes of autosomal dominant *OPA1*-related cases to include an optic atrophy plus syndrome with additional extraocular features that can include progressive sensorineural hearing impairment, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, ragged-red muscle fibers, and exercise-induced lactic acidemia, as well as multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions (PMID: 16158427, PMID: 18158317). Families have also emerged with members harboring homozygous or compound heterozygous *OPA1* variants, with those individuals exhibiting more severe effects than their relatives with monoallelic variants (PMID: 11440988, PMID: 25146916). Patients with biallelic *OPA1* variants have typically been diagnosed with Behr syndrome (PMID: 25012220, PMID: 25146916), while a subset of those receiving this diagnosis has been recognized as overlapping with the Leigh syndrome spectrum (PMID: 28494813, PMID: 28442211). These cases exhibit optic atrophy and other ocular features, as well as infantile onset of neurological symptoms (such as global developmental delay, ataxia, sensory axonal neuropathy, hypotonia, dysphagia, nystagmus, and seizures) and abnormalities of brain morphology (such as atrophy of structures such as the cerebellar vermis and caudate nucleus, and MRI hyperintensities in cerebral white matter and other regions). Additional features include metabolic symptoms (increased lactate in the serum and central nervous system, decreased activity of mitochondrial complexes, and depletion of mitochondrial DNA in muscle tissue), and digestive issues (such as episodic vomiting and chronic constipation). Some particularly severe homozygous cases with death in infancy have been diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 14 (PMID: 26561570). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (*OPA1* loss of function) was found to be consistent among patients with optic atrophy 1 (MIM#: 165500), optic atrophy plus syndrome (MIM#: 125250), mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 14 (MIM#: 616896), and Behr syndrome (MIM#: 210000), including the Leigh syndrome-like cases (MIM#: 256000). The phenotypic variability between them appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities, with underlying mitochondrial dysfunction as a shared feature. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *OPA1* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *OPA1*-related optic atrophy with or without extraocular features (MONDO:0800181), with a semidominant mode of inheritance.\n\nSixteen suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (two nonsense, three frameshift, two affecting splicing, and nine missense), which have been collectively reported in eighteen probands in seven publications (PMID: 11017079, PMID: 11017080, PMID: 18158317, PMID: 25012220, PMID: 26561570, PMID: 28494813, PMID: 28442211). Nine of the probands scored in this curation harbored only one variant allele within the *OPA1* locus, while the other nine probands harbored biallelic *OPA1* variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic or biallelic loss of *OPA1* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. One family with segregation evidence contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship (PMID:11735024). The literature included more case-level evidence (PMID: 11440988, PMID: 16158427, PMID: 25146916) and segregation evidence (PMID: 11017079, PMID: 11017080), but their inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that OPA1 localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane (PMID: 11038181) and functions as a GTPase (PMID: 15509649) to promote mitochondrial fusion (PMID: 11038181), to prevent mitochondrial network fragmentation (PMID: 12509422), and to control mitochondrial cristae shape to prevent cytochrome C release and apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway (PMID: 16839885). *OPA1* is ubiquitously expressed but exhibits its highest expression levels in ocular tissues (PMID: 30239781). Cellular models of OPA1 loss-of-function exhibit disorganization of cristae structure, enhanced apoptosis (PMID: 12509422), depletion of mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency (PMID: 1532158). A mouse model harboring a heterozygous null *Opa1* variant recapitulates human patient features such as progressive optic nerve abnormalities, reduced visual acuity, and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network (PMID: 17428816). Homozygous animals exhibit early embryonic lethality (PMID: 17428816), indicating that phenotypic severity across patients may correlate with the degree of retention of residual OPA1 function. Correction of an *OPA1* variant by CRISPR/Cas9 editing in induced pluripotent stem cells from a patient largely rescues their phenotypes of mitochondrial network fragmentation, bioenergetic defects, and susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli (PMID: 34589289). \n\nIn summary, *OPA1* is definitively associated with *OPA1*-related optic atrophy with or without extraocular features. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This curation represents an update of the previous curation of *OPA1* for Leigh syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel and the ClinGen Mitochondrial Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 21st, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fc3f3ec8-0394-4732-bb4b-d75aaa5bdbcb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
