The physiological role of LCAD and the fatty acid oxidation pathway in lung was subsequently studied using LCAD knock-out mice. Lung fatty acid oxidation was reduced in LCAD(-/-) mice. LCAD(-/-) mice demonstrated reduced pulmonary compliance, but histological examination of lung tissue revealed no obvious signs of inflammation or pathology. The changes in lung mechanics were found to be due to pulmonary surfactant dysfunction. Large aggregate surfactant isolated from LCAD(-/-) mouse lavage fluid had significantly reduced phospholipid content as well as alterations in the acyl chain composition of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. LCAD(-/-) surfactant demonstrated functional abnormalities when subjected to dynamic compression-expansion cycling on a constrained drop surfactometer. Serum albumin, which has been shown to degrade and inactivate pulmonary surfactant, was significantly increased in LCAD(-/-) lavage fluid, suggesting increased epithelial permeability. Finally, we identified two cases of sudden unexplained infant death where no lung LCAD antigen was detectable. Both infants were homozygous for an amino acid changing polymorphism (K333Q).

Its diagnosis has been made based on the reduced activity of palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenation, i.e., in fibroblasts. We previously showed that in immunoblot analysis, an LCAD band of normal size and intensity was detected in fibroblasts from all LCAD-deficient patients tested. In the present study, we amplified via polymerase chain reaction and sequenced LCAD cDNA from three of these LCAD-deficient cell lines, and found perfectly normal LCAD sequences in two of them, indicating that at least these patients were not deficient in LCAD. The third patient was homozygous for an A to C substitution at 997, although it is unknown whether or not 997-C is a normal polymorphism. Although the LCAD sequence data were puzzling, a new enzyme, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), was recently identified. Because VLCAD also has high activity with palmitoyl-CoA as substrate, it was possible that defective VLCAD may cause reduced palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenating activity. We performed immunoblot analysis of VLCAD in six \"LCAD-deficient\" patients; VLCAD was negative in three of them, two of whom had a normal LCAD cDNA sequence. These results indicated that a considerable number of the patients who had previously been diagnosed as having LCAD deficiency in fact have VLCAD deficiency.","dc:creator":"Yamaguchi S","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Identification of very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in three patients previously diagnosed with long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency."}},"rdfs:label":"J-1"},{"id":"cggv:b354b102-31db-477e-b926-93142f2447c0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b354b102-31db-477e-b926-93142f2447c0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b354b102-31db-477e-b926-93142f2447c0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 32389575 shows that compared to wt, K333Q shows significantly reduced enzyme activity and a propensity to lose FAD.
