Here we report identification of a novel, probably pathogenic mutation in the WHSC1 gene in a patient case with phenotype overlapping the features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Deletions involving WHSC1 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 gene) were described earlier in patients with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. However, to our knowledge, single-point mutations in WHSC1 associated with any intellectual deficiency syndromes have not been reported. Using whole exome sequencing, we found a de novo nonsense mutation in WHSC1 (c.3412C>T, p.Arg1138Ter, NM_001042424.2) in patient with syndromic intellectual disability. This finding is challenging regarding a possible causative role of WHSC1 in intellectual disability syndromes, specifically Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. From the clinical standpoint, our finding suggests that next-generation sequencing along with chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) might be useful in genetic testing for patients with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features.","dc:creator":"Lozier ER","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"De novo nonsense mutation in WHSC1 (NSD2) in patient with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de3c113b-0a7d-454d-88e3-faf4f1fdb9ac_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:de3c113b-0a7d-454d-88e3-faf4f1fdb9ac_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c955740-bdb3-4b70-9fa0-052f6cae9956","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a5f6ad25-5141-470f-8a86-c265a9379112","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"H3K36me2 levels increased in overexpression of wild-type NSD2 and a cancer-related NSD2 GoF variant (E1099K).

Since then, more than 40 patients with neurodevelopmental abnormalities have been reported with primarily *de novo* variants in *NSD2* and a few reported cases of variants inherited from an affected parent (PMIDs: 25363760, 28135719, 28600779, 29760529, 29892088, 30345613, 31171569, 31382906, 33941880). Zanoni et al. (2021, PMID: 33941880) described a cohort of 18 previously unreported patients with *NSD2* pathogenic variants. Patients shared a phenotype characterized by developmental delay, prenatal-onset growth retardation and low birth weight, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, height and head circumference below the 5th centile (<âˆ’1.65 SDS), dysmorphic features, hypotonia, usually mild intellectual disability, and autistic features.\n\n*NSD2* is located in the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS, MIM #194190) critical region; NSD2 deficiency leads to a distinct and milder phenotype that only partially overlaps with WHS. The majority of variants identified to date are nonsense and frameshift variants that result in predicted loss-of-function of NSD2. Additionally, this is a highly constrained gene with few loss-of-function variants reported in public databases. Consequently, the mechanism of disease is hypothesized to be haploinsufficiency of *NSD2* due to loss-of-function or hypomorphic variants. \n\n*NSD2* encodes a histone methyltransferase involved in transcriptional regulation. Experimental evidence showed that cells with *NSD2* missense variants have reduced H3K36me2 methylation levels and impaired ability to rescue methylation abnormalities in NSD2-depleted cells (PMID: 33941880). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NSD2* and a distinct autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability disorder.
