After 60 min of TCR triggering by an α-CD3 monoclonal Ab, large intracellular CD3-positive puncta were formed in wt cells, whereas in FCHO1 ko clones CD3 molecules remained in diffuse form. Knockout clones reconstituted with wt FCHO1 formed large CD3-positive puncta, essentially indistinguishable from those in wt cells. In contrast, none of the FCHO1 mutants were able to rescue the phenotype.\n\nThe authors next measured the intracellular accumulation of CD3:TCR complexes upon anti-CD3-mediated TCR triggering over time using flow cytometry. Consistent with the confocal microscopy studies, they noted that FCHO1 ko cells accumulated approximately two-fold less CD3:TCR complexes when compared to wt cells. Finally, they assessed whether FCHO1 directly modulated TCR responsiveness by investigating Jurkat cells, sufficient or deficient for FCHO1, stimulated with an α-CD3 antibody and assessed for release of intracellular Ca2+. When compared to controls, FCHO1-deficient cells released less Ca2+ upon CD3:TCR triggering.

We identify ten unrelated patients with variable T and B cell lymphopenia, who are homozygous for six distinct mutations in FCHO1. We demonstrate that these mutations either lead to mislocalisation of the protein or prevent its interaction with binding partners. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing mutant variants of FCHO1 provide evidence of impaired formation of clathrin coated pits (CCP). Patient T cells are unresponsive to T cell receptor (TCR) triggering. Internalisation of the TCR receptor is severely perturbed in FCHO1-deficient Jurkat T cells but can be rescued by expression of wild-type FCHO1.

This primary immunologic disorder is characterized by onset of recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in early childhood. Laboratory studies show T-cell lymphopenia and may show variable B-cell or immunoglobulin abnormalities. Genetic evidence was included in this curation from 8 probands in two publications (PMID: 30822429, PMID: 32098969). The proposed mechanism of disease is loss of function and the reported variants include missense, splice site, frameshift, and nonsense. There is no in vivo evidence of T-cell dysfunction in healthy carriers. More evidence is available in the literature however, the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached. In patients, the absence of functional *FCHO1* results in perturbed clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in several tissues, as well as dysfunctional internalization of transferrin (PMID: 30822429) and the T-cell receptor (PMID: 32098969). Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its function as a CME nucleator (PMID: 20448150) and enhanced expression in lymphoid cells (PMID: 30822429), however the relationship between the molecular mechanism of impaired CME and the resulting immunodeficiency requires further elucidation. Functional alteration in patient cells demonstrated defective CME, impaired T-cell proliferation, and increased activation-induced T-cell death, suggesting that defective T-cell proliferation and increased activation-induced cell death, rather than impaired thymic output, are major contributors to the T-cell lymphopenia observed in patients with *FCHO1* deficiency (PMID: 30822429) and FCHO1 knockout cells provide evidence that *FCHO1* plays a role in TCR-dependent T-cell activation (PMID: 32098969). In summary, there is Definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ae21f2b2-e283-404b-9517-74fad00a352a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
