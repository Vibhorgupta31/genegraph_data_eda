HPP is heterogeneous, with clinical presentation correlating with residual TNSALP activity and/or dominant-negative effects (DNE). We measured residual activity and DNE for 155 ALPL variants by transient transfection and TNSALP enzymatic activity measurement. Ninety variants showed low residual activity and 24 showed DNE. These results encompass all missense variants with carrier frequencies above 1/25,000 from the Genome Aggregation Database. We used resulting data as a reference to develop a new computational algorithm that scores ALPL missense variants and predicts high/low TNSALP enzymatic activity. Our approach measures the effects of amino acid changes on TNSALP dimer stability with a physics-based implicit solvent energy model. We predict mutation deleteriousness with high specificity, achieving a true-positive rate of 0.63 with false-positive rate of 0, with an area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.9, better than all in silico predictors tested. Combining this algorithm with other in silico approaches can further increase performance, reaching an AUC of 0.94. This study expands our understanding of HPP heterogeneity and genotype/phenotype relationships with the aim of improving clinical ALPL variant interpretation.","dc:creator":"Del Angel G","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Large-scale in vitro functional testing and novel variant scoring via protein modeling provide insights into alkaline phosphatase activity in hypophosphatasia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160374","rdfs:label":"37"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.5 point (0.5 for missense with functional evidence)\n"},{"id":"cggv:a895bed4-0f55-4a98-93fd-f967f4aa0418_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92a14b7e-9dec-4a3c-b1e5-5534ecb37edd","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"childhood hypophosphatasia diagnosed\nThe diagnosis of HPP required all of the following at the first Research Center admission: i) medical history or physical examination consistent with one or more dento-osseous complication(s) of HPP, ii) no evidence of any other condition that can cause early loss of primary teeth [1], iii) serum ALP activity below age-matched reference ranges established at the Research Center [26] and provided by clinical pathologists for our analytical instruments, iv) no indication of any other condition that can cause hypophosphatasemia [1], v) plasma pyridoxal 5/-phosphate level above published [8] reference ranges and established at the Research Center [38], [40], [41] while off of vitamin supplementation (154 patients since 1985), and vi) radiographic findings consistent with HPP if skeletal abnormalities were identified\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a895bed4-0f55-4a98-93fd-f967f4aa0418_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:5f1417d8-b38f-404e-800e-fc70550d11de","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.526G>A (p.Ala176Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256935"}},{"id":"cggv:0ffab841-caf5-42eb-adab-285d6a17d564","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.1190G>A (p.Gly397Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338881624"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25731960","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is caused by loss-of-function mutation(s) within the gene TNSALP that encodes the \"tissue-nonspecific\" isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). In HPP, inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization and substrate for TNSALP, accumulates extracellularly often leading to rickets or osteomalacia and tooth loss, and sometimes to craniosynostosis and calcium crystal arthropathies. HPP's remarkably broad-ranging expressivity spans stillbirth from profound skeletal hypomineralization to adult-onset dental problems or arthropathies without bone disease, which is largely explained by autosomal recessive versus autosomal dominant transmission from among several hundred, usually missense, TNSALP mutations. For clinical purposes, this expressivity has been codified according to absence or presence of skeletal disease and then patient age at presentation and diagnosis. Pediatric patients are reported principally with \"odonto\", \"childhood\", \"infantile\", or \"perinatal\" HPP. However, this nosology has not been tested using a cohort of patients, and the ranges of the clinical and laboratory findings have not been defined and contrasted among these patient groups. To evaluate the extant nosology for HPP in children, we assessed our 25 years experience with 173 pediatric HPP patients. Data were exclusively from inpatient studies. The childhood form of HPP was further designated \"mild\" or \"severe\". Here, we focused on demographic, clinical, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry parameters compared to data from healthy American children. The 173-patient cohort comprised 64 individuals with odonto HPP, 38 with mild childhood HPP, 58 with severe childhood HPP, and 13 with infantile HPP. None was a survivor of perinatal HPP. TNSALP analysis revealed a mutation(s) in all 105 probands tested. Thirteen mutations were unique. Most patients represented autosomal dominant inheritance of HPP. Mutant allele dosage generally indicated the disorder's severity. Gender discordance was found for severe childhood HPP; 42 boys versus 16 girls (p=0.006), perhaps reflecting parental concern about stature and strength. Key disease parameters (e.g., height, weight, numbers of teeth lost prematurely, grip strength, spine and hip bone mineral density) were increasingly compromised as HPP was designated more severe. Although data overlapped successively between the four patient groups, body size (height and weight) differed significantly. Thus, our expanded nosology for HPP in children organizes the disorder's broad-ranging expressivity and should improve understanding of HPP presentation, natural history, complications, and prognosis.","dc:creator":"Whyte MP","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Hypophosphatasia: validation and expansion of the clinical nosology for children from 25 years experience with 173 pediatric patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25731960","rdfs:label":"Whyte_1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Allele 1: 67.6% of WT\n(Del Angel 2020)\nAllele 2: No in-vitro evidence found \n"},{"id":"cggv:44c6f5ae-2b36-4c21-be1a-6fe422a91b8c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae5a21e5-2b7b-4c09-99fb-57dcd189c37a","type":"Proband","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with adult hypophosphatasia","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:44c6f5ae-2b36-4c21-be1a-6fe422a91b8c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:8870b30d-a3ac-4eee-848f-5e22fb5bd1a3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.1466G>C (p.Cys489Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA338882304"}},{"id":"cggv:4b3bb769-61e5-4d9a-9028-522939781f51","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.571G>A (p.Glu191Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256927"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160374"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160374","rdfs:label":"16"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"1 point (0.5 for each missense with functional evidence)\nAllele 1: 3.7% of WT\nAllele 2: 21.4% of WT\n"},{"id":"cggv:3d7fe3ab-c3c6-4d26-b07a-4ccd46539c1c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:74288980-d330-46cc-8203-24b064daf973","type":"Proband","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with adult hypophosphatasia","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3d7fe3ab-c3c6-4d26-b07a-4ccd46539c1c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:4b3bb769-61e5-4d9a-9028-522939781f51"},{"id":"cggv:c7ae3862-498c-4a6c-9188-2e9365271c23","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000478.6(ALPL):c.512A>G (p.His171Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA666518"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160374"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160374","rdfs:label":"18"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"1 points -

We successfully generated the first large animal model of a rare human bone disease, hypophosphatasia (HPP) using CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a single point mutation in the tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene (ALPL) (1077 C > G) in sheep. HPP is a rare inherited disorder of mineral metabolism that affects bone and tooth development, and is associated with muscle weakness. Compared to wild-type (WT) controls, HPP sheep have reduced serum alkaline phosphatase activity, decreased tail vertebral bone size, and metaphyseal flaring, consistent with the mineralization deficits observed in human HPP patients. Computed tomography revealed short roots and thin dentin in incisors, and reduced mandibular bone in HPP vs. WT sheep, accurately replicating odonto-HPP. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed aberrant fiber size and disorganized mitochondrial cristae structure in HPP vs. WT sheep. These genetically engineered sheep accurately phenocopy human HPP and provide a novel large animal platform for the longitudinal study of HPP progression, as well as other rare human bone diseases.","dc:creator":"Williams DK","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Genetic engineering a large animal model of human hypophosphatasia in sheep."},"rdfs:label":"Sheep model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded given the wide range of phenotypes of the sheep."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2887,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"cggv:24b8a3bf-457b-4d33-93e9-dc0f8aa3de66","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009428","gene":"hgnc:438","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"ALPL has been described in association with autosomal recessive moderate hypophosphatasia (Taillandier et al., 2000; PMID:10679946). Moderate hypophosphatasia is a rare, moderate form of hypophosphatasia characterized by defective mineralization of bone and/or teeth, premature loss of teeth with intact roots, and reduced serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Individuals can present with this form of hypophosphatasia in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Based upon the severity and mode of inheritance of the hypophosphatasia clinical subtypes, the curations for autosomal recessive severe hypophosphatasia, autosomal dominant moderate hypophosphatasia, and autosomal dominant mild hypophosphatasia have been split and curated separately (PMID: 32973344). Eighteen variants (missense, splice, frameshift) that have been reported in 12 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 10679946, 25731960, 32160374) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by an animal model (PMID: 30446691). In summary, ALPL is definitively associated with autosomal recessive moderate hypophosphatasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 1/19/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:354366d0-a7f6-472d-a7b2-4b16f6e328ac"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
