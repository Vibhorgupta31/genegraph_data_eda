We report two individuals with similar dominant de novo GRIN1 mutations (c.1858 G>A and c.1858 G>C; both p.G620R). Both individuals presented at birth with developmental delay and hypotonia associated with behavioral abnormalities and stereotypical movements. Recombinant NMDARs containing the mutant GluN1-G620R together with either GluN2A or GluN2B were evaluated for changes in their trafficking to the plasma membrane and their electrophysiological properties. GluN1-G620R/GluN2A complexes showed a mild reduction in trafficking, a ~2-fold decrease in glutamate and glycine potency, a strong decrease in sensitivity to Mg2+ block, and a significant reduction of current responses to a maximal effective concentration of agonists. GluN1-G620R/GluN2B complexes showed significantly reduced delivery of protein to the cell surface associated with similarly altered electrophysiology. These results indicate these individuals may have suffered neurodevelopmental deficits as a result of the decreased presence of GluN1-G620R/GluN2B complexes on the neuronal surface during embryonic brain development and reduced current responses of GluN1-G620R-containing NMDARs after birth. These cases emphasize the importance of comprehensive functional characterization of de novo mutations and illustrates how a combination of several distinct features of NMDAR expression, trafficking and function can be present and influence phenotype.","dc:creator":"Chen W","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"GRIN1 mutation associated with intellectual disability alters NMDA receptor trafficking and function."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28228639","rdfs:label":"Chen Proband 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"De novo heterozygous p.Gly620Arg variant.

We hypothesized that de novo mutations (DNMs) in synaptic genes explain an important fraction of sporadic NSID cases. In order to investigate this possibility, we sequenced 197 genes encoding glutamate receptors and a large subset of their known interacting proteins in 95 sporadic cases of NSID. We found 11 DNMs, including ten potentially deleterious mutations (three nonsense, two splicing, one frameshift, four missense) and one neutral mutation (silent) in eight different genes. Calculation of point-substitution DNM rates per functional and neutral site showed significant excess of functional DNMs compared to neutral ones. De novo truncating and/or splicing mutations in SYNGAP1, STXBP1, and SHANK3 were found in six patients and are likely to be pathogenic. De novo missense mutations were found in KIF1A, GRIN1, CACNG2, and EPB41L1. Functional studies showed that all these missense mutations affect protein function in cell culture systems, suggesting that they may be pathogenic. Sequencing these four genes in 50 additional sporadic cases of NSID identified a second DNM in GRIN1 (c.1679_1681dup/p.Ser560dup). This mutation also affects protein function, consistent with structural predictions. None of these mutations or any other DNMs were identified in these genes in 285 healthy controls. This study highlights the importance of the glutamate receptor complexes in NSID and further supports the role of DNMs in this disorder.","dc:creator":"Hamdan FF","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Excess of de novo deleterious mutations in genes associated with glutamatergic systems in nonsyndromic intellectual disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21376300","rdfs:label":"Hamdan Patient 9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The p.Ser560dup variant was identified to be a de novo mutation in GRIN1 in a patient with epilepsy and intellectual disability.

Variants in GRIN1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2011 (Hamdan et al., PMID: 21376300). At least 16 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, in-frame duplications) have been reported in humans (PMID: 21376300, 27164704, 25864721, 28228639). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes de novo case-level data, and experimental data. Of note, there are animal models supporting that loss of function of the GRIN1 protein results in complex neurodevelopmental disorder, but these models are full knockouts that are used to support the gene's association with autosomal recessive disease. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 33 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 21376300, 27164704, 25864721, 28228639). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is predicted to be dominant negative/haploinsufficiency (PMID: 27164704). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in causing disease in an autosomal recessive pattern. This will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays showing that the de novo variants may cause a dominant negative impact resulting in a loss of function of the transmembrane domain (PMID: 27164704). In summary, GRIN1 is definitively associated with AD complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b98e5df5-8f39-4fd6-9715-bb8da7dc1806"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
