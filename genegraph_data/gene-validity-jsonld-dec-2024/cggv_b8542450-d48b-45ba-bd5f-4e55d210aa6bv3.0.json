Since most NPH gene products (NPHP) function at the primary cilium, NPH is classified as a ciliopathy. We identified mutations in a candidate gene in eight individuals from five families presenting late-onset NPH with massive renal fibrosis. This gene encodes MAPKBP1, a poorly characterized scaffolding protein for JNK signaling. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that MAPKBP1 is not present at the primary cilium and that fibroblasts from affected individuals did not display ciliogenesis defects, indicating that MAPKBP1 may represent a new family of NPHP not involved in cilia-associated functions. Instead, MAPKBP1 is recruited to mitotic spindle poles (MSPs) during the early phases of mitosis where it colocalizes with its paralog WDR62, which plays a key role at MSP. Detected mutations compromise recruitment of MAPKBP1 to the MSP and/or its interaction with JNK2 or WDR62. Additionally, we show increased DNA damage response signaling in fibroblasts from affected individuals and upon knockdown of Mapkbp1 in murine cell lines, a phenotype previously associated with NPH. In conclusion, we identified mutations in MAPKBP1 as a genetic cause of juvenile or late-onset and cilia-independent NPH.","dc:creator":"Macia MS","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations in MAPKBP1 Cause Juvenile or Late-Onset Cilia-Independent Nephronophthisis."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in Adult Kidney"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b8542450-d48b-45ba-bd5f-4e55d210aa6b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a31b6744-5825-4c7c-990f-4372587c6985","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca0d2d00-5494-4dc1-95fb-9a9ea0f37121","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"shMKBP1.1.1 & shMKBP1.1.3 IMCD3 clones (mutants, with knockdown of MAPKBP1) exhibit increased DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, compared to the control, consistent with the phenotype.

MAPKBP1 was found at mitotic spindle poles but could not be detected at primary cilia or centrosomes. Here, by identification and characterization of novel MAPKBP1 variants, we aimed at further investigating its role in health and disease. Genetic analysis was done by exome sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and a targeted kidney gene panel while coimmunoprecipitation was used to explore wild-type and mutant protein-protein interactions. Expression of MAPKBP1 in non-ciliated HeLa and ciliated inner medullary collecting duct cells enabled co-localization studies by fluorescence microscopy. By next generation sequencing, we identified two novel homozygous MAPKBP1 splice-site variants in patients with nephronophthisis-related chronic kidney disease. Splice-site analyses revealed truncation of C-terminal coiled-coil domains and patient-derived deletion constructs lost their ability to homodimerize and heterodimerize with paralogous WDR62. While wild-type MAPKBP1 exhibited centrosomal, basal body, and microtubule association, mutant proteins lost the latter and showed reduced recruitment to cell cycle dependent centriolar structures. Wild-type and mutant proteins had no reciprocal influence upon co-expression excluding dominant negative effects. Thus, MAPKBP1 appears to be a novel microtubule-binding protein with cell cycle dependent centriolar localization. Truncation of its coiled-coil domain is enough to abrogate its dimerization and results in severely disturbed intracellular localizations. Delineating the impact of impaired dimerization on cell cycle regulation and intracellular kidney signaling may provide new insights into common mechanisms of kidney degeneration. Thus, due to milder clinical presentation, MAPKBP1-associated nephronophthisis should be considered in adult patients with otherwise unexplained chronic kidney disease.","dc:creator":"Sch√∂nauer R","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Novel nephronophthisis-associated variants reveal functional importance of MAPKBP1 dimerization for centriolar recruitment."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient 2"},{"id":"cggv:77ff558e-dd5d-4e5a-ba81-21c9997acc35","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:77ff558e-dd5d-4e5a-ba81-21c9997acc35_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:77ff558e-dd5d-4e5a-ba81-21c9997acc35_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"HeLa cell analysis indicated atypical localization in mutants.

Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RCs) are a common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in children and adolescents. NPHP-RCs are often accompanied by extrarenal manifestations, including intellectual disability, retinitis pigmentosa, or polydactyly. Although more than 100 causative genes have been identified, its diagnosis is difficult because the clinical features of each mutation often overlap. From September 2010 to August 2021, we performed genetic analysis, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), in 574 probands with kidney dysfunction and retrospectively studied cases genetically diagnosed with NPHP-RCs. RESULTS: We detected mutations related to NPHP-RCs in 93 patients from 83 families. Members of 60 families were diagnosed using NGS, and the mutations and the corresponding number of families are as follows: NPHP1 (24), NPHP3 (10), OFD1 (7), WDR35 (5), SDCCAG8 (4), BBS10 (3), TMEM67 (3), WDR19 (3), BBS1 (2), BBS2 (2), IFT122 (2), IFT140 (2), IQCB1 (2), MKKS (2), SCLT1 (2), TTC21B (2), ALMS1 (1), ANKS6 (1), BBS4 (1), BBS12 (1), CC2D2A (1), DYNC2H1 (1), IFT172 (1), and MAPKBP1 (1). A total of 39 cases (41.9%) progressed to ESKD at the time of genetic analysis, whereas 58 cases (62.3%) showed extrarenal manifestations, the most common being developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder in 44 patients. Comprehensive genetic analysis using NGS is useful for diagnosing patients with NPHP-RCs.","dc:creator":"Sakakibara N","dc:date":"2022","dc:title":"Comprehensive genetic analysis using next-generation sequencing for the diagnosis of nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies in the Japanese population."}},"rdfs:label":"New proband (re-curation)"},{"id":"cggv:8c248ad3-4c4f-43cd-a6fc-d3c46043bdc2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c248ad3-4c4f-43cd-a6fc-d3c46043bdc2_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a211102c-3eb0-4922-aad9-54a7fb0de70e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a211102c-3eb0-4922-aad9-54a7fb0de70e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d6bb8cf0-61d1-4f43-abb3-b0adb7169619","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014994.3(MAPKBP1):c.2426-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16043975"}},"detectionMethod":"The Authors initially performed homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing (WES) in the proband.

Ten variants (nonsense, frameshift, missense) that have been reported in 11 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28089251, 32505465, 33623699, 35140360) are included in this curation. All but two of the variants are null, indicating that this disease is largely caused by a loss-of-function mechanism. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence, functional alteration evidence; PMID: 28089251). Expression analysis showed that the encoded protein is expressed in tubular epithelial cells and glomeruli of the adult kidney. Analysis of inner medullary collecting duct cells shows increased DNA Damage Response signaling in mutants, consistent with the human phenotype. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic & Ciliopathy GCEP on 5/26/2021, and re-evaluated on 6/10/2024. Even though there was only one new case (PMID: 35140360) and no new experimental evidence, the panel felt that there was ample genetic evidence, with supporting functional evidence for many of the mutations, that outweighed the limited other experimental evidence. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Strong to Definitive supporting the relationship between MAPKBP1 and autosomal recessive nephronophthisis that has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 6/10/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b8542450-d48b-45ba-bd5f-4e55d210aa6b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
