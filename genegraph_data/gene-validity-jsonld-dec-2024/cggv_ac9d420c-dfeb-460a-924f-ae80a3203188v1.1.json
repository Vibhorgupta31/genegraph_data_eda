We have identified a novel CDG type, CDG-Ij, resulting from deficiency in UDP-GlcNAc: dolichol phosphate N-acetyl-glucosamine-1 phosphate transferase (GPT) activity encoded by DPAGT1. The patient presents with severe hypotonia, medically intractable seizures, mental retardation, microcephaly, and exotropia. Metabolic labeling of cultured dermal fibroblasts from the patient with [2-(3)H]-mannose revealed lowered incorporation of radiolabel into full-length dolichol-linked oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. In vitro enzymatic analysis of microsomal fractions from the cultured cells indicated that oligosaccharyltransferase activity is normal, but the GPT activity is reduced to approximately 10% of normal levels while parents have heterozygous levels. The patient's paternal DPAGT1 allele contains a point mutation (660A>G) that replaces a highly conserved tyrosine with a cysteine (Y170C). The paternal allele cDNA produces a full-length protein with almost no activity when over-expressed in CHO cells. The maternal allele makes only about 12% normal mature mRNA, while the remainder shows a complex exon skipping pattern that shifts the reading frame encoding a truncated non-functional GPT protein. Thus, we conclude that the DPAGT1 gene defects are responsible for the CDG symptoms in this patient.

They are characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. We performed whole-exome sequencing to determine the underlying defect in a group of individuals with an inherited limb-girdle pattern of myasthenic weakness. We identify DPAGT1 as a gene in which mutations cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome. We describe seven different mutations found in five individuals with DPAGT1 mutations. The affected individuals share a number of common clinical features, including involvement of proximal limb muscles, response to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and 3,4-diaminopyridine, and the presence of tubular aggregates in muscle biopsies. Analyses of motor endplates from two of the individuals demonstrate a severe reduction of endplate acetylcholine receptors. DPAGT1 is an essential enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of N-linked protein glycosylation. Our findings underscore the importance of N-linked protein glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction. Using the DPAGT1-specific inhibitor tunicamycin, we show that DPAGT1 is required for efficient glycosylation of acetylcholine-receptor subunits and for efficient export of acetylcholine receptors to the cell surface. We suggest that the primary pathogenic mechanism of DPAGT1 mutations is reduced levels of acetylcholine receptors at the endplate region. These individuals share clinical features similar to those of congenital myasthenic syndrome due to GFPT1 mutations, and their disorder might be part of a larger subgroup comprising the congenital myasthenic syndromes that result from defects in the N-linked glycosylation pathway and that manifest through impaired neuromuscular transmission.","dc:creator":"Belaya K","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Mutations in DPAGT1 cause a limb-girdle congenital myasthenic syndrome with tubular aggregates."}},{"id":"cggv:3c99c89a-d5ae-4e3d-8ba2-5c9dcb3e2374_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:3f90f823-d1a5-4c35-ae72-d536cd9eb73b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22742743"}],"rdfs:label":"Belaya Case 2"},{"id":"cggv:51b9da59-2f1b-478a-a114-37813e3ea266","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:51b9da59-2f1b-478a-a114-37813e3ea266_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:51b9da59-2f1b-478a-a114-37813e3ea266_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"HEK293 cells transfected with the variant produced no detectable protein -

UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase (GPT), the protein encoded by DPAGT1, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein involved in an initial step in the N-glycosylation pathway. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of six variants in DPAGT1 detected in patients with DPAGT1-CDG, and the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress, as part of the search for therapeutic strategies to use against DPAGT1-CDG. The effect of the six mutations, i.e., c.358C>A (p.Leu120Met), c.791T>G (p.Val264Gly), c.901C>T (p.Arg301Cys), c.902G>A (p.Arg301His), c.1154T>G (p.Leu385Arg), and of the novel mutation c.329T>C (p.Phe110Ser), were examined via the analysis of DPAGT1 transcriptional profiles and GTP levels in patient-derived fibroblasts. In addition, the transient expression of different mutations was analysed in COS-7 cells. The results obtained, together with those of bioinformatic studies, revealed these mutations to affect the splicing process, the stability of GTP, or the ability of this protein to correctly localise in the ER membrane. The unfolded protein response (UPR; the response to ER stress) was found not to be active in patient-derived fibroblasts, unlike that seen in cells from patients with PMM2-CDG or DPM1-CDG. Even so, the fibroblasts of patients with DPAGT1-CDG seemed to be more sensitive to the stressor tunicamycin. The present work improves our knowledge of DPAGT1-CDG and provides bases for developing tailored splicing and folding therapies.","dc:creator":"Yuste-Checa P","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"DPAGT1-CDG: Functional analysis of disease-causing pathogenic mutations and role of endoplasmic reticulum stress."}},{"id":"cggv:95eab6a5-3daf-4338-a20f-29ea0d7c67af_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7cda089c-cb91-43b0-a051-06bb7c2d3ade"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28662078"}],"rdfs:label":"Yuste-Checa P3"},{"id":"cggv:95eab6a5-3daf-4338-a20f-29ea0d7c67af","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95eab6a5-3daf-4338-a20f-29ea0d7c67af_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:95eab6a5-3daf-4338-a20f-29ea0d7c67af_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In transfected COS7 cells, protein quantity reduced by 30% compared to wt (fig 4)."}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:92f445e1-88c0-4f1f-a16a-55d3a3667063","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92f445e1-88c0-4f1f-a16a-55d3a3667063_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:92f445e1-88c0-4f1f-a16a-55d3a3667063_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 30388443 performed enzyme activity and thermostability assays on this variant.

Identification of disease genes is compromised by the enormous heterogeneity in clinical symptoms and the large number of potential genes involved. Until now, gene identification included the sequential application of biochemical methods in blood samples and fibroblasts. In genetically unsolved cases, homozygosity mapping has been applied in consanguineous families. Altogether, this time-consuming diagnostic strategy led to the identification of defects in 17 different CDG-I genes. Here, we applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) in combination with the knowledge of the protein N-glycosylation pathway for gene identification in our remaining group of six unsolved CDG-I patients from unrelated non-consanguineous families. Exome variants were prioritized based on a list of 76 potential CDG-I candidate genes, leading to the rapid identification of one known and two novel CDG-I gene defects. These included the first X-linked CDG-I due to a de novo mutation in ALG13, and compound heterozygous mutations in DPAGT1, together the first two steps in dolichol-PP-glycan assembly, and mutations in PGM1 in two cases, involved in nucleotide sugar biosynthesis. The pathogenicity of the mutations was confirmed by showing the deficient activity of the corresponding enzymes in patient fibroblasts.

The first step in precursor biosynthesis requires the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc: dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase (GPT). Without GPT activity, subsequent steps necessary in constructing the oligosaccharide precursor cannot occur. Inhibition of this biosynthetic step using tunicamycin, a GlcNAc analog, produces a deficiency in N-glycosylation in cell lines and embryonic lethality during preimplantation development in vitro, suggesting that N-glycan formation is essential in early embryogenesis. In exploring structure-function relationships among N-glycans, and since tunicamycin has various reported biochemical activities; we have generated a germline deletion in the mouse GPT gene. GPT mutant embryos were analyzed and the phenotypes obtained were compared with previous studies using tunicamycin. We find that embryos homozygous for a deletion in the GPT gene complete preimplantation development and also implant in the uterine epithelium, but die shortly thereafter between days 4-5 postfertilization with cell degeneration apparent among both embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. Of cells derived from these early embryos, neither trophoblast nor embryonic endodermal lineages are able to survive in culture in vitro. These results indicate that GPT function is essential in early embryogenesis and suggest that N-glycosylation is needed for the viability of cells comprising the peri-implantation stage embryo.","dc:creator":"Marek KW","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"A recessive deletion in the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase gene results in peri-implantation embryonic lethality."},"rdfs:label":"Marek GPT Activity "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ac9d420c-dfeb-460a-924f-ae80a3203188_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05e7102a-6f53-4f58-8a89-bbb3cc40cdbb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1cc93ca-bfd6-4e81-9ae1-cc92f1fdca1b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"While decreased fertility has not been noted in humans with DPAGT1 mutations (likely due to most patients not reaching reproductive age), the decreased N-glycosylation of the zona pellucida (a coating on vertebrate oocytes) is consistent with decreased N-glycosylation in humans.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32714760","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Post-translational modification of proteins by ","dc:creator":"Li H","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"DPAGT1-Mediated Protein "},"rdfs:label":"Li Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Decreased due to primary focus on oocyte development and fertility, which are not phenotypes associated with human disease."},{"id":"cggv:50080245-631b-402b-a5d0-651a4c2eebdf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1414413-bedd-47ed-830b-b9517313589c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Retinal degeneration has not been observed in humans with DPAGT1 mutations.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s), inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, both disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity. 27 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, and splice) that have been reported in 16 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 22742743, 30117111, 22492991, 29356258, 24759841, 28662078) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model and a biochemical function assay (PMIDs: 32714760, 10536042). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between DPAGT1 and autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation.
