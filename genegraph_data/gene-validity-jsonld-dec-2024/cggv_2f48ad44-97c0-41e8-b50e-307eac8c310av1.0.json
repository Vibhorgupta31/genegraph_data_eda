The first report of GRIP1 in association with Fraser syndrome 3 was in Vogel, et.al 2012 (PMID:22510445), which reported in 2 independent fetuses with homozygous loss of function GRIP1 variants and phenotypes consistent with Fraser syndrome.  Biallelic or homozygous loss of function (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice, and deletion) variants in GRIP1 have since been reported in multiple additional affected individuals in the literature with Fraser Syndrome 3 (PMIDs:24357607, 33709629).  The mechanism for GRIP1 in association with Fraser Syndrome 3 is loss of function and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  GRIP1 knockout mouse models have variable background dependent phenotypes including embryonic lethality with severe bullous disorder, haemorrhagic bullae, limb malformations including syndactyly and polydactyly, uni- or bilateral cryptophthalmos, and absent kidneys (PMIDs:11983858, 14730302).
