The enzyme is involved in N-linked glycosylation and catalyzes two mannose transfers onto lipid-linked oligosaccharide (PMID: 25966638). \n\nMonoallelic *ALG9* pathogenic variants were first reported in relation to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in 2019 (Besse et al., PMID: 31395617). Of note, biallelic ALG9 pathogenic variants have been associated with the congenital disorder of glycosylation, type 1L (CDG-1L; OMIM #6087776) and Gillessen-Kaesbach-Nishimura syndrome (GIKANIS; OMIM #263210). Given that ALG9-associated ADPKD and ALG9-associated CDG-1L have different inheritance modes and phenotypic manifestations, we have split the two disease entities. Here, we only curate the association between *ALG9* and ADPKD (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0700000). ADPKD-ALG9 patients are characterized by the presence of renal cysts, however, these patients show variable penetrance and expressivity. For instance, Besse et al., 2019 demonstrate that 7/14 of the probands with available abdominal imaging had clear evidence of multicystic kidney disease (multiple kidney cysts, bilaterally), whereas the remaining 7 probands had less than 4 renal cysts (n=4), no imaging data for analysis (n=3), or had reached ESRD by the time of renal imaging (n=1). This large variation of expressivity should be considered when evaluating ALG9 carriers.\n\nAt least ten variants (4 nonsense, 3 frameshift, 1 canonical splice-site, and 2 missense) reported in 2 publications have been included in this curation (PMID: 31395617; 37761895). The presumed mechanism of pathogenicity based on published evidence is loss of function whereby variants in the ALG9 gene leads to impaired polycystin-1 maturation (PMID: 31395617).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level genetic data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 individuals in 4 publications (PMID: 31395617; 32398770; 37761895; 36573973). Of these individuals, ten were reported to have clear evidence of cystic kidney disease; of the remaining nine, five were reported to not display multiple kidney cysts, three had insufficient clinical data available for assessment, and one harbored a benign variant. This is evidence consistent ADPKD-*ALG9* having variable penetrance and expressivity. For this gene-disease curation, only the ten probands who showed clear evidence of cystic kidney disease as well as putatively pathogenic *ALG9* variants were counted for case-level genetic evidence. A total of 12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached. \n\nIn summary, there is “Definitive” evidence to support this gene-disease relationship and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as ”Moderate” by the Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 08/26/2020 (SOP Version 7). It was reevaluated on 09/11/2023 and the classification changed (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:38d817af-0a28-4453-a00f-ffccadbd9936"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
