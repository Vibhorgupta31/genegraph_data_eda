An autophagic flux assay was performed using LCLs from patients.

Using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from the subjects, aberrant splicing was confirmed in two, and protein expression was observed to be severely impaired in all five. WDR45 encodes WD-repeat domain 45 (WDR45). WDR45 (also known as WIPI4) is one of the four mammalian homologs of yeast Atg18, which has an important role in autophagy. Lower autophagic activity and accumulation of aberrant early autophagic structures were demonstrated in the LCLs of the affected subjects. These findings provide direct evidence that an autophagy defect is indeed associated with a neurodegenerative disorder in humans.","dc:creator":"Saitsu H","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"De novo mutations in the autophagy gene WDR45 cause static encephalopathy of childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood."},"rdfs:label":"Autophagic Flux Assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:85a54036-4d36-414d-8d26-944b9763a039_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0feb97f5-510f-4441-b406-865d40f99e71","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:415e762a-439c-47fa-add4-64e40c7c3888","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Normal birth and no initial evidence of impaired motor function.

The disorder is typically characterized by later (adolescence to adulthood) neurologic deterioration, loss of skills, and progressive impairment. Many individuals were described as presenting in childhood with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment or intellectual disability. The childhood presentation led to the inclusion of this gene on epilepsy panels with resulting earlier identification, broadened phenotypes, and reports of patients at younger ages. The expert panel decided to curate this gene for the X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder phenotype which represents a spectrum of neurologic presentations that can include epilepsy, autism, movement disorders, and intellectual disability. It should be noted that a review of the literature identified 34 adolescent and adult cases and 17 pediatric cases. Given the earlier identification, increased reporting, and variable phenotypes, the ultimate course and variability of this disorder may not yet be determined.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:85a54036-4d36-414d-8d26-944b9763a039"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
