Primary open angle glaucoma is characterized by a loss of retinal ganglion cells, visual field defects, and cupping of the optic disc.\n\nThis curation includes one missense variant reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 28150229). This proband was also reported to have a variant in the *MAPKAPK2* gene, and group members were therefore unable to conclusively confirm the cause of the phenotype within this proband. \n\nThis gene-disease association is not supported by any experimental evidence. The *TP53BP2* gene is expressed in the human cornea (PMID: 11709013), and its gene product reportedly interacts with components of apoptosis pathways and may regulate cell cycle progression (PMID: 8668206), but the relevance of this evidence to primary open-angle glaucoma is not yet clear.\n\nIn summary, the gene-disease relationship between *TP53BP2* and primary open angle glaucoma is classified as disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 18th, 2023.\nThe only proband used as evidence towards this curation was also reported to have a variant in the MAPKAPK2 gene, and we are therefore unable to confirm the cause of the phenotype within this proband. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:05ac2b0b-5f6d-4227-ad08-0bb6c852583f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
