Mutations in the RECQL4 gene, encoding a protein of the family of Werner (WRN) and Bloom (BLM) helicases, have been identified in a subset of RTS patients. Apart from congenital poikiloderma, the clinical presentation of RTS is widely variable, raising the question of the possible existence of a second locus. Results herein reported on a sporadic Caucasian patient emphasize the concept that mutation analyses at both DNA and RNA level complement the genetic defect suggested by clinical and cytogenetic signs. The patient presented with typical congenital poikiloderma and bone defects and exhibited significant genomic instability in the peripheral blood karyotype. By RECQL4 DNA mutation analysis, he was found to carry a 1473delT (mut 5) on one allele and an AG to AC change at the 3'-splice site of exon 13 (a variant of mut 4) on the second allele. RT-PCR analysis of RECQL4 cDNA encompassing the entire helicase domain showed diffuse splicing defects indicating that the loss of a single 3'-splice signal motif disregulates the correct splice-site selection and affects the overall RNA processing. The presence of an unstable minisatellite which ends at 3'-splice site of IVS12 may enhance the mutation at this site. This genomic feature together with a number of short introns in the RECQL4 gene may account for the common missplicing of RECQL4 mRNA. While it is possible that defects of RECQL4 mRNA processing might account for part of the clinical variability observed for this syndrome, only a thorough analysis at both genomic and RNA level may allow a genotype-phenotype correlation in RTS patients, restricting the search of a second RTS locus to the specific patients.","dc:creator":"Beghini A","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"RNA processing defects of the helicase gene RECQL4 in a compound heterozygous Rothmund-Thomson patient."},"rdfs:label":"RT-PCR analysis showed diffuse splicing defects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:579f3249-dbd7-4207-81d7-50449a93d410","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dbbef614-f841-4d43-8a84-20a9d1eb0bc2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Mammals have five genes that encode different RecQ DNA helicases.

Each parent was shown to be a heterozygote carrier for one mutation. This report strengthens the association between mutations in RECQL4 helicase gene and RTS.

(1999). Multiple case level studies have been performed with RTS patients that have variants in the RECQL4 gene. WRN and BLM, another two RecQ DNA helicases, are associated with Werner and Bloom syndromes. All three are disorders of chromosomal instability and manifest growth retardation, premature aging, and predisposition to malignancies. RT-PCR analysis of RECQL4 cDNA from patient's cells showed diffuse splicing defects. Defective repair of H2O2-induced DNA lesions was reported in primary RTS patient's cell line, AG05013. Multiple RECQL4 deficient mouse models have been established to show consistent phenotypes with RTS patients, including growth retardation, skin and several other tissue abnormalities, birth defects of the skeletal system and increased cancer susceptibility. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the RECQL4 gene and Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:dbf00cfa-ac36-4eb0-94c4-69b05014e0f6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
