","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056270","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The transition to pulmonary respiration after birth requires rapid alterations in the structure of the mammalian cardiovascular system. One dramatic change that occurs is the closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA), an arterial connection in the fetus that directs blood flow away from the pulmonary circulation. Two members of the TGFÎ² family, bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) and BMP10, have been recently involved in postnatal angiogenesis, both being necessary for remodeling of newly formed microvascular beds. The aim of the present work was to study whether BMP9 and BMP10 could be involved in closure of the DA. We found that Bmp9 knockout in mice led to an imperfect closure of the DA. Further, addition of a neutralizing anti-BMP10 antibody at postnatal day 1 (P1) and P3 in these pups exacerbated the remodeling defect and led to a reopening of the DA at P4. Transmission electron microscopy images and immunofluorescence stainings suggested that this effect could be due to a defect in intimal cell differentiation from endothelial to mesenchymal cells, associated with a lack of extracellular matrix deposition within the center of the DA. This result was supported by the identification of the regulation by BMP9 and BMP10 of several genes known to be involved in this process. The involvement of these BMPs was further supported by human genomic data because we could define a critical region in chromosome 2 encoding eight genes including BMP10 that correlated with the presence of a patent DA. Together, these data establish roles for BMP9 and BMP10 in DA closure.","dc:creator":"Levet S","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"BMP9 and BMP10 are necessary for proper closure of the ductus arteriosus."},"rdfs:label":"Injection of Antibodies Directed Against BMP10 in Bmp9-KO "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded due to the study not closely investigating mutant BMP10 in mice nor capturing the disease inheritance pattern.

One unique missense variant has been reported in two related probands in one publication (PMIDs: 35737725). The gene-disease relationship is supported by expression evidence and a knockout mouse model that shows *Bmp9*-mutant mice injected with anti-Bmp10 antibodies display patent ductus arteriosus (PMIDs: 23715323, 26056270). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
