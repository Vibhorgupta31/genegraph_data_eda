The F5F8D locus was previously mapped to a 1-cM interval on chromosome 18q21. Mutations in a candidate gene in this region, ERGIC-53, were recently found to be associated with the coagulation defect in nine Jewish families. We performed single-strand conformation and sequence analysis of the ERGIC-53 gene in 35 F5F8D families of different ethnic origins. We identified 13 distinct mutations accounting for 52 of 70 mutant alleles. These were 3 splice site mutations, 6 insertions and deletions resulting in translational frameshifts, 3 nonsense codons, and elimination of the translation initiation codon. These mutations are predicted to result in synthesis of either a truncated protein product or no protein at all. This study revealed that F5F8D shows extensive allelic heterogeneity and all ERGIC-53 mutations resulting in F5F8D are \"null.\" Approximately 26% of the mutations have not been identified, suggesting that lesions in regulatory elements or severe abnormalities within the introns may be responsible for the disease in these individuals.

We showed that endogenous LMAN1 and MCFD2 are present primarily in complex with each other with a 1:1 stoichiometry, although MCFD2 is not required for oligomerization of LMAN1. Using a cross-linking-immunoprecipitation assay, we detected a specific interaction of both LMAN1 and MCFD2 with factor VIII, with the B domain as the most likely site of interaction.

The interaction of MCFD2 with factor VIII appeared to be independent of LMAN1-MCFD2 complex formation. These results suggest that LMAN1 and MCFD2 form a cargo receptor complex and that the primary sorting signals residing in the B domain direct the binding of factor VIII to LMAN1-MCFD2 through calcium-dependent protein-protein interactions.
