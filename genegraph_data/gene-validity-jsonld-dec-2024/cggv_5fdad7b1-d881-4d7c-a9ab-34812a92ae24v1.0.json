In a multiplex consanguineous family with severe WWS phenotype, autozygome-guided sequencing of previously reported WWS genes was negative. Exome sequencing followed by autozygome filtration revealed a homozygous two-base pair insertion in B3GNT1 (NM_006876.2:c.821_822insTT), leading to premature truncation of the protein (p.Glu274Aspfs*94). Recently, two missense mutations in this gene have been reported as probably causal in a family with WWS.

Mutations in these glycosyltransferase genes result in defective αDG glycosylation and reduced ligand binding by αDG causing a clinically heterogeneous group of congenital muscular dystrophies, commonly referred to as dystroglycanopathies. The most severe clinical form, Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy and severe neurological and ophthalmological defects. Here, we report two homozygous missense mutations in the β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1) gene in a family affected with WWS. Functional studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the mutations. First, expression of wild-type but not mutant B3GNT1 in human prostate cancer (PC3) cells led to increased levels of αDG glycosylation. Second, morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish b3gnt1 orthologue caused characteristic muscular defects and reduced αDG glycosylation. These functional studies identify an important role of B3GNT1 in the synthesis of the uncharacterized laminin-binding glycan of αDG and implicate B3GNT1 as a novel causative gene for WWS.","dc:creator":"Buysse K","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Missense mutations in β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1) cause Walker-Warburg syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"15456"},{"id":"cggv:a4506592-422d-4627-9df8-cb31a9e6623d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a4506592-422d-4627-9df8-cb31a9e6623d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a4506592-422d-4627-9df8-cb31a9e6623d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Transfection with single mutants and the double mutant did not cause an increase of αDG glycosylation."}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Double homozygous for both mutations and the authors concluded that both mutations were pathogenic because each introduced individually was sufficient to abolish the glycosylation activity of B3GNT1 on dystroglycan, a highly unusual scenario in autosomal recessive inheritance although it has been reported in the context of WWS"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"cggv:5fdad7b1-d881-4d7c-a9ab-34812a92ae24_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5fdad7b1-d881-4d7c-a9ab-34812a92ae24_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c2145c9-e8e4-4e6b-be6b-f0c167867130","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7a67e945-107c-49c1-bc41-084a323fbdec","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Transfection with single mutants and the double mutant did not cause an increase of IIH6-positive cells.
