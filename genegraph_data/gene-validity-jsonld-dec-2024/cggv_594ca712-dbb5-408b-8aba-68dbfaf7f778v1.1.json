The similarity of AIPL1 to AIP has led to suggestions that AIPL1 could function in a similar manner to AIP in facilitating protein translocation and as a component of chaperone complexes. AIPL1 interacts with the cell cycle regulator NEDD8 ultimate buster protein 1 (NUB1). As AIPL1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and NUB1 is predominantly nuclear, we tested the hypothesis that AIPL1 could modulate the nuclear translocation of NUB1. Co-transfection of AIPL1 with GFP-NUB1 resulted in a shift of GFP-NUB1 subcellular distribution toward the cytoplasm. Interestingly, AIPL1 was able to act in a chaperone-like fashion to efficiently suppress inclusion formation by NUB1 fragments. Co-transfection of AIPL1 with GFP-NUB1-N and GFP-NUB1-C resulted in an AIPL1-dependent suppression of GFP-NUB1-N perinuclear inclusions and GFP-NUB1-C intranuclear inclusions leading to the redistribution of these fragments in the cytoplasm. This chaperone-like function of AIPL1 was specific for NUB1, since AIPL1 was unable to suppress the inclusion formation by unrelated aggregation-prone proteins and AIP had no effect on NUB1 localization or inclusion formation. We examined the effect of a range of pathogenic and engineered mutations on the ability of AIPL1 to modulate NUB1 localization or inclusion formation. With the exception of W278X, which formed non-functional SDS-insoluble inclusions, all of the pathogenic mutations studied were soluble and could modulate NUB1 with varying efficiency compared with the wild-type protein. The effect of AIPL1 on NUB1 required the C-terminal region of AIPL1, as engineered C-terminal truncation mutations had no effect on NUB1. These data show that AIPL1 can modulate protein translocation and act in a chaperone-like manner and suggest that AIPL1 is an important modulator of NUB1 cellular function.","dc:creator":"van der Spuy J","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"The Leber congenital amaurosis protein AIPL1 modulates the nuclear translocation of NUB1 and suppresses inclusion formation by NUB1 fragments."},"rdfs:label":"Modulation of Subcellular Distribution of NUB1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4c9cd9e7-60c2-4cda-9406-c9b89bb7eb83","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:95e4b3f5-c8f0-4e42-a154-374de5ba6bf6","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The authors showed that all nine of the suspected disease-associated AIPL1 variations investigated induced aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of the AIPL1 gene, and the study is the first to show that AIPL1 missense mutations alter AIPL1 splicing.

Because this currently incurable disease is present from birth and is a relatively rare disorder, the development of animal models that closely resemble the phenotype in patients is especially important. Our previous genetic analyses of LCA patients identified mutations in the aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1) gene. Here we present development of an animal model of AIPL1-associated LCA, the Aipl1-deficient mouse. Aipl1 is expressed at low levels throughout human and mouse retinal development and is rapidly upregulated as photoreceptors differentiate. The mouse displays rapid retinal degeneration and massive Müler cell gliosis, resembling the phenotype of the rd mouse, which is caused by a mutation in the gene for the beta-subunit of the rod-specific phosphodiesterase. We confirm that this phenotype is consistent with the human disease using electroretinograms, and document the disease pathogenesis by analyzing the development of all retinal cell types and synaptogenesis during retinal histogenesis. Ectopic expression of AIPL1 led to deregulated retinal progenitor cell proliferation and alterations in cell fate specification; however, no gross abnormalities of proliferation during retinal development were detected. Data from analysis of proliferation and cell fate specification during retinal development of Aipl1-deficient mice suggests that there may be redundancy or compensation for Aipl1 loss by other related proteins. Because this mouse model closely mimics the human retinopathy caused by homozygous mutations in this gene, it provides a preclinical model for testing therapies to rescue the vision of children whose

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leber congenital amaurosis in 2000 (Sohochi et al., PMID: 10615133). *AIPL1* has been associated with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy, juvenile retinitis pigmentosa, and Leber congenital amaurosis [OMIM#604393]. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. Therefore, the aforementioned disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, AIPL1-related retinopathy.\n\n11 variants (of variant types including missense, deletion, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in nine probands in four publications (PMIDs: 10615133, 25596619) are included in this curation. Notably, the c.834G>A (p.Trp278Ter) nonsense variant (ClinVar variation ID: 5565) has been reported to be a common variant in this gene (Aboshiha et al., PMID: 25596619). Functional studies have demonstrated that this p.Trp278Ter nonsense variant alters cellular function, affecting the modulation of NUB1, a downstream target of AIPL1 (van der Spuy et al., PMID: 15347646). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Additional functional studies have demonstrated that missense variants (such as c.784G>A (p.Gly262Ser)) can lead to abnormal splicing of transcript (Bellingham et al., PMID: 26650897).\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by mouse models, in which AIPL1-deficient mice have displayed retinal degeneration (Dyer et al., PMIDs: 15582159).\n\nIn summary, *AIPL1* is definitively associated with AIPL1-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on February 2nd, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:594ca712-dbb5-408b-8aba-68dbfaf7f778"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
