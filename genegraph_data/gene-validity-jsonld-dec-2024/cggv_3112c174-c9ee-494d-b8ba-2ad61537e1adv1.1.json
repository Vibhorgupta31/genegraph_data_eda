Each chain has a triple helix flanked by N- and C-terminal globular domains that share homology with the von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains. During biosynthesis, the three chains come together to form triple helical monomers, which then assemble into dimers and tetramers. Tetramers are secreted from the cell and align end-to-end to form microfibrils. The precise molecular mechanisms responsible for assembly are unclear. Mutations in the three collagen VI genes can disrupt collagen VI biosynthesis and matrix organization and are the cause of the inherited disorders Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. We have identified a Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy patient with compound heterozygous mutations in α2(VI). The first mutation causes skipping of exon 24, and the mRNA is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay. The second mutation is a two-amino acid deletion in the C1 VWA domain. Recombinant C1 domains containing the deletion are insoluble and retained intracellularly, indicating that the mutation has detrimental effects on domain folding and structure. Despite this, mutant α2(VI) chains retain the ability to associate into monomers, dimers, and tetramers. However, we show that secreted mutant tetramers containing structurally abnormal C1 VWA domains are unable to associate further into microfibrils, directly demonstrating the critical importance of a correctly folded α2(VI) C1 domain in microfibril formation.","dc:creator":"Tooley LD","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Collagen VI microfibril formation is abolished by an {alpha}2(VI) von Willebrand factor type A domain mutation in a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy."},"rdfs:label":"Immunostaining of muscle"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8f718478-6066-4864-8bc4-6b0a29ce4eaf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4a3131d2-8ad0-4ef0-a750-49ae3074ca53","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"Figure 2H","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18366090","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) cause Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), two related conditions of differing severity.

The monomer was produced by selective reduction of interchain disulphide bridges. Before reduction, dimers, tetramers and larger filamentous structures were found. Dimers are lateral staggered aggregates of two monomers aligned in an anti-parallel fashion. This gives rise to an inner 75 nm-long region of two slightly intertwisted triple helices flanked by the large globular domains. The outer triple-helical segments (length 30 nm) with the small globular domains at their ends emerge at both sides of this structure. Interchain disulphide bridges are probably located in the vicinity of the large domains. Only the outer segments could be degraded by bacterial collagenase. In tetramers the outer segments of two dimers are covalently linked, forming a scissors-like structure. In the fibrous forms several tetramers are assembled end-to-end with an overlap between the outer segments. The molecular masses and sedimentation coefficients were calculated for these various forms from the electron-microscopically observed dimensions and agreed with results obtained by ultracentrifugation.

Morpholinos designed to exon 9 of col6a1 produced a severe muscle disease reminiscent of UCMD, while ones to exon 13 produced a milder phenotype similar to BM.

We performed a genomewide screening with microsatellite markers in a consanguineous family with three sibs affected with UCMD. Linkage of the disease to chromosome 2q37 was found in this family and in two others. We analyzed COL6A3, which encodes the alpha3 chain of collagen VI, and identified one homozygous mutation per family. In family I, the three sibs carried an A-->G transition in the splice-donor site of intron 29 (6930+5A-->G), leading to the skipping of exon 29, a partial reduction of collagen VI in muscle biopsy, and an intermediate phenotype. In family II, the patient had an unusual mild phenotype, despite a nonsense mutation, R465X, in exon 5. Analysis of the patient's COL6A3 transcripts showed the presence of various mRNA species-one of which lacked several exons, including the exon containing the nonsense mutation. The deleted splice variant encodes collagen molecules that have a shorter N-terminal domain but that may assemble with other chains and retain a functional role. This could explain the mild phenotype of the patient who was still ambulant at age 18 years and who showed an unusual combination of hyperlaxity and finger contractures.

We describe clinical and genetic characteristics of 97 individuals with glycine substitutions in the TH domain of COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 and add a review of 97 published cases, for a total of 194 cases. Clinical findings include severe, INT, and mild phenotypes even from patients with identical mutations. INT phenotypes were most common, accounting for almost half of patients, emphasizing the importance of INT phenotypes to the overall phenotypic spectrum. Glycine substitutions in the TH domain are heavily clustered in a short segment N-terminal to the 17th Gly-X-Y triplet, where they are acting as dominants. The most severe cases are clustered in an even smaller region including Gly-X-Y triplets 10-15, accounting for only 5% of the TH domain. Our findings suggest that clustering of glycine substitutions in the N-terminal region of collagen VI is not based on features of the primary sequence. We hypothesize that this region may represent a functional domain within the triple helix.

Since then, the disease has been associated with autosomal recessive and dominant forms of Bethlem myopathy, Ulrich congenital muscular dystrophy, and dystonia. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group and the clinical and genetic findings of patients, we found Bethlem myopathy (OMIM:158810) and Ulrich congenital muscular dystrophy (OMIM:254090) to lie on ends of a clinical spectrum and lumped these entities into Collagen VI-related dystrophy. The split curation for autosomal recessive dystonia will be assessed separately. Fourteen variants (missense, nonsense, splicing) that have been reported in 5 publications (PMIDs: 9536084, 9536084, 11992252, 15689448, 24038877) are included in this curation. At least one variant in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, protein interactions, expression studies, and assays demonstrating functional alterations in both patient and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 11707460, 18825676, 20729548, 6307276, 18366090, 24563484, 23564457). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between COL6A3 and autosomal dominant/autosomal recessive collagen VI-related dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathy GCEP on the meeting date 5/24/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3112c174-c9ee-494d-b8ba-2ad61537e1ad"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
