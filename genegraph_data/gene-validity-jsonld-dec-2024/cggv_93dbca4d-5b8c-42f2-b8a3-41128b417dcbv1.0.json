Most mutations described reside in the central alpha-helical rod domain of desmin. Here we report three novel mutations--c.1325C>T (p.T442I), c.1360C>T (p.R454W), and c.1379G>T (p.S460I)--located in desmin's non-alpha-helical carboxy-terminal \"tail\" domain.

Most notably, when coassembled with wild-type desmin, these mutants revealed a severe disturbance of filament-formation competence and filament-filament interactions, indicating an inherent incompatibility of mutant and wild-type protein to form mixed filaments. The various clinical phenotypes observed may reflect altered interactions of desmin's tail domain with different components of the myoblast cytoskeleton leading to diminished biomechanical properties and/or altered metabolism of the individual myocyte.

Since the vast majority of myofibrillar myopathy causing mutations are heterozygous single amino acid substitutions or small in-frame deletions, the pathogenic role of mutant versus wild-type protein cannot be assessed in human skeletal muscle by standard immunodetection techniques. We report on an exceptional desminopathy due to a heterozygous c.735G>C mutation. Immunoblotting detected full-length 53 kDa desmin and a truncated 50 kDa variant in skeletal muscle from three affected patients of two different families. RT-PCR identified three desmin mRNA species encoding for wild-type and two mutant proteins, p.Glu245Asp and p.Asp214_Glu245del. Since previous functional studies on the p.Glu245Asp mutant showed biological properties identical to wild-type desmin, the truncated p.Asp214_Glu245del desmin is the disease-causing mutant. Semiquantitative RT-PCR established a fraction of the truncated desmin mRNA species in a range from 24% to 37%. Initial quantification of corresponding desmin proteins in the muscle biopsy of the index patient of one family indicated a fraction of only 10% of the truncated species. However, serial analyses of different sections from each muscle biopsy revealed a high intra- and interindividual variability of the truncated desmin protein level within a range from 5% to 43%. Desmin assembly studies in vitro have established clear-cut pathogenic ratios of mutant versus wild-type proteins. However, our findings point out a far more complex situation in human skeletal muscle. The heterogeneously distributed mutation load within and between individual specimens, which reflects local differences in the expression and/or turnover of the mutant protein in different areas containing multiple myonuclear domains, renders it impossible to define an exact pathogenic threshold of a specific mutant in vivo.","dc:creator":"Clemen CS","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"How much mutant protein is needed to cause a protein aggregate myopathy in vivo?

Whereas 6 of 14 mutants assemble into seemingly normal IFs in the test tube, the other mutants interfere with the assembly process at distinct stages, i.e., tetramer formation, unit-length filament (ULF) formation, filament elongation, and IF maturation. Correspondingly, the mutants with in vitro assembly defects yield dot-like aggregates in transfected cells, whereas the mutants that form IFs constitute a seemingly normal IF cytoskeleton in the cellular context.

Every phenotype observed in human myofibrillar myopathy probands are related to these organs, specifically the muscle weakness/atrophy and cardiomyopathy. Although this model does demonstrate all aspects of the human disorder, this more reflects the rarer loss-of-function pathogenic mechansim rather than the gain-of-function aggregates.

In contrast, expression of both mutants in the mice muscle fibers yielded centrally nucleated muscle fibers, abnormal regeneration, and accumulations in the perinuclear regions. In the mouse WT muscle, desmin was correctly aligned like sarcomeres and showed no difference from untreated control muscles. However, expression of both mutants showed altered localization and accumulation around the nuclei and/or subsarcollemal regions. Both mutant lines showed significantly increased regeneration compared to the WT, demonstrating that the expression of this mutant desmin caused muscle fiber degredation. Perturbations and alterations of the z-line is also notable, since the sacromere disorganization is commonly observed in probands with muscular phenotypes such as weakness or atrophy. Reduced maximal active force production in the model was also noted, specifically with both R406W (-18.8%, P <0.001) and E413K (-18.1%, P <0.001) desmin-expressing muscles compared the the WT.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23425003","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The clinical features of myofibrillar myopathies display a wide phenotypic heterogeneity.

Myofibrillar myopathy is a subset of inherited muscle diseases primarily characterized by progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, respiratory abnormalities, and cardiomyopathy. Over 100 variants, mostly missense and small in-frame indels, have been reported in human probands. Although this disorder largely segregates in an autosomal dominant manner, many confirmed cases of autosomal recessive probands have been characterized. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs; 17221859, 23687351, 19105189, 10717012, 9697706, 10545598, 11061256). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 13 additional family members in 3 families. Significantly more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. Although the primary mechanism for pathogenic DES variants is a gain-of-function causing desmin aggregates and clumping in the muscle fibers, there is evidence for some variants disrupting the desmin fiberous network or for a loss-of-function when multiple null variants are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (PMIDs: 16217025, 31718026) This gene has historically been implicated in a form of recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, but as of 2018 the association was reclassified as a type of myofibrillar myopathy (PMIDs: 23687351, 30055862).\nThis gene-disease association is additionally supported by many animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. There are several models that recapitulate either the entirety of phenotypes observed in human probands or a partial aspect, such as the skeletal myopathy or cardiomyopathy phenotypes. These models vary in the pathogenic mechanism, however they all provide strong evidence supporting the pathogenicity of DES null and other variants. DES is uniquely expressed in all types of muscle, further implicating this gene as related to the cardiac and skeletal myopathy phenotypes. A functional assay evaluating the effect of 14 different DES variants was conducted with all of them showing altered function, whether that be disrupting the proper assembly of sarcomeres and z-discs or forming aggregates that impairs the contration and relaxation of the muscle fibers.\nIn summary, DES is definitively associated with semidominant Myofibrillar Myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \nThis gene-disease-inheritance association was recurated according to ClinGen's recuration guidelines (last curation publication date 09/25/17, SOP Version 5).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:93dbca4d-5b8c-42f2-b8a3-41128b417dcb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
