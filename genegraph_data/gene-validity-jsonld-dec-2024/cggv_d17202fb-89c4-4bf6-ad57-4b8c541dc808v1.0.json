In the Druze community in Northern Israel and two Moslem Arab villages located near Jerusalem the incidence of Krabbe disease is about 1 in 100-150 live births. With our cloning of the GALC gene, mutation analysis of these populations was undertaken. The Moslem Arabs were homozygous for two mutations in the GALC gene; a T-to-C transition at CDNA position 1637 (counting from the A of the initiation codon), which is considered a polymorphism and a G-to-A transition at position 1582, which changes the codon for aspartic acid to one for asparagine. The Druze patients are homozygous for a T-to-G transversion at position 1748, which changes the codon for isoleucine to one for serine. Expression studies confirmed the deleterious nature of these mutations. The development of a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and restriction enzyme digestion method to identify these alleles will lead to accurate carrier testing and improved genetic counseling for interested individuals in these communities.","dc:creator":"Rafi MA","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Two different mutations are responsible for Krabbe disease in the Druze and Moslem Arab populations in Israel."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient A"},{"id":"cggv:d2d8d876-7abd-4d9a-9d9f-2d75bbd98c17","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2d8d876-7abd-4d9a-9d9f-2d75bbd98c17_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d2d8d876-7abd-4d9a-9d9f-2d75bbd98c17_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 8786069: Shown to result in non-detectable GALC enzyme activity in transfected COS-1 cells"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Adjusted to 0.25pts to yield 0.5pt total (avoid double-counting)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3db8caa8-ed74-4cb3-bd76-e62e665faa37_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3db8caa8-ed74-4cb3-bd76-e62e665faa37","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:46650030-c563-4789-8cc0-5f403c836cf3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"GALC, 30-KB DEL, IVS10","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/3819"}},{"id":"cggv:9c9eee0c-d2cb-4dc5-a047-5f7cbebec949","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000153.4(GALC):c.521del (p.Tyr174fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/552100"}}],"detectionMethod":"PCR amplification of cDNA from patient fibroblasts or lymphocytes followed by Sanger sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"GALC enzyme activity 3.2% vs wt (measured for all cases in fibroblasts or leukocytes)","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:1e9f6e9c-7334-450f-a824-ffbdd4fbb978_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:46650030-c563-4789-8cc0-5f403c836cf3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20886637","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The characterization of the underlying GALC gene lesions was performed in 30 unrelated patients affected by Krabbe disease, an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase.

With the exception of 4 novel missense mutations that replaced evolutionarily highly conserved residues (p.P318R, p.G323R, p.I384T, p.Y490N), most of the newly described lesions altered mRNA processing.

In addition, 6 previously unreported GALC polymorphisms were identified. The functional significance of the novel GALC missense mutations and polymorphisms was investigated using the MutPred analysis tool. This study, reporting one of the largest genotype-phenotype analyses of the GALC gene so far performed in a European Krabbe disease cohort, revealed that the Italian GALC mutational profile differs significantly from other populations of European origin.

GALC deficiency leads to the accumulation of the cytotoxic glycolipid, galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). Complementary evidence suggested that psychosine is synthesized via an anabolic pathway. Here, we show instead that psychosine is generated catabolically through the deacylation of galactosylceramide by acid ceramidase (ACDase). This reaction uncouples GALC deficiency from psychosine accumulation, allowing us to test the long-standing \"psychosine hypothesis.\" We demonstrate that genetic loss of ACDase activity (Farber disease) in the GALC-deficient mouse model of human GLD (twitcher) eliminates psychosine accumulation and cures GLD. These data suggest that ACDase could be a target for substrate reduction therapy (SRT) in Krabbe patients. We show that pharmacological inhibition of ACDase activity with carmofur significantly decreases psychosine accumulation in cells from a Krabbe patient and prolongs the life span of the twitcher (Twi) mouse. Previous SRT experiments in the Twi mouse utilized l-cycloserine, which inhibits an enzyme several steps upstream of psychosine synthesis, thus altering the balance of other important lipids. Drugs that directly inhibit ACDase may have a more acceptable safety profile due to their mechanistic proximity to psychosine biogenesis.

The identity between the human and murine amino acid sequences was very high, being calculated to be 84%. Sequencing of cDNA from liver of the twitcher mouse revealed a nonsense mutation at codon 339 (TGG-->TGA). The most abundant mRNA of the murine galactocerebrosidase gave a 3.6-kb band, which was not detected in twitcher mice. This suggests that the cDNA (2,278 bp) we characterized represents a minor species generated by an alternate poly(A) signal and that most of the mRNA has a much longer 3'-untranslated region. Genome analysis revealed that this mutation was homozygous in the twitcher and heterozygous in the carrier but was not present in normal mice. The normal mouse cDNA but not the mutant cDNA of the galactocerebrosidase transfected into COS1 cells gave rise to an increase in enzymatic activity. We concluded that this mutation results in the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase in the twitcher mouse.","dc:creator":"Sakai N","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Molecular cloning and expression of cDNA for murine galactocerebrosidase and mutation analysis of the twitcher mouse, a model of Krabbe's disease."},"rdfs:label":"GALC knockout mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4715,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7331f074-89dd-49c7-a5ea-52488f73c0db","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009499","gene":"hgnc:4115","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between the GALC gene and Krabbe disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 18, 2022. GALC encodes galactocerebrosidase (GALC), a lysosomal enzyme involved that removes galactose from galactosylceramide, a glycosphingolipid (PMID: 8281145, PMID: 1164212, PMID: 5271165). When GALC is deficient, as is the case among individuals with Krabbe disease, the enzyme acid ceramidase removes the fatty acyl chain from galactosylceramide to generate psychosine (PMID: 31527255). Psychosine is a cytotoxic glycolipid that results in loss of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, leading to CNS and PNS demyelination and the neurologic anomalies seen in Krabbe disease (PMID: 34449528, PMID: 31527255). \n\nThe disease mechanism of Krabbe disease is loss of function. Krabbe disease was first reported in 1916 (PMID: 24137751) and the first report of biallelic variants in GALC among patients with Krabbe was published in 1994 (PMID: 8297359). Since then, at least 260 unique variants have been identified (PMID: 34449528). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between Krabbe disease and GALC. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants, as well as larger deletions, including a recurrent 30kb deletion encompassing exons 11-17 (as reviewed in PMID: 34449528). In total, nine variants from five probands in three publications were curated (PMID: 23462331, PMID: 8786069, PMID: 20886637); although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between GALC and Krabbe disease includes the biochemical function of the gene product (the GALC enzyme) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with Krabbe disease (PMID: 8281145, PMID: 1164212, PMID: 5271165, PMID: 34449528, PMID: 31527255), the biochemical and clinical features of a mouse animal model (‘twitcher’ mouse model) homozygous for the p.W339* variant (PMID: 7417782, PMID: 8769874), and the impact of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy among human Krabbe patients (PMID: 15901860, PMID: 28855403). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, GALC is definitively associated with Krabbe disease. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time.
