Based on its expression pattern and observations in cell culture, it has been postulated that M-cadherin may be important for the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes, the correct localization and function of satellite cells during muscle regeneration, and the specialized architecture of adhering junctions in granule cells of cerebellar glomeruli. In order to investigate the potential roles of M-cadherin in vivo, we generated a null mutation in mice. Mutant mice were viable and fertile and showed no gross developmental defects. In particular, the skeletal musculature appeared essentially normal. Moreover, muscle lesions induced by necrosis were efficiently repaired in mutant mice, suggesting that satellite cells are present, can be activated, and are able to form new myofibers. This was also confirmed by normal growth and fusion potential of mutant satellite cells cultured in vitro. In the cerebellum of M-cadherin-lacking mutants, typical contactus adherens junctions were present and similar in size and numbers to the equivalent junctions in wild-type animals. However, the adhesion plaques in the cerebellum of these mutants appeared to contain elevated levels of N-cadherin compared to wild-type animals. Taken together, these observations suggest that M-cadherin in the mouse serves no absolutely required function during muscle development and regeneration and is not essential for the formation of specialized cell contacts in the cerebellum. It seems that N-cadherin or other cadherins can largely compensate for the lack of M-cadherin.","dc:creator":"Hollnagel A","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The cell adhesion molecule M-cadherin is not essential for muscle development and regeneration."},"rdfs:label":"Knockout Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Homozygous mutant mice were viable and fertile and showed no gross developmental defects.\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:9295bddb-d61c-47c2-b186-97296b9c4d94_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9295bddb-d61c-47c2-b186-97296b9c4d94_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2670399-1d90-4a64-b49b-8f583306cf1f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4db2fc7e-be02-4a6b-824b-1df0057b66ff","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:d2670399-1d90-4a64-b49b-8f583306cf1f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:a03f094e-da57-4be8-8b74-94954b6d30c3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004933.3(CDH15):c.365C>T (p.Ala122Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA127321"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19012874","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cell-adhesion molecules play critical roles in brain development, as well as maintaining synaptic structure, function, and plasticity. Here we have found the disruption of two genes encoding putative cell-adhesion molecules, CDH15 (cadherin superfamily) and KIRREL3 (immunoglobulin superfamily), by a chromosomal translocation t(11;16) in a female patient with intellectual disability (ID). We screened coding regions of these two genes in a cohort of patients with ID and controls and identified four nonsynonymous CDH15 variants and three nonsynonymous KIRREL3 variants that appear rare and unique to ID. These variations altered highly conserved residues and were absent in more than 600 unrelated patients with ID and 800 control individuals. Furthermore, in vivo expression studies showed that three of the CDH15 variations adversely altered its ability to mediate cell-cell adhesion. We also show that in neuronal cells, human KIRREL3 colocalizes and interacts with the synaptic scaffolding protein, CASK, recently implicated in X-linked brain malformation and ID. Taken together, our data suggest that alterations in CDH15 and KIRREL3, either alone or in combination with other factors, could play a role in phenotypic expression of ID in some patients.","dc:creator":"Bhalla K","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Alterations in CDH15 and KIRREL3 in patients with mild to severe intellectual disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19012874","rdfs:label":"Patient 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Allele frequency in gnomAD: 65/281588\n"},{"id":"cggv:92013e0c-08a4-4b5f-afee-a17e16cdc926_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9df5c1d5-4b31-465f-bd90-420505b5e4d9","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:92013e0c-08a4-4b5f-afee-a17e16cdc926_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8f688ad2-d3a2-4aa0-bcc3-23056ef4c01c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004933.3(CDH15):c.274C>T (p.Arg92Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA127320"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19012874"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19012874","rdfs:label":"Patient 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Allele frequency in gnomAD: 18/273398\n"},{"id":"cggv:a820273e-20af-4ca6-8cb2-2e96948a6655_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c784e14-9a00-4678-a0cd-79f153f4ba9d","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"SSCP","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a820273e-20af-4ca6-8cb2-2e96948a6655_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:59ac3b76-a23e-4369-96ef-b7c068cc605f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004933.3(CDH15):c.22G>C (p.Val8Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8238636"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19012874"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19012874","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Allele frequency in gnomAD: 25/191314\n"},{"id":"cggv:e3acf249-0495-4d62-8766-f0abcf18281a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6cbdf572-6b51-4e42-8b31-33072c42488a","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:e3acf249-0495-4d62-8766-f0abcf18281a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:2ca0106a-7713-486d-a7cf-ca9a69f868ca","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004933.3(CDH15):c.2231C>T (p.Ser744Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10603282"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26077850","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Clinical exome sequencing (CES) has become an increasingly popular diagnostic tool in patients with heterogeneous genetic disorders, especially in those with neurocognitive phenotypes. Utility of CES in consanguineous populations has not yet been determined on a large scale. A clinical cohort of 149 probands from Qatar with suspected Mendelian, mainly neurocognitive phenotypes, underwent CES from July 2012 to June 2014. Intellectual disability and global developmental delay were the most common clinical presentations but our cohort displayed other phenotypes, such as epilepsy, dysmorphism, microcephaly and other structural brain anomalies and autism. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation, including pathogenic CNVs, was identified in 89 probands for a diagnostic yield of 60%. Consanguinity and positive family history predicted a higher diagnostic yield. In 5% (7/149) of cases, CES implicated novel candidate disease genes (MANF, GJA9, GLG1, COL15A1, SLC35F5, MAGE4, NEUROG1). CES uncovered two coexisting genetic disorders in 4% (6/149) and actionable incidental findings in 2% (3/149) of cases. Average time to diagnosis was reduced from 27 to 5 months.

This translocation was not counted as evidence because the contribution of KIRREL3 cannot be ruled out. The authors also screened coding regions of these two genes in a cohort of patients with ID and identified four heterozygous missense variants in CDH15 (three with unknown inheritance and one inherited from an unaffected father). In vitro functional expression studies in mouse cells showed that three of the mutant proteins resulted in decreased cell adhesion. However, these four variants are observed in the gnomAD database at frequencies too high to be causative of disease and therefore were not scored as evidence. According to gnomAD (v2.1.1), CDH15 is not constrained for either loss-of-function or missense variants (pLI = 0, Z score = -1.01). Since then, two additional heterozygous CDH15 variants have been reported. In 2012, Bartnik et al. detected a 97 kb deletion containing CDH15 in a 9-month-old female with profound developmental delay, Rett-like syndrome, autistic features, and seizures. However, this deletion also included part of a neighboring gene, ACSF3, and was inherited from the healthy father (PMID: 22825934). In 2015, another heterozygous CDH15 missense variant was reported in a proband with speech delay, hyperactivity, and dysmorphic facial features, but this variant was also present in gnomAD and its inheritance and functional impact were unknown (PMID: 26077850). Therefore, no points were granted for genetic evidence regarding autosomal dominant ID. In addition, a homozygous splice variant in the last intron of CDH15 was reported in a 11-year-old female born to consanguineous parents with ID, hip dysplasia, prominent forehead, retrognathia, abnormal facial shape, and strabismus; no functional studies were performed (PMID: 28940097). The contribution of biallelic CDH15 variants to neurodevelopmental disorders is unknown, and is not addressed in this curation. Mouse model studies provide no supportive experimental evidence as homozygous CDH15 mutant mice were viable and fertile and did not show either gross developmental defects or abnormal cerebellum adherens junctions (PMID: 12052883). In summary, there is disputed evidence linking the CDH15 gene to autosomal dominant ID. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/17/2021.\nPlease see Evidence Summary","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9295bddb-d61c-47c2-b186-97296b9c4d94"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
