Homozygous null mice are profoundly deaf and have vestibular symptoms- circling behavior, head tilting, hyperactivity, pathological reaching response. Preyer reflex was absent in all null mice, while heterozygotes were normal. Histological examination of inner ear revealed profound deformation. The entire cochlea and vestibulum were missing, inner ear replaced by \"a large irregular and continuous cavity\".

Genes encoding forkhead proteins are instrumental during embryogenesis in mammals, in particular during development of the nervous system. Here we report that mice with a targeted disruption of the Fkh10 locus exhibit circling behaviour, poor swimming ability and abnormal reaching response-all common findings in mice with vestibular dysfunction. These animals also fail to elicit a Preyer reflex in response to a suprathreshold auditory stimulation, as seen in mice with profound hearing impairment. Histological examination of the inner ear reveals a gross structural malformation of the vestibulum as well as the cochlea. These structures have been replaced by a single irregular cavity in which neither proper semicircular ducts nor cochlea can be identified. We also show that at 9.5 days post coitum (dpc), Fkh10 is exclusively expressed in the otic vesicle. These findings implicate Fkh10 as an early regulator necessary for development of both cochlea and vestibulum and identify its human homologue FKHL10 as a previously unknown candidate deafness gene at 5q34.","dc:creator":"Hulander M","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"The winged helix transcription factor Fkh10 is required for normal development of the inner ear."},"rdfs:label":"Hulander Animal Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:842b8bd4-bbe3-44eb-8548-6ac7d4a846c7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:842b8bd4-bbe3-44eb-8548-6ac7d4a846c7","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:156b2e3f-09ff-4ed0-9a94-bc64fa2196ff","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012188.4(FOXI1):c.436C>T (p.Leu146Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA362125453"}},"detectionMethod":"WES in affecteds, and segregation analysis","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic acidosis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000121","obo:HP_0011387","obo:HP_0002748","obo:HP_0000407"],"secondTestingMethod":"Genotyping","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:689705fe-a475-4ce3-96c6-0d7dee47c1a8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:156b2e3f-09ff-4ed0-9a94-bc64fa2196ff"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29242249","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Maintenance of the composition of inner ear fluid and regulation of electrolytes and acid-base homeostasis in the collecting duct system of the kidney require an overlapping set of membrane transport proteins regulated by the forkhead transcription factor FOXI1. In two unrelated consanguineous families, we identified three patients with novel homozygous missense mutations in FOXI1 (p.L146F and p.R213P) predicted to affect the highly conserved DNA binding domain. Patients presented with early-onset sensorineural deafness and distal renal tubular acidosis. In cultured cells, the mutations reduced the DNA binding affinity of FOXI1, which hence, failed to adequately activate genes crucial for normal inner ear function and acid-base regulation in the kidney. A substantial proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of inherited distal renal tubular acidosis has no identified causative mutations in currently known disease genes. Our data suggest that recessive mutations in FOXI1 can explain the disease in a subset of these patients.","dc:creator":"Enerbäck S","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Acidosis and Deafness in Patients with Recessive Mutations in FOXI1."}},"rdfs:label":"Family 1 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:689705fe-a475-4ce3-96c6-0d7dee47c1a8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:689705fe-a475-4ce3-96c6-0d7dee47c1a8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:689705fe-a475-4ce3-96c6-0d7dee47c1a8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"trans-activation of WT and mutant FOXI1  constructs showed that  WT FOXI1 increased reporter gene activity severalfold above empty vector-transfected cells, where the p.L146F or p.R213P mutant constructs show significantly reduced capability to trans-activate these promoters. \n"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Downgraded because the variant is missense in a consanguineous family.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, this gene-disease association was split from the FOXI1- enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVA) association due to phenotypic concordance with the mouse model (Hulander et al., PMID:9843211). The split curation for autosomal recessive EVA has been curated separately.  Additionally, digenic inheritance with variants in FOXI1 and SLC26A4 has been proposed in association with autosomal recessive enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome, which has been split in its own curation and is currently disputed (Yang et al. 2007 PMID:17503324). At least 2 missense variants have been reported in humans. Association is seen in at least 2 probands in 1 publication (PMID: 29242249). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The mechanism for disease is unknown. The gene-disease association is also supported by a homozygous FOXI1 null mouse (PMID:9843211). Homozygous null mice were profoundly deaf with vestibular symptoms and histological examination of the inner ear revealed profound deformation. In summary, due to minimal genetic evidence in humans, there is limited evidence to support the FOXI1 and AR syndromic genetic deafness and renal tubular acidosis association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/27/2018. It was re-evaluated on 3/16/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change, and no new additional information was added to the curation.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
