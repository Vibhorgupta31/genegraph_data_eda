Three major clinical forms of GM1-gangliosidosis have been established on the basis of age of onset and severity of symptoms: infantile, late infantile/juvenile, and adult. We performed mutation analysis on 30 GM1-gangliosidosis and five Morquio B patients, mainly of Spanish origin, and all the causative mutations were identified. Thirty different mutations were found, 21 of which were novel. With the exception of two adults and one juvenile patient, all the GM1-gangliosidosis patients were affected by the infantile form. Clinical findings are presented for all patients. We report the association of the novel mutations p.T420K and p.L264S with the adult form and the juvenile form, respectively. In addition, the novel mutation p.Y83C was associated with Morquio B disease. Among the 30 GM1-gangliosidosis patients, 6 were of Gypsy origin (Roma). Moreover, those six Gypsy patients shared not only the same mutation (p.R59H) but also a common haplotype. This observation indicates a possible founder effect in this group and suggests that screening of the p.R59H mutation may be appropriate in GM1-gangliosidosis patients of Gypsy origin. This is the first exhaustive mutational analysis performed in a large group of Iberian GM1-gangliosidosis and Morquio B patients.","dc:creator":"Santamaria R","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Twenty-one novel mutations in the GLB1 gene identified in a large group of GM1-gangliosidosis and Morquio B patients: possible common origin for the prevalent p.R59H mutation among gypsies."}},{"id":"cggv:0a720208-72c3-4984-9b59-80434204c997_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:24383d9b-a14c-41f6-aa8c-f9a8659f8847"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16941474"}],"rdfs:label":"Santamaria_Patient GM1.1"},{"id":"cggv:8dda0a3a-9a32-4c22-8612-c2d6bca0a6c5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8dda0a3a-9a32-4c22-8612-c2d6bca0a6c5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The proband was compound heterozygous for two missense variants: Arg201His and Gly272Asp.

The duplication comprised positions +1688-+1706 of the GLB1 cDNA. It partially disrupted a potential exon splicing enhancer (ESE), leading to exon skipping in a fraction of the transcripts. Thus, the mutation caused the expression of two different mRNAs from the mutant allele. One transcript contained the complete exon 15 with the 19-bp duplication, while the other transcript lacked exon 15. In the transcript containing exon 15 with the 19-bp duplication a premature termination codon (PTC) appeared, but due to its localization in the last exon of canine GLB1, nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) did not occur. As a consequence of these molecular events two different truncated GLB1 proteins are predicted to be expressed from the mutant GLB1 allele.

The primary role of EBP is to chaperone the deposition of elastin fibers in the extracellular matrix. The phenotypic spectrum of GM1 gangliosidosis is a continuum that is classified based on age of onset: Type I (infantile), Type II (late-infantile and juvenile) and Type III (adult) (PMID: 34539759, 24156116). The clinical manifestations are variable and may include intellectual disability,  cerebral degeneration, developmentla delay, gait disturbance, kyphosis, scoliosis, joint stiffness, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, facial dysmorphism and/or dwarfism. The diagnosis of GM1 gangliosidosis involves demonstration of low beta-galactosidase enzyme activity in patient fibroblasts.\n\n**GLB1** was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive GM1 gangliosidosis in 1991 (Yoshida et al, PMID: 1907800; Nishimoto et al, PMID: 1909089). More than 200 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nOMIM entities: \nGM1-gangliosidosis, type I (MIM: 230500); GM1-gangliosidosis, type II\t(MIM: 230600); GM1-gangliosidosis, type III (MIM: 230650); Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (Morquio) (MIM: 253010)\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, multiple disease assertions are made in the literature; while the GM1 gangiosidoses phenotypes fall on a spectrum, there are differences in phenotypic variability and potentially molecular mechanism(s) between the GM1 gangliosidosis and Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB. Therefore, the two entities have been split into separate curations.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 1 publication (PMID: 16941474). Several variants are reported to be recurrent in affected individuals. Much more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function.\n\nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional studies, model organisms and rescue evidence. Reduction in β-GAL activity leads to the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside and its asialo derivative (PMID: 34539759). **GLB1** interacts with **NEU1** and **CTSA** to form the lysosomal multienzyme complex (PMID: 33980489). Several model organisms, spontaneous and lab-generated have been reported in the literature (knock-out mouse, PMID: 9063740; spontaneous in American black bears, PMID: 24581871; spontaneous in Siamese cats, PMID: 22772479; spontaneous in Alaskan Huskies, PMID: 15944348). Rescue of phenotype by the wild-type gene product has been reported in mouse model and patient cells (PMID: 31481471) and enzyme replacement therapy are under development and refinement (PMID: 26766614).\n\nIn summary, **GLB1** is definitively associated with autosomal recessive GM1 gangliosidosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on April 28, 2023.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0019c7ef-4e2f-4f32-ab42-decfa0b20c29"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
