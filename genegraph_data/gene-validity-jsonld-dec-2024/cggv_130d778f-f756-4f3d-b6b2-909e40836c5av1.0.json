We show that MLP can form a ternary complex with two of its previously documented myofibrillar ligand proteins, N-RAP and alpha-actinin, which indicates the presence of distinct, non-overlapping binding sites. Our data also show that, in comparison to wild-type MLP, the capacity of the mutated MLP protein to bind both N-RAP and alpha-actinin is significantly decreased. In addition, this single point mutation prevents zinc coordination and proper folding of the second zinc-finger in the first LIM domain, which consequently renders the protein less stable and more susceptible to proteolysis. The molecular basis for HCM-causing mutations in the MLP gene might therefore be an alteration in the equilibrium of interactions of the ternary complex MLP-N-RAP-alpha-actinin. This assumption is supported by the previous observation that in the pathological situation accompanied by MLP down regulation, cardiomyocytes try to compensate for the decreased stability of MLP protein by increasing the expression of its ligand N-RAP, which might finally result in the development of myocyte disarray that is characteristic of this disease.","dc:creator":"Gehmlich K","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Decreased interactions of mutant muscle LIM protein (MLP) with N-RAP and alpha-actinin and their implication for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Gehmlich Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Altered expression of variant protein in expression cultures"},{"id":"cggv:2fb43eed-de56-400d-83df-56cc70874ecb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e8627e7-bb1d-4bb6-a40d-4e8a93696860","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"},"dc:description":"CSRP3 is also expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscle myocytes (Arber 1994). 15% of HCM cases are associated with mild skeletal myopathy (Karandreas et al 2000). 3/5 patients with the C58G mutation had mild myopathy.

American Heart Association (AHA) recommends family screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We assessed the outcome of family screening combining clinical evaluation and screening for sarcomere gene mutations in a cohort of 90 Danish HCM patients and their close relatives, in all 451 persons. Index patients were screened for mutations in all coding regions of 10 sarcomere genes (MYH7, MYL3, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC, CSRP3, TCAP, and TNNC1) and five exons of TTN. Relatives were screened for presence of minor or major diagnostic criteria for HCM and tracking of DNA variants was performed. In total, 297 adult relatives (>18 years) (51.2%) fulfilled one or more criteria for HCM. A total of 38 HCM-causing mutations were detected in 32 index patients. Six patients carried two disease-associated mutations. Twenty-two mutations have only been identified in the present cohort. The genetic diagnostic yield was almost twice as high in familial HCM (53%) vs. HCM of sporadic or unclear inheritance (19%). The yield was highest in families with an additional history of HCM-related clinical events. In relatives, 29.9% of mutation carriers did not fulfil any clinical diagnostic criterion, and in 37.5% of relatives without a mutation, one or more criteria was fulfilled. A total of 60% of family members had no mutation and could be reassured and further follow-up ceased. Genetic diagnosis may be established in approximately 40% of families with the highest yield in familial HCM with clinical events. Mutation-screening was superior to clinical investigation in identification of individuals not at increased risk, where follow-up is redundant, but should be offered in all families with relatives at risk for developing HCM.","dc:creator":"Andersen PS","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Diagnostic yield, interpretation, and clinical utility of mutation screening of sarcomere encoding genes in Danish hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and relatives."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19035361","rdfs:label":"Patient GEF"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"gnomAD Max MAF (EU Finnish) = 128/25,794 alleles, 1 homozygote = 0.004962"},{"id":"cggv:b3737ea0-a806-41a8-bf2f-04daf8867a9b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aee9a30e-a217-40a5-8509-e97bea7d0267","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"High-throughput sequencing of 41 cardiovascular genes in 223 unrelated patients with HCM.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001639","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Proband also carries 2 TTN variants (D12799H and V9923delinsVE)","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:b3737ea0-a806-41a8-bf2f-04daf8867a9b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f62b4aa0-6f11-4116-ad26-888fbe671501"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396983"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396983","rdfs:label":"H35"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD Max MAF (EU Non-Finnish) = 5/ 126,650 alleles, 0 homozygotes = 0.00003948"},{"id":"cggv:d334d755-ce4f-43f7-a2f2-9bfd7fd738f0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a6bf9901-dbe3-4bda-9e89-49486fbe6df7","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"not given","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001639","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"not given","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:d334d755-ce4f-43f7-a2f2-9bfd7fd738f0_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:bd9c56ca-f1cc-4ff2-9adf-301f0632cc00","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003476.5(CSRP3):c.28T>C (p.Cys10Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA379888654"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25351510"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25351510","rdfs:label":"Lopes Case 8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"absent from gnomAD"},{"id":"cggv:0c45fee3-62dd-4347-8903-52ed8af2b48e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd5913c4-17f8-40c5-be95-208eaaed7797","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"High-throughput sequencing of 41 cardiovascular genes in 223 unrelated patients with HCM.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001639","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"not given","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:0c45fee3-62dd-4347-8903-52ed8af2b48e_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:f62b4aa0-6f11-4116-ad26-888fbe671501"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396983"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396983","rdfs:label":"Lopes Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD Max MAF (EU Non-Finnish) = 5/ 126,650 alleles, 0 homozygotes = 0.00003948"},{"id":"cggv:ffc94bfa-dc99-4c1a-97b9-ca5c93105f57_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fcb25a83-f32d-4713-bdb3-b39465c24a38","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"NGS of 62 sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric genes in 41 HCM cases and 3 patients with HCM-related disorders of Italian ethnicity","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"HCM; QTc: 0.4 ms","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001639","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Proband also carries MYBPC3 p.M949fs (LB/VUS), TXNRD2 c.375-8C>T (LB), and RBM20 p.E1125K (VUS)","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:ffc94bfa-dc99-4c1a-97b9-ca5c93105f57_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4f6325fd-f825-4cb8-ac45-0a75d70fc723"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656175","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common genetic heart disorder characterized by unexplained left ventricle hypertrophy associated with non-dilated ventricular chambers.

cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease with an estimated prevalence of 1/500. More than 40 genes have been reported to cause HCM. Among them, CSRP3 is usually included on HCM gene panels used for molecular diagnosis by next-generation sequencing (NGS). To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a NGS workflow based on a panel of 48 cardiomyopathies-causing genes was analyzed on a cohort of 542 HCM patients. As expected, this molecular approach led to identify most pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants into prevalent HCM-causing genes: MYBPC3 (123/542; 22.7%), MYH7 (48/542; 8.9%), TNNT2 (12/542; 2.2%), and TNNI3 (10/542; 1.8%). Among MYBPC3 variants, 96 led to a premature stop codon (78%). More surprisingly, our molecular study led also to detect, for the first time, homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants in two unrelated HCM probands. Meta-analysis of rare previously reported CSRP3 variants on HCM probands using ACMG guidelines indicate that only one variation (p.Cys58Gly) could be considered as likely pathogen. By combining meta-analysis results and identification of two unrelated HCM patients with homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants, we suggest that the association of CSRP3 as a validated HCM-causing gene require additional studies and those CSRP3 variants could result in HCM with an autosomal recessive inheritance rather than with an autosomal dominant transmission as usually reported on HCM (OMIM 612124).","dc:creator":"Janin A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"First identification of homozygous truncating CSRP3 variants in two unrelated cases with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30012424","rdfs:label":"Case 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Patient has consanguineous parents and is HOMOZYGOUS for a truncating variant."},{"id":"cggv:6791ce45-eda1-49a5-a575-e8553c87c6e5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02ad067c-b719-45d6-adb4-0b1a20278aa3","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"not given","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001639","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Proband also carries RBM20 E1125K (LB/Benign), RYR2 R694X, and TTN P13044L","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:6791ce45-eda1-49a5-a575-e8553c87c6e5_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c416e7be-d084-42e3-80d9-cff4084c1fa8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003476.5(CSRP3):c.415-1G>T (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5916543"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396983"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396983","rdfs:label":"H116"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Variant predicted to affect a canonical splice-site (SA), probably causing loss-of-function (by removing the last 2 exons = aa139-194 = the last 55 aa);

With the improvement in genetic testing over time, double-heterozygous mutations are more often found by coincidence in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Double heterozygosity can be a cause of the wellknown clinical diversity within HCM families.Methods and results. We describe a family in which members carry either a single mutation or are double heterozygous for mutations in myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) and cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3). The described family emphasises the idea of a more severe clinical phenotype with double-heterozygous mutations. It also highlights the importance of cardiological screening where NT-proBNP may serve as an added diagnostic tool.Conclusion. With a more severe inexplicable phenotype of HCM within a family, one should consider the possibility of double-heterozygous mutations. This implies that in such families, even when one disease-causing mutation is found, all the family members still have an implication for cardiological screening parallel to extended genetic screening.

CSRP3 was first associated with this disease in humans in 2003 (Geier et al., PMID 12642359). The mechanism for disease is unknown. The gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro assays. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association with HCM. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:130d778f-f756-4f3d-b6b2-909e40836c5a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
