Here, positional cloning methods establish KVLQT1 as the chromosome 11-linked LQT1 gene responsible for the most common inherited cardiac arrhythmia.

KVLQT1 mutations are present in affected members of 16 arrhythmia families, including one intragenic deletion and ten different missense mutations.

The molecular structure of the I(Ks) channel is not known, but physiological data indicate that one component of the I(Ks), channel is minK, a 130-amino-acid protein with a single putative transmembrane domain. The size and structure of this protein is such that it is unlikely that minK alone forms functional channels. We have previously used positional cloning techniques to define a new putative K+-channel gene, KVLQT1. Mutations in this gene cause long-QT syndrome, an inherited disorder that increases the risk of sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. Here we show that KVLQT1 encodes a K+ channel with biophysical properties unlike other known cardiac currents. We considered that K(V)LQT1 might coassemble with another subunit to form functional channels in cardiac myocytes. Coexpression of K(V)LQT1 with minK induced a current that was almost identical to cardiac I(Ks). Therefore, K(V)LQT1 is the subunit that coassembles with minK to form I(Ks) channels and I(Ks) dysfunction is a cause of cardiac arrhythmia.","dc:creator":"Sanguinetti MC","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"Coassembly of K(V)LQT1 and minK (IsK) proteins to form cardiac I(Ks) potassium channel."},"rdfs:label":"Voltage clamp"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:5000dde0-156c-45b0-87db-35a935c69cb7_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:954590a5-80d3-4931-8fcb-8a3776078ff4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a2987b02-1289-4f1f-bede-01dedadde5bd","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Accelerated activation of K current","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15159330","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The electrocardiographic short QT-interval syndrome forms a distinct clinical entity presenting with a high rate of sudden death and exceptionally short QT intervals.

Bellocq et al. were the first to identify a rare KCNQ1 missense variant (p.Val180Leu ClinVar Variation ID# 3148) in a patient with SQTS (PMID 15159330). Subsequently, 9 other probands with SQTS were found to carry another variant (p.Val14Met, ClinVar Variation ID# 67072). Interestingly, all of these 9 cases presented with severe bradycardia in-utero or at birth and in 6 atrial fibrillation was also documented (PMIDs 24818999, 26279191, 16109388, 24380499, 25974115, 28491547). Importantly, in none of the p.Val14Met cases was cardiac arrest or SCD described. In fact, cardiac arrest was described only in the first case described by Bellocq et al.\nIn 4 cases the p.Val14Met variant was demonstrated to be de-novo although paternity was not proven in all.  In another 4 cases no other family members were diagnosed and in one family the father of the proband was identified with the p.Val14Met variant and demonstrated a mild phenotype. The fact that almost all genetic evidence was derived from a single variant led the Expert Panel to limit the classification of KCNQ1 as a SQTS-causing gene to “Strong”, despite evidence being reproducible over time.    \n\nAlmost all genetic evidence derived from a single variant.
