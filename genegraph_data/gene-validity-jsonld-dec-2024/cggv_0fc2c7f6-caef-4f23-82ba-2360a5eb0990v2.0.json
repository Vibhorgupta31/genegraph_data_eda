The proteins products of PRKCSH (alias GIIB) and SEC63 function in protein quality control and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while LRP5 is implicated in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To identify common denominators in the PLD pathogenesis, we mapped the PLD interactome by affinity proteomics, employing both HEK293T cells and H69 cholangiocytes. Identification of known complex members, such as glucosidase IIA (GIIA) for PRKCSH, and SEC61A1 and SEC61B for SEC63, confirmed the specificity of the analysis. GANAB, encoding GIIA, was very recently identified as an ADPLD gene. The presence of GIIA in the LRP5 complex pinpoints a potential functional connection with PRKCSH. Interestingly, all three PLD-associated protein complexes included filamin A (FLNA), a multifunctional protein described to play a role in ciliogenesis as well as canonical Wnt signalling. As ciliary dysfunction may also contribute to hereditary liver cyst formation, we evaluated the requirement of PRKCSH and SEC63 for ciliogenesis and Wnt signaling. By CRISPR/Cas9 induced knockdown of both ADPLD genes in HEK293T cells and H69 cholangiocytes, we identified that their depletion results in defective ciliogenesis. However, only H69 knockouts displayed reduced Wnt3a activation. Our results suggest that loss of PRKCSH and SEC63 leads to general defects in ciliogenesis, while quenching of the Wnt signaling cascade is cholangiocyte-restricted. Interactions of all three PLD-associated protein complexes with FLNA may mark a common link between the ADPLD proteins and the cystogenic processes driving this disease.","dc:creator":"Wills ES","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Liver cyst gene knockout in cholangiocytes inhibits cilium formation and Wnt signaling."},"rdfs:label":"SEC63 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:74418af4-356d-4a73-b918-d4041897db7b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8e02de7-98db-4a38-970d-36e8d114d541","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"},"dc:description":"CRISPR was used to KO SEC61B in a kidney epithelial cell line generated from mouse models containing 3 copies of BAC transgene expressing Pkd1 with N-terminal FLAG and C-terminal HA tag (Pkd1F/H-BAC)\nIn these cells PC1 was barely detectable, while PC2 was not affected.

The causative genes are known for fewer than 40% of PCLD index cases. Here, we have used whole exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 102 unrelated patients who were excluded for mutations in the 2 most common PCLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, to identify heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in 3 additional genes, ALG8, GANAB, and SEC61B. Similarly to PRKCSH and SEC63, these genes encode proteins that are integral to the protein biogenesis pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. We inactivated these candidate genes in cell line models to show that loss of function of each results in defective maturation and trafficking of polycystin-1, the central determinant of cyst pathogenesis. Despite acting in a common pathway, each PCLD gene product demonstrated distinct effects on polycystin-1 biogenesis. We also found enrichment on a genome-wide basis of heterozygous mutations in the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease gene PKHD1, indicating that adult PKHD1 carriers can present with clinical PCLD. These findings define genetic and biochemical modulators of polycystin-1 function and provide a more complete definition of the spectrum of dominant human polycystic diseases.","dc:creator":"Besse W","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Isolated polycystic liver disease genes define effectors of polycystin-1 function."},"rdfs:label":"SEC61B and PC1 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4692ae62-dafd-4eb6-9498-493281cf5d72","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c8d5e792-89d0-490f-ab96-05d21c8b5fc2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Activation of the UPR pathway was measured via WB of spliced XBP1 and found to be increased.\nTunicamycin was used as a + control","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28375157","rdfs:label":"UPR activation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":7073,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":3,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6aa2b4ab-a58e-43cf-a9f5-c7a9b1655e39","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0550003","gene":"hgnc:16993","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","dc:description":"SEC61B was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD) in 2017 (Besse et al., 2017, PMID: 28375157). Two unique variants (frameshift, start-loss) reported in two probands in one publication are included in this curation (PMID: 28375157). One patient had numerous small liver cysts and 1 kidney cyst and the other had numerous small liver cysts and no kidney cysts. Additional clinical features were not provided. These heterozygous mutations in SEC61B lead to complete loss of function of the affected allele (PMID: 28375157). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the related roles of ADPLD proteins and in vitro functional assays (PMID:28973524,28375157). In summary, there remains “Limited” evidence supporting the relationship between SEC61B and ADPLD. While more evidence is required to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
