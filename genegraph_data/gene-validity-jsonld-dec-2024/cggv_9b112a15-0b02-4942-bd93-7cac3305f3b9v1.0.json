Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein (MRP)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This is a known mitochondrial ribosomal protein."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9b112a15-0b02-4942-bd93-7cac3305f3b9_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d6321fd-2b78-4fa0-84f0-b667623b6d1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2432b391-e9bd-4cad-aaeb-9ec636d25165","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblast cell line derived from three affected patients showed reduced levels of MRPL39 protein as well as reduced levels of other MRP large proteins, suggesting instability of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (Fig 4B) .​\n\nOverexpression of MRPL39 through lentiviral transduction of a MRPL39 cDNA construct restored levels of the MRPL proteins (Fig 4C-D).

In conjunction with 30 proteins in the small subunit, the mitoribosome synthesizes the 13 subunits of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system encoded by mitochondrial Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). We used multi-omics and gene matching to identify three unrelated individuals with biallelic variants in MRPL39 presenting with multisystem diseases with severity ranging from lethal, infantile-onset (Leigh syndrome spectrum) to milder with survival into adulthood. Clinical exome sequencing of known disease genes failed to diagnose these patients; however quantitative proteomics identified a specific decrease in the abundance of large but not small mitoribosomal subunits in fibroblasts from the two patients with severe phenotype. Re-analysis of exome sequencing led to the identification of candidate single heterozygous variants in mitoribosomal genes MRPL39 (both patients) and MRPL15. Genome sequencing identified a shared deep intronic MRPL39 variant predicted to generate a cryptic exon, with transcriptomics and targeted studies providing further functional evidence for causation. The patient with the milder disease was homozygous for a missense variant identified through trio exome sequencing. Our study highlights the utility of quantitative proteomics in detecting protein signatures and in characterizing gene-disease associations in exome-unsolved patients. We describe Relative Complex Abundance analysis of proteomics data, a sensitive method that can identify defects in OXPHOS disorders to a similar or greater sensitivity to the traditional enzymology. Relative Complex Abundance has potential utility for functional validation or prioritization in many hundreds of inherited rare diseases where protein complex assembly is

The *MRPL39* gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L39, one of 52 mitochondrial large ribosomal protein subunits that form the mitochondrial ribosome. \n\n*MRPL39* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2023 (PMID:18771761), in three affected individuals presenting with a broad phenotype spectrum of severe disease including Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). Clinical features included developmental delay, hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, feeding difficulty and faltering growth, together with brain abnormalities detected by MRI and elevate blood lactate. The age of onset ranged from birth to early infancy and cases showed variability in the severity of the clinical course.  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MRPL39*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MRPL39* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MRPL39* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes four unique variants in three probands from one publication (PMID: 18771761). Variant types included one missense, one frameshift, and two splice region variants. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and functional alteration observed in fibroblasts from affected individuals (PMIDs: 33340416; 18771761).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 29, 2024 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9b112a15-0b02-4942-bd93-7cac3305f3b9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
