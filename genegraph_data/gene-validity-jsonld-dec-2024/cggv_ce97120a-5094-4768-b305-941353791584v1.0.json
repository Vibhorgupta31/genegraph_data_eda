We applied whole exome sequencing to 128 mostly consanguineous families with neurogenetic disorders that often included brain malformations. Rare variant analyses for both single nucleotide variant (SNV) and copy number variant (CNV) alleles allowed for identification of 45 novel variants in 43 known disease genes, 41 candidate genes, and CNVs in 10 families, with an overall potential molecular cause identified in >85% of families studied. Among the candidate genes identified, we found PRUNE, VARS, and DHX37 in multiple families and homozygous loss-of-function variants in AGBL2, SLC18A2, SMARCA1, UBQLN1, and CPLX1. Neuroimaging and in silico analysis of functional and expression proximity between candidate and known disease genes allowed for further understanding of genetic networks underlying specific types of brain malformations.","dc:creator":"Karaca E","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Genes that Affect Brain Structure and Function Identified by Rare Variant Analyses of Mendelian Neurologic Disease."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ce97120a-5094-4768-b305-941353791584_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ce97120a-5094-4768-b305-941353791584_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f550744c-144d-421f-81e7-0ddb27296ff8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:80bdc0db-af50-4b34-bd94-00e4237b657e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"BPTF is associated with syndromic intellectual disability (Definitive, curated by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/6/2022).\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14609955","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The modification of chromatin structure is an important regulatory mechanism for developmental gene expression.

Also known as SNF2L, the encoded protein is an ATPase which is expressed in diverse tissues and forms chromatin remodeling complexes with different partners to regulate transcription. In 2015, Karaca *et al.* reported a nonsense *SMARCA1* variant of unknown inheritance in a male with intellectual disability, microcephaly, spasticity, cortical atrophy, and Coffin-Siris-like dysmorphic features (PMID: 26539891). In 2016, a large exome study reported a *de novo* frameshift variant in a male patient with intellectual disability (PMID: 27479843). In addition, at least four missense variants have been reported in individuals with intellectual disability: a *de novo* variant in a female with a Rett syndromeâ€“like phenotype (PMID: 26740508), two *de novo* variants in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability (PMID: 33057194), and a maternally-inherited missense variant in two affected brothers (PMID: 27457812). While *SMARCA1* is highly intolerant to truncating variants (pLI 1, gnomAD v2.1.1), it is not significantly constrained for missense variants (Z = 2.44). Thus, in the absence of functional evidence of pathogenicity, none of the missense variants were scored.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence. SMARCA1 and BPTF are part of the human NURF complex, an ISWI-containing ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex (PMID: 14609955); variants in *BPTF* are implicated in autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. In addition, transfection of mouse neuroblastoma cells by wild type but not mutant SMARCA1 protein has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth (PMID: 14609955).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence at this time to support the relationship between *SMARCA1* and X-linked intellectual disability. Additional studies are required to verify this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 3, 2022 (SOP Version 9). Please note: this gene was originally curated for Coffin-Siris syndrome by the General Gene Curation Expert Panel in 2016 and classified as Moderate. The current classification of Limited reflects updated scoring practices in SOP version 9 and the consensus of the ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ce97120a-5094-4768-b305-941353791584"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
