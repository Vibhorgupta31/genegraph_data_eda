For about half of the cases, the molecular basis is currently unknown. We used homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing to identify a homozygous 11 bp deletion in the orphan gene C19orf12. Mutation screening of 23 ideopathic NBIA index cases revealed two mutated alleles in 18 of them, and one loss-of-function mutation is the most prevalent. We also identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in a case initially diagnosed with Parkinson disease at age 49. Psychiatric signs, optic atrophy, and motor axonal neuropathy were common findings. Compared to the most prevalent NBIA subtype, pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), individuals with two C19orf12 mutations were older at age of onset and the disease progressed more slowly. A polyclonal antibody against the predicted membrane spanning protein showed a mitochondrial localization. A histopathological examination in a single autopsy case detected Lewy bodies, tangles, spheroids, and tau pathology. The mitochondrial localization together with the immunohistopathological findings suggests a pathomechanistic overlap with common forms of neurodegenerative disorders.","dc:creator":"Hartig MB","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Absence of an orphan mitochondrial protein, c19orf12, causes a distinct clinical subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:20b64ab8-0b48-40d4-8ef5-b3d251e4bec0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f410a1d9-51c3-44d9-a8a7-bdcaa3204c8e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f410a1d9-51c3-44d9-a8a7-bdcaa3204c8e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ddcf6dd6-0563-4959-ab3e-0d2096f6cbdb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000019.10:g.29702978del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA506638193"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"MRI evidence of high brain iron in the basal ganglia (most often in the globus pallidus and without an eye-of-the-tiger sign)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001257","obo:HP_0001300","obo:HP_0001332"],"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:58f49ed1-9392-471b-8dc1-4b647ffed927_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ddcf6dd6-0563-4959-ab3e-0d2096f6cbdb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23269600","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To assess the frequency of mutations in C19orf12 in the greater neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) population and further characterize the associated phenotype.","dc:creator":"Hogarth P","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"New NBIA subtype: genetic, clinical, pathologic, and radiographic features of MPAN."}},"rdfs:label":"251-1"},{"id":"cggv:58f49ed1-9392-471b-8dc1-4b647ffed927","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58f49ed1-9392-471b-8dc1-4b647ffed927_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:71c479e1-cadd-4953-bf75-0a0fc664d328_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:71c479e1-cadd-4953-bf75-0a0fc664d328","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ca33c484-2858-4375-a9d7-f4d0a538f87f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031448.6(C19orf12):c.154G>C (p.Ala52Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA145387"}},"detectionMethod":"DNA from an affected sister was used to perform exome sequencing as previously described\n[Landour´e et al., 2012], and we identified a homozygous missense sequence variant in the coding region of the C19orf12 gene (NM 001031726.3; MIM #614297) at position c.187G>C\n(Supp. Fig. S1), predicting the amino-acid substitution p.Ala63Pro (http://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/C19orf12).","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Gait difficulty, spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy\nthe older patient had severe atrophy and decreased sensation in\nthe arms and legs, and reduced-to-absent reflexes, but no cognitive\ndecline, facial and bulbar weakness, or vision loss.","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Homozygosity mapping","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:cc64cc64-7869-4c7c-a3f6-e41749ab9ac0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ca33c484-2858-4375-a9d7-f4d0a538f87f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23857908","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We report here the genetic basis for a form of progressive hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG43) previously described in two Malian sisters.

A total of 18 NBIA cases were found to have homozygous common founder mutation c.204_214del11 (p.Gly69ArgfsX10) with all individuals having common MRI brain findings of hypointensities in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, and presenting features including speech, gait difficulties, extrapyramidal features (oromandibular dystonia, generalized dystonia and parkinsonism), spasticity, hyperreflexia, psychiatric symptoms, and optic atrophy. C19orf12 was previously reported in two Malian sisters presenting with spastic paraplegia with gait difficulty, spasticity and peripheral neuropathy without brain abnormalities. (Landoure et al 2013 (PMID: 23857908); Meilleur et al 2009 (PMID: 20039086)). Both disease assertions have overlapping features in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with NBIA individuals having additional MRI brain abnormal findings in globus pallidus/substantia nigra, and ophthalmological features (e.g. Optic atrophy).\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Biallelic variants in C19orf12  (including nonsense, frameshift, splice, and missense variants, small indel, duplication and deletion) were identified in at least 35 patients with clinical features suggestive of Autosomal Recessive Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) (Hartig et al 2011, PMID:21981780; Hogarth et al 2012, PMID:23269600; Deschauer et al 2012, PMID: 22584950; Akçakaya et al 2019, PMID: 31804703; Dezfouli et al 2013, PMID:23166001; Landouré et al 2013, PMID: 23857908).\nAt least 11 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice, and missense variants, small indel, duplication and deletion) have been reported in humans. This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical function studies, non-human model organism studies, and functional alteration analysis. (Hartig et al 2011, PMID:21981780; Landouré et al 2013, PMID: 23857908; Mori et al 2019, PMID 31548400; Mignani et al 2020, PMID: 33425903; Iuso et al 2014, PMID:24586779; Venco et al 2015, PMID: 26136767; Shao et al 2022, PMID: 35182730).\nIn summary, the C19orf12 gene is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) and Autosomal Recessive Spastic Paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:20b64ab8-0b48-40d4-8ef5-b3d251e4bec0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
