It has been shown previously that mutations in the perforin 1 gene (PRF1) and in UNC13D are associated with FHL2 and FHL3, respectively, indicating genetic heterogeneity. We performed genome-wide homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous Kurdish kindred with five children affected with FHL. Linkage to a 10 cM region on chromosome 6q24 between D6S1569 and D6S960 defined a novel FHL locus. By screening positional candidate genes, we identified a homozygous deletion of 5 bp in the syntaxin 11 gene (STX11) in this family. We could demonstrate that syntaxin 11 protein was absent in the mononuclear cell fraction of patients with the homozygous 5 bp deletion. In addition to this family, we found homozygous mutations in STX11 in five consanguineous Turkish/Kurdish FHL kindreds including two families with the 5 bp deletion, one family with a large 19.2 kb genomic deletion spanning the entire coding region of STX11 (exon 2) and two families with a nonsense mutation that leads to a premature stop codon in the C-terminal end of the protein. As both STX11 and UNC13D are involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion, we conclude that, besides mutations in perforin 1, defects in the endocytotic or the exocytotic pathway may be a common mechanism in FHL.","dc:creator":"zur Stadt U","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Linkage of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) type-4 to chromosome 6q24 and identification of mutations

hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is an often-fatal hyperinflammatory disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, and STXBP2. We identified a homozygous STX11 mutation, c.173T > C (p.L58P), in three patients presenting clinically with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis from unrelated Pakistani families. The mutation yields an amino acid substitution in the N-terminal Habc domain of syntaxin-11 and resulted in defective natural killer cell degranulation. Notably, syntaxin-11 expression was decreased in patient cells. However, in an ectopic expression system, syntaxin-11 L58P was expressed at levels comparable to wild-type syntaxin-11, but did not bind Munc18-2. Moreover, another N-terminal syntaxin-11 mutant, R4A, also did not bind Munc18-2. Thus, we have identified a novel missense STX11 mutation causative of FHL type 4. The syntaxin-11 R4A and L58P mutations reveal that both the N-terminus and Habc domain of syntaxin-11 are required for binding to Munc18-2, implying similarity to the dynamic binary binding of neuronal syntaxin-1 to Munc18-1.","dc:creator":"Müller ML","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"An N-Terminal Missense Mutation in STX11 Causative of FHL4 Abrogates Syntaxin-11 Binding to Munc18-2."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient B"},{"id":"cggv:fa8a726f-9d80-4e22-aefd-7286eaa0f30b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa8a726f-9d80-4e22-aefd-7286eaa0f30b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:fa8a726f-9d80-4e22-aefd-7286eaa0f30b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"\n"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Homozygous due to consanguinity.\n\nSouth Asian 2/30598 (0.00006536) https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/6-144507937-T-C"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ec0804a8-5d86-4544-8a1a-e04a0b423672_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ec0804a8-5d86-4544-8a1a-e04a0b423672","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f1fc6d73-56f1-4089-9dfe-26cccd0711dc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003764.4(STX11):c.802C>T (p.Gln268Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA253453"}},"detectionMethod":"direct DNA sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Haemophagocytosis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003281","obo:HP_0002155","obo:HP_0001744","obo:HP_0001945","obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0001873","obo:HP_0011900","obo:HP_0002240"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1db0602b-1746-44b4-80e8-b782dda19a89_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f1fc6d73-56f1-4089-9dfe-26cccd0711dc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16582076"},"rdfs:label":"Patient  C1"},{"id":"cggv:1db0602b-1746-44b4-80e8-b782dda19a89","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1db0602b-1746-44b4-80e8-b782dda19a89_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Consanguineous parents were reported for this proband\n\nEuropean (non-finnish): 1/112278 (0.000008906) https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/6-144508566-C-T"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:9844bf07-9887-4a28-b644-467b664fcb80_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9844bf07-9887-4a28-b644-467b664fcb80_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d63f031-1c64-4b5f-9d08-4f118ea13531","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63691273-5766-4c3b-b8b1-618b0f0d243b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RNA from purified, unstimulated CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, as well as the NK-cell line NK92 was prepared and amplified by RT-PCR using primers specific for STX11.

In contrast to mutations leading to loss of perforin and Munc13-4 function, it is unclear how syntaxin-11 loss-of-function mutations contribute to disease. We show here that freshly isolated, resting natural killer (NK) cells and CD8(+) T cells express syntaxin-11. In infants, NK cells are the predominant perforin-containing cell type. NK cells from FHL4 patients fail to degranulate when encountering susceptible target cells. Unexpectedly, IL-2 stimulation partially restores degranulation and cytotoxicity by NK cells, which could explain the less severe disease progression observed in FHL4 patients, compared with FHL2 and FHL3 patients. Since the effector T-cell compartment is still immature in infants, our data suggest that the observed defect in NK-cell degranulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of FHL, that evaluation of NK-cell degranulation in suspected FHL patients may facilitate diagnosis, and that these new insights may offer novel therapeutic possibilities.","dc:creator":"Bryceson YT","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Defective cytotoxic lymphocyte degranulation in syntaxin-11 deficient familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 4 (FHL4) patients."},"rdfs:label":"Expression of Stx11 in cytotoxic lymphocytes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Based on Human Protein Atlas this protein is most abundant in immune cells, such as T and NK cells."},{"id":"cggv:40d9d169-7326-40c3-beda-d0ce02aa743e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:327daea0-d6b0-4cf6-8074-a9bd422eb252","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) shows that STX11 associates with Munc18-2 in activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CLTs).

Strikingly, complete fusion is stimulated by addition of wild-type Munc18-2 to the assay, but not of Munc18-2 mutants with abnormal STX11 binding. Our data reveal that Munc18-2 is not just a chaperone of STX11 but also directly contributes to complete membrane merging by promoting SNARE complex assembly.

FHL is characterized by episodes of severe and overwhelming systemic immune activation which is often lethal in the absence of appropriate treatment and subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Typical features include fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hyperferritinemia, elevated levels of soluble IL-2 receptor, decreased or absent NK cell function, and hemophagocytosis observed on pathologic inspection of bone marrow or other tissues. Patients with defects in syntaxin 11 result in severely compromised NK degranulation and cytotoxicity. STX11 is expressed in many tissues, but with regard to the immune system, Syntaxin 11 is necessary for normal NK cell and CD8+T cell cytotoxic granule exocytosis and has been implicated in being involved in neutrophil granule exocytosis as well. The exact molecular mechanism of STX11 is not clear. This curation includes 11 variants (including in-frame deletions, missense, nonsense, and frameshift) found in 10 probands from two publications (PMIDs: 20486178, 16582076, 24459464, 26709266, 21298754, 19967551, 31207086 and 31770233). Additional cases are available in the literature however the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. A role in disease is supported by increased expression of STX11 in NK cells and CD8+ T cells, as well as in NK92 cells (PMID:17525286). Functional alteration in the patient's cells also showed how a mutation resulted in a complete loss of STX11 function (PMID: 20486178). A Stx11−/− mouse model demonstrated the phenotypes associated with FHL4 and exhibited a defective degranulation and cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes in vitro, confirming the critical role of this SNARE protein in cytotoxic granule exocytosis. Recuse of the phenotype was also seen in this same mouse model (PMID:23160464). In summary, STX11 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive FHL4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9844bf07-9887-4a28-b644-467b664fcb80"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
