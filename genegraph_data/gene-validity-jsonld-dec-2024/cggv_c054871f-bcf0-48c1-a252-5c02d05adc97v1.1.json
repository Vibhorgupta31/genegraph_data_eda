We ascertained 34 unrelated probands with classic features of BBS including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), obesity and polydactyly. The probands were from families unsuitable for linkage because of family size. We found MKKS mutations in four typical BBS probands (Table 1). The first is a 13-year-old Hispanic girl with severe RP, PAP, mental retardation and obesity (BMI >40). She was a compound heterozygote for a missense (1042GA, G52D) and a nonsense (1679TA, Y264stop) mutation in exon 3. Cloning and sequencing of the separate alleles confirmed that the mutations were present in trans. A second BBS proband (from Newfoundland), born to consanguineous parents, was homozygous for two deletions (1316delC and 1324-1326delGTA) in exon 3, predicting a frameshift. An affected brother was also homozygous for the deletions, whereas an unaffected sibling had two normal copies of MKKS. Both the proband and her affected brother had RP, PAP, mild mental retardation, morbid obesity (BMI >50 and 37, respectively), lobulated kidneys with prominent calyces and diabetes mellitus (diagnosed at ages 33 and 30, respectively). A deceased sister (DNA unavailable) had similar phenotypic features (RP with blindness by age 13, BMI >45, abnormal glucose tolerance test and IQ=64, vaginal atresia and syndactyly of both feet).

When used as bait in yeast 2-hybrid assays, the Cep290rd16 deleted region (termed deleted in sensory dystrophy [DSD] domain) interacted with full-length MKKS as prey (Figure (Figure1B).1B). Eight other cilia-associated proteins (BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS8, and NPHP1, NPHP2, NPHP4, and NPHP5) did not reveal any obvious interaction with the DSD domain (Figure (Figure1B).1B). Evaluation of MKKS mutants/variants identified in human patients with BBS (Figure (Figure1A)1A) revealed that the p.G52D and p.G345E mutations eliminated the interaction with CEP290-DSD bait, while 2 others (p.T57A and p.C499S) reduced this association (Figure (Figure1C),1C), using yeast 2-hybrid assays. \n\nCoimmunoprecipitation experiments using transfected HEK293 cells (Figure (Figure2,2, A and B) or bovine retina extracts (Figure (Figure2C)2C) validated the interaction of CEP290 with MKKS.

Defects in cilia biogenesis and transport cause pleiotropic human ciliopathies. Mutations in over 30 different genes can lead to cilia defects, and complex interactions exist among ciliopathy-associated proteins. Mutations of the centrosomal protein 290 kDa (CEP290) lead to distinct clinical manifestations, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a hereditary cause of blindness due to photoreceptor degeneration. Mice homozygous for a mutant Cep290 allele (Cep290rd16 mice) exhibit LCA-like early-onset retinal degeneration that is caused by an in-frame deletion in the CEP290 protein. Here, we show that the domain deleted in the protein encoded by the Cep290rd16 allele directly interacts with another ciliopathy protein, MKKS. MKKS mutations identified in patients with the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome disrupted this interaction. In zebrafish embryos, combined subminimal knockdown of mkks and cep290 produced sensory defects in the eye and inner ear. Intriguingly, combinations of Cep290rd16 and Mkksko alleles in mice led to improved ciliogenesis and sensory functions compared with those of either mutant alone. We propose that altered association of CEP290 and MKKS affects the integrity of multiprotein complexes at the cilia transition zone and basal body. Amelioration of the sensory phenotypes caused by specific mutations in one protein by removal of an interacting domain/protein suggests a possible novel approach for treating human ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Rachel RA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Combining Cep290 and Mkks ciliopathy alleles in mice rescues sensory defects and restores ciliogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Rachel_MKKSandCep290_Association"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Score increased due to evidence from a zebrafish morpholino model in which \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"cggv:bb9d1083-01d2-4227-aa3a-e08f3bbb99a7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8d9367d4-edc0-42ae-adad-443380b4455f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"PMID: 19190184","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28824921","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare genetic disorder that belongs to the group of ciliopathies, defined as diseases caused by defects in cilia structure and/or function.

Fine-mapping reduced the critical interval to 1.9 cM between D20S851 and D20S189, encompassing a chaperonin-like gene.

We present the molecular findings of 677 individuals, residing in Denmark, with IRD and report 806 variants of which 187 are novel. We found that deletions and duplications spanning one or more exons can explain 3% of the cases, and thus copy number variation (CNV) analysis is important in molecular genetic diagnostics of IRD. Seven percent of the individuals have variants classified as pathogenic or likely-pathogenic in more than one gene. Possible Danish founder variants in EYS and RP1 are reported. A significant number of variants were classified as variants with unknown significance; reporting of these will hopefully contribute to the elucidation of the actual clinical consequence making the classification less troublesome in the future. In conclusion, this study underlines the relevance of performing targeted sequencing of IRD including CNV analysis as well as the importance of interaction with clinical diagnoses.","dc:creator":"Jespersgaard C","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Molecular genetic analysis using targeted NGS analysis of 677 individuals with retinal dystrophy."}},"rdfs:label":"Jespersgaard_154"},{"id":"cggv:63a82126-8045-400f-bc57-d60c22753f99","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63a82126-8045-400f-bc57-d60c22753f99_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c25aade3-bda4-480e-932c-829e82ec7ae0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c25aade3-bda4-480e-932c-829e82ec7ae0","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:4b7b0fac-345a-4e0b-baf9-1c2c3ca990cb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_170784.3(MKKS):c.890T>C (p.Ile297Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9763608"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"BBS","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Mutation screening of the six BBS genes first identified was performed by DHPLC analysis using at least two melting temperatures for each amplicon, followed by direct sequencing of the variant PCR fragments as described by Hichri et al.

To date, 14 BBS genes have been identified, 3 of which have been found mutated only in a single BBS family each (BBS11/TRIM32, BBS13/MKS1 and BBS14/MKS4/NPHP6). Previous reports of systematic mutation detection in large cohorts of BBS families (n > 90) have dealt only with a single gene, or at most small subsets of the known BBS genes. Here we report extensive analysis of a cohort of 174 BBS families for 12/14 genes, leading to the identification of 28 novel mutations. Two pathogenic mutations in a single gene have been found in 117 families, and a single heterozygous mutation in 17 families (of which 8 involve the BBS1 recurrent mutation, M390R). We confirm that BBS1 and BBS10 are the most frequently mutated genes, followed by BBS12. No mutations have been found in BBS11/TRIM32, the identification of which as a BBS gene only relies on a single missense mutation in a single consanguineous family. While a third variant allele has been observed in a few families, they are in most cases missenses of uncertain pathogenicity, contrasting with the type of mutations observed as two alleles in a single gene. We discuss the various strategies for diagnostic mutation detection, including homozygosity mapping and targeted arrays for the detection of previously reported mutations.","dc:creator":"Muller J","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Identification of 28 novel mutations in the Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes: the burden of private mutations in an extensively heterogeneous disease."}},"rdfs:label":"Muller_V.31"},{"id":"cggv:4bf1c75c-fcdd-47ee-8e3a-8b3796afde0d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4bf1c75c-fcdd-47ee-8e3a-8b3796afde0d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:cf014a66-eeec-4f10-a715-e7960f39df76_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf014a66-eeec-4f10-a715-e7960f39df76","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:f4588105-3cf9-4421-a1da-cf72e7492307","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_170784.3(MKKS):c.873_876dup (p.Cys293ProfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342353"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"BBS with RP","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:d12d0f9a-b923-4211-ad23-2e268a06d5a9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:f4588105-3cf9-4421-a1da-cf72e7492307"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12107442"},"rdfs:label":"Slavotinek_Patient6"},{"id":"cggv:d12d0f9a-b923-4211-ad23-2e268a06d5a9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d12d0f9a-b923-4211-ad23-2e268a06d5a9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduced score due to lack of WES"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:666d5009-dcc8-40d8-bedc-c189636697c4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:666d5009-dcc8-40d8-bedc-c189636697c4","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:15aee990-66a0-4409-917b-8397d7385ffc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_170784.3(MKKS):c.281del (p.Phe94SerfsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA253463"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"retinal dystrophy, obesity, learning disabilities and renal abnormalities","previousTesting":false,"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a701926e-6f09-4e7f-bab7-d3e78018f3a0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:15aee990-66a0-4409-917b-8397d7385ffc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10973251"},"rdfs:label":"Katsanis_Family_NF-B3"},{"id":"cggv:a701926e-6f09-4e7f-bab7-d3e78018f3a0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a701926e-6f09-4e7f-bab7-d3e78018f3a0_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Reduced score due to lack of WES"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b9f4a67d-7023-4bc0-a019-1cf4d9282e22_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b9f4a67d-7023-4bc0-a019-1cf4d9282e22","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:5d1e9253-ea4b-4fca-a36e-c58550b37568","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_170784.3(MKKS):c.1648C>T (p.Gln550Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA408230439"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"BBS","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Mutation screening of the six BBS genes first identified was performed by DHPLC analysis using at least two melting temperatures for each amplicon, followed by direct sequencing of the variant PCR fragments as described by Hichri et al.

Triallelic inheritance has recently been suggested on the basis of the identification of three mutated alleles in two different genes for the same patient. In a cohort of 27 families, six BBS genes (namely BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS6, BBS7 and BBS8) have been studied. Mutations were identified in 14 families. Two mutations within the same gene have been identified in seven families. BBS1 is most frequently implied with the common M390R substitution at the homozygous state (n=2), or associated with another mutation at BBS1 (n=3). Compound heterozygous mutations have been found in BBS2 (one family) and BBS6 (one family). In seven other families, only one heterozygous mutation has been identified (once in BBS1, twice for BBS2 and three times in BBS6). Although our study did not reveal any families with bona fide mutations in two BBS genes, consistent with a triallelic hypothesis, we have found an excess of heterozygous single mutations.

(PMID: 10973238) and Katsanis et al. (PMID: 10973251). BBS is a rare genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy, characterized by rod-cone dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, genital anomalies, renal anomalies, and intellectual disabilities.\n\nThis curation includes twelve variants (five missense, three nonsense and four frameshift) that have been reported in thirteen probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 10973238, 10973251, 12107442, 20472660, 15770229, 20177705, 28761321 and 30718709). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental data showing that *MKKS* is expressed in tissues affected by BBS (PMID: 10973238 ). This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that the MKKS protein shares a function with the products of the *BBS10* and *BBS12* genes to mediate the assembly of the BBSome, a complex that performs vesicle transport to primary cilia and contributes to adipocyte differentiation. Through yeast two hybrid and coimmunoprecipitatin assays, Rachel et al. 2012 show that MKKS physically interacts with CEP290, a critical protein in ciliary biogenises and function, and that MKKS variants found in human BBS patients disrupt this protein-protein interaction (PMID: 22446187). Finally, multiple *Mkks*-knockout mouse models show that mice without a functional copy of *Mkks* display severe retinal degeneration compared to wild-type mice (PMIDs: 30901771 and 15772095).\n\nIn summary, *MKKS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MKKS-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on May 2nd, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c054871f-bcf0-48c1-a252-5c02d05adc97"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
