Defects in ATP7A lead to Menkes disease or its milder variant, occipital horn syndrome or to a newly discovered condition, ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy (DMN), for which the precise pathophysiology has been obscure. We investigated two ATP7A motor neuropathy mutations (T994I, P1386S) previously associated with abnormal intracellular trafficking. In the patients' fibroblasts, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicated a shift in steady-state equilibrium of ATP7A(T994I) and ATP7A(P1386S), with exaggerated PM localization. Transfection of Hek293T cells and NSC-34 motor neurons with the mutant alleles tagged with the Venus fluorescent protein also revealed excess PM localization. Endocytic retrieval of the mutant alleles from the PM to the TGN was impaired. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed an abnormal interaction between ATP7A(T994I) and p97/VCP, an ubiquitin-selective chaperone which is mutated in two autosomal dominant forms of motor neuron disease: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and fronto-temporal dementia. Small-interfering RNA (SiRNA) knockdown of p97/VCP corrected ATP7A(T994I) mislocalization. Flow cytometry documented that non-permeabilized ATP7A(P1386S) fibroblasts bound a carboxyl-terminal ATP7A antibody, consistent with relocation of the ATP7A di-leucine endocytic retrieval signal to the extracellular surface and partially destabilized insertion of the eighth transmembrane helix. Our findings illuminate the mechanisms underlying ATP7A-related DMN and establish a link between p97/VCP and genetically distinct forms of motor neuron degeneration.","dc:creator":"Yi L","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Altered intracellular localization and valosin-containing protein (p97 VCP) interaction underlie ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy."},"rdfs:label":"protein expression in patient derived fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"no altered expression demonstrated"},{"id":"cggv:ea44ff10-a141-4d01-9da0-6232a6424d50","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:05d7b80c-a690-4605-9482-92cca1bf05fb","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22210628","rdfs:label":"immunoprecipitation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:ec7c42f3-3cad-4020-aa75-cf103c5381ba_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac74e375-851d-4796-8af5-2acb7f0924cf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba9d66f0-456a-4d9f-8c9b-1518ef0bea62","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In  cells  transfected  with  the  wild-typeallele,  ATP7A  moved  from  the  TGN  to  the  PM  in  200mMCu  (A),  whereas  in  cells  transfected  with  the  mutant  alleles,  the  ATP7A  signal  was  alreadylocated  predominantly  at  the  PM  under  basal  (0.5mMCu)  copper  conditions  (b  and  c).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22210628","rdfs:label":"immunohistochemistry in HEK cells transfected with mutant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:510bb72f-82f5-47ac-b149-f97e7295410e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d768d8a3-5606-4ed5-8fea-d40613ea4e57","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"no evidence for altered function","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22210628","rdfs:label":"yeast complementation assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"no altered function demonstrated"},{"id":"cggv:5ee060b2-2a7e-4392-8903-e868bd52f756","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08d59d62-591b-487b-9626-1e27d3f7968b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"mutant  ATP7As  did  not  clearlyco-localize  in  the  endoplasmic  reticulum,  early  or late  endo-somes,  lysosomes  or  endocytic  vesicles","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22210628","rdfs:label":"immunohistochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:ec7c42f3-3cad-4020-aa75-cf103c5381ba_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0a0ae210-ee85-4101-9213-cd94d03709a4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:02f1aafa-5c73-4d07-abc5-c5c94854aa4c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"motor neurons degeneration","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25639447","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"ATP7A is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that is essential for cellular copper homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations in the ATP7A gene result in Menkes disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder resulting in seizures, hypotonia and failure to thrive, due to systemic copper deficiency. Most recently, rare missense mutations in ATP7A that do not impact systemic copper homeostasis have been shown to cause X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 3 (SMAX3), a distal hereditary motor neuropathy. An understanding of the mechanistic and pathophysiological basis of SMAX3 is currently lacking, in part because the disease-causing mutations have been shown to confer both loss- and gain-of-function properties to ATP7A, and because there is currently no animal model of the disease. In this study, the Atp7a gene was specifically deleted in the motor neurons of mice, resulting in a degenerative phenotype consistent with the clinical features in affected patients with SMAX3, including the progressive deterioration of gait, age-dependent muscle atrophy, denervation of neuromuscular junctions and a loss of motor neuron cell bodies. Taken together, these data reveal autonomous requirements for ATP7A that reveal essential roles for copper in the maintenance and function of the motor neuron, and suggest that SMAX3 is caused by a loss of ATP7A function that specifically impacts the spinal motor neuron.","dc:creator":"Hodgkinson VL","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"X-linked spinal muscular atrophy in mice caused by autonomous loss of ATP7A in the motor neuron."},"rdfs:label":"Atp7aMN/Ymice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5759,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":7.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6ca55e1a-6ddd-4448-9bb6-a60d8f8da1ab","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010338","gene":"hgnc:869","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"ATP7A encodes the copper-transporting ATPase alpha. In basal conditions, it is in the trans-Golgi Network (TGV) and transports copper to the cuproenzymes (copper metalloenzymes). However, in elevated copper concentrations, it localizes to the plasma membrane and facilitates the export of excess copper from the cells through exocytosis (MÃ¸ller et al., PMID: 19501626).\nThe gene was first mapped to chrXq13.3 in 1993 (Vulpe et al, PMID: 8490659; Mercer et al., PMID: 8490647; Chelly et al., PMID: 8490646) in patients with Menkes disease (MIM:309400) due to a loss of function mechanism in ATP7A. Partial loss of function is associated with occipital horn syndrome (MIM: 304150). Subnormal serum copper levels and early age of onset are characteristic for both phenotypes. In 2009, ATP7A was first reported in relation to X-linked recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy in two families (Kennerson et al., PMID: 20170900). These patients present during adulthood with progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy without clinical or biochemical characteristics of systemic copper deficiency. Some patients show dysautonomic features (Gualandi et al., PMID: 31558336; Fradin et al., PMID: 33137485).\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability but no difference in inheritance pattern in the association of ATP7A with distal spinal muscular atrophy. Therefore, the following diseases entities have been split into the three before-mentioned entities: Menkes disease, Occipital Horn Syndrome and distal spinal muscular atrophy.\nFour different missense variants were reported of which three segregated in families (Kennerson et al., PMID: 20170900; Gualandi et al., PMID: 31558336) and one was sporadic (Fradin et al., PMID: 33137485). Two of these variants occur in the carboxyl half of the ATP7A protein, are highly conserved and absent in control populations (Kennerson et al., PMID: 20170900). Two other variants were predicted to be deleterious in in silico evaluations and were absent in control populations (Gualandi et al., PMID: 31558336; Fradin et al., PMID: 33137485).\nThe gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. Patient (Atp7A-T994I)-derived fibroblasts show reduced trans-Golgi-localization of ATP7A and more diffuse signals in cultured cells. Immunoprecipitation assays identified p97/VCP as an interaction protein  (Yi et al., PMID: 22210628). Two mouse models were generated, a knock-in mouse (Atp7a-T994I) and a transgenic mouse (Atp7aMN/Y), with contradictory results. Herein the knock-in model showed no altered motor abilities or histological manifestations of acute or chronic neuropathy (Perez-Siles et al., PMID: 27293072), whereas the transgenic model exhibited progressive motor abnormalities and age-dependent loss of motor neuron cell bodies and denervation of the neuromuscular junction (Hodgkinson et al., PMID: 25639447).\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be partial loss of function, altered protein-to-protein interaction (cfr. P97/VCP), and intracellular trafficking.\nIn summary, ATP7A is moderately associated with x-linked distal spinal muscular atrophy. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitely, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ec7c42f3-3cad-4020-aa75-cf103c5381ba"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
