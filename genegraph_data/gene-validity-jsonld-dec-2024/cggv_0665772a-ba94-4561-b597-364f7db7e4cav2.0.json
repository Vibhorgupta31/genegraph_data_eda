We found two families (one American and one Dutch) with autosomal dominant, non-syndromic hearing loss to have mutations in COL11A2 that are predicted to affect the triple-helix domain of the collagen protein. In both families, deafness is non-progressive and predominantly affects middle frequencies. Mice with a targeted disruption of Col11a2 also were shown to have hearing loss. Electron microscopy of the tectorial membrane of these mice revealed loss of organization of the collagen fibrils. Our findings revealed a unique ultrastructural malformation of inner-ear architecture associated with non-syndromic hearing loss, and suggest that tectorial membrane abnormalities may be one aetiology of sensorineural hearing loss primarily affecting the mid-frequencies.","dc:creator":"McGuirt WT","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutations in COL11A2 cause non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNA13)."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0665772a-ba94-4561-b597-364f7db7e4ca_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0665772a-ba94-4561-b597-364f7db7e4ca_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":11.6},{"id":"cggv:0665772a-ba94-4561-b597-364f7db7e4ca_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0665772a-ba94-4561-b597-364f7db7e4ca_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a96d9645-29e4-456f-828c-27137b2dfb17","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8970e296-ef50-4d97-8268-b7b79ac2ec02","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Using in situ hybridization of wild type C57BL/6J mice, at P5 Col11a2 hybridization is strong in regions of the lateral wall including basal border of stria vascularis.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in variant type, inheritance pattern, and phenotype within reported *COL11A2* cases. Therefore we have split curations by inheritance pattern for nonsyndromic hearing loss and otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia  and assessed them separately. This curation focuses on its relationship with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. At least 18 unique variants (missense, nonsense, synonymous, splice-site, and deletion) in 18 probands have been reported in humans (PMIDs:10581026, 23990876, 23967202, 26969326, 27911912, 27610647, 31152317, 33297549, 31045651, 33229591, 33597575, 36515421, 36703223, 36597107, doi:10.1007/s13258-016-0440-4). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 41 additional family members (PMID:10581026). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an expression study (PMID:15141750). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COL11A2* and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 12/20/2018. It was re-evaluated on 11/15/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of new genetic evidence (PMIDs:23990876, 23967202, 26969326, 27911912, 27610647, 31152317, 33297549, 31045651, 33229591, 33597575, 36515421, 36703223, 36597107, doi:10.1007/s13258-016-0440-4) although no new experimental evidence was included. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 11/15/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:0665772a-ba94-4561-b597-364f7db7e4ca"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
