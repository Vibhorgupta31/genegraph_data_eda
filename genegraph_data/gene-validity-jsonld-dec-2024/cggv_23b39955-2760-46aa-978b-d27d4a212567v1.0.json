To study the lineage distribution of Mpl-R in normal hematopoietic cells, we developed a monoclonal antibody (designated M1 MoAb) by immunizing mice with a soluble form of the human Mpl-R protein. With few exceptions, Mpl-R was detected by indirect immunofluorescent analysis on all human leukemic hematopoietic cell lines with pluripotential and megakaryocytic phenotypes, but not on other cell lines. By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, M1 MoAb recognized a band at 82 to 84 kD corresponding to the expected size of the glycosylated receptor. Among normal hematopoietic cells, M1 MoAb strongly stained megakaryocytes (MK) and Mpl-R was detected on platelets by indirect immunofluorescence staining or immunoblotting. On purified CD34+ cells, less than 2% of the population was stained, but the labeling was weak and just above the threshold of detection. However, dual-labeling with the M1 and antiplatelet glycoprotein MoAbs showed that most Mpl-R+/CD34+ cells coexpressed CD41a, CD61, or CD42a, suggesting that cell surface appearance of Mpl-R and platelet glycoproteins could be coordinated. M1-positive and M1-negative subsets were sorted from purified CD34+ cell populations. Colony assays showed that the absolute number of hematopoietic progenitors was extremely low and no primitive progenitors were present in the CD34+/Mpl-R+ fraction. However, this cell fraction was significantly enriched in low proliferative colony-forming units-MK. When the CD34+/Mpl-R+ fraction was grown in liquid culture containing human aplastic serum and a combination of growth factors, mature MK were seen as early as day 4, whereas the predominant cell population was erythroblasts on day 8. Similar data were also obtained with the CD34+/Mpl-R- fraction with, however, a delay in the time of appearance of both MK and erythroblasts. In conclusion, Mpl-R is a cytokine receptor restricted to the MK cell lineage. Its expression is low on CD34+ cells and these cells mainly correspond to late MK progenitors and transitional cells. These data indicate that the action of the Mpl-R ligand might predominate during the late stages of human MK differentiation.","dc:creator":"Debili N","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"The Mpl receptor is expressed in the megakaryocytic lineage from late progenitors to platelets."},"rdfs:label":"MPL expression in the Megakaryocytic Lineage"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Megakaryocytes and platelets show MPL expression and these are the cells involved in thrombocythemia 2"},{"id":"cggv:fac58500-9fff-4ff4-accb-bf1e9d43d2b8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac6174bb-8272-47c3-b5f2-7366bd5cefd7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"MPL is the receptor for TPO.

This study was undertaken to further delineate the putative binding domain on the Mpl receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that within the Mpl-EC domain 1 (Mpl-EC-D1), amino acids 102-251 were strongly involved in ligand binding. We subsequently expressed five subdomains within this region with T7 phage display. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays identified a short stretch of peptide located between residues 206 and 251 as the minimum binding domain for both TPO and hNUDC. A series of sequential Ala replacement mutations in the region were subsequently used to identify the specific residues most involved in ligand binding.

Mutations in MPL can drastically impair its function and be a contributing factor in multiple hematologic malignancies, including congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT). CAMT is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia at birth, which progresses to bone marrow failure and pancytopenia. Here we report unique familial cases of CAMT that presented with a previously unreported MPL mutation: T814C (W272R) in the background of the activating MPL G117T (K39N or Baltimore) mutation. Confocal microscopy, proliferation and surface biotinylation assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and western blotting analysis were used to elucidate the function and trafficking of Mpl mutants. Results showed that Mpl protein bearing the W272R mutation, alone or together with the K39N mutation, lacks detectable surface expression while being strongly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calreticulin. Both WT and K39N-mutated Mpl were found to be signaling competent, but single or double mutants bearing W272R were unresponsive to Tpo. Function of the deficient Mpl receptor could be rescued by using 2 separate approaches: (1) GRASP55 overexpression, which partially restored Tpo-induced signaling of mutant Mpl by activating an autophagy-dependent secretory pathway and thus forcing ER-trapped immature receptors to traffic to the cell surface; and (2) CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing used to repair MPL T814C mutation in transfected cell lines and primary umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells.

A recurring mechanism for the activation of haemopoietin receptors is the formation of functional complexes by receptor subunit oligomerization. Within the growth hormone receptor, a cluster of extracellular amino acids forms a dimer interface domain that stabilizes ligand-induced homodimers. This domain appears to be functionally conserved in the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor because substitution of cysteines for residues in the analogous region causes EPO-independent receptor activation via disulfide-linked homodimerization. This report identifies an homologous domain within the c-Mpl receptor. The substitution of cysteine residues for specific amino acids in the dimer interface homology regions of c-Mpl induced constitutive receptor activity. Factor-dependent FDC-P1 and Ba/F3 cells expressing the active receptor mutants no longer required exogenous factors and proliferated autonomously.

Hereditary mutations of c-Mpl can either result in loss-of-function and thrombocytopenia or in gain-of-function and thrombocythemia (HT), and are important models to analyze the mechanism of c-Mpl activity. We have analyzed the effect of the c-Mpl P106L gain-of-function and the nearby loss-of-function R102P and F104S mutations, which cause HT or thrombocytopenia, respectively, on posttranslational processing, intracellular trafficking, cell surface expression, and cell proliferation. In contrast to R102P and F104S, the P106L mutant confers cytokine-independent growth and stimulates downstream signaling after THPO treatment in Ba/F3 cells. Despite their opposite function, R102P and P106L, both lead to abnormal subcellular receptor distribution, lack of membrane localization, impaired glycosylation, and elevated THPO serum levels in effected patients. These findings indicate that the activation of downstream signaling by c-Mpl P106L does not require correct processing, trafficking, and cell surface expression of c-Mpl, whereas the negative feedback loop controlling THPO serum levels requires cell surface expression of the receptor. Thus, we propose that the P106L mutation functionally separates the activity of c-Mpl in downstream signaling from that in maintaining platelet homeostasis.

Somatic variants in MPL are also associated with Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (OMIM 254450) that we did not curate because somatic. \n\nThe MPL gene encodes the receptor for thrombopoietin, a hematopoietic growth factor that regulates the development of megakaryocytes and platelets as well as the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells.\n\nMPL was first reported in relation to Thrombocythemia 2 in 2004 (Ding et al., PMID 14764528) in a Japanese family with thrombocythemia inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. A unique point mutation, p.Ser505Asn, was identified in the transmembrane domain of the MPL gene in all of the 8 members with thrombocythemia. \n\n4 unique variants, all missense, have been reported in humans. The most common variant is p.Ser505Asn, that causes Thrombocythemia 2 with a mechanism of heterozygous gain of function, all the families with this variant show an autosomal dominant inheritance for the disorder. However, for the other three variants, p.Lys39Asn (that is present with high frequency in African Americans), p.Arg102Pro and p.Pro106Leu the inheritance is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance because thrombocythemia is present in all the homozygous subjects while heterozygous subjects may have normal or increased platelet count (however less than homozygous).\n \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (functional evidence of biochemical functions, functional alteration in non-patient cells, non-human model organisms that replicate the disease).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 7.2 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 28979237, 14764528, 19036112, 28034873, 19608689, 15269348, 25538044, 19713221). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 5.5 POINTS \nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and mouse models.\n\nMPL was found expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets, the cells involved in Thrombocythemia 2. It was not detectable on granulocytic cells, blast cells, and lymphocytes (PMID 7529061).\nChen et al. showed that MPL physically interacts with TPO upon immunoprecipitation for TPO and western blotting with an anti- MPL antibody. Moreover, they show that within the Mpl extracellular domain amino acids 102â€“251 are strongly involved in ligand binding and that mutations in residues Asp235 and Leu239 had the largest effect on decreasing binding efficacy (PMID: 20529857). \n\nAlexander et al. showed in non-patient cells (Ba/F3) transfected with mutant MPL that variants in MPL might contribute to constitutive receptor activation and consequent proliferation of cells expressing this receptor, such as megakaryocytes, inducing thrombocytosis (PMID: 8521814). In Ding et al showed that in Ba/F3 cells the Asn505 mutation induces both autonomous dimerization of Mpl and signal activation (p-MEK-1/2 and p-STAT5) in the absence of TPO (PMID 19483125).\nAlso UT-7 (non-patient) cells expressing the gain-of-function Mpl K39N showed a significant increase in proliferation compared with WT - expressing cells (PMID:29296828).\n\nA mouse model knockout for MPL demonstrated that the expression of MPL is crucial for megakaryocyte and platelet formation, even if it does not directly demonstrate that variants in MPL cause thrombocytosis (PMID 8630375).\nFavale et al. described a retroviral murine model in which deficient C57/Bl6 Mpl-/- lin- cells were retrovirally transduced with either the human MPLWT or MPL P106L receptor and then injected into lethally irradiated Mpl-/- mice. 4 weeks after transduction MPL P106L mice exhibited thrombocytosis, whereas MPL WT transduced mice did not. TPO levels were high in MPL P106L mice (PMID: 28034873). This mouse model recapitulates Thrombocythemia 2 phenotype.\n\nIn summary, MPL is definitively associated with Thrombocythemia 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on 7/22/20 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:23b39955-2760-46aa-978b-d27d4a212567"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
