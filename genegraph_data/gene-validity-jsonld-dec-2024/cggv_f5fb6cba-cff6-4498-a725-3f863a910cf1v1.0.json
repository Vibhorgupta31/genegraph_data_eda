Using mutant human PACS1 mRNA in a zebrafish model, the authors observe craniofacial defects that recapitulate the human disease phenotype. This craniofacial phenotype, induced upon over-expression of mutant mRNA, was rescued with the injection of an equal ratio of wild-type and mutant mRNA, suggesting a dominant negative mechanism of disease. They further reported that the significant reduction in craniofacial structures upon expression of mutant PACS1 mRNA was at least in part due to the loss of cranial-neural-crest cell-derived progenitors that showed a significant reduction in migration in the anterior-most region of the embryo. Examining specificity, the authors find that the observed migration phenotype is not observed in enteric-neural-crest cells but is instead specific to the cranial-neural-crest cells. Altogether, their findings suggest that PACS1 can promote the specification and migration of cranial-neural-crest cells that give rise to the majority of skeletal and connective tissues in the face.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23159249","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We studied two unrelated boys with intellectual disability (ID) and a striking facial resemblance suggestive of a hitherto unappreciated syndrome. Exome sequencing in both families identified identical de novo mutations in PACS1, suggestive of causality. To support these genetic findings and to understand the pathomechanism of the mutation, we studied the protein in vitro and in vivo. Altered PACS1 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in vitro with concomitant increased protein stability and shows impaired binding to an isoform-specific variant of TRPV4, but not the full-length protein. Furthermore, consistent with the human pathology, expression of mutant PACS1 mRNA in zebrafish embryos induces craniofacial defects most likely in a dominant-negative fashion. This phenotype is driven by aberrant specification and migration of SOX10-positive cranial, but not enteric, neural-crest cells. Our findings suggest that PACS1 is necessary for the formation of craniofacial structures and that perturbation of its functions results in a specific syndromic ID phenotype.","dc:creator":"Schuurs-Hoeijmakers JH","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Recurrent de novo mutations in PACS1 cause defective cranial-neural-crest migration and define a recognizable intellectual-disability syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"In vivo functional characterization of p.Arg203Trp in PACS1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f5fb6cba-cff6-4498-a725-3f863a910cf1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f5fb6cba-cff6-4498-a725-3f863a910cf1_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:114f899e-df63-4855-be13-bcabcd7eb83a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d98a16f6-3745-4d31-943d-9d9f62b453ef","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Developmental delay/intellectual disability; abnormal growth at birth (> 90th percentile in height); abnormal speech; dysmorphic features include epicanthal folds, synophyrys, low set ears, bulbous nose, thin upper lip, micrognathia, highly arched palate, left fifth finger clinodactyly, and broad big toe","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:114f899e-df63-4855-be13-bcabcd7eb83a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:e1a87efd-1e9f-44c8-b199-da7d02aef56d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018026.4(PACS1):c.607C>T (p.Arg203Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA204795"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28111752","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Graphical abstract key: ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ASD, atrial septal defect; DD, developmental delay; EEG, electroencephalogram; Ht, height; ID, intellectual disability; OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder; OFC, open fontanelle; PDA, patent ductus arteriosis; PFO, patent foramen ovale; VSD, ventricular septal defect; Wt, weight.","dc:creator":"Stern D","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Association of the missense variant p.Arg203Trp in PACS1 as a cause of intellectual disability and seizures."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28111752","rdfs:label":"Patient 8"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"One of eight of the patients in this publication is said to have an unknown inheritance of the PACS1 mutation.

Here, we describe two Japanese patients with Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome with a recurrent PACS1 mutation. In addition to the typical clinical symptoms, each patient presented novel clinical phenotypes. One patient presented with involuntary movements and was treated with trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride. We hypothesized that the PACS1 mutation leads to an inherent dopaminergic insufficiency that underlies the developing symptoms along with the neurodevelopmental processes. The second patient was diagnosed with lipomyelomeningocele during an examination for severe constipation at the age of 2 years and 8 months. The diagnosis of lipomyelomeningocele in this patient was delayed due to the lack of cutaneous lesions.

Thus our report expands the phenotypic spectrum of SHMS and establishes its occurrence across populations.","dc:creator":"Dutta AK","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome in a patient from India."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30690871","rdfs:label":"Patient"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Given the surplus of probands to be scored aside from this publication and the use of next generation sequencing gene panel rather than whole exome sequencing for variant detection, this patient does not need to be scored."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":923,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6290c1f8-7c1f-4ec1-935d-2196e7caa66c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014006","gene":"hgnc:30032","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PACS1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome in 2012 (Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al., 23159249). At least 2 unique missense variants (NM_018026.4(PACS1):c.607C>T (p.Arg203Trp) & NM_018026.3(PACS1): c.608G>A (p.Arg203Gln)) have been reported in humans. All but one reported cases are due to the Arg203Trp mutation. Miyake et al. 2018 (PMID: 28975623) reported the first and only case of Arg203Gln and described the same distinctive facial dysmorphisms characteristic of the Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome. These features typically include full, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, long eyelashes, ptosis, low-set, large ears, bulbous tip of nose, flat philtrum, wide mouth with downturned corners and thin upper lip with a wavy profile, and diastema of the teeth. Other common phenotypes include intellectual disability, delayed speech development, cryptorchidism in males, seizures, hypotonia, and congenital anomalies affecting the heart, brain, or eye. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\u000b\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points. \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 33 probands in nine publications (PMIDs: 23159249, 25522177, 26842493, 28111752, 30113927, 28975623, 29550517, 30690871, 30588754). Among these, six probands from four publications (PMIDs: 23159249, 25522177, 28975623, 30588754) were selected to be scored based on confirmed de novo status, representation of the variant spectrum, diversity in ethnic groups, and variant detection via trio-based exome sequencing. \nSummary of Experimental Data: 2 points.\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vivo functional assays in a non-human model organism. To understand the mechanistic basis of the human dysmorphic phenotype, Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al 2012 (PMID: 23159249) studied the behavior of the p.Arg203Trp substitution in craniofacial cartilaginous structures in zebrafish embryos and found that the expression of mutant PACS1 mRNA in zebrafish embryos induces craniofacial defects most likely in a dominant-negative fashion and that this phenotype is driven by aberrant specification and migration of SOX10-positive cranial, but not enteric, neural-crest cells. \nIn summary, PACS1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant, Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome also known as the intellectual disability-craniofacial dysmorphism-cryptorchidism syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 16, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f5fb6cba-cff6-4498-a725-3f863a910cf1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
