Joubert syndrome (JS) is a ciliopathy with a prevalence estimated to be between 1:80 000 and 1:100 000. JS occurs due to bi-allelic mutations in one of the 34 identified genes, all of which encode for protein components of the primary cilia. The presentation of JS is highly variable, however a clinical diagnosis can be established by the presence of the molar tooth sign on axial brain MRI, hypotonia in infancy, and developmental delay. JS is less severe than Meckel syndrome (MKS), which is another recessive, and often lethal, ciliopathy. This report outlines an interesting case of JS, in which two novel mutations in B9D1 were identified. This gene is not commonly associated with JS, and is often implicated in MKS.

This disorder is thought to be associated with defects in primary cilia; therefore, it is classed as a ciliopathy. To date, six genes have been commonly associated with MKS (MKS1, TMEM67, TMEM216, CEP290, CC2D2A and RPGRIP1L). However, mutation screening of these genes revealed two mutated alleles in only just over half of our MKS cohort (46 families), suggesting an even greater level of genetic heterogeneity. To explore the full genetic complexity of MKS, we performed exon-enriched next-generation sequencing of 31 ciliopathy genes in 12 MKS pedigrees using RainDance microdroplet-PCR enrichment and IlluminaGAIIx next-generation sequencing. In family M456, we detected a splice-donor site change in a novel MKS gene, B9D1. The B9D1 protein is structurally similar to MKS1 and has been shown to be of importance for ciliogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of fetal RNA revealed, hemizygously, a single smaller mRNA product with a frameshifting exclusion of B9D1 exon 4. ArrayCGH showed that the second mutation was a 1.713 Mb de novo deletion completely deleting the B9D1 allele. Immunofluorescence analysis highlighted a significantly lower level of ciliated patient cells compared to controls, confirming a role for B9D1 in ciliogenesis. The fetus inherited an additional likely pathogenic novel missense change to a second MKS gene, CEP290; p.R2210C, suggesting oligogenic inheritance in this disorder.","dc:creator":"Hopp K","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"B9D1 is revealed as a novel Meckel syndrome (MKS) gene by targeted exon-enriched next-generation sequencing and deletion analysis."}},"rdfs:label":"Male, neonate"},{"id":"cggv:eee95221-515f-4f73-bea2-9970b4ba6d5d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eee95221-515f-4f73-bea2-9970b4ba6d5d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:eee95221-515f-4f73-bea2-9970b4ba6d5d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Evaluation through immunofluorescence showed a significantly decreased level of ciliation in proband cells when compared to normal cells, showing a role of B9D1 in ciliogenesis.

For the clinical diagnosis, the presence of at least three CFs is required, individuals presenting with only two CFs have been categorized as VATER/VACTERL-like. The majority of VATER/VACTERL individuals displays a renal phenotype. Hitherto, variants in FGF8, FOXF1, HOXD13, LPP, TRAP1, PTEN, and ZIC3 have been associated with the VATER/VACTERL association; however, large-scale re-sequencing could only confirm TRAP1 and ZIC3 as VATER/VACTERL disease genes, both associated with a renal phenotype. In this study, we performed exome sequencing in 21 individuals and their families with a renal VATER/VACTERL or VATER/VACTERL-like phenotype to identify potentially novel genetic causes.

Localization of MKS-3 and other known MKS and NPHP proteins partially overlapped. By analyzing mks-3 mutants, we found that ciliogenesis did not require MKS-3; instead, cilia elongated and cilia-mediated chemoreception was abnormal. Genetic analysis indicated that mks-3 functions in a pathway with other mks genes. Furthermore, mks-1 and mks-3 genetically interacted with a separate pathway (involving nphp-1 and nphp-4) to influence proper positioning, orientation, and formation of cilia. Combined disruption of nphp and mks pathways had cell nonautonomous effects on C. elegans sensilla.

Mouse mutations in either Mks1 or B9d2 compromise ciliogenesis and result in phenotypes similar to those of MKS. Given the importance of these two B9 proteins to ciliogenesis, we examined the role of the third B9 protein, B9d1. Mice lacking B9d1 displayed polydactyly, kidney cysts, ductal plate malformations, and abnormal patterning of the neural tube, concomitant with compromised ciliogenesis, ciliary protein localization, and Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. These data prompted us to screen MKS patients for mutations in B9D1 and B9D2. We identified a homozygous c.301A>C (p.Ser101Arg) B9D2 mutation that segregates with MKS, affects an evolutionarily conserved residue, and is absent from controls. Unlike wild-type B9D2 mRNA, the p.Ser101Arg mutation failed to rescue zebrafish phenotypes induced by the suppression of b9d2. With coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, we found that Mks1, B9d1, and B9d2 interact physically, but that the p.Ser101Arg mutation abrogates the ability of B9d2 to interact with Mks1, further suggesting that the mutation compromises B9d2 function.

This disorder is characterized by abnormal development/structure of cilia and renal malformations/cysts. The *B9D1* gene encodes one of three B9D-containing proteins, which all interact with basal bodies and primary cilia in mammalian cells and have a role in ciliogenesis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity (autosomal recessive Ciliopathy): autosomal recessive Meckel Syndrome 9 (OMIM: 614209) and autosomal recessive Joubert Syndrome 27 (OMIM: 617120).\n\nTwelve variants (missense, nonsense, splicing, large deletion) that have been reported in 9 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 24886560, 21493627, 32622957, 25920555, 27894351, 34338422, 26092869) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. There were four missense variants downgraded for homozygosity/consanguinity. One proband had a deletion impacting several genes (only one of which was implicated in ciliopathy) in trans with a splicing variant, and both variants were scored as loss of function variants due to severely decreasing ciliogenesis evident in cell analysis. In another patient, a missense variant compound heterozygous to another missense variant was scored as loss of function due to RNA analysis demonstrating an impact on splicing. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, cell culture models, expression studies, biochemical functional evidence, and evidence of interactions with other proteins (PMIDs: 21763481, 22179047, 20150540). Two mouse models were available (PMIDs: 21763481, 22179047), one where a homozygous whole exon deletion led to cysts and other kidney anomalies in mice, and the other showing significantly decreased ciliation in homozygous knockout mice compared to the wild type. Evidence in IMCD3 cells further shows the influence on ciliation which *B9D1* has, in its localization to the transition zone, and shows that it interacts with other proteins definitively associated with ciliogenesis/Joubert Syndrome, including *CC2D2A*, *AHI1*, and *CC2D2A* (PMID: 22179047). The protein is also known to be essential to ciliation, indicated in a C. elegan model, when inhibiting it as well as the NPHP pathway led to defective ciliary function, while no such effect was seen when only the NPHP pathway was inhibited alone. \n\nThe protein is an essential part of the *B9D1* complex, which interacts with several other proteins associated with autosomal recessive Ciliopathy manifesting as Joubert/Meckel Syndrome. In summary, *B9D1* is “Definitively” associated with autosomal recessive Ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 05/08/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8d682069-b65a-46d5-973a-6b43ba1a80e1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
