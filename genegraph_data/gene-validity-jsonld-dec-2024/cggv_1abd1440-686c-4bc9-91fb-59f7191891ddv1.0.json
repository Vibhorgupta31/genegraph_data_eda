We report a patient with Leigh syndrome who showed a complex I deficiency expressed in cultured fibroblasts and muscle tissue. To find the genetic cause of the complex I deficiency, we screened the mitochondrial DNA and the nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I. We identified compound-heterozygous mutations in the NDUFA10 gene, encoding an accessory subunit of complex I. The first mutation disrupted the start codon and the second mutation resulted in an amino acid substitution. The fibroblasts of the patient displayed decreased amount and activity, and a disturbed assembly of complex I.

Complex I exists in supercomplex forms with respiratory chain complexes III and IV, which are together required for the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient used for the synthesis of ATP. Complex I is also a major source of damaging reactive oxygen species and its dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial disease, Parkinson's disease and ageing. Bacterial and human complex I share 14 core subunits that are essential for enzymatic function; however, the role and necessity of the remaining 31 human accessory subunits is unclear. The incorporation of accessory subunits into the complex increases the cellular energetic cost and has necessitated the involvement of numerous assembly factors for complex I biogenesis. Here we use gene editing to generate human knockout cell lines for each accessory subunit. We show that 25 subunits are strictly required for assembly of a functional complex and 1 subunit is essential for cell viability. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cell lines revealed that loss of each subunit affects the stability of other subunits residing in the same structural module. Analysis of proteomic changes after the loss of specific modules revealed that ATP5SL and DMAC1 are required for assembly of the distal portion of the complex I membrane arm. Our results demonstrate the broad importance of accessory subunits in the structure and function of human complex I. Coupling gene-editing technology with proteomics represents a powerful tool for dissecting large multi-subunit complexes and enables the study of complex dysfunction at a cellular level.","dc:creator":"Stroud DA","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Accessory subunits are integral for assembly and function of human mitochondrial complex I."},"rdfs:label":"NDUFA10 KO cell line"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"NDUFA10 is a complex I accessory protein required for complex I assembly and function."},{"id":"cggv:231bda2f-bd16-456a-836f-6c1b7fb8006a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a45b59da-1e06-4c74-9c05-a9f0d53ab3d7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fig 3.

Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*NDUFA10* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2011 (PMID: 21150889), in a boy with a confirmed neuropathological diagnosis of Leigh syndrome. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFA10*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFA10* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFA10* was previously curated by this GCEP on June 10, 2019 (SOP V6) as having a Limited association with Leigh Syndrome Spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS. \n  \nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *NDUFA10* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes nine variants (five missense, two deletions, one insertion, one frameshift) in seven probands from seven publications (PMIDs: 21150889; 22200994; 28247337; 26741492; 36270260; 35379322; 35094435). Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of disease which includes LSS. The age of onset ranges from birth to early childhood. Additional features seen include developmental delay, ataxia, spastic tetraparesis, seizures, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and feeding difficulty. Elevated blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactates are seen. Muscle biopsies showed a complex I deficiency. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and functional alteration in patient fibroblasts and in a *C. elegans* model system (PMIDs: 27509854; 27626371, 21150889, 19672299).    \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFA10* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
