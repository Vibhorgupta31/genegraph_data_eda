Here, using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole human exome resequencing, we identified mutations in the aarF domain containing kinase 4 (ADCK4) gene in 15 individuals with SRNS from 8 unrelated families. ADCK4 was highly similar to ADCK3, which has been shown to participate in coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthesis. Mutations in ADCK4 resulted in reduced CoQ10 levels and reduced mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in cells isolated from individuals with SRNS and transformed lymphoblasts. Knockdown of adck4 in zebrafish and Drosophila recapitulated nephrotic syndrome-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, ADCK4 was expressed in glomerular podocytes and partially localized to podocyte mitochondria and foot processes in rat kidneys and cultured human podocytes. In human podocytes, ADCK4 interacted with members of the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway, including COQ6, which has been linked with SRNS and COQ7. Knockdown of ADCK4 in podocytes resulted in decreased migration, which was reversed by CoQ10 addition. Interestingly, a patient with SRNS with a homozygous ADCK4 frameshift mutation had partial remission following CoQ10 treatment. These data indicate that individuals with SRNS with mutations in ADCK4 or other genes that participate in CoQ10 biosynthesis may be treatable with CoQ10.

They found that CoQ10 levels were significantly lower in both affected sibs (20.11±3.41 and 19.75±4.63 pmol/mg protein) compared to the het parents (64.33±11.92 and 83.04±20.64; p=0.0134). The authors also measured oxygen consumption rates, finding that they were ~20% reduced in this patient compared to the unaffected parents and an unrelated control (Fig. 5C).

The *COQ8B* gene encodes the COQ8B protein, which is an atypical kinase that is expressed in the podocytes of the kidney and localizes to the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in coenzyme Q10 synthesis.  Of note, this gene was previously known as *ADCK4*.\n\nThe *COQ8B* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 24270420). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COQ8B*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COQ8B* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *COQ8B* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes eleven variants (five missense, two nonsense, three frameshift, and one in frame insertion) in eight probands in one publication (PMIDs: 24270420) although additional cases have been reported in the medical literature. Affected individuals typically experience early-onset severe kidney dysfunction (steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, or SRNS, that typically leads to end-stage kidney disease) although later onset has also been reported. Treatment with high dose Coenzyme Q10 supplementation early in the course of disease can be beneficial. Other features have been reported including seizures, intellectual disability, hypothyroidism, and retinitis pigmentosa. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function, a mouse model, a zebrafish model, and in vitro functional assays demonstrating oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies due to variants in *COQ8B* (PMIDs: 32381600, 24270420).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COQ8B* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. More than three years have elapsed since the first assertion of this gene-disease relationship, and no contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
