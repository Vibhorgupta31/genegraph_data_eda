Psychomotor development was slow until his fifth month; thereafter, virtually absent until treatment was started. He had marked hypotonia with elevated serum creatine kinase and transaminases, prolonged prothrombin time and low albumin. Electron microscopy of muscle showed numerous abnormal myelin figures; liver biopsy showed mild hepatitis with sparse rough endoplasmic reticulum. Brain MRI at 12.7 months revealed white matter atrophy and abnormally slow myelination. Hypermethioninemia was present in the initial metabolic study at age 8 months, and persisted (up to 784 microM) without tyrosine elevation. Plasma total homocysteine was very slightly elevated for an infant to 14.5-15.9 microM. In plasma, S-adenosylmethionine was 30-fold and AdoHcy 150-fold elevated. Activity of AdoHcy hydrolase was approximately equal to 3% of control in liver and was 5-10% of the control values in red blood cells and cultured fibroblasts. We found no evidence of a soluble inhibitor of the enzyme in extracts of the patient's cultured fibroblasts. Additional pretreatment abnormalities in plasma included low concentrations of phosphatidylcholine and choline, with elevations of guanidinoacetate, betaine, dimethylglycine, and cystathionine. Leukocyte DNA was hypermethylated. Gene analysis revealed two mutations in exon 4: a maternally derived stop codon, and a paternally derived missense mutation. We discuss reasons for biochemical abnormalities and pathophysiological aspects of AdoHcy hydrolase deficiency.","dc:creator":"Baric I","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency in a human: a genetic disorder of methionine metabolism."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9b3a56b-b188-44d1-9983-a059895c0ba1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9b3a56b-b188-44d1-9983-a059895c0ba1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ee697cb-8313-4a64-b17c-150680d7b227","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:59f91fce-86af-48bb-ac93-57014da09429","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"As reviewed in PMID: 21308989, not being catabolized normally, adenosyl-homocysteine accumulates and inhibits many adenosyl-methionine-dependent methyltransferases, producing accumulation of adenosyl-methionine and, thereby, hypermethioninemia.

Here we report that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH/AHCY), the only mammalian enzyme capable of hydrolyzing S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine binds to DNMT1 during DNA replication. SAHH enhances DNMT1 activity in vitro, and its overexpression in mammalian cells led to hypermethylation of the genome, whereas its inhibition by adenosine periodate or siRNA-mediated knockdown resulted in hypomethylation of the genome. Hypermethylation was consistent in both gene bodies and repetitive DNA elements leading to aberrant gene regulation.

Main characteristics are psychomotor delay including delayed myelination and myopathy (hypotonia, absent tendon reflexes etc.) from birth, mostly associated with hypermethioninaemia, elevated serum creatine kinase levels and increased genome wide DNA methylation. The prime function of AHCY is to hydrolyse and efficiently remove S-adenosylhomocysteine, the by-product of transmethylation reactions and one of the most potent methyltransferase inhibitors. In this study, we set out to more specifically characterize DNA methylation changes in blood samples from patients with AHCY deficiency. Global DNA methylation was increased in two of three analysed patients. In addition, we analysed the DNA methylation levels at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of six imprinted genes (MEST, SNRPN, LIT1, H19, GTL2 and PEG3) as well as Alu and LINE1 repetitive elements in seven patients. Three patients showed a hypermethylation in up to five imprinted gene DMRs. Abnormal methylation in Alu and LINE1 repetitive elements was not observed. We conclude that DNA hypermethylation seems to be a frequent but not a constant feature associated with AHCY deficiency that affects different genomic regions to different degrees.

These abnormal DNA methylation reactions may have occurred only in patients that exceeded a critical threshold of elevated SAH levels at the embryonic stage and thus underwent fetal programming during early to mid-gestation. A global DNA methylation analysis of the patients which, owing to lack of sufficient genomic DNA, were up to now only studied for imprinted gene methylation, would be necessary to further corroborate the hypothesis of fetal programming dependent on SAH levels present around implantation. In addition, the fact that only some patients with AHCY deficiency display DNA hypermethylation and these patients are even not all affected at the global or gene-specific level may reflect the involvement of the AHCY protein in a multitude of cellular pathways and complex protein interaction networks including more than 200 SAM-dependent MTs and thereby adjusting the metabolic machinery of the cell and individual.

The diagnosis was based on markedly elevated plasma concentrations of both AdoHcy and S-adenosylmethionine, some 20% of the mean control activity of AdoHcy hydrolase activity in haemolysates of his red-blood cells, and two missense mutations in his gene encoding AdoHcy hydrolase. He had low values of erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine and plasma free choline and marginally elevated excretion of guanidinoacetate, suggesting that the elevated AdoHcy may have been inhibiting methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine and guanidinoacetate.

Traditional methods yield molecular diagnoses in less than one-half of children with NDD. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) can enable diagnosis of NDD, but their clinical and cost-effectiveness are unknown. One hundred families with 119 children affected by NDD received diagnostic WGS and/or WES of parent-child trios, wherein the sequencing approach was guided by acuity of illness. Forty-five percent received molecular diagnoses. An accelerated sequencing modality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11 of 15). Forty percent of families with children with nonacute NDD, followed in ambulatory care clinics (34 of 85), received diagnoses: 33 by WES and 1 by staged WES then WGS. The cost of prior negative tests in the nonacute patients was $19,100 per family, suggesting sequencing to be cost-effective at up to $7640 per family. A change in clinical care or impression of the pathophysiology was reported in 49% of newly diagnosed families. If WES or WGS had been performed at symptom onset, genomic diagnoses may have been made 77 months earlier than occurred in this study.

Main characteristics are psychomotor delay including delayed myelination and myopathy (hypotonia, absent tendon reflexes etc.) from birth, with biochemical abnormalities of marked elevations in plasma SAH, SAM, methionine and creatine kinase accompanied by a significant decrease in the SAM/SAH ratio (however several cases had normal methionine levels at the initial evaluation). At least 13 variants (mostly missense but also nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Biallelic variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 15024124, 16736098, 20852937, 22959829, 30121674, 26527160, 26095522, 27848944, 31957987, 35463910, 39512434, 39634240). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function (PMID: 13641268). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 06/29/2020.
