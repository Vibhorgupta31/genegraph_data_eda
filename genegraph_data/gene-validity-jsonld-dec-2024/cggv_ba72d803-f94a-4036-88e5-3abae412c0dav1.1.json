It is a major determinant of the physiological properties of each of the three muscle fibre types that make up the skeletal muscles. Heterozygous dominant missense mutations in myosin heavy chain genes cause various types of cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy, but the effects of myosin heavy chain null mutations in humans have not previously been reported. We have identified the first patients lacking fast type 2A muscle fibres, caused by total absence of fast myosin heavy chain IIa protein due to truncating mutations of the corresponding gene MYH2. Five adult patients, two males and three females, from three unrelated families in UK and Finland were clinically assessed and muscle biopsy was performed in one patient from each family. MYH2 was sequenced and the expression of the corresponding transcripts and protein was analysed in muscle tissue. The patients had early-onset symptoms characterized by mild generalized muscle weakness, extraocular muscle involvement and relatively favourable prognosis. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes including variability of fibre size, internalized nuclei, and increased interstitial connective and adipose tissue. No muscle fibres expressing type IIa myosin heavy chain were identified and the MYH2 transcripts were markedly reduced. All patients were compound heterozygous for truncating mutations in MYH2. The parents were unaffected, consistent with recessive mutations. Our findings show that null mutations in the fast myosin heavy chain IIa gene cause early onset myopathy and demonstrate that this isoform is necessary for normal muscle development and function. The relatively mild phenotype is interesting in relation to the more severe phenotypes generally seen in relation to recessive null mutations in sarcomeric proteins.","dc:creator":"Tajsharghi H","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Human disease caused by loss of fast IIa myosin heavy chain due to recessive MYH2 mutations."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba72d803-f94a-4036-88e5-3abae412c0da_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba72d803-f94a-4036-88e5-3abae412c0da_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:2a8e28f2-f409-4369-9bd9-fda18317a59b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2a8e28f2-f409-4369-9bd9-fda18317a59b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":60,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d5c73cfa-3909-41f0-910e-4dcda09fe6bd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017534.6(MYH2):c.4352del (p.Lys1451SerfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8390659"}},"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen skeletal muscle or peripheral blood.

Homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating MYH2 mutations have been demonstrated to cause recessive myopathy with ophthalmoplegia, mild-to-moderate muscle weakness and complete lack of type 2A muscle fibers. In this study, we describe for the first time the clinical and morphological characteristics of recessive myosin IIa myopathy associated with MYH2 missense mutations. Seven patients of five different families with a myopathy characterized by ophthalmoplegia and mild-to-moderate muscle weakness were investigated. Muscle biopsy was performed to study morphological changes and MyHC isoform expression. Five of the patients were homozygous for MYH2 missense mutations, one patient was compound heterozygous for a missense and a nonsense mutation and one patient was homozygous for a frame-shift MYH2 mutation. Muscle biopsy demonstrated small or absent type 2A muscle fibers and reduced or absent expression of the corresponding MyHC IIa transcript and protein. We conclude that mild muscle weakness and ophthalmoplegia in combination with muscle biopsy demonstrating small or absent type 2A muscle fibers are the hallmark of recessive myopathy associated with MYH2 mutations.

The distribution of beta/slow, IIa, and IIx MHC transcripts defines three major muscle fiber types expressing a single MHC mRNA, i.e., either beta/slow, IIa, or IIx MHC mRNA, and two populations of hybrid fibers coexpressing beta/slow with IIa or IIa with IIx MHC mRNA.

The MyHC IIa E706K mutation is associated with congenital joint contractures, early-onset muscle weakness, and progressive course with moderate to severe muscle weakness later in life. To study the pathogenicity of this MyHC mutation, we investigated the effect of the corresponding mutation (E710K) in the major MyHC isoform (MyHC B) of the body wall muscle of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms with null mutations in the MyHC B gene (unc-54) are severely paralyzed and depleted of thick filaments in the body wall muscle sarcomeres. unc-54 null mutants with extrachromosomal arrays of a gene construct including the entire wild-type unc-54 gene were partially rescued as determined by a motility assay and by morphological analysis of the body wall muscle. Analysis of unc-54 null mutants with extrachromosomal arrays of the unc-54 gene with the E710K mutation were severely paralyzed but showed formation of thick filaments in the body wall muscle. We conclude that the MyHC E706K (E710K in C. elegans) mutation is pathogenic and that the effect is primarily functional rather than structural because thick filaments are formed.
