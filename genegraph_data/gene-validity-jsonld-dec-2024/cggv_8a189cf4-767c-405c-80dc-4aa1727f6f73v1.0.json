Presently, no effective pharmacological therapy for TTR amyloidoses is available, mostly due to a substantial lackÂ of knowledge about both the molecular mechanisms of TTR aggregation in tissue and the ensuing functional and viability modifications that occur in aggregate-exposed cells. TTR amyloidoses are of particular interest regarding the relation between functional and viability impairment in aggregate-exposed excitable cells such as peripheral neurons and cardiomyocytes. In particular, the latter cells provide an opportunity to investigate in parallel the electrophysiological and biochemical modifications that take place when the cells are exposed for various lengths of time to variously aggregated wild-type TTR, a condition that characterizes senile systemic amyloidosis. In this study, we investigated biochemical and electrophysiological modifications in cardiomyocytes exposed to amyloid oligomers or fibrils of wild-type TTR or to its T4-stabilized form, which resists tetramer disassembly, misfolding, and aggregation. Amyloid TTR cytotoxicity results in mitochondrial potential modification, oxidative stress, deregulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, and Ca2+ cycling. The altered intracellular Ca2+ cycling causes a prolongation of the action potential, as determined by whole-cell recordings of action potentials on isolated mouse ventricular myocytes, which may contribute to the development of cellular arrhythmias and conduction alterations often seen in patients with TTR amyloidosis. Our data add information about the biochemical, functional, and viability alterations that occur in cardiomyocytes exposed to aggregated TTR, and provide clues as to the molecular and physiological basis of heart dysfunction in sporadic senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloid cardiomyopathy forms of TTR amyloidoses.","dc:creator":"Sartiani L","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Biochemical and Electrophysiological Modification of Amyloid Transthyretin on Cardiomyocytes."},"rdfs:label":"TTR Mouse Myocyte AP Modification"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8f8da427-0822-47b1-a6b1-d3ab0ac58345","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f239b11f-177c-4b82-89ab-47d6ad6ca44b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"They found that cells treated with the aggregating forms only, showed localization of TTR to the cell membrane and internalization of the TTR aggregate forms.\n\nNote: TTR deposits are not formed in the heart, but the liver.

In an attempt to establish an animal model of TTR Met-30-associated homozygous familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy and to study the structural and functional properties of human TTR Met 30, we generated a mouse line carrying a null mutation at the endogenous ttr locus (ttr-/-) and the human mutant ttr gene (6.0-hMet 30) as a transgene. In these mice, human TTR Met-30-derived amyloid deposits were first observed in the esophagus and stomach when the mice were 11 months of age. With advancing age, amyloid deposits extended to various other tissues. Because no significant difference was detected in the onset, progression, and tissue distribution of amyloid deposition between the ttr-/- and ttr+/+ transgenic mice expressing 6.0-hMet 30, endogenous normal mouse TTR probably does not affect the deposition of human TTR Met-30-derived amyloid in mice. TTR is a tetramer composed of four identical subunits that binds thyroxine (T4) and plasma retinol-binding protein. The introduction of 6.0-hMet 30 into the ttr-/- mice significantly increased their depressed serum levels of T4 and retinol-binding protein, suggesting that human TTR Met 30 binds T4 and retinol-binding protein in vivo. The T4-binding ability of human TTR Met 30 was confirmed by the analysis of T4-binding proteins in the sera of ttr-/- transgenic mice expressing 6.0-hMet 30.

In this study here, we first determined that aged vervet monkeys developed TTR amyloidosis and showed cardiac dysfunction but other primates did not. We also found that vervet monkeys had the TTR Ile122 allele, which is well known as a frequent mutation-causing human TTR amyloidosis. Furthermore, we generated recombinant monkey TTRs and determined that the vervet monkey TTR had lower tetrameric stability and formed more amyloid fibrils than did cynomolgus monkey TTR, which had the Val122 allele. We thus propose that the Ile122 allele has an important role in TTR amyloidosis in the aged vervet monkey and that this monkey can serve as a valid pathological model of the human disease. Finally, from the viewpoint of molecular evolution of TTR in primates, we determined that human TTR mutations causing the leptomeningeal phenotype of TTR amyloidosis tended to occur in amino acid residues that showed no diversity throughout primate evolution.

Of note, autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. Being a syndrome, individuals with TTR- related amyloidosis can present with multi-systemic phenotypes including, polyneuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, cardiomyopathy, gastrointestinal features, autonomic insufficiency, and renal insufficiency. Familial amyloidosis was first described in 1952 (Andrade et al.; PMID 12978172), but it was not until 1984 (Saraiva et al.; PMID 6736244) that TTR was discovered as the causative gene responsible for this initial report of familial amyloidosis. There are >100 known mutations in TTR reported in humans world-wide as documented in Mutations in Hereditary Amyloidosis Registry (http://www.amyloidosismutations.com) and the Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), USA Amyloidosis Research group site at (http://www.iupui.edu/~amyloid/home.html). All reported mutations are missense (Rowczenio et al., 2014). Multiple cases are reported in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is gain of function, as mutation causes either tetramer dissociation or monomer denaturation, which both contribute to the formation of amyloid fibrils in tissue (Sekijima, 2015; PMID 25604431). Note, wild-type ATTR (wtATTR), the protein product of the TTR gene, can cause amyloidosis (senile cardiac amyloidosis) on its own, but this form is age-dependent, and often occurs at a much greater age of onset than individuals who harbor a pathogenic variant in TTR. This gene-disease association is supported by the function of the gene product, decreased myocyte functional activity in non-patient cells treated with fibril forming TTR, multiple animal models, rescue experiments, and studies of the clinical impact of anti-sense-oligonucleotides (ASOs) for the treatment of amyloidosis in humans (http://ttrstudy.com). In summary, TTR is definitively associated with Amyloidosis. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nLumping and Splitting: Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found that no difference in molecular mechanism underlies the two disease entities: (1) Amyloidosis, hereditary, transthyretin-related (MIM:105210), and (2) Carpal tunnel syndrome, familial (MIM:115430). Furthermore, carpal tunnel syndrome is often a presenting phenotype that occurs in hereditary amyloidosis (MIM:105210). Therefore, the two entities (MIM:105210 and MIM:115430) have been lumped into one disease entity, Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.\n\nData on the occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in individuals with Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis was collected by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Committee (subgroup of the Cardiovascular Working Group). Some individuals with Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis present with features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and/or restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). The prevalence of HCM and/or RCM in Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is high but exact percentages have not been accurately defined due the high prevalence of HCM and RCM (~25%) development in senile cardiac amyloidosis, which occurs due to accumulation of wildtype TTR accumulation in the heart with age (Galant et al., 2017 PMID 28213611; Meier-Ewert et al., 2011 PMID 21989745; Perlini et al, 2016 PMID 27900617; Ruberg and Berk, 2012 PMID 22949539). Several variants including TTR-V30M, TTR-T60A, and TTR-V122L are the most commonly associated with cardiac amyloidosis (Siddiqi and Ruberg, 2017 PMID 28739313). Additionally, the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Gene Curation Working Group reviewed the subtype of individuals that present with features of polyneuropathy, those individuals typically developing an axonal, length-dependent, predominantly sensory and autonomic neuropathy or small fiber neuropathy in the early course, which rapidly progresses involving motor nerves as well.  For the neuropathy sub-phenotype, the current literature provides additional evidence including further neuropathy cases associated to various TTR mutations such as p.Val50Met (PMIDs: 8071954, 19180884, 24101130) and p.Leu75Pro (1351039, 7910950, 31319424) with variant-based functional studies ranging from urea-assays (PMID: 12351683)  to mouse models (PMIDs: 9095004, 12351683). Functional evidence further supports the gene-disease relationship for neuropathy, including expression studies (PMID: 28335735), nerve tissue based cell cultures (PMIDs: 11567048, 18983977, 14981241), and rescue experiments including three successful phase 3 clinical trials (PMIDs: 22843282, 30145929, 29972753)","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8a189cf4-767c-405c-80dc-4aa1727f6f73"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
