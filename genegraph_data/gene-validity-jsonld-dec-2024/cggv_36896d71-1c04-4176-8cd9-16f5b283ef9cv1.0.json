KDM5C, a histone H3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methyl (H3K4me2/3)-specific demethylase, is frequently mutated in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) patients. Here, we report that disruption of the mouse Kdm5c gene recapitulates adaptive and cognitive abnormalities observed in XLID, including impaired social behavior, memory deficits, and aggression. Kdm5c-knockout brains exhibit abnormal dendritic arborization, spine anomalies, and altered transcriptomes. In neurons, Kdm5c is recruited to promoters that harbor CpG islands decorated with high levels of H3K4me3, where it fine-tunes H3K4me3 levels. Kdm5c predominantly represses these genes, which include members of key pathways that regulate the development and function of neuronal circuitries. In summary, our mouse behavioral data strongly suggest that KDM5C mutations are causal to XLID. Furthermore, our findings suggest that loss of KDM5C function may impact gene expression in multiple regulatory pathways relevant to the clinical phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Iwase S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"A Mouse Model of X-linked Intellectual Disability Associated with Impaired Removal of Histone Methylation."},"rdfs:label":"Dendritic morphology"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Multiple dendritic phenotypes were reported."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:36896d71-1c04-4176-8cd9-16f5b283ef9c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92b786d6-f085-4810-a7d0-40141b35b917","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d7aa3a4f-2f4a-4248-bfad-b274a14df111","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Kdm5c knockout mice show memory deficits in fear conditioning and Morris Water Maze, which resembles mental retardation phenotype in human patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804915","rdfs:label":"Behavioral tests"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:36896d71-1c04-4176-8cd9-16f5b283ef9c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:36896d71-1c04-4176-8cd9-16f5b283ef9c_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":2.2},{"id":"cggv:36896d71-1c04-4176-8cd9-16f5b283ef9c_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:87676899-026d-4193-bdf5-ae5473d7b37f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e425bd1-5d2d-4548-b800-786b6b6e5b55","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"Mutation screen on 47 brain expressed genes in a 7.4-Mb interval in Xp11, flanked by the genes ELK1 and ALAS2.","phenotypeFreeText":"Developmental delay","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002353","obo:HP_0010864"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Karyotyping, negative for Fragile X syndrome","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:87676899-026d-4193-bdf5-ae5473d7b37f_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:655a4937-9637-42ed-9217-708ee1e1c9fd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004187.3(KDM5C):c.202dup (p.Arg68ProfsTer7)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10419736"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15586325","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"In families with nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (NS-XLMR), >30% of mutations seem to cluster on proximal Xp and in the pericentric region. In a systematic screen of brain-expressed genes from this region in 210 families with XLMR, we identified seven different mutations in JARID1C, including one frameshift mutation and two nonsense mutations that introduce premature stop codons, as well as four missense mutations that alter evolutionarily conserved amino acids. In two of these families, expression studies revealed the almost complete absence of the mutated JARID1C transcript, suggesting that the phenotype in these families results from functional loss of the JARID1C protein. JARID1C (Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1C), formerly known as \"SMCX,\" is highly similar to the Y-chromosomal gene JARID1D/SMCY, which encodes the H-Y antigen. The JARID1C protein belongs to the highly conserved ARID protein family. It contains several DNA-binding motifs that link it to transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, processes that are defective in various other forms of mental retardation. Our results suggest that JARID1C mutations are a relatively common cause of XLMR and that this gene might play an important role in human brain function.","dc:creator":"Jensen LR","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Mutations in the JARID1C gene, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, cause X-linked mental retardation."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15586325","rdfs:label":"D034-II-4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This variant exists in ExAC database one time."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:36896d71-1c04-4176-8cd9-16f5b283ef9c_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dae13792-bdb8-4e60-b7ef-7ce231432dc4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:acdf6b31-f3c0-4dda-8e4e-13272dc46afe","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Developmental delay, seizures","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000750","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001347"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:dae13792-bdb8-4e60-b7ef-7ce231432dc4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:585e2857-b7b1-4a5b-a466-764cf9e3c3ed","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004187.3(KDM5C):c.4441_4442del (p.Arg1481GlyfsTer9)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658820924"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18697827","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the JARID1C (Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1C) gene were recently associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR).

KDM5C was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2005 (Jensen et al.). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMID:15586325,18697827). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 30 additional family members. \nMore evidence is available in the literature. The mechanism for disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. \nIn summary,  KDM5C is definitively associated with  X-linked syndromic intellectual disability.
