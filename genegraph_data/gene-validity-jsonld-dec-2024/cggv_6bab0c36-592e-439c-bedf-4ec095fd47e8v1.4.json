In the thymus, IL-7Ra was detected in CD4-8- T cells and also in CD4 or CD8 single-positive cells but not in CD4+8+ double-positive cells. In the peripheral lymphoid tissues, both CD4 and CD8 single-positive cells were the major cell types that express IL-7Ra. Addition of A7R34 to a long-term B-precursor-cell culture inhibited proliferation of the B-lineage cells, indicating that IL-7 is an absolute requirement for in vitro B-cell genesis. Consistent with this in vitro result, continuous injection of A7R34 into an adult mouse resulted in a decrease of B-precursor cells and also of thymocytes, whereas a considerable fraction of mature B and T cells in the peripheral tissues persisted over 2 weeks of the experiment. When A7R34 injection is started from day 14 of gestation, it is possible to produce mice that lack B cells.

In XSCID and SCID resulting from mutations in JAK3, which encodes a Janus family tyrosine kinase that couples to gamma(c) and is required for gamma(c)-dependent signalling, T- and natural killer (NK)-cells are decreased but B-cell numbers are normal (T(-)B(+)NK(-)SCID). Some SCID patients lack T cells but retain NK cells. Given diminished T-cell development in Il7- or Il7r-deficient mice and that Il/7r-deficient mice have NK cells, we hypothesized that T(-)B(+)NK(+) SCID might result from defective IL-7 signalling, although apparent differences in the role of the IL-7/IL-7R pathway in humans and mice in T-cell and B-cell development have been suggested.

KL-mediated activation of Kit induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of gammac and IL-7Ralpha in the absence of IL-7. Activated Kit formed a complex with either IL-7Ralpha or gammac, and tyrosine phosphorylation of both subunits occurred independently of Jak3, suggesting that gammac and IL-7Ralpha are each direct substrates of Kit.

Moreover, deficient Stat5 activation of the Kit mutant YY567/569FF lacking intrinsic Src activation capacity was partially reconstituted in the presence of IL-7R and Jak3.

In humans, although both T-cell and B-cell progenitors express the functional IL-7 receptor that consists of IL-7R alpha and the gamma common (gamma c) chain, this lymphocyte receptor system is critical for T lineage but not for B lineage development. Indeed, complete gamma c deficiency like IL-7R alpha deficiency results in the arrest of T-cell but not B-cell development (T(-)B(+) SCID). However, partial deficiency of gamma c caused by missense mutations results in a T(+)B(+) phenotype and a delay of clinical presentation. It was therefore plausible to assume that partial deficiency of IL-7R alpha, like partial gamma c deficiency may lead to a milder clinical and immunologic phenotype. A P132S mutation in the IL-7R alpha was identified in 3 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) within an extensively consanguineous family. Substitution of proline with serine in the extracellular portion of IL-7R alpha did not affect IL-7R alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, but severely compromised affinity to IL-7, resulting in defective signal transduction. In response to IL-7 stimulation, Jak-3 phosphorylation was markedly reduced in both patient cells as well as in COS cells reconstituted with mutant IL-7R alpha. Surprisingly, this partial deficiency of IL-7R alpha resulted in a severe phenotype, including markedly reduced circulating T cells while sparing B-cell numbers similar to gamma c chain deficiency. However, unlike the previously reported cases, serum immunoglobulins were virtually absent. Further, unlike gamma c deficiency, NK cell numbers and function was preserved. Despite the partial deficiency, clinical presentation was indistinguishable from a complete gamma c deficiency, including severe and persistent viral and protozoal infections and failure to thrive. Unlike partial gamma c deficiency, a partial deficiency of IL-7R alpha results in an arrest of T-cell development, leading to typical severe combined immunodeficiency. This underscores the critical role of IL-7R alpha chain in the differentiation of T cells.

IL7R encodes a receptor for interleukin-7, a glycoprotein which is involved in lymphopoiesis regulation and is essential for the development of T cells. Nine variants (missense, splicing, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in six probands in six publications (PMID: 11023514, 9843216, 19890784, 30778343, 15615257, 26123418) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members. Heterozygous parents and other relatives were unaffected in all reported families. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies showing that IL7R is expressed in murine B and T cell lineages (PMID: 8415665) and IL7R expression is severely decreased to absent in patients with T-B+NK+ SCID (PMID: 9843216). In addition, IL7R interacts with JAK3, which is also associated with a SCID phenotype (PMID: 17554063) and IL7R null mice have a phenotype consistent with T cell lymphopenia  (PMID: 8692964, 7964471). T and B cell deficiency is rescued in IL7Ra deficient mice through introduction of IL7Ra by retroviral transfection (PMID: 16208423). In summary, IL7R is definitively associated with autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency, autosomal recessive, T cell-negative, B cell-positive, NK cell-positive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.Â This classification was approved by the ClinGen (SCID-CID) GCEP on 2/18/2021 (SOP Version 8).
