Panel testing for rasopathies identified a novel HRAS mutation (c.179G>A; p.Gly60Asp) in three individuals with attenuated features of Costello syndrome. De novo paternal origin occurred in two, transmission from a heterozygous mother in the third. Individuals showed subtle facial features; curly hair and relative macrocephaly were seen in three; atrial tachycardia and learning difficulties in two, and pulmonic valve dysplasia and mildly thickened left ventricle in one. None had severe failure to thrive, intellectual disability or cancer, underscoring the need to consider HRAS mutations in individuals with an unspecific rasopathy phenotype.

Targeted oligonucleotide-selective sequencing of 101 cardiomyopathy genes revealed the genetic diagnosis, and the mutation was verified by Sanger sequencing in the patient and her parents. To offer insights into the potential mechanism of patient mutation, protein structural analysis was performed using the resolved structure of human activated HRAS protein with bound GTP analogue (PDB id 5P21) in Discovery Studio 4.5 (Dassault SystÃ¨mes Biovia, San Diego, CA). The patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and normal cognitive development was diagnosed with an HRAS mutation c.173C>T (p.T58I), a milder variant of Costello syndrome affecting a highly conserved amino acid, threonine 58. Our analysis suggests that the p.G12 mutations slow GTP hydrolysis rendering HRAS unresponsive to GTPase activating proteins, and resulting in permanently active state. The p.T58I mutation likely affects binding of guanidine-nucleotide-exchange factors, thereby promoting the active state but also allowing for slow inactivation. Patients with the HRAS mutation c.173C>T (p.T58I) might go undiagnosed because of the milder phenotype compared with other mutations causing Costello syndrome. We expand the clinical and molecular picture of the rare HRAS mutation by reporting the first case in Europe and the fourth case in the literature.

It is caused by heterozygous germline HRAS mutations mostly affecting Gly(12) or Gly(13), which impair HRAS-GTPase activity and result in increased downstream signal flow independent of incoming signals. Functional analyses of rarer HRAS mutations identified in individuals with attenuated Costello syndrome phenotypes revealed altered GDP/GTP nucleotide affinities (p.K117R) and inefficient effector binding (p.E37dup). Thus, both phenotypic and functional variability associated with HRAS mutations are evident. Here, we report on a novel heterozygous HRAS germline mutation (c.187_207dup, p.E63_D69dup) in a girl presenting with a phenotype at the milder end of the Costello syndrome spectrum. The p.E63_D69dup mutation impaired co-precipitation of recombinant HRAS with NF1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) suggesting constitutive HRAS(E63_D69dup) activation due to GAP insensitivity. Indeed, we identified strongly augmented active HRAS(E63_D69dup) that co-precipitated with effectors RAF1, RAL guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator and phospholipase C1. However, we could not pull down active HRAS(E63_D69dup) using the target protein PIK3CA, indicating a compromised association between active HRAS(E63_D69dup) and PIK3CA. Accordingly, overexpression of HRAS(E63_D69dup) increased steady-state phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 downstream of RAF, whereas AKT phosphorylation downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was not enhanced. By analyzing signaling dynamics, we found that HRAS(E63_D69dup) has impaired reagibility to stimuli resulting in reduced and disrupted capacity to transduce incoming signals to the RAF-MAPK and PI3K-AKT cascade, respectively.

CS is caused by HRAS germline mutations. In the majority of cases, mutations affect Gly(12) and Gly(13) and are associated with a relatively homogeneous phenotype. The same amino acid substitutions are well known as somatic mutations in human tumors and promote constitutive HRAS activation by impairing its GTPase activity. In a small number of cases with mild phenotype, a second class of substitutions involving codons 117 and 146 and affecting GTP/GDP binding has been described. Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of two different three-nucleotide duplications resulting in a duplication of glutamate 37 (p.E37dup) associated with a homogeneous phenotype reminiscent of CS. Ectopic expression of HRAS(E37dup) in COS-7 cells resulted in enhanced growth factor-dependent stimulation of the MEK-ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathways. Recombinant HRAS(E37dup) was characterized by slightly increased GTP/GDP dissociation, lower intrinsic GTPase activity and complete resistance to neurofibromin 1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) stimulation due to dramatically reduced binding. Co-precipitation of GTP-bound HRAS(E37dup) by various effector proteins, however, was inefficient because of drastically diminished binding affinities. Thus, although HRAS(E37dup) is predominantly present in the active, GTP-bound state, it promotes only a weak hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways. These findings provide evidence that the mildly enhanced signal flux through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT cascades promoted by these disease-causing germline HRAS alleles results from a balancing effect between a profound GAP insensitivity and inefficient binding to effector proteins.","dc:creator":"Gremer L","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Duplication of Glu37 in the switch I region of HRAS impairs effector/GAP binding and underlies Costello syndrome by promoting enhanced growth factor-dependent MAPK and AKT activation."},"rdfs:label":"NF1 interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Cannot score this because it only implicates the gene's association with a RASopathy, not CS"},{"id":"cggv:fcbe4337-0449-48bd-92c3-1ebe7a6adadc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:69958fc2-e6c5-4ecf-bdcd-fbbdbfd1de13","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Alterations in the RAS pathways cause RASopathies, and alterations to HRAS cause CS,  but this study doesn't explicitly show that HRAS causes CS, just RASopathies","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17979197","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Costello syndrome is a mental retardation syndrome characterized by high birth weight, postnatal growth retardation, coarse face, loose skin, cardiovascular problems, and tumor predisposition.

In 2005, we discovered that heterozygous germline mutations in HRAS caused CS. Several studies have shown that CS-associated HRAS mutations are clustered in codons 12 and 13, and mutations in other codons have also been identified. However, a comprehensive comparison of the substitutions identified in patients with CS has not been conducted. In the current study, we identified four mutations (p.G12S, p.G12A, p.G12C and p.G12D) in 21 patients and analyzed the associated clinical manifestations of CS in these individuals. To examine functional differences among the identified mutations, we characterized a total of nine HRAS mutants, including seven distinct substitutions in codons 12 and 13, p.K117R and p.A146T. The p.A146T mutant demonstrated the weakest Raf-binding activity, and the p.K117R and p.A146T mutants had weaker effects on downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling than did codon 12 or 13 mutants. We demonstrated that these mutant HRAS proteins induced senescence when overexpressed in human fibroblasts. Oncogene-induced senescence is a cellular reaction that controls cell proliferation in response to oncogenic mutation and it has been considered one of the tumor suppression mechanisms in vivo. Our findings suggest that the HRAS mutations identified in CS are sufficient to cause oncogene-induced senescence and that cellular senescence might therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of CS.","dc:creator":"Niihori T","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"HRAS mutants identified in Costello syndrome patients can induce cellular senescence: possible implications for the pathogenesis of Costello syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"HRAS variants in NIH3T3 cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"does not provide differentiating evidence for HRAS and CS as opposed to other RASopathies"},{"id":"cggv:959bac6a-cea7-4933-bb1c-40667fbde24f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e0dc5daf-2a8a-450e-911f-08ff4f779ccc","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Initial findings indicated that CS skin fibroblasts showed an increase in the amount of GTP-bound HRAS when compared to healthy fibroblasts.

HRAS is one of the three classical RAS proteins and cycles between an active, GTP- and an inactive, GDP-bound conformation. We used primary human skin fibroblasts from patients with CS as a model system to study the functional consequences of HRAS mutations on endogenous signaling pathways. The GTP-bound form of HRAS was significantly enriched in CS compared with normal fibroblasts. Active HRAS is known to stimulate both the RAF-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade. Phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was normal in CS fibroblasts under basal conditions and slightly prolonged after epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Interestingly, basal phosphorylation of AKT was increased yet more in CS fibroblasts. Moreover, AKT phosphorylation was diminished in the early and enhanced in the late phase of EGF stimulation. Taken together, these results document that CS-associated HRAS mutations result in prolonged signal flux in a ligand-dependent manner.

We report that a majority of individuals with CS have hypo-mineralization of enamel, the outer covering of teeth, and that similar defects are present in a CS mouse model. Comprehensive analysis of the mouse model revealed that ameloblasts, the cells that generate enamel, lacked polarity, and the ameloblast progenitor cells were hyperproliferative. Ras signals through two main effector cascades, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. To determine through which pathway Ras affects enamel formation, inhibitors targeting either PI3K or MEK 1 and 2 (MEK 1/2), kinases in the MAPK pathway, were utilized. MEK1/2 inhibition rescued the hypo-mineralized enamel, normalized the ameloblast polarity defect and restored normal progenitor cell proliferation. In contrast, PI3K inhibition only corrected the progenitor cell proliferation phenotype.
