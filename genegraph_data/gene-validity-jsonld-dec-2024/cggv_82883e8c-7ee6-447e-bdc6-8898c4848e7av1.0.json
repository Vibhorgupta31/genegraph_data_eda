The disease locus was identified on chromosome 2 by homozygosity mapping; candidate genes were prioritized for their known or predicted mitochondrial localization and then sequenced in probands and controls. A homozygous nonsense mutation in the KIAA0971 gene segregated with the disease in the proband family. The corresponding protein is known as fas activated serine-threonine kinase domain 2, FASTKD2. Confocal immunofluorescence colocalized a tagged recombinant FASTKD2 protein with mitochondrial markers, and membrane-potential-dependent in vitro mitochondrial import was demonstrated in isolated mitochondria. In staurosporine-induced-apoptosis experiments, decreased nuclear fragmentation was detected in treated mutant versus control fibroblasts. In conclusion, we found a loss-of-function mutation in a gene segregating with a peculiar mitochondrial encephalomyopathy associated with COX deficiency in skeletal muscle. The corresponding protein is localized in the mitochondrial inner compartment. Preliminary data indicate that FASTKD2 plays a role in mitochondrial apoptosis.","dc:creator":"Ghezzi D","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"FASTKD2 nonsense mutation in an infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:82883e8c-7ee6-447e-bdc6-8898c4848e7a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3e612a1-770c-4d2e-8d0f-9f70dbcacda2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3e612a1-770c-4d2e-8d0f-9f70dbcacda2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:6676327d-85df-4ee6-96fa-368df44ef1b0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001136193.2(FASTKD2):c.613C>T (p.Arg205Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/870460"}},{"id":"cggv:be00f868-3e7f-4bc0-b0a0-1be79992c4f9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001136193.2(FASTKD2):c.764T>C (p.Leu255Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/870461"}}],"detectionMethod":"Target sequencing of whole mtDNA and 73 nuclear genes.

Cell-based complementation assay revealed that these three FASTKD2 mutations were pathogenic. Mitochondrial functional analysis revealed that mutations in FASTKD2 impaired the mitochondrial function in patient-derived lymphocytes due to the deficiency in multi-OXPHOS complexes, whereas mitochondrial complex II remained unaffected. Consistent results were also found in human primary muscle cell and zebrafish with knockdown of FASTKD2. Furthermore, we discovered that FASTKD2 mutation is not inherently associated with epileptic seizures, optic atrophy, and loss of visual function. Alternatively, a patient with FASTKD2 mutation can show sinus tachycardia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which was partially confirmed in zebrafish with knockdown of FASTKD2. In conclusion, both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that loss of function mutation in FASTKD2 is responsible for multi-OXPHOS complexes deficiency, and FASTKD2-associated mitochondrial disease has a high degree of clinical heterogenicity.","dc:creator":"Wei X","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Mutations in FASTKD2 are associated with mitochondrial disease with multi-OXPHOS deficiency."}},{"id":"cggv:8c286999-9c65-4d28-9ae3-288b7c54998c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:24e7f597-2496-4261-8017-2af14300eb73"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31944455"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 3"},{"id":"cggv:8c286999-9c65-4d28-9ae3-288b7c54998c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8c286999-9c65-4d28-9ae3-288b7c54998c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:8c286999-9c65-4d28-9ae3-288b7c54998c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"exon 3 of 12, NMD expected"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:d70e5987-2552-4d85-afa4-b3c1535b9cbf","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d70e5987-2552-4d85-afa4-b3c1535b9cbf_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d70e5987-2552-4d85-afa4-b3c1535b9cbf_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"p.Ser621LeufsTer14: exon 10 of 12 position 48 of 85 NMD may not be expected.

Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Review"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Disorders of the mitoribosome, >10 genes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:82883e8c-7ee6-447e-bdc6-8898c4848e7a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c7b8c06-5abe-4b0f-a28c-dd2b35cf93aa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7466bc11-1bbc-4864-b30b-ae09fc7a3763","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fig 4. iCRISPR mediated knock out (null) and siRNA mediated knockdown (85%) FASTKD2 in stably transduced HEK293 cells.

RNA interactome capture identified several disease-relevant RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with noncanonical RNA-binding architectures, including all six members of the FASTK (FAS-activated serine/threonine kinase) family of proteins. A mutation within one of these newly assigned FASTK RBPs, FASTKD2, causes a rare form of Mendelian mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. To investigate whether RNA binding of FASTKD2 contributes to the disease phenotype, we identified the RNA targets of FASTKD2 by iCLIP. FASTKD2 interacts with a defined set of mitochondrial transcripts including 16S ribosomal RNA (RNR2) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) messenger RNA. CRISPR-mediated deletion of FASTKD2 leads to aberrant processing and expression of RNR2 and ND6 mRNA that encodes a subunit of the respiratory complex I. Metabolic phenotyping of FASTKD2-deficient cells reveals impaired cellular respiration with reduced activities of all respiratory complexes.

The *FASTKD2* gene encodes the FAST kinase domain-containing protein 2, an RNA-binding protein required for mitochondrial RNA processing and translation. \n\nThe *FASTKD2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18771761). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *FASTKD2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *FASTKD2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique variants reported in six cases from four publications (PMIDs: 18771761, 31944455, 28499982, 34234304). Insufficient clinical data were available to include two additional reports in this curation (PMIDs: 30831263, 25497598). Variants included four nonsense, two frameshift, and one missense. The condition was first described in two similarly affected siblings from consanguineous Bedouin family who presented with a severe encephalomyopathy including asymmetrical brain atrophy, developmental delay, fixed contractures, bilateral optic atrophy and elevated serum lactate. A subsequent publication reported three additional probands with a similar early onset, severe, multisystem disorder (PMID: 31944455). Two cases with a later onset disease have also been reported in the literature. One case was a male with  syndrome resembling mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and an onset of disease at 15 years, the other a female with an onset of a cerebellar ataxia phenotype at the age of 42 years (PMIDs: 28499982, 34234304).  This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mitochondrial RNA processing for translation) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and biochemical evidence from patient derived lymphoblast cell lines (PMID: 31944455).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *FASTKD2* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 21, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:82883e8c-7ee6-447e-bdc6-8898c4848e7a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
