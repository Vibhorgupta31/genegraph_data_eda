Metabolite abnormalities described to date in HMCS2 deficiency are nonspecific and overlap with other inborn errors of metabolism, making the biochemical diagnosis of HMCS2 deficiency difficult. Urinary organic acid profiles from periods of metabolic decompensation were studied in detail in HMCS2-deficient patients from four families. An additional six unrelated patients were identified from clinical presentation and/or qualitative identification of abnormal organic acids. The diagnosis was confirmed by sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis of the HMGCS2 gene. Seven related novel organic acids were identified in urine profiles. Five of them (3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic 1,5 lactone; trans-5-hydroxyhex-2-enoate; 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone; 5-hydroxy-3-ketohexanoate; 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate) were identified by comparison with synthesized or commercial authentic compounds. We provisionally identified trans-3-hydroxyhex-4-enoate and 3-hydroxy-5-ketohexanoate by their mass spectral characteristics. These metabolites were found in samples taken during periods of decompensation and normalized when patients recovered. When cutoffs of adipic >200 and 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone >20 μmol/mmol creatinine were applied, all eight samples taken from five HMCS2-deficient patients during episodes of decompensation were flagged with a positive predictive value of 80% (95% confidence interval 35-100%). Some ketotic patients had increased 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone. Molecular studies identified a total of 12 novel mutations, including a large deletion of HMGCS2 exon 1 in two families, highlighting the need to perform quantitative gene analyses. There are now 26 known HMGCS2 mutations, which are reviewed in the text. 4-Hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone and related metabolites are markers for HMCS2 deficiency. Detection of these metabolites will streamline the biochemical diagnosis of this disorder.","dc:creator":"Pitt JJ","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase deficiency: urinary organic acid profiles and expanded spectrum of mutations."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25511235","rdfs:label":"B3-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"No functional study on the missense variant"},{"id":"cggv:bb00f4be-c9cf-4d09-b411-d2b8c20a3ad1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c8b573f-3a68-426a-a819-aafbd1b0aa92","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"acute metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemic hypoketotic coma","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001985","obo:HP_0001942"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:bb00f4be-c9cf-4d09-b411-d2b8c20a3ad1_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:42808839-8edd-4d58-b392-bd714282a7cf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005518.3(HMGCS2):c.634G>A (p.Gly212Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA120256"}},{"id":"cggv:f3be4da5-bfa6-4a79-9d2f-2b2de7756fd9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000001.11:g.119764300_119764301del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658761352"}}],"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25511235"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25511235","rdfs:label":"B2-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"A functional study by Ramos 2013 (PMID 23751782) showed that the missense mutation p.G212R did not produce proteins that could have been detected in soluble form by western blot"},{"id":"cggv:4c545a67-8e8f-4c4c-b41e-4a74208389ef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4da26aa0-7715-481a-8807-ba1855c70bd9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"phenotypeFreeText":"After fasting for 22 hours, the patient had a blood  glucose concentration of 41 mg per deciliter (2.3  mmol per liter) and a plasma  beta-hydroxybutyrate  concentration of 0.2 mmol per liter (normal,  greater than  2.0).

We present clinical follow-up and molecular analysis of the two known mHS-deficient patients. The diagnosis of mHS deficiency is challenging because the symptoms and metabolite pattern are not specific. Moreover, enzyme analysis is technically difficult and requires sampling of an expressing organ such as liver. The patients, now aged 16 and 6 y, have normal development and have had no further decompensations since diagnosis. Patient 1 is homozygous for a phenylalanine-to-leucine substitution at codon 174 (F174L). Interestingly, although the F174 residue is conserved in vertebrate mHS and cytoplasmic HS isozymes, a Leu residue is predicted in the corresponding position of HS-like sequences from Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Brassica juncea. Bacterial expression of human F174L-mHS produces a low level of mHS polypeptide with no detectable activity. Similarly, in purified cytoplasmic HS, which in contrast to purified human mHS is stable and can be studied in detail, the corresponding F-->L substitution causes a 10,000-fold decrease in V(max) and a 5-fold reduction in thermal stability. Patient 2 is a genetic compound of a premature termination mutation, R424X, and an as-yet uncharacterized mutant allele that is distinguishable by intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms that we describe. Molecular studies of mHS are useful in patients with a suggestive clinical presentation.","dc:creator":"Bouchard L","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase deficiency: clinical course and description of causal mutations in two patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11228257","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Bacterial expression of human F174L mutant produces a low level of mitocondrial HMG-CoA synthase polypeptide with no detectable activity.

The patient recovered well under intravenous glucose infusion. Enzyme studies in fibroblasts showed normal beta-oxidation capacity. A monitored fasting test was performed, leading to hypoglycaemia (blood glucose 2.3 mmol/l) 12 h after the last meal. At this time, there was massive elevation of plasma free fatty acids (3290 µmol/l, norm: <300 µmol/l) without concomitant elevation of total plasma ketones (174 µmol/l, norm: <150 µmol/l, in fasting: >1500 µmol/l). Blood lactate, insulin and transaminases were within normal ranges. Urinary organic acids again showed massive dicarboxylic aciduria without adequate ketonuria; acylcarnitines in dried blood spots were normal. The patient was started on carnitine (100 mg/kg body weight) and the family was advised to avoid fasting for more than 8 h and to administer a caloric drink at around midnight. Under this regimen, there were no subsequent hypoglycaemic episodes and, at present, the child (4 years old) is developing normally with no residual neurological impairment.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0002240"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:2f8e0d00-7d54-4de9-bc76-38adb9adcf65_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:42808839-8edd-4d58-b392-bd714282a7cf"},{"id":"cggv:55948608-8d48-4129-a09d-af25b12c5177","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166107.1(HMGCS2):c.1373G>A (p.Arg458His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/9260"}}],"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11479731","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Deficiency of mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (mHMGS) is a recessive disorder of ketogenesis that has been previously diagnosed in two children with hypoglycaemic hypoketotic coma during fasting periods.

To date, eight patients have been reported with nine allelic variants of the HMGCS2 gene. We present a new method of enzyme expression and a modification of the activity assay that allows, for first time, the functional study of missense mutations found in patients with this deficiency. Four of the missense mutations (p.V54M, p.R188H, p.G212R and p.G388R) did not produce proteins that could have been detected in soluble form by western blot; three produced a total loss of activity (p.Y167C, p.M307T and p.R500H) and one, variant p.F174L, gave an enzyme with a catalytic efficiency of 11.5%. This indicates that the deficiency may occur with partial loss of activity of enzyme. In addition, we describe a new patient with this deficiency, in which we detected the missense allelic variant, c.1162G>A (p.G388R) and the nonsense variant c.1270C>T (p.R424X).","dc:creator":"Ramos M","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"New case of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase deficiency.

The nucleotide sequence of the human mHS cDNA encodes a mature mHS peptide of 471 residues, with a mean amino acid identity of 66.5% with cHS from mammals and chicken. Comparative analysis of all known mHS and cHS protein and DNA sequences shows a high degree of conservation near the N-terminus that decreases progressively toward the C-terminus and suggests that the two isozymes arose from a common ancestor gene 400-900 million years ago. Comparison of the gene structure of mHS and cHS is also consistent with a recent duplication event. We hypothesize that the physiologic result of the HS gene duplication was the appearance of HS within the mitochondria around the time of emergence of early vertebrates, which linked preexisting pathways of beta oxidation and leucine catabolism and created the HMG CoA pathway of ketogenesis, thus providing a lipid-derived energy source for the vertebrate brain.","dc:creator":"Boukaftane Y","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Human mitochondrial HMG CoA synthase: liver cDNA and partial genomic cloning, chromosome mapping to 1p12-p13, and possible role in vertebrate evolution."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in different human tissues"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b3f49254-4635-4961-83b9-31c7ebc7f159_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a1a5705f-562c-4f7c-b0fa-383c335f9217","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:60fd552f-6dea-46f8-b4df-6e76fd02782e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Wild type enzyme can induce fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant C166A did not generate either process.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21502324","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"HMGCS2 (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase 2), the gene that regulates ketone body production, is barely expressed in cultured cell lines.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α expression also induces fatty acid β-oxidation and endogenous HMGCS2 expression. Interestingly, PPARα-mediated induction was abolished when HMGCS2 expression was down-regulated by RNAi. These results indicate that HMGCS2 expression is both sufficient and necessary to the control of fatty acid oxidation in these cells. Next, we examined the expression pattern of several PPARα target genes in this now \"ketogenic\" HepG2 cell line. FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) expression was specifically induced by HMGCS2 activity or by the inclusion of the oxidized form of ketone bodies (acetoacetate) in the culture medium. This effect was blunted by SirT1 (sirtuin 1) RNAi, so we propose a SirT1-dependent mechanism for FGF21 induction by acetoacetate. These data suggest a novel feed-forward mechanism by which HMGCS2 could regulate adaptive metabolic responses during fasting.
