The predominance of autosomal-recessive causes allowed us to make several key observations. We highlight 155 genes that we propose to be recessive, disease-related candidates. We report additional mutational events in 64 previously reported candidates (40 recessive), and these events support their candidacy. We report recessive forms of genes that were previously associated only with dominant disorders and that have phenotypes ranging from consistent with to conspicuously distinct from the known dominant phenotypes. We also report homozygous loss-of-function events that can inform the genetics of complex diseases. We were also able to deduce the likely causal variant in most couples who presented after the loss of one or more children, but we lack samples from those children. Although a similar pattern of mostly recessive causes was observed in the prenatal setting, the higher proportion of loss-of-function events in these cases was notable. The allelic series presented by the wealth of recessive variants greatly expanded the phenotypic expression of the respective genes. We also make important observations about dominant disorders; these observations include the pattern of de novo variants, the identification of 74 candidate dominant, disease-related genes, and the potential confirmation of 21 previously reported candidates. Finally, we describe the influence of a predominantly autosomal-recessive landscape on the clinical utility of rapid sequencing (Flash Exome). Our cohort's genotypic and phenotypic data represent a unique resource that can contribute to improved variant interpretation through data sharing.","dc:creator":"Monies D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Lessons Learned from Large-Scale, First-Tier Clinical Exome Sequencing in a Highly Consanguineous Population."}},"rdfs:label":"Monies 17-8679"},{"id":"cggv:3760a54f-8c8f-4c63-8981-0d2e6313f2ca","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3760a54f-8c8f-4c63-8981-0d2e6313f2ca_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9300229b-d498-43e1-a79d-ec4a846796c1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9300229b-d498-43e1-a79d-ec4a846796c1","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:92f64ae8-5593-43a5-a583-0bd36414bbf1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006030.4(CACNA2D2):c.3119T>C (p.Leu1040Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130795"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0032867","obo:HP_0001319","obo:HP_0002072","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0012430","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000817","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0008936","obo:HP_0012736"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0 performed on family member 3111","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:e717abdd-047e-4daf-932d-60e25987318e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:92f64ae8-5593-43a5-a583-0bd36414bbf1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23339110"},"rdfs:label":"Edvardson 3111"},{"id":"cggv:e717abdd-047e-4daf-932d-60e25987318e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e717abdd-047e-4daf-932d-60e25987318e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e717abdd-047e-4daf-932d-60e25987318e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Expression of the mutant gene in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed reduction of current density of both N and L type calcium channels.

To date only one CACNA2D2 mutation altering channel functionality has been identified in a single family. In the same family, a rare CELSR3 polymorphism also segregated with disease. Involvement of CACNA2D2 in EE is therefore not confirmed, while that of CELSR3 is questionable. In a patient with epilepsy, dyskinesia, cerebellar atrophy, psychomotor delay and dysmorphic features, offspring to consanguineous parents, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) for homozygosity mapping and mutation detection. WES identified extended autozygosity on chromosome 3, containing two novel homozygous candidate mutations: c.1295delA (p.Asn432fs) in CACNA2D2 and c.G6407A (p.Gly2136Asp) in CELSR3. Gene prioritization pointed to CACNA2D2 as the most prominent candidate gene. The WES finding in CACNA2D2 resulted to be statistically significant (p = 0.032), unlike that in CELSR3. CACNA2D2 homozygous c.1295delA essentially abolished α2δ-2 expression. In summary, we identified a novel null CACNA2D2 mutation associated to a clinical phenotype strikingly similar to the Cacna2d2 null mouse model. Molecular and statistical analyses together argued in favor of a causal contribution of CACNA2D2 mutations to EE, while suggested that finding in CELSR3, although potentially damaging, is likely

myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) comprise a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous rare diseases. Over 70% of PME cases can now be molecularly solved. Known PME genes encode a variety of proteins, many involved in lysosomal and endosomal function. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 84 (78 unrelated) unsolved PME-affected individuals, with or without additional family members, to discover novel causes. We identified likely disease-causing variants in 24 out of 78 (31%) unrelated individuals, despite previous genetic analyses. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher for individuals studied as trios or families (14/28) versus singletons (10/50) (OR = 3.9, p value = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). The 24 likely solved cases of PME involved 18 genes. First, we found and functionally validated five heterozygous variants in NUS1 and DHDDS and a homozygous variant in ALG10, with no previous disease associations. All three genes are involved in dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation, a pathway not previously implicated in PME. Second, we independently validate SEMA6B as a dominant PME gene in two unrelated individuals. Third, in five families, we identified variants in established PME genes; three with intronic or copy-number changes (CLN6, GBA, NEU1) and two very rare causes (ASAH1, CERS1). Fourth, we found a group of genes usually associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, but here, remarkably, presenting as PME, with or without prior developmental delay. Our systematic analysis of these cases suggests that the small residuum of unsolved cases will most likely be a collection of very rare, genetically heterogeneous etiologies.","dc:creator":"Courage C","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Progressive myoclonus epilepsies-Residual unsolved cases have marked genetic heterogeneity including dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation pathway genes."}},{"id":"cggv:2a63b60f-a54f-437d-babe-5f2bf75f4929_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1cee28d1-eae2-4482-81fc-c18f7520359c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33798445"}],"rdfs:label":"Courage PME19"},{"id":"cggv:d36671b3-5277-4e8e-abff-f9a06acc42b1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d36671b3-5277-4e8e-abff-f9a06acc42b1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Did not score these variants because phase was not confirmed and functional studies were not performed for the de novo synonymous variant."},{"id":"cggv:2a63b60f-a54f-437d-babe-5f2bf75f4929","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2a63b60f-a54f-437d-babe-5f2bf75f4929_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Did not score these variants because phase was not confirmed and functional studies were not performed for the de novo synonymous variant."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:9b494f2c-9dd8-4862-a117-0e0d5d96f20e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9b494f2c-9dd8-4862-a117-0e0d5d96f20e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:184eff88-c6e7-4852-b1bc-8b4b4a96b9bf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006030.4(CACNA2D2):c.782C>T (p.Pro261Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA352939391"}},{"id":"cggv:711634ec-b162-4d83-993a-10488fa14fbb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006030.4(CACNA2D2):c.3137T>C (p.Leu1046Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA352900737"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0000496","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002540","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001337","obo:HP_0100275","obo:HP_0001263"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Previous biochemical testing was nondiagnostic.

The underlying mutation was mapped to chromosome 9 (60.1 centimorgans) and identified as an allele of the Cacna2d2 gene encoding the alpha2delta-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. The Cacna2d2entla allele harbors a 38-kb duplication comprising the 117 nucleotides of exon 3. The predicted duplication of 39 amino acid residues near the subunit's N terminus results in the expression of a full-length, membrane-associated protein. Western blot data were consistent with correct cleavage of the alpha2delta-2entla precursor into alpha2entla and delta2 proteins but indicated loss of the disulfide linkage between the two proteins. ent/ent mice develop ataxia by postnatal day 13-15, followed by paroxysmal dyskinesia a few days later. Two distinct types of cortical and hippocampal epileptic activity at 2 and 4 Hz were recorded, indicative of absence epilepsy. Homozygotes display reduced size and weight, increased mortality before weaning, and female infertility. No overt neuroanatomical abnormalities were detected. Ca2+ current densities recorded from acutely dissociated Purkinje cells of homozygous entla animals were reduced by 50% compared with wild type. Ligand binding assays using the antiepileptic drug [3H]gabapentin, a specific ligand of the alpha2delta-1 and alpha2delta-2 subunits, revealed a >60% reduced maximum binding to cerebellar membranes of ent/ent compared with unaffected littermates. entla is allelic to ducky and ducky2J, representing the third murine Cacna2d2 allele identified and so far the only one encoding an untruncated protein that is incorporated into membranes.","dc:creator":"Brill J","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"entla, a novel epileptic and ataxic Cacna2d2 mutant of the mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model: entla"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:efa33f91-abd6-41a3-93ba-4b4a7eb47517","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eaecab4e-bec1-44cc-b569-04a673dbc9fc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both have epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia.

A mutation in Cacna2d2, the gene encoding the alpha 2 delta-2 voltage-dependent calcium channel accessory subunit, has been found to underlie the ducky phenotype. The alpha 2 delta-2 mRNA is strongly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. We show that du/du mice have abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic tree. The mutation in alpha 2 delta-2 results in the introduction of a premature stop codon and predicts the expression of a truncated protein encoded by the first three exons of Cacna2d2, followed by 8 novel amino acids. We show that both mRNA and protein corresponding to this predicted transcript are expressed in du/du cerebellum and present in Purkinje cells. Whereas the alpha 2 delta-2 subunit increased the peak current density of the Ca(V)2.1/beta(4) channel combination when co-expressed in vitro, co-expression with the truncated mutant alpha 2 delta-2 protein reduced current density, indicating that it may contribute to the du phenotype.","dc:creator":"Brodbeck J","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"The ducky mutation in Cacna2d2 results in altered Purkinje cell morphology and is associated with the expression of a truncated alpha 2 delta-2 protein with abnormal function."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model: ducky or du/du "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":7565,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":10.6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:abf39795-b417-4ef4-a77c-618afc8b6823","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100038","gene":"hgnc:1400","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"Biallelic *CACNA2D2* variants were first reported in individuals with epilepsy, global developmental delay, and cerebellar atrophy in 2013 (Edvardson et al., PMID: 23339110). Some patients with biallelic variants in *CACNA2D2* have also been reported with motor features like ataxia, dysmetria, and dysarthria in addition to seizures and cerebellar atrophy (PMID: 31402629, 30410802). Given the broad neurodevelopmental phenotypes present in these individuals, we have chosen to curate this gene-disease relationship under the disease term complex neurodevelopmental disorder (MONDO:0100038).\n\nTen variants (two frameshift, one synonymous, and seven missense) reported in eight probands across seven publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 23339110, 24358150, 29997391, 30410802, 31402629, 33798445, 31130284). Of note, one individual with compound heterozygous missense and synonymous variants in *CACNA2D2* was not scored, as the phase of their variants was not confirmed (PMID: 33798445). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by two mouse models (PMIDs: 11756448, 14660671). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *CACNA2D2* and autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.
