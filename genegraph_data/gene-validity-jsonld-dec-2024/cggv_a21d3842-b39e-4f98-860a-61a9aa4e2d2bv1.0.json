They mediate the import and insertion of hydrophobic membrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane.

So far, the only missense mutation known to cause a full-blown clinical phenotype is a C66W exchange directly affecting this Cys(4) motif. Here, we show that the mutant human protein is efficiently imported into mitochondria and sorted into the intermembrane space. In contrast to wild-type DDP1, it does not complement the function of its yeast homologue Tim8. The C66W mutation impairs binding of Zn(2+) ions via the Cys(4) motif. As a consequence, the mutated DDP1 is incorrectly folded and loses its ability to assemble into a hetero-hexameric 70-kDa complex with its cognate partner protein human Tim13.

The majority of patients have progression or generalization of their dystonia regardless of age of onset. Within our 3 kindreds, we observed relative intrafamilial homogeneity but interfamilial variation.

In the most extensively studied Norwegian family, the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome was reported to be caused by a one-basepair deletion (151delT) in the deafness/dystonia peptide (DDP) gene at Xq22. This gene has been renamed TIMM8a. We identified a stop mutation (E24X) in the TIMM8a gene segregating with the disease in the original Danish family with the Jensen syndrome, which confirms that the two disorders are allelic conditions. We also report abnormal VEP examinations and neuropathological abnormalities in affected males from the two unrelated families with different mutations. The findings included neuronal cell loss in the optic nerve, retina, striate cortex, basal ganglia, and dorsal roots of the spinal cord. The demonstration of mitochondrial abnormalities in skeletal muscle biopsies in some patients is compatible with the suggestion from recent research that the TIMM8a protein is the human counterpart of an intermembrane mitochondrial transport protein, Tim8p, recently characterized in yeast. The clinical and neuropathological abnormalities associated with mutations in the TIMM8a gene support that this X-linked deafness-dystonia-optic neuropathy syndrome is an example of progressive neurodegeneration due to mutations in a nuclear gene necessary for some, yet unknown mitochondrial transport function.

Previously reported mutations in the DDP gene have all been frameshifts/nonsense mutations or deletion of the entire gene as part of a larger deletion encompassing the BTK gene. The clinical presentation was uniformly characterised by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental deterioration, paranoid psychotic features, and optic atrophy, indicating progressive neurodegeneration. Our report illustrates that de novo mutations occur and that a missense mutation, C66W, may cause an equally severe clinical picture. The diagnosis of sensorineural hearing impairment associated with neurologic and visual disability in a male, therefore, should encourage the search for mutations in the DDP gene, even in sporadic cases. The association of deafness-dystonia syndrome with a missense mutation provides valuable information for in vitro investigations of the functional properties of the deafness-dystonia peptide which was recently shown to be the human homolog of a yeast protein, Tim8p, belonging to a family of small Tim proteins involved in intermembrane protein transport in mitochondria.","dc:creator":"Tranebjaerg L","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"A de novo missense mutation in a critical domain of the X-linked DDP gene causes the typical deafness-dystonia-optic atrophy syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10878669","rdfs:label":"Tranebjaerg_1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:83fbd45a-494c-4ceb-b17f-d935c6a4fe78_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c78366c-c2e8-4a98-96ed-58ec9e844730","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"","phenotypeFreeText":"Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome- deafness and dystonia\n34-year-old man, had apparently normal\npsychomotor development until the age of 3 years, when\nhe was diagnosed with progressive sensorineural deafness\nattributed to an ototoxic drug.

A Mohr-Tranebjaerg patient and his mother were subjected to clinical and molecular studies. Screening of mutations were performed in TIMM8A, TIMM13, and other mitochondrial protein transport genes by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE), followed by direct DNA sequencing of tissue samples from the patient. Mitochondrial DNA of the patient was also sequenced at the genes for COX subunits and some mitochondrial tRNAs. Respiratory chain activities in a muscle biopsy and cultured fibroblasts from the patient were assessed using biochemical methods. mRNA expression of TIMM8A and TIMM13 was determined by RT-PCR in cultured fibroblasts. We identified a new case of Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome and report the characteristics of a new pathogenic de novo mutation (c.112C>T, pGln38X) in the TIMM8A gene. Biochemical measures of respiratory chain complex activities in muscle biopsy and fibroblasts did not show a major deficiency or alteration. mRNA expression studies demonstrated increased TIMM8A mRNA levels in cultured fibroblasts from the patient. Phenotypic differences among published cases seem not to be related with the mutation location or type. Our results support the idea that dysfunctions of mitochondrial protein transport, in addition to OXPHOS deficiency, can be the basis of important mitochondrial pathologies.","dc:creator":"Blesa JR","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Molecular genetics of a patient with Mohr-Tranebjaerg Syndrome due to a new mutation in the DDP1 gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17999202","rdfs:label":"Blesa 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Variant is de novo and null variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":661,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:6a39b76d-8ec7-4b91-b785-2817f9457f82","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010578","gene":"hgnc:11817","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The TIMM8A gene has been associated with X-linked deafness dystonia syndrome (aka Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome) using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 8/18/2017. This association was made using case-level data and experimental data. At least 6 probands in 5 publications with at least 8 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans, and variants in this gene segregated with disease in 17 additional family members (PMIDs 11803487, 22736418, 18952432, 17999202). TIMM8A was first associated with this disease in humans in 2000 (Tranebjaerg et al.). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is X-linked LOF. This gene-disease association is supported by functional alteration studies in isolated patient cells as well as non patient cells and expression studies (PMIDs: 11956200, 15254020). In summary, TIMM8A is definitively associated with X-linked deafness dystonia syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 12/19/2017.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a21d3842-b39e-4f98-860a-61a9aa4e2d2b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
