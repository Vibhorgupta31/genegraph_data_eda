However, mutations in the known CRC-susceptibility genes explain CRC risk in fewer than 10% of affected individuals. Germline mutations in DNA-repair genes (DRGs) have recently been reported in CRC, but their contribution to CRC risk is largely unknown. We evaluated the gene-level germline mutation enrichment of 40 DRGs in 680 unselected CRC individuals and 27,728 ancestry-matched cancer-free adults. Significant findings were then examined in independent cohorts of 1,661 unselected CRC individuals and 1,456 individuals with early-onset CRC. Of the 680 individuals in the discovery set, 31 (4.56%) individuals harbored germline pathogenic mutations in known CRC-susceptibility genes, and another 33 (4.85%) individuals had DRG mutations that have not been previously associated with CRC risk. Germline pathogenic mutations in ATM and PALB2 were enriched in both the discovery (OR = 2.81 and p = 0.035 for ATM and OR = 4.91 and p = 0.024 for PALB2) and validation (OR = 2.97 and adjusted p = 0.0013 for ATM and OR = 3.42 and adjusted p = 0.034 for PALB2) sets. Biallelic loss of ATM was evident in all individuals with matched tumor profiling. CRC individuals also had higher rates of actionable mutations in the HR pathway, which can substantially increase the risk of developing cancers other than CRC. Our analysis provides evidence for ATM and PALB2 as CRC-risk genes, underscoring the importance of the homologous recombination pathway in CRC. In addition, we identified frequent complete homologous recombination deficiency in CRC tumors, representing a unique opportunity to explore targeted therapeutic interventions such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi).","dc:creator":"AlDubayan SH","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Inherited DNA-Repair Defects in Colorectal Cancer."},"rdfs:label":"Case-Control Discovery Cohort (S Figure 5)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","dc:description":"PLEASE NOTE: The number of variant carriers in case and control populations was not provided.

In the MUTYH-null cells carrying no adenine DNA glycosylase activity, the spontaneous mutation rate increased 2-fold in comparison with wild type cells. The expression of wild type mMUTYH or mutant mMUTYH protein with amino acid substitutions at the proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding motif restored the increased spontaneous mutation rates of the MUTYH-null ES cells to the wild type level. The expression of a mutant mMUTYH protein with an amino acid substitution (G365D) that corresponds to a germ-line mutation (G382D) found in patients with multiple colorectal adenomas could not suppress the elevated spontaneous mutation rate of the MUTYH-null ES cells. Although the recombinant mMUTYH(G365D) purified from Escherichia coli cells had a substantial level of adenine DNA glycosylase activity as did wild type MUTYH, no adenine DNA glycosylase activity was detected in the MUTYH-null ES cells expressing the mMUTYH(G365D) mutant protein.

The impact on genetic instability of the p.Tyr179Cys and p.Arg245His MUTYH variants was evaluated in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from MAP patients and their relatives in comparison to wild-type LCLs. No difference in MUTYH expression was identified between wild type and LCLs with the p.Tyr179Cys, while the p.Arg245His mutation was associated with an unstable MUTYH protein. LCLs homozygous for the p.Tyr179Cys or the p.Arg245His variant contained increased DNA 8-oxodG levels and exhibited a mutator phenotype at the PIG-A gene. The extent of the increased spontaneous mutation frequency was 3-fold (range 1.6- to 4.6-fold) in four independent LCLs carrying the p.Tyr179Cys variant, while a larger increase (6-fold) was observed in two p.Arg245His LCLs. A similar hypermutability and S-phase delay following treatment with KBrO3 was observed in LCLs homozygous for either variant. When genetic instability was investigated in monoallelic p.Arg245His carriers, mutant frequencies showed an increase which is intermediate between wild-type and homozygous cells, whereas the mutator effect in heterozygous p.Tyr179Cys LCLs was similar to that in homozygotes. These findings indicate that the type of MUTYH mutation can affect the extent of genome instability associated with MUTYH inactivation.

Recently, biallelic germ-line mutations of MUTYH have been found in patients predisposed to a recessive form of hereditary multiple colorectal adenoma and carcinoma with an increased incidence of G:C to T:A somatic mutations in the APC gene. In the present study, a systematic histologic examination revealed that more spontaneous tumors had developed in MUTYH-null mice (72 of 121; 59.5%) than in the wild type (38 of 109; 34.9%). The increased incidence of intestinal tumors in MUTYH-null mice (11 tumors in 10 of 121 mice) was statistically significant compared with the wild type (no intestinal tumors in 109 mice). Two adenomas and seven adenocarcinomas were observed in the small intestines, and two adenomas but no carcinomas were found in the colons. In MUTYH-null mice treated with KBrO(3), the occurrence of small intestinal tumors dramatically increased. The mean number of polyps induced in the small intestines of these mice was 61.88 (males, 72.75; females, 51.00), whereas it was 0.85 (males, 0.50; females, 1.00) in wild-type mice. The tumors developed predominantly in the duodenum and in the upper region of the (jejunum) small intestines.

Monoallelic germline MUTYH variants were first reported in relation to colorectal cancer (MONDO:0005575) in 2004 (Croitoru et al., PMID: 15523092). Of note, bi-allelic variants in MUTYH are associated with autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis 2 (MONDO:0012041). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split the association of MUTYH and recessive familial adenomatous polyposis 2 in another curation due to phenotypic differences and inheritance mechanism. \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 3 points** \nGiven the potential for phenocopies due to the high population incidence of colorectal cancer, case-level reports were not scored for this curation. Instead, case-control studies and cohort studies were considered the strongest form of genetic evidence. In total, four case-control studies and one cohort study were included in this curation. The case-control studies included meta-analyses, aggregate variant analyses and single variant analyses. Some studies suggested a slightly increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers compared to controls (PMID: 21063410,  24444654, 23946381) and other studies suggested no increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers (29478780, 33309985).   \n\n**Summary of Experimental Data: 3 points**\nThere is experimental evidence showing a role for MUTYH in DNA repair (base excision and mismatch repair) pathways, including a null mouse model (PMID: 17638869) which is also a model for the recessive disorder, and in vitro functional studies (PMIDs: 24569162, 15199168, 11801590). \n\n**Overall Summary**\nIn summary, given that case-control studies show either a slightly increased risk, or no increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers, and limited experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role MUTYH plays in autosomal dominant colorectal cancer. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated (in relation to autosomal dominant familial adenomatous polyposis 2) as moderate by the Colon Cancer GCEP on 10/09/2017.
