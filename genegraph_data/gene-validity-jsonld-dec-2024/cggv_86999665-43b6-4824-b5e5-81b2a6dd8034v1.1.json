However, the specific role of ELMOD3 in auditory function is still far from being elucidated. In the present study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to establish an Elmod3 knockout mice line in the C57BL/6 background (hereinafter referred to as Elmod3-/- mice) and investigated the role of Elmod3 in the cochlea and auditory function. Elmod3-/- mice started to exhibit hearing loss from 2Â months of age, and the deafness progressed with aging, while the vestibular function of Elmod3-/- mice was normal. We also observed that Elmod3-/- mice showed thinning and receding hair cells in the organ of Corti and much lower expression of F-actin cytoskeleton in the cochlea compared with wild-type mice. The deafness associated with the mutation may be caused by cochlear hair cells dysfunction, which manifests with shortening and fusion of inner hair cells stereocilia and progressive degeneration of outer hair cells stereocilia. Our finding associates Elmod3 deficiencies with stereocilia dysmorphologies and reveals that they might play roles in the actin cytoskeleton dynamics in cochlear hair cells, and thus relate to hearing impairment.","dc:creator":"Li W","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Elmod3 knockout leads to progressive hearing loss and abnormalities in cochlear hair cell stereocilia."},"rdfs:label":"Li_Expression "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84af927b-c005-43eb-a022-d57f00840fc9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b0a1c3c-dbd2-472a-8575-73bbe038e80c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Heterozygous mice were evaluated up to two months of age and did not display any hearing loss.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31628468","rdfs:label":"Li_ELMOD3 KO mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Heterozygous mice were evaluated up to two months of age and did not display any hearing loss.

At least one missense variant has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and expression data. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been assessed separately. Summary of Case Level Data: 0.5 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication and segregated with disease in 4 additional family members (Li et al., PMID: 29713870). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies. Of note, the heterozygous *ELMOD3* null mouse does not display a phenotype and was not scored. (Li et al 2019 PMID:31628468). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 11.17.21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
