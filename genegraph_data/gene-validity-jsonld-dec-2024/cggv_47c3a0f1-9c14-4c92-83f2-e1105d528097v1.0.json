NPHP may be associated with Leber congenital amaurosis, tapeto-retinal degeneration, cerebellar ataxia, cone-shaped epiphyses, congenital oculomotor apraxia and hepatic fibrosis. Loci associated with an infantile type of NPHP on 9q22-q31 (NPHP2), juvenile types of NPHP on chromosomes 2q12-q13 (NPHP1) and 1p36 (NPHP4) and an adolescent type of NPHP on 3q21-q22 (NPHP3) have been mapped. NPHP1 and NPHP4 have been identified, and interaction of the respective encoded proteins nephrocystin and nephrocystin-4 has been shown. Here we report the identification of NPHP3, encoding a novel 1,330-amino acid protein that interacts with nephrocystin. We describe mutations in NPHP3 in families with isolated NPHP and in families with NPHP with associated hepatic fibrosis or tapeto-retinal degeneration. We show that the mouse ortholog Nphp3 is expressed in the node, kidney tubules, retina, respiratory epithelium, liver, biliary tract and neural tissues. In addition, we show that a homozygous missense mutation in Nphp3 is probably responsible for the polycystic kidney disease (pcy) mouse phenotype. Interventional studies in the pcy mouse have shown beneficial effects by modification of protein intake and administration of methylprednisolone, suggesting therapeutic strategies for treating individuals with NPHP3.","dc:creator":"Olbrich H","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in a novel gene, NPHP3, cause adolescent nephronophthisis, tapeto-retinal degeneration and hepatic fibrosis."},"rdfs:label":"Northern blot analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:47c3a0f1-9c14-4c92-83f2-e1105d528097_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:985b0a82-52b1-4579-ac4a-411409ba0fd7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6750652-78c7-48a6-b9e6-0362d452ad32","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Similar location of  cysts and age of onset","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12872122","rdfs:label":"pcy/Nphp3 mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Discussed with expert panel and score increased due to specificity of phenotype of animal model to human disease"},{"id":"cggv:81adcdaa-35d2-44d9-859e-0bb2c7d72cbf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b680b910-5074-432d-9ad6-68792c0bbbed","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Overlapping features","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18371931","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Many genetic diseases have been linked to the dysfunction of primary cilia, which occur nearly ubiquitously in the body and act as solitary cellular mechanosensory organelles. The list of clinical manifestations and affected tissues in cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) such as nephronophthisis is broad and has been attributed to the wide expression pattern of ciliary proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to this dramatic diversity of phenotypes. We recently reported hypomorphic NPHP3 mutations in children and young adults with isolated nephronophthisis and associated hepatic fibrosis or tapetoretinal degeneration. Here, we chose a combinatorial approach in mice and humans to define the phenotypic spectrum of NPHP3/Nphp3 mutations and the role of the nephrocystin-3 protein. We demonstrate that the pcy mutation generates a hypomorphic Nphp3 allele that is responsible for the cystic kidney disease phenotype, whereas complete loss of Nphp3 function results in situs inversus, congenital heart defects, and embryonic lethality in mice. In humans, we show that NPHP3 mutations can cause a broad clinical spectrum of early embryonic patterning defects comprising situs inversus, polydactyly, central nervous system malformations, structural heart defects, preauricular fistulas, and a wide range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). On the functional level, we show that nephrocystin-3 directly interacts with inversin and can inhibit like inversin canonical Wnt signaling, whereas nephrocystin-3 deficiency leads in Xenopus laevis to typical planar cell polarity defects, suggesting a role in the control of canonical and noncanonical (planar cell polarity) Wnt signaling.","dc:creator":"Bergmann C","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Loss of nephrocystin-3 function can cause embryonic lethality, Meckel-Gruber-like syndrome, situs inversus, and renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia."},"rdfs:label":"Nphp3 mouse knockout"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5},{"id":"cggv:47c3a0f1-9c14-4c92-83f2-e1105d528097_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17f1bd75-e6b6-4090-9790-9d4773b39de3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17f1bd75-e6b6-4090-9790-9d4773b39de3","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:ea193a22-68ef-4956-a3a1-3667cad8b3db","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153240.5(NPHP3):c.1381G>T (p.Glu461Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115653"}},{"id":"cggv:ab157acc-12b0-4381-9662-6f81ea316287","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153240.5(NPHP3):c.1079G>C (p.Ser360Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115652"}}],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:e678da72-c4da-4f9c-8b21-45adb4c5eeea_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ea193a22-68ef-4956-a3a1-3667cad8b3db"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12872122"},{"id":"cggv:9926e4ca-6713-46e7-bb41-880f1fa2511a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ab157acc-12b0-4381-9662-6f81ea316287"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12872122"}],"rdfs:label":"F23:II-I"},{"id":"cggv:e678da72-c4da-4f9c-8b21-45adb4c5eeea","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e678da72-c4da-4f9c-8b21-45adb4c5eeea_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:9926e4ca-6713-46e7-bb41-880f1fa2511a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9926e4ca-6713-46e7-bb41-880f1fa2511a_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:32920af3-22bf-4620-b780-e1c00208c36d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:32920af3-22bf-4620-b780-e1c00208c36d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":30,"allele":{"id":"cggv:6870de6b-c487-475a-be9a-d7a1a39bfb52","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153240.5(NPHP3):c.2563C>T (p.Gln855Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2621987"}},"detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis in families using loci that flank NPHP2 and NPHP3\nthen sequencing of one affected child in each family of NPHP2 and then NPHP3\ndirect sequencing of coding exons and intronic junctions\nVariants compared against 100 ethnically matched controls","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000090","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"NPHP2 Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c24be865-a119-41e9-a6ba-6503e4d0b556_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6870de6b-c487-475a-be9a-d7a1a39bfb52"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19177160","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive chronic tubulointerstitial disease that progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in about 10% of cases during infancy.

Mutations of NPHP3, known to be associated with adolescent nephronophthisis, were found in two patients with early-onset ESRD. Here we screened 43 families with infantile nephronophthisis (ESRD less than 5 years of age) for NPHP2 and NPHP3 mutations and determined genotype-phenotype correlations. In this cohort there were 16 families with NPHP2 mutations and NPHP3 mutations in seven. Three patients carried only one heterozygous mutation in NPHP3. ESRD arose during the first 2 years of life in 16 of 18 patients with mutations in NPHP2, but in only two patients with mutations in NPHP3. Renal morphology, characterized by hyper-echogenic kidneys on ultrasound and tubular lesions with interstitial fibrosis on histology, was similar in the two patient groups. The kidney sizes were highly diverse and ultrasound-visualized cysts were present in a minority of cases. Extra-renal anomalies were found in 80% of the entire cohort including hepatic involvement (50%), cardiac valve or septal defects (20%) and recurrent bronchial infections (18%).

(PMID: 10631142). There are a number of different disease entities described as associated with *NPHP3 *in OMIM, including nephronophthisis, renal-hepatic-pancreatic-dysplasia and Meckel syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism OR inheritance pattern between these different disease entities. Therefore, these disease entities have been lumped into one disease which we suggest is referred to as ‘nephronophthisis – *NPHP3*’. Multiple variants (missense, in-frame, indel and predicted protein truncating variants) have been reported across multiple probands in multiple publications (PMIDs: 12872122, 19177160) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies and animal models (mice and zebrafish) (PMIDs: 12872122, 18371931, 20462968). In summary, *NPHP3 *is strongly associated with autosomal recessive nephronophthisis (NPHP-*NPHP3*). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
