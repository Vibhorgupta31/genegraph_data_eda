Here we report the identification of causal mutations in Sorting Nexin 14 (SNX14) found in seven affected individuals from three unrelated consanguineous families who presented with recessively inherited moderate-severe intellectual disability, cerebellar ataxia, early-onset cerebellar atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, and the distinctive association of progressively coarsening facial features, relative macrocephaly, and the absence of seizures. We used homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing to identify a homozygous nonsense mutation and an in-frame multiexon deletion in two families. A homozygous splice site mutation was identified by Sanger sequencing of SNX14 in a third family, selected purely by phenotypic similarity. This discovery confirms that these characteristic features represent a distinct and recognizable syndrome. SNX14 encodes a cellular protein containing Phox (PX) and regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domains. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis predicts that SNX14 is highly coexpressed with genes involved in cellular protein metabolism and vesicle-mediated transport. All three mutations either directly affected the PX domain or diminished SNX14 levels, implicating a loss of normal cellular function. This manifested as increased cytoplasmic vacuolation as observed in cultured fibroblasts. Our findings indicate an essential role for SNX14 in neural development and function, particularly in development and maturation of the cerebellum.","dc:creator":"Thomas AC","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mutations in SNX14 cause a distinctive autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia and intellectual disability syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:caf5ad64-1220-4969-bde4-1aaca1d95c3c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a340518e-9a5a-49bf-8e2e-8801ab5d9d51_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a340518e-9a5a-49bf-8e2e-8801ab5d9d51","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":23,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c39b70bc-f653-4133-9ac5-a236ac53c5cf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153816.6(SNX14):c.1894+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA364902565"}},"detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing of exons and exon/intron borders followed by RT-PCR from mRNA collected in peripheral blood lymphocytes to confirm exon 19 skipping (in frame).

Saturated lipids are particularly detrimental to cells, but how lipid saturation levels are maintained remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the cerebellar ataxia spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive 20 (SCAR20)-associated protein Snx14, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-lipid droplet (LD) tethering protein, as a factor required to maintain the lipid saturation balance of cell membranes.

Mutations generally result in loss of protein although several coding region deletions have also been reported. Patient-derived fibroblasts show disrupted autophagy, but the precise function of SNX14 is unknown. The yeast homolog, Mdm1, functions in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-lysosome/vacuole inter-organelle tethering, but functional conservation in mammals is still required. Here, we show that loss of SNX14 alters but does not block autophagic flux. In addition, we find that SNX14 is an ER-associated protein that functions in neutral lipid homeostasis and inter-organelle crosstalk. SNX14 requires its N-terminal transmembrane helices for ER localization, while the Phox homology (PX) domain is dispensable for subcellular localization. Both SNX14-mutant fibroblasts and SNX14KO HEK293 cells accumulate aberrant cytoplasmic vacuoles, suggesting defects in endolysosomal homeostasis. However, ER-late endosome/lysosome contact sites are maintained in SNX14KO cells, indicating that it is not a prerequisite for ER-endolysosomal tethering. Further investigation of SNX14- deficiency indicates general defects in neutral lipid metabolism. SNX14KO cells display distinct perinuclear accumulation of filipin in LAMP1-positive lysosomal structures indicating cholesterol accumulation. Consistent with this, SNX14KO cells display a slight but detectable decrease in cholesterol ester levels, which is exacerbated with U18666A. Finally, SNX14 associates with ER-derived lipid droplets (LD) following oleate treatment, indicating a role in ER-LD crosstalk. We therefore identify an important role for SNX14 in neutral lipid homeostasis between the ER, lysosomes and LDs that may provide an early intervention target to alleviate the clinical symptoms of SCAR20.","dc:creator":"Bryant D","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"SNX14 mutations affect endoplasmic reticulum-associated neutral lipid metabolism in autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 20."},"rdfs:label":"SNX14 subcellular localization and lipid homeostasis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Variants that lead to perturbation of cholesterol homeostasis have been linked to Niemann-Pick disease type C1 which has a similar phenotypic spectrum to SCAR20.

However, evidence of errors in lipid homeostasis as a pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration remains limited. Here, we show that cerebellar neurodegeneration caused by Sorting Nexin 14 (SNX14) deficiency is associated with lipid homeostasis defects. Recent studies indicate that SNX14 is an interorganelle lipid transfer protein that regulates lipid transport, lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis, and fatty acid desaturation, suggesting that human SNX14 deficiency belongs to an expanding class of cerebellar neurodegenerative disorders caused by altered cellular lipid homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mouse model that recapitulates human SNX14 deficiency at a genetic and phenotypic level. We demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are selectively vulnerable to SNX14 deficiency while forebrain regions preserve their neuronal content. Ultrastructure and lipidomic studies reveal widespread lipid storage and metabolism defects in SNX14-deficient mice. However, predegenerating SNX14-deficient cerebella show a unique accumulation of acylcarnitines and depletion of triglycerides. Furthermore, defects in LD content and telolysosome enlargement in predegenerating PCs suggest lipotoxicity as a pathogenic mechanism of SNX14 deficiency. Our work shows a selective cerebellar vulnerability to altered lipid homeostasis and provides a mouse model for future therapeutic studies.","dc:creator":"Zhou Y","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"Altered lipid homeostasis is associated with cerebellar neurodegeneration in SNX14 deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse SNX14 -/-"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9189,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:21a79ee7-14d6-4f77-b358-b88be9e2e5cf","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014601","gene":"hgnc:14977","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"Sorting nexin 14 (*SNX14*) was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 20 (SCAR20) in 2014 (Thomas et al., PMID: 25439728). SCAR20 is a pediatric onset disease which often involves ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, coarse facial features and intellectual disability (PMIDs 25439728, 25848753). Six variants (two stop-gain, one frame shift, one missense, one canonical splice, and one deep intronic) that have been reported in six probands in four publications (PMIDs: 25439728, 25848753, 27913285, 37485342) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, cell culture models, and biochemical data (PMIDs 33310904, 38625743, 29635513). The effects from a loss of function or expression was shown to be more pronounced in cerebral tissue and that disruption to lipid homeostasis is likely involved in pathogenesis. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SNX14* and autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 20. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
