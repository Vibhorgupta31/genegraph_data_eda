Thus, this study aimed to use whole genome sequencing to identify and evaluate genetic variants and genetic structure of early onset epilepsy in the Kazakhstani pediatric population. In this study, for the first time in Kazakhstan, whole genome sequencing was carried out among epilepsy diagnosed children. The study involved 20 pediatric patients with early onset epilepsy and no established cause of the disease during the July-December, 2021. The average age at enrolment was 34.5 months, with a mean age at seizure onset of 6 months. Six patients (30%) were male, and 7 were familial cases. We identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 14 (70%) cases, among them, 6 novel disease gene variants (KCNQ2, CASK, WWOX, MT-CO3, GRIN2D, and SLC12A5). Other genes associated with the disease were SCN1A (x2), SLC2A1, ARX, CACNA1B, PCDH19, KCNT1, and CHRNA2. Identification of the genetic causes in 70% of cases confirms the general structure of the etiology of early onset epilepsy and the necessity of using NGS in diagnostics. Moreover, the study describes new genotype-phenotypic correlations in genetic epilepsy. Despite certain limitations of the study, it can be concluded that the genetic etiology of pediatric epilepsy in Kazakhstan is very broad and requires further research.","dc:creator":"Bayanova M","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Whole-Genome Sequencing Among Kazakhstani Children with Early-Onset Epilepsy Revealed New Gene Variants and Phenotypic Variability."}},{"id":"cggv:53a994ca-0cba-496e-8bc8-cf0eb729a716_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:50769680-b78f-4b34-83ae-2e0b46e70ea5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37095367"}],"rdfs:label":"Patient 3  Bayanova"},{"id":"cggv:b661103e-9d4c-4ace-bece-5df375569ca4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b661103e-9d4c-4ace-bece-5df375569ca4_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Variant seen with 4% frequency in gnomAD.

However, their role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory has never been examined. Here, we investigated hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses in mice deficient for the alpha(1B) subunit of N-type Ca(2+) channels. The mutant mice exhibited impaired learning and memory in the Morris water maze and the social transmission of food preference tasks. In particular, long-term memory was impaired in the mutant mice. Interestingly, among activity-dependent long-lasting synaptic changes, theta burst- or 200-Hz-stimulation-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was decreased in the mutant, compared with the wild-type mice. This type of LTP is known to require brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It was found that both BDNF-induced potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and facilitation of the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were reduced in the mutant. Taken together, these results demonstrate that N-type Ca(2+) channels are required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, and certain forms of LTP.","dc:creator":"Jeon D","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Impaired long-term memory and long-term potentiation in N-type Ca2+ channel-deficient mice."},"rdfs:label":"Knockout mice "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Model fails to sufficiently recapitulate human phenotype."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":6751,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":9,"subject":{"id":"cggv:62ef057d-93e9-44ee-aca4-4b9c63a94471","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100516","gene":"hgnc:1389","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*CACNA1B* encodes the (α1B) pore-forming subunit of the N-type voltage-gated calcium channel. *CACNA1B* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder with motor features in 2019 (Gorman KM et al., PMID: 30982612).
