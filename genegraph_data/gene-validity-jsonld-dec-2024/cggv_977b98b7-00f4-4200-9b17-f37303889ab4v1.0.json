We report a mouse transcript, isolated by a candidate deafness gene approach, that is expressed almost exclusively in the inner ear. Genomic analysis shows that the human ortholog STRC (so called owing to the name we have given its protein-stereocilin), which is located on chromosome 15q15, contains 29 exons encompassing approximately 19 kb. STRC is tandemly duplicated, with the coding sequence of the second copy interrupted by a stop codon in exon 20. We have identified two frameshift mutations and a large deletion in the copy containing 29 coding exons in two families affected by autosomal recessive non-syndromal sensorineural deafness linked to the DFNB16 locus. Stereocilin is made up of 1,809 amino acids, and contains a putative signal petide and several hydrophobic segments.

These distortions reflect nonlinear mechanical interactions within the cochlea. By allowing one tone to suppress another (masking effect), they contribute to speech intelligibility. Tones can also combine to produce sounds with frequencies not present in the acoustic stimulus. These sounds compose the otoacoustic emissions that are extensively used to screen hearing in newborns. Because both cochlear amplification and distortion originate from the outer hair cells-one of the two types of sensory receptor cells-it has been speculated that they stem from a common mechanism. Here we show that the nonlinearity underlying cochlear waveform distortions relies on the presence of stereocilin, a protein defective in a recessive form of human deafness. Stereocilin was detected in association with horizontal top connectors, lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the outer hair cell's hair bundle. These links were absent in stereocilin-null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf. At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced and both acoustic and electrical waveform distortions were completely lacking. From this unique functional situation, we conclude that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a deflection-dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic nonlinear behaviour of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel.","dc:creator":"Verpy E","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Stereocilin-deficient mice reveal the origin of cochlear waveform distortions."},"rdfs:label":"STRC Null Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"cggv:977b98b7-00f4-4200-9b17-f37303889ab4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:977b98b7-00f4-4200-9b17-f37303889ab4_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae673654-e396-41aa-9f0f-275f696a895c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:737c22f5-a8d7-4bdb-81a2-5f8680ccccbf","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ae673654-e396-41aa-9f0f-275f696a895c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:8091d0a7-a6ad-47b3-8aed-6f8f272789da","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153700.2(STRC):c.2171_2174delTTTG (p.Val724Glyfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA253126"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11687802"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11687802","rdfs:label":"S040"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a8421346-c82e-49f3-ab35-134467a1b11c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c044f802-e014-4fc1-855a-a716b7695b84","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"High frequency HL with normal hearing\nthresholds until 1 kHz and mild to\nmoderate HL from 2 to 8 kHz","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"GJB2/GJB6 negative ARSNHL patient","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a8421346-c82e-49f3-ab35-134467a1b11c_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:dcea1f06-3d31-405d-b460-51b05d0f3cf6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153700.2(STRC):c.4918C>T (p.Leu1640Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7527839"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26011646","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Increasing attention has been directed toward assessing mutational fallout of stereocilin (STRC), the gene underlying DFNB16.

In 94 GJB2/GJB6-mutation negative individuals with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL), we identified two homozygous and six heterozygous deletions, encompassing the STRC region by microarray and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. To detect smaller mutations, we developed a Sanger sequencing method for pseudogene exclusion. Three heterozygous deletion carriers exhibited hemizygous mutations predicted as negatively impacting the protein. In 30 NSHL individuals without deletion, we detected one with compound heterozygous and two with heterozygous pathogenic mutations. Of 36 total patients undergoing STRC sequencing, two showed the c.3893A>G variant in conjunction with a heterozygous deletion or mutation and three exhibited the variant in a heterozygous state. Although this variant affects a highly conserved amino acid and is predicted as deleterious, comparable minor allele frequencies (MAFs) (around 10%) in NSHL individuals and controls and homozygous variant carriers without NSHL argue against its pathogenicity. Collectively, six (6%) of 94 NSHL individuals were diagnosed with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations causing DFNB16 and five (5%) as heterozygous mutation carriers.

To date, more than 150 loci and 89 genes have been reported for non-syndromic hearing loss. Next generation sequencing has recently been developed as a powerful genetic strategy for identifying pathogenic mutations in heterogeneous disorders with various causative genes. In this study, we performed targeted sequencing to identify the causative mutation in a Korean family that had moderate hearing loss. We targeted 64 genes associated with non-syndromic hearing loss and sorted the homozygous variations according to the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of the family. Implementing a bioinformatic platform for filtering and detecting variations allowed for the identification of two variations within different genes (c.650G>A in TRIOBP and c.4057C>T in STRC). These variants were selected for further analysis. Among these, c.4057C>T (p.Q1353X) was a divergent sequence variation between the STRC gene and the STRC pseudogene. This was the critical difference that resulted in loss of the protein-coding ability of the pseudogene. Therefore, we hypothesized that the p.Q1353X variation in the STRC gene is the causative mutation for hearing loss.

STRC was first associated with this disease in humans in 2001 (Verpy et al.). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function that leads to dysfunction or lack of function of the stereocilia in the inner ear. This gene-disease association is supported by a knockout mouse model designed by Verpy et al. 2008 as well as expression studies showing localization of the stereocilin protein in the inner ear. It is important to note that STRC is in close proximity with the CATSPER gene which has been found to be crucial to sperm viability and therefore large deletions of the region encompassing STRC and CATSPER2 have been shown to cause hearing loss as well as male infertility (See genereviews Hildebrand 2017 PMID: 20301780).
