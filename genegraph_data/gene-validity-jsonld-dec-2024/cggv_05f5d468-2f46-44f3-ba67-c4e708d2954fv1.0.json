We carried out a multicenter study of IVA patients diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS) or symptoms clinics over a period of 28 years in Spain. Evaluated at diagnosis, data included age, detection method, levels of C5 and IVG, enzymatic studies, clinical presentation parameters and genotype in 16 patients. Follow-up data included C5 levels, intellectual quotient and correlation genotype-phenotype. IVA was detected by NBS in 8 patients (prevalence of 1/326 629). Except 1, all the 8 patients identified by NBS were asymptomatic at diagnosis and had isovalerylcarnitine (C5) levels of 1.6-6.4 μM and isovalerylglycine (IVG) levels <1100 mmol per mol creatinine; they remained asymptomatic with a natural protein intake ⩾1.5 g kg-1 per day. Symptomatic patients with chronic intermittent or acute neonatal IVA had C5 levels of 3.9-16.3 μM and IVG levels >3400 mmol per mol creatinine. The percentage of isovalerate incorporation in fibroblasts was 64-80% in patients detected by NBS and 4.9-13% in symptomatic patients. Cognitive function was within normal ranges in all patients but was negatively correlated with IVG at detection (-0.592; P<0.05). The genetic analysis revealed nine novel mutations. The clinical/biochemical phenotype correlated fairly well with the phenotype predicted by the mutations found. In conclusion, although blood C5 levels have traditionally been considered the prognostic marker of choice, urine IVG levels would appear to be a better predictor, as they correlated well with severity of mutations and were associated with a lower incorporation rate of IVA in fibroblasts and a less favorable clinical course.","dc:creator":"Couce ML","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Genotype and phenotype characterization in a Spanish cohort with isovaleric acidemia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27904153","rdfs:label":"Patient 15"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Patient has another variant in trans that resulted in the deletion of exons 1-3, but could not be registered in the allele registry."},{"id":"cggv:a49c56a0-e6d6-45a1-b88b-5c9a5cb282b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c03f95d-a169-4ff2-9bb6-7584c40f8677","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":30,"detectionMethod":"DNA isolated and sequenced from whole blood or fibroblasts.

IVD is produced as a 45-kDa precursor and then is transported into the mitochondria, where it is processed to its mature 43-kDa size. Previous [35S]methionine-labeling studies of fibroblasts from IVA patients have revealed at least five classes of mutations within the IVD gene. In size, IVD precursor and mature proteins produced by class I mutants are indistinguishable from their normal counterparts. Class II, III, and IV mutants make IVD precursor proteins which are 23 kDa smaller than normal. Subsequent processing in class III and IV mutants is normal but proceeds inefficiently in class II mutants. Class V mutants make no detectable IVD protein. In order to further study these mutations at the molecular level, the IVD coding region from mutant fibroblast cDNA was amplified by the PCR and was analyzed by DNA sequencing. cDNA from class I mutant alleles from two of seven class I mutant cell lines each contained a different missense mutation. In cDNA from a class III mutant, a single base deletion at position 1179 of the coding region was identified which leads to a shift in reading frame, predicting the incorporation of eight abnormal amino acids followed by a premature termination codon. Sequencing of amplified IVD cDNA from a type V mutant has failed to identify any abnormalities. It most probably is deficient in translation of the IVD mRNA. A new class of IVD mutant allele which appears to be transcriptionally defective (type VI) was also identified. Additional study of this set of IVD mutations should add both to our knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of mitochondrial proteins and to our understanding of the clinical heterogeneity seen in IVA.","dc:creator":"Vockley J","dc:date":"1991","dc:title":"Molecular characterization of four different classes of mutations in the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene responsible for isovaleric acidemia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2063866","rdfs:label":"YH834"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The second variant in trans was not identified but at the mRNA level they saw a deletion of exon 2."},{"id":"cggv:028707fd-1c34-4822-b7fe-244c93b3cc85_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:22e4acbd-1bc6-4c93-b3a6-acdc9b946bc3","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"PCR amplification of cDNA from fibroblast mRNA (entire coding region).

It was the first organic acidemia recognized in humans and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment with a protein restricted diet and supplementation with carnitine and glycine are effective in promoting normal development in severely affected individuals. Both intra- and interfamilial variability have been recognized. Initially, two phenotypes with either an acute neonatal or a chronic intermittent presentation were described. More recently, a third group of individuals with mild biochemical abnormalities who can be asymptomatic have been identified through newborn screening of blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. IVD is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and transfers electrons to the electron transfer flavoprotein. Human IVD has been purified from tissue and recombinant sources and its biochemical and physical properties have been extensively studied. Molecular analysis of the IVD gene from patients with IVA has allowed characterization of different types of mutations in this gene. One missense mutation, 932C>T (A282V), is particularly common in patients identified through newborn screening with mild metabolite elevations and who have remained asymptomatic to date. This mutation leads to a partially active enzyme with altered catalytic properties; however, its effects on clinical outcome and the necessity of therapy are still unknown. A better understanding of the heterogeneity of this disease and the relevance of genotype/phenotype correlations to clinical management of patients are among the challenges remaining in the study of this disorder in the coming years.","dc:creator":"Vockley J","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Isovaleric acidemia: new aspects of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity."},"rdfs:label":"IVD Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:05f5d468-2f46-44f3-ba67-c4e708d2954f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6b79af31-e820-4ccc-88cb-01976b387efc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:127ede82-787d-44e4-8a6a-15632f9162d3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Macromolecular-labeling test (MLT) to analyze the activity of enzymes involved in the oxidation of leucine was used to test the ability of fibroblasts to oxidize [l-14C]isovaleric acid.

We first developed a simple macromolecular-labeling test to measure the ability of cells to oxidize [1-14C]isovaleric acid in situ in culture. Cells from two different lines were fused using polyethylene glycol, and the ability of the heterokaryons to oxidize [1-14C]isovaleric acid was tested by the macromolecular-labeling test. The MC line complemented with all 10 IVA lines tested; heterokaryons showed 99 +/- 68% more activity than the unfused mixture of component cells. GA II/IVA heterokaryons exhibited poor growth, but when the culture remained confluent, the GA II cells complemented with all six IVA lines tested, showing a 71 +/- 41% increase in activity. The relatively large standard deviations are due to a few experiments in which significant enhancement of macromolecular-labeling test activity was not observed upon fusion, but significant complementation was clearly observed in repeats of the same combinations. These results are consistent with our previous findings, which indicated that the decreased ability of GA II cells to oxidize isovaleryl-CoA involves a defective electron-transporting system rather than a defective isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. IVA/IVA heterokaryons showed no complementation in any combination tested, indicating no detectable heterogeneity in isovaleric acidemia.

For example, α-aminoadipic acidemia and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency are known in C57BL/6J mice. Using RNA sequencing, we now reveal the causal variants in Dhtkd1 and Bckdhb, and the molecular mechanism underlying these metabolic defects. C57BL/6J mice have decreased Dhtkd1 mRNA expression due to a solitary long terminal repeat (LTR) in intron 4 of Dhtkd1. This LTR harbors an alternate splice donor site leading to a partial splicing defect and as a consequence decreased total and functional Dhtkd1 mRNA, decreased DHTKD1 protein and α-aminoadipic acidemia. Similarly, C57BL/6J mice have decreased Bckdhb mRNA expression due to an LTR retrotransposon in intron 1 of Bckdhb. This transposable element encodes an alternative exon 1 causing aberrant splicing, decreased total and functional Bckdhb mRNA and decreased BCKDHB protein. Using a targeted metabolomics screen, we also reveal elevated plasma C5-carnitine in 129 substrains. This biochemical phenotype resembles isovaleric acidemia and is caused by an exonic splice mutation in Ivd leading to partial skipping of exon 10 and IVD protein deficiency. In summary, this study identifies three causal variants underlying mild inborn errors of metabolism in commonly used inbred mouse strains.","dc:creator":"Leandro J","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Mild inborn errors of metabolism in commonly used inbred mouse strains."},"rdfs:label":"Inbred Mouse Strain 129"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The defect was mild and this is an inbred mouse strain so other factors could contribute to a metabolic defect."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":421,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:22705936-e6b9-4f9c-a60a-0bf4aeea4ad3","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009475","gene":"hgnc:6186","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between IVD and isovaleric acidemia (autosomal recessive) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April, 2019. Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is an inborn error of leucine metabolism characterized by an accumulation of isovaleryl-CoA derivatives in cells, blood and urine. Clinical presentation varies widely from acute neonatal to chronic intermittent and can be detected by newborn screening. Variation in IBD were first identified in humans with the disease as early as 1985 (Ikeda et al., PMID 3863140). To date, over 50 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) have been reported (Sakamoto et al., 2015; PMID 26018748). This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays, in vitro assays, and a mouse model. In summary, IVD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive isovaleric acedmia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:05f5d468-2f46-44f3-ba67-c4e708d2954f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
