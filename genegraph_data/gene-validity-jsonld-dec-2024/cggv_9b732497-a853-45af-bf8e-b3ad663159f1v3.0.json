Previous studies indicate a peroxisomal location of BAAT in peroxisomes with variable amounts up to 95% detected in cytosolic fractions. The absence or presence of a cytosolic pool of BAAT has important implications for the intracellular transport of unconjugated/deconjugated bile salts. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and digitonin permeabilization assays to determine the subcellular location of endogenous BAAT in primary human and rat hepatocytes. In addition, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rat Baat (rBaat) and human BAAT (hBAAT) were transiently expressed in primary rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts. Catalase and recombinant GFP-SKL and DsRed-SKL were used as peroxisomal markers. Endogenous hBAAT and rBaat were found to specifically localize to peroxisomes in human and rat hepatocytes, respectively. No significant cytosolic fraction was detected for either protein. GFP-tagged hBAAT and rBaat were efficiently sorted to peroxisomes of primary rat hepatocytes. Significant amounts of GFP-tagged hBAAT or rBaat were detected in the cytosol only when coexpressed with DsRed-SKL, suggesting that hBAAT/rBaat and DsRed-SKL compete for the same peroxisomal import machinery. When expressed in fibroblasts, GFP-tagged hBAAT localized to the cytosol, confirming earlier observations.","dc:creator":"Pellicoro A","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Human and rat bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase are liver-specific peroxisomal enzymes: implications for intracellular bile salt transport."},"rdfs:label":"Pellicoro_Expression in hepatocyte peroxisomes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:3974e381-6043-4ff0-9c55-70f0c6910ae2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c459445c-3bdb-42c1-8779-2daa17b973d8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Only unconjugated bile acids were detected in the serum of patients with FHC and BAAT missense variant Met76Val (PMID: 12704386).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12810727","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BACAT) catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids to glycine and taurine for excretion into bile. By use of site-directed mutagenesis and sequence comparisons, we have identified Cys-235, Asp-328, and His-362 as constituting a catalytic triad in human BACAT (hBACAT) and identifying BACAT as a member of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase gene family. We therefore hypothesized that hBACAT may also hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoAs and/or conjugate fatty acids to glycine. We show here that recombinant hBACAT also can hydrolyze long- and very long-chain saturated acyl-CoAs (mainly C16:0-C26:0) and by mass spectrometry verified that hBACAT also conjugates fatty acids to glycine. Tissue expression studies showed strong expression of BACAT in liver, gallbladder, and the proximal and distal intestine. However, BACAT is also expressed in a variety of tissues unrelated to bile acid formation and transport, suggesting important functions also in the regulation of intracellular levels of very long-chain fatty acids. Green fluorescent protein localization experiments in human skin fibroblasts showed that the hBACAT enzyme is mainly cytosolic. Therefore, the cytosolic BACAT enzyme may play important roles in protection against toxicity by accumulation of unconjugated bile acids and non-esterified very long-chain fatty acids.","dc:creator":"O'Byrne J","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"The human bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase functions in the conjugation of fatty acids to glycine."},"rdfs:label":"O'Byrne_bile acid conjugation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:9b732497-a853-45af-bf8e-b3ad663159f1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5c381513-5ff5-4f7b-b490-80afd2c36228","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd54b1ea-a2e7-408e-acff-9a46b4519738","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Choloyl-CoA conjugation activity (in the presence of 50 mM glycine) of wild-type hBACAT was about 1041 nmol/min/mg protein.

Here we report the establishment of a high-throughput gene-targeting pipeline for the generation of reporter-tagged, conditional alleles. Computational allele design, 96-well modular vector construction and high-efficiency gene-targeting strategies have been combined to mutate genes on an unprecedented scale. So far, more than 12,000 vectors and 9,000 conditional targeted alleles have been produced in highly germline-competent C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells. High-throughput genome engineering highlighted by this study is broadly applicable to rat and human stem cells and provides a foundation for future genome-wide efforts aimed at deciphering the function of all genes encoded by the mammalian genome.","dc:creator":"Skarnes WC","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A conditional knockout resource for the genome-wide study of mouse gene function."},"rdfs:label":"IMPC BAAT mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The evidence is scored minimal points in the absence of data supporting recapitulation of disease."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":9455,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":7.6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:b5922183-6d3f-4a76-b1f2-442c807a9a01","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100305","gene":"hgnc:932","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"3.0","dc:description":"The relationship between BAAT and bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase deficiency (also referred to as familial hypecholanemia in the literature), an autosomal recessive disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March, 2022. BAAT encodes a liver enzyme that is involved in the final step of bile acid synthesis, the conjugation of mature bile acids to glycine and taurine. This facilitates intestinal absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Patients with BAAT mutations show increased levels of unconjugated bile acids in the serum, urine and bile. They present with itching and fat malabsorption. \n\nBAAT was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive familial hypecholanemia in 2003 (Carlton et al, PMID: 12704386). The condition is also caused by mutations in genes other than BAAT. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (5.1 points):\nAt least 10 patients in 4 publications have been reported with homozygous missense or nonsense variants (PMID: 12704386,10655068, 22783059, 23415802). The mechanism is expected to be homozygous loss of function. The variant segregated with disease in 5 additional family members.\n  \nSummary of experimental data (2.5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model originally developed by the IMPC project and later shown to recapitulate the biochemical deficiency (PMID: 21677750, PMID: 36243101). The enzyme is highly expressed in peroxisomes in hepatocytes (PMID: 17256745) and has a role in conjugating bile acids (PMID: 12810727). \n  \nIn summary, there is moderate level of evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of BAAT and bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase deficiency. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on Apr 9, 2022. It was reevaluated on May 3, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.
