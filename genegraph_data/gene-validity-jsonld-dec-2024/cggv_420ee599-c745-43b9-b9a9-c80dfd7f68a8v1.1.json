Here, we aim to examine the impact on diagnosis, treatment and cost with early use of targeted WES in early-onset epilepsy. WES was performed on 180 patients with early-onset epilepsy (≤5 years) of unknown cause. Patients were classified as Retrospective (epilepsy diagnosis >6 months) or Prospective (epilepsy diagnosis <6 months). WES was performed on an Ion Proton™ and variant reporting was restricted to the sequences of 620 known epilepsy genes. Diagnostic yield and time to diagnosis were calculated. An analysis of cost and impact on treatment was also performed. A molecular diagnoses (pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants) was achieved in 59/180 patients (33%). Clinical management changed following WES findings in 23 of 59 diagnosed patients (39%) or 13% of all patients. A possible diagnosis was identified in 21 additional patients (12%) for whom supporting evidence is pending. Time from epilepsy onset to a genetic diagnosis was faster when WES was performed early in the diagnostic process (mean: 145 days Prospective vs. 2,882 days Retrospective). Costs of prior negative tests averaged $8,344 per patient in the Retrospective group, suggesting savings of $5,110 per patient using WES. These results highlight the diagnostic yield, clinical utility and potential cost-effectiveness of using targeted WES early in the diagnostic workup of patients with unexplained early-onset epilepsy. The costs and clinical benefits are likely to continue to improve. Advances in precision medicine and further studies regarding impact on long-term clinical outcome will be important.","dc:creator":"Demos M","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Diagnostic Yield and Treatment Impact of Targeted Exome Sequencing in Early-Onset Epilepsy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31164858","rdfs:label":"Proband Demos et al."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:99f5a5f0-66f8-448a-ad63-214f721cc821_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3f40145-5e9c-451e-88d0-f8745e279f6a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":18,"detectionMethod":"Candidate gene sequencing based on highly specific phenotype.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0100543","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0007018","obo:HP_0031491"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:99f5a5f0-66f8-448a-ad63-214f721cc821_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:9953181f-c630-4843-a52b-149041486c1a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014927.5(CNKSR2):c.2134C>T (p.Arg712Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA412557004"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28098945","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Synaptic proteins are critical to neuronal function in the brain, and their deficiency can lead to seizures and cognitive impairments.

In this study, we sequenced 112 patients with phenotypes within the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum (EAS) to determine the frequency of CNKSR2 mutation within this complex set of disorders. We detected a novel nonsense mutation (c.2314 C>T; p.Arg712*) in one Ashkenazi Jewish family, the male proband of which had a severe epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves in sleep (ECSWS). His affected brother also had ECSWS with better outcome, whereas the sister had childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. This mutation segregated in the three affected siblings in an X-linked manner, inherited from their mother who had febrile seizures.

Carrier females may be unaffected or mildly affected. To date, at least 17 unique variants predicted to cause loss of function of the protein have been described. In addition to SNVs and indels, whole-gene deletions and intragenic CNVs have also been identified in affected individuals. This gene is intolerant to loss-of function variants (pLI = 1, LOEUF = 0.18, gnomAD v2.1.1). This gene-disease relationship is further supported by expression studies and rescue experiments.
