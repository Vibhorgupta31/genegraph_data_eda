Tip-links stretch from the tips of stereocilia in the short and middle rows to the sides of neighboring, taller stereocilia. They are made of cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15, products of the Usher syndrome type 1 genes USH1D and USH1F, respectively. In this study we address the role of sans, a putative scaffold protein and product of the USH1G gene. In Ush1g(-/-) mice, the cohesion of stereocilia is disrupted, and both the amplitude and the sensitivity of the transduction currents are reduced. In Ush1g(fl/fl)Myo15-cre(+/-) mice, the loss of sans occurs postnatally and the stereocilia remain cohesive. In these mice, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the total transducer current with no loss in sensitivity, and the tips of the stereocilia in the short and middle rows lose their prolate shape, features that can be attributed to the loss of tip-links. Furthermore, stereocilia from these rows undergo a dramatic reduction in length, suggesting that the mechanotransduction machinery has a positive effect on F-actin polymerization. Sans interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15 in vitro and is absent from the hair bundle in mice defective for either of the two cadherins.

Homozygous mutant mice had no detectable auditory brainstem response, displayed highly disorganized hair-cell stereocilia and had no detectable MYO7A protein. We generated mice that were digenic heterozygotes for Myo7a(sh1-8J) and one of each Cdh23(v-2J), Ush1g(js) or Pcdh15(av-3J) alleles, or an Ush1c null allele.

While we readily detected MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23 and PCDH15 using mass spectrometry of purified chick utricle hair bundles, we did not detect USH1G. Consistent with that observation, Ush1g microarray signals were much lower in chick cochlea than those of Myo7a, Ush1c, Cdh23 and Pcdh15 and were not detected in the chick utricle. These experiments confirm the importance of MYO7A for the development and maintenance of bundle function and support the suggestion that MYO7A, USH1G (Sans) and CDH23 form the upper tip-link complex in adult mice, likely in combination with USH1C (harmonin).

In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the relationship between USH1G and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss.
