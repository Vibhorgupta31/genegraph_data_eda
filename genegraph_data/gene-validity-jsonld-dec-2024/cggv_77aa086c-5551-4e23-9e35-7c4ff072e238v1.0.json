M., Guggino, W. B., and Agre, P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1908-1912). Here we report the isolation and characterization of the human AQP5 cDNA and gene. The AQP5 cDNA from a human submaxillary gland library contains a 795-base pair open reading frame encoding a 265-amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequences of human and rat AQP5 are 91% identical with 6 substitutions in the 22-amino acid COOH-terminal domain. Expression of human AQP5 in Xenopus oocytes conferred mercurial-sensitive osmotic water permeability (Pf) equivalent to other aquaporins. The human AQP5 structural gene resides within a 7. 4-kilobase SalI-EcoRI fragment with four exons corresponding to amino acids 1-121, 122-176, 177-204, and 205-265 separated by introns of 1.2, 0.5, and 0.9 kilobases. A transcription initiation site was identified 518 base pairs upstream of the initiating methionine. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that AQP5 is a single copy gene which localized to human chromosome 12q13; this coincides with the chromosomal locations of the homologous human genes MIP and AQP2, thus confirming 12q13 as the site of an aquaporin gene cluster. The mouse gene localized to distal chromosome 15. This information may permit molecular characterization of AQP5 expression during normal development and in clinical disorders.","dc:creator":"Lee MD","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"The human Aquaporin-5 gene.

The HTS-induced current is more robust and rapid in TRPV4/Asn123TyrAQPt cells, suggesting a GOF.

AQP1, AQP3, and AQP5 protein were confirmed in these tissues by immunoblotting. AQP1 was identified in capillary endothelial cells by immunohistochemical labeling, but not in sweat glands or epidermis. Abundant AQP3 expression was seen in basal levels of epidermis, but not in sweat glands. AQP2 and AQP4 were not observed in either skin or sweat glands. Immunohistochemical labeling revealed abundant AQP5 in secretory parts of rat and mouse sweat glands, where immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated abundant AQP5 labeling in the apical plasma membrane. AQP5 immunolabeling of human sweat glands yielded a similar pattern. To establish the role of AQP5 in sweat secretion, we tested the response of adult mice to s.c. injection of pilocarpine, as visualized by reaction of secreted amylase with iodine/starch. The number of active sweat glands was dramatically reduced in AQP5-null (-/-) mice compared with heterozygous (+/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice. We conclude that the presence of AQP5 in plasma membranes of sweat glands is essential for secretion, providing potential insight into mechanisms underlying mammalian thermoregulation, tactile sensitivity, and the pathophysiology of hyperhidrosis.","dc:creator":"Nejsum LN","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Functional requirement of aquaporin-5 in plasma membranes of sweat glands."},"rdfs:label":"Nejsum 2002 Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Does not fully recapitulate since the authors used a null mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5},{"id":"cggv:77aa086c-5551-4e23-9e35-7c4ff072e238_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:77aa086c-5551-4e23-9e35-7c4ff072e238_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:77aa086c-5551-4e23-9e35-7c4ff072e238_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a5e03bc5-3621-4be1-8789-3e7ca6de33a5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8681b553-bdf3-4208-9dac-b02a5246455c","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Diffuse nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratodermas","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000972","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:a5e03bc5-3621-4be1-8789-3e7ca6de33a5_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:c46d1629-993e-419d-920f-67234132e580","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001651.3(AQP5):c.134T>G (p.Ile45Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/65480"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23830519"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23830519","rdfs:label":"British Family A Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Structural modeling suggests that replacing Ile45 with the smaller serine might also widen the diameter of the constriction point."},{"id":"cggv:b638278d-ffdd-4dba-8d8a-33d6ccdaece4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7c6c56f8-44eb-4ddc-959d-a5c77271b8b9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Large 3 generation family of Chinese Han ethnicity with PPKB (including 10 affected individuals).
