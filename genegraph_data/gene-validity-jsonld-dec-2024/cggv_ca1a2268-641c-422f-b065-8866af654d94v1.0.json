The predicted product shares 34% sequence identity with the C(19) and C(21) 3beta-HSD enzymes, which participate in steroid hormone metabolism. When transfected into cultured cells, the cloned C(27) 3beta-HSD cDNA encodes an enzyme that is active against four 7alpha-hydroxylated sterols, indicating that a single C(27) 3beta-HSD enzyme can participate in all known pathways of bile acid synthesis. The expressed enzyme did not metabolize several different C(19/21) steroids as substrates. The levels of hepatic C(27) 3beta-HSD mRNA in the mouse are not sexually dimorphic and do not change in response to dietary cholesterol or to changes in bile acid pool size. The corresponding human gene on chromosome 16p11.2-12 contains six exons and spans 3 kb of DNA, and we identified a 2-bp deletion in the C27 3beta-HSD gene of a patient with neonatal progressive intrahepatic cholestasis. This mutation eliminates the activity of the enzyme in transfected cells. These findings establish the central role of C(27) 3beta-HSD in the biosynthesis of bile acids and provide molecular tools for the diagnosis of a third type of neonatal progressive intrahepatic cholestasis associated with impaired bile acid synthesis.","dc:creator":"Schwarz M","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"The bile acid synthetic gene 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase is mutated in progressive intrahepatic cholestasis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d27df872-d000-40ff-9800-a26029ffa5eb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:483323c2-7143-4ce7-98ed-9a58e5a4ff26","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"The tissue distributions of the mouse, rat, and human C27 3β-HSD mRNAs were examined by RNA blotting.

The 3β-HSD enzymatic system plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids and HSD VII is active against four 7-alpha-hydroxylated sterols. The deficiency of 3β-HSD causes congenital defects of bile acid synthesis, characterized by neonatal onset of progressive liver disease with cholestatic jaundice and malabsorption of lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins from the gastrointestinal tract resulting from a primary failure to synthesize bile acids. Affected infants show failure to thrive and secondary coagulopathy. At least 53 cases of 3β-HSD have been reported (reviewed in PMID: 26080666), with six variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) from 6 probands (and 1 additional family member) in 2 publications (PMIDs: 11067870, 12679481) included here. This gene-disease association is also supported by its biochemical functions in bile acid synthesis and enriched expression in the liver (PMID: 11067870). Additionally, a knockout mouse model that recapitulates human phenotype (PMID: 17601774). In summary, *HSD3B7* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive congenital bile acid synthesis defect 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
