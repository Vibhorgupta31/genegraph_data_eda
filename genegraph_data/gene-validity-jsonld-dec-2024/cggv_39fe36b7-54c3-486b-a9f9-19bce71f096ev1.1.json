Electroretinographic recordings show that in RM, rod photoreceptor function is normal, whereas cone photoreceptor responses are absent. The locus for RM has been mapped to chromosome 2q11 (ref. 2), however the gene underlying RM has not yet been identified. Recently, a suitable candidate gene, CNGA3, encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel, a key component of the phototransduction pathway, has been cloned and assigned to human chromosome 2q11 (refs 3,4). We report the identification of missense mutations in CNGA3 in five families with RM. Homozygous mutations are present in two families, whereas the remaining families show compound heterozygous mutations. In all cases, the segregation pattern of the mutations is consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease and all mutations affect amino acids that are highly conserved among cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNG) in various species. This is the first report of a colour vision disorder caused by defects other than mutations in the cone pigment genes, and implies at least in this instance a common genetic basis for phototransduction in the three different cone photoreceptors of the human retina.","dc:creator":"Kohl S","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Total colourblindness is caused by mutations in the gene encoding

retinopathies affect approximately two and a half million people globally, yet the majority of affected patients lack clear genetic diagnoses given the diverse range of genes and mutations implicated in these conditions. We present results from a next-generation sequencing study of a large inherited retinal disease patient population, with the goal of providing clear and actionable genetic diagnoses. Targeted sequencing was performed on 539 individuals from 309 inherited retinal disease pedigrees. Causative mutations were identified in the majority (57%, 176/309) of pedigrees. We report the association of many previously unreported variants with retinal disease, as well as new disease phenotypes associated with known genes, including the first association of the SLC24A1 gene with retinitis pigmentosa. Population statistics reporting the genes most commonly implicated in retinal disease in the cohort are presented, as are some diagnostic conundrums that can arise during such studies. Inherited retinal diseases represent an exemplar group of disorders for the application of panel-based next-generation sequencing as an effective tool for detection of causative mutations.","dc:creator":"Carrigan M","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Panel-Based Population Next-Generation Sequencing for Inherited Retinal Degenerations."}},{"id":"cggv:5aa5b9f7-86b5-405a-acba-34c28d28a148_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0e337146-ed15-4e12-8c10-bca8b7031faa"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27624628"}],"rdfs:label":"Table 1 - CNGA3"},{"id":"cggv:a227a1c6-55bf-4dac-ae72-6025dc8df14d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a227a1c6-55bf-4dac-ae72-6025dc8df14d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:5aa5b9f7-86b5-405a-acba-34c28d28a148","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5aa5b9f7-86b5-405a-acba-34c28d28a148_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c1cc49a6-f4da-4b61-ad09-14c38d663879_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c1cc49a6-f4da-4b61-ad09-14c38d663879","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:2b8cea1e-92f3-40ab-b26e-064676326ce0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001298.3(CNGA3):c.586C>T (p.Gln196Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347831713"}},{"id":"cggv:2e747d5b-1aed-4e2d-bdfc-5b8179dd4a70","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001298.3(CNGA3):c.1137_1139del (p.Phe380del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573048344"}}],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:b1faa26b-dff2-4a01-a705-9b1ee76ea3e5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2b8cea1e-92f3-40ab-b26e-064676326ce0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25637600"},{"id":"cggv:1e144639-3ba9-40b4-a9cb-c3b3e42cd37f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2e747d5b-1aed-4e2d-bdfc-5b8179dd4a70"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25637600"}],"rdfs:label":"F8-II1"},{"id":"cggv:b1faa26b-dff2-4a01-a705-9b1ee76ea3e5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b1faa26b-dff2-4a01-a705-9b1ee76ea3e5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:1e144639-3ba9-40b4-a9cb-c3b3e42cd37f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1e144639-3ba9-40b4-a9cb-c3b3e42cd37f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:39fe36b7-54c3-486b-a9f9-19bce71f096e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:39fe36b7-54c3-486b-a9f9-19bce71f096e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4c4fa6a6-eacc-4459-988c-e0f81f3d2537","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:946fd580-aa75-4e0c-81d3-c26237a0dcd8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"To determine the impact of the p.Cys319Arg variant on the channel function of CNGA3, we performed a ligand-induced calcium permeability assay using human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells heterologously expressing either homo-oligomeric (only CNGA3) or hetero-oligomeric (CNGA3 þ CNGB3) channels. In contrast to the wild-type protein, the CNGA3 channel harboring the p.Cys319Arg alteration did not mediate any 8-Br-cGMP-induced calcium influx when expressed either alone or together with the wild-type CNGB3 subunit (Table 3).\nTo confirm the expression of the CNGA3 mutant channel (CNGA3C319R) in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, we performed western blot analysis using enriched membrane fractions and an\nanti-CNGA3 antibody.

The half-maximal activating concentration (K(1/2)) for cGMP in the homomeric CNGA3-T565M channels (160microM) was 17.8-fold higher than that of the homomeric wild-type CNGA3 channels (9.0microM).

Herein, we report the development of novel engineered rAAV vectors that enable efficient targeting of photoreceptors via less invasive intravitreal administration. A unique in vivo selection procedure was performed, where an AAV2-based peptide-display library was intravenously administered in mice, followed by isolation of vector DNA from target cells after only 24 h. This stringent selection yielded novel vectors, termed AAV2.GL and AAV2.NN, which mediate widespread and high-level retinal transduction after intravitreal injection in mice, dogs and non-human primates. Importantly, both vectors efficiently transduce photoreceptors in human retinal explant cultures.

Achromatopsia is a rare congenital autosomal recessive disorder characterized by photophobia, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and the complete inability to discriminate between colors. Later studies showed that patients with biallelic pathogenic CNGA3 variants can also have cone-rod dystrophy (PMID: 24903488; PMID: 11536077). Based on the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, these disorders are lumped together as CNGA3-related retinopathy. \n15 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 11 probands are included in this curation (PMID: 9662398; 27624628; 25637600; 24903488; 25052312). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Notably, four variants (p.R277C, p.R283W, p.R435W, and p.F547L) were reported to account for >40% of all detected variants (PMID: 11536077). Biallelic CNGA3 variants have been demonstrated to segregated in at least 5 families with three or more affected individuals (PMID: 9662398; 25637600; 24903488; 25052312). \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. In-vitro studies demonstrated that decreased expression of CNGA3 in the cell membrane of p.Cys319Arg knock-in HEK293 cells possibly as a result of reduced protein stability (PMID: 25052312). In the Muraki-Oda et al study, they identified 32 missense CNGA3 variants with ablated channel functions in an in-vitro study (PMID:17693388). In the Paylou et al study using a CNGA3-/-mouse model, the achromatopsia phenotype was rescued using intravitreal CNGA3 delivery using AAV2.GL, leading to cone-specific expression of CNGA3 protein. \nIn summary, CNGA3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive CNGA3-related retinopathy. This has been repeated demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:39fe36b7-54c3-486b-a9f9-19bce71f096e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
