The use of fibrinogen(Nieuwegein)-derived fibrin (fibrin(Nieuwegein)) in an in vitro angiogenesis model resulted in a strong reduction of tube formation. The ingrowth of human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC) was independent of alpha(v)beta(3), indicating that the reduced ingrowth is not due to the absence of the RGD-adhesion site at position Aalpha 572-574.

Fibrinogen gene expression is controlled by the activity of proximal promoters which contain binding sites for hepatocyte transcription factors, including proteins which influence fibrinogen transcription in response to acute-phase inflammatory stimuli. The fibrinogen gene cluster also contains cis regulatory elements; enhancer sequences with liver activities identified by sequence conservation and functional genomics. While the transcriptional control of this gene cluster is fascinating biology, the medical impetus to understand fibrinogen gene regulation stems from the association of cardiovascular disease risk with high level circulating fibrinogen. In the general population this level varies from about 1.5 to 3.5 g/l. This variation between individuals is influenced by genotype, suggesting there are genetic variants contributing to fibrinogen levels which reside in fibrinogen regulatory loci. A complete picture of how fibrinogen genes are regulated will therefore point towards novel sources of regulatory variants. In this review we discuss regulation of the fibrinogen genes from proximal promoters and enhancers, the influence of acute-phase stimulation, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs and functional regulatory variants identified in genetic studies.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 30 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is characterized by quantitative and qualitative defects in fibrinogen. It may manifest as afibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia. Clinical symptoms include a bleeding diathesis and/or a thrombotic phenotype. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 11 probands in 6 publications (PMID:11460510, 11739173, 11354637, 10602365, 11159525, 14615374). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be heterozygous as well as biallelic loss of function. (PMID: 10602365, 11460510). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): FGA encodes the α subunit of the coagulation factor, fibrinogen, which is a hexamer of three subunit chains (PMID: 22836683). The Aα fibrinopeptide interacts with thrombin, which catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (PMID: 15572239). It is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma (PMID: 20921339). Mouse and zebrafish models are reported that recapitulate fibrinogen deficiency (PMID: 7649481, 24553182).   \n\nIn summary, the FGA-Congenital fibrinogen deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on January 22, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nLumping & Splitting information: OMIM assertions - (1) Congenital Afibrinogenemia (MIM: 202400); (2) Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia (MIM: 616004); (3) Congenital Hypodysfibrinogenemia (MIM: 616004); (4) Familial Visceral Amyloidosis (MIM: 105200).
