Mutations in MBTPS2 have been recently reported in Olmsted syndrome, underscoring the overlap and the confusion in separating Olmsted from IFAP syndrome. We studied a Lebanese family with IFAP syndrome both, clinically and molecularly, and investigated whether there is a cross relation between TRPV3 and MBTPS2. We identified a recurrent mutation designated p.F475S in MBTPS2 in the affected individuals. This mutation was not found in 100 control individuals from the same population. We determined that TRPV3 regulatory region is a target for MBTPS2. In addition, there was an increased cell death in the cells transfected with the mutant versus the wild-type MBTPS2.

The IFAP syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic disorder characterized by the triad of follicular ichthyosis, atrichia, and photophobia. Case Report. A three-month-old Caucasian, male patient was observed with noncicatricial universal alopecia and persistent eczema from birth. He had dystrophic nails, spiky follicular hyperkeratosis, and photophobia which became apparent at the first year of life. Short stature and psychomotor developmental delay were also noticed. Histopathological examination of skin biopsy on left thigh showed epidermis with irregular acanthosis, lamellar orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, and hair follicles fulfilled by parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. The chromosomal study showed a karyotype 46, XY. Total IgE was 374 IU/mL. One missense mutation c.1360G>C (p.Ala454Pro) in hemizygosity was detected on the MBTPS2 gene thus confirming the diagnosis of IFAP syndrome. Conclusions. We describe a boy with a typical clinical presentation of IFAP syndrome and severe atopic manifestations. A novel missense mutation c.1360G>C (p.Ala454Pro) in MBTPS2 gene was observed. The phenotypic expression of disease is quantitatively related to a reduced function of a key cellular regulatory system affecting cholesterol and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. It can cause epithelial disturbance with failure in differentiation of epidermal structures and abnormal skin permeability barrier. However, no correlation phenotype/genotype could be established.

Functional analysis revealed that this mutation was the most severe mutation identified to date for this syndrome. None of the male German patients had been tested for the mutation because they had several visceral and bone anomalies, and had died as neonates or infants. The clinical features of our 5-year-old patient are less severe than those of the German patients. Although he has neurological abnormalities, such as retarded psychomotor development and seizures, he does not have bone or visceral anomalies, except cryptorchidism.

This disease was initially characterized by the triad of Ichthyosis Follicularis, Atrichia, and Photophobia (IFAP syndrome). Later, variants in this gene were also observed in individuals with additional features, including Brain anomalies, severe mental Retardation, Ectodermal dysplasia, Skeletal malformations, Hirschsprung disease, Ear/eye anomalies, Cleft palate/cryptorchidism, and Kidney dysplasia/hypoplasia (BRESHECK syndrome). Evidence suggests that there is no difference in the molecular mechanism underlying IFAP and BRESHECK syndromes and they are within the same phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, for the purposes of this curation, they have been lumped into one disease entity, IFAP syndrome with or without BRESHECK syndrome. Neurodevelopmental features are commonly found in individuals with IFAP syndrome, including developmental delay (32%), intellectual disability (39%), seizures (28%), and hypotonia (8%) (PMID: 21600032). Since 2009, 11 MBTPS2 variants in 17 male probands with X-linked IFAP/BRESHECK syndrome have been reported in 11 publications. In addition to the classic triad of IFAP, all of them had neurodevelopmental phenotypes and were hemizygous for missense variants. Complementation analysis and luciferase reporter assays in cell culture demonstrated impaired protein function for the variants studied, with residual activity (PMID: 19361614, 23316014). These studies indicate a partial loss-of-function disease mechanism, and suggest that complete null alleles may cause embryonic lethality in hemizygous males. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/16/2020 (SOP Version 8). \nPlease note, due to a known issue in which the Gene Curation Interface is capping the total number of points allotted for missense variants at 7 points (not yet reflective of the change in scoring in SOP version 8), the total number of points for genetic evidence is not reflecting the true amount, which is the maximum of 12 points.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:13a8a124-1071-4150-b6ea-0165cbf41c2d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
