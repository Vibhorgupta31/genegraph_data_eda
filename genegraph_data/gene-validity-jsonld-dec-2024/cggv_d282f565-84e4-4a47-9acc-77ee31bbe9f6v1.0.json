To date, over 50 patients have been reported suffering from ADSL deficiency. We report all seven so far diagnosed Polish patients with this defect. Most of our patients shared intractable seizures and psychomotor retardation since the neonatal period and had biochemical evidence of severe (type I) deficiency. Two patients with type II suffered only from mild/moderate psychomotor retardation and showed a transientvisual contact disturbance. One patient had a fatal neonatal form of ADSL deficiency with lack of spontaneous movement, respiratory failure, severe encephalopathy and intractable seizures. Analysis of the ADSL gene showed that four apparently unrelated patients carried a R426H mutation (two homozygous and two compound heterozygous). With the exception of the latter mutation, a Y114H mutation that had been reported previously, and a novel mutation T242I, all other mutations (including D268H and three novel S23R, D215H and I351T mutations) were found only in single families in single alleles.

ADSL deficiency is a selectively neuronopathic disorder with psychomotor retardation and epilepsy as leading traits. Both dephosphorylated enzyme substrates, succinylaminoimidazole-carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado), accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of affected individuals with S-Ado/SAICAr concentration ratios proportional to the phenotype severity. We studied the disorder at various levels in a group of six patients with ADSL deficiency. We identified the complete ADSL cDNA and its alternatively spliced isoform resulting from exon 12 skipping. Both mRNA isoforms were expressed in all the tissues studied with the non-spliced form 10-fold more abundant. Both cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli and functionally characterized at the protein level. The results showed only the unspliced ADSL to be active. The gene consists of 13 exons spanning 23 kb. The promotor region shows typical features of the housekeeping gene. Eight mutations were identified in a group of six patients. The expression studies of the mutant proteins carried out in an attempt to study genotype-phenotype correlation showed that the level of residual enzyme activity correlates with the severity of the clinical phenotype. All the mutant enzymes studied in vitro displayed a proportional decrease in activity against both of their substrates. However, this was not concordant with strikingly different concentration ratios in the CSF of individual patients. This suggests either different in vivo enzyme activities against each of the substrates and/or their different turnover across the CSF-blood barrier, which may be decisive in determining disease severity.","dc:creator":"Kmoch S","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Human adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), cloning and characterization of full-length cDNA and its isoform, gene structure and molecular basis

Patients with type I (severe form) present with a purely neurologic clinical picture characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, early onset of seizures, and autistic features. A more slowly progressing form has also been described (type II, moderate or mild form), as having later onset, usually within the first years of life, slight to moderate psychomotor retardation and transient contact disturbances. Diagnosis is facilitated by demonstration of SAICAr and S-Ado in extracellular fluids such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and/or followed by genomic and/or cDNA sequencing and characterization of mutant proteins. Over 50 ADSL mutations have been identified and their effects on protein biogenesis, structural stability and activity as well as on purinosome assembly were characterized. To date there is no specific and effective therapy for ADSL deficiency.

The phenotypic severity differs considerably among patients: neonatal fatal, severe childhood, and moderate phenotypic forms correlating with different values for the ratio between S-Ado and SAICAr concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid have been distinguished. To reveal the biochemical and structural basis for this phenotypic heterogeneity, we expressed and characterized 19 ADSL mutant proteins identified in 16 patients representing clinically distinct subgroups. Respecting compound heterozygosity and considering the homotetrameric structure of ADSL, we used intersubunit complementation and prepared and characterized genotype-specific heteromeric mutant ADSL complexes. We correlated clinical phenotypes with biochemical properties of the mutant proteins and predicted structural impacts of the mutations. We found that phenotypic severity in ADSL deficiency is correlated with residual enzymatic activity and structural stability of the corresponding mutant ADSL complexes and does not seem to result from genotype-specific disproportional catalytic activities toward one of the enzyme substrates. This suggests that the S-Ado/SAICAr ratio is probably not predictive of phenotype severity; rather, it may be secondary to the degree of the patient's development (i.e., to the age of the patient at the time of sample collection).","dc:creator":"Zikanova M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Biochemical and structural analysis of 14 mutant adsl enzyme complexes and correlation to phenotypic heterogeneity of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Decreased enzyme function from patient variants in E. coli"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:54532248-1145-4c6f-b379-0cb85e4ebeec","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd93e0a7-4b7a-4629-bbe6-51e9fef2ed11","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"CSF, plasma and urine from ADSL deficiency patients show high levels of SAICAr and S-Ado as a key feature of diagnosis in demonstrating lack of ADSL enzyme function","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25112391","rdfs:label":"SAICAr and S-Ado metabolites in ADSL deficiency patients"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1411,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:64f52ae7-d5f8-4100-9928-0159d8f09898","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0007068","gene":"hgnc:291","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"ADSL was first reported in association with autosomal recessive adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency in 1984 (PMID: 6150139). ADSL deficiency results in psychomotor retardation, seizures, hypotonia and autistic behaviors, and encompasses a wide phenotypic spectrum with three forms: neonatal fatal, severe (type I) and mild (type II) (PMID: 25112391, 18524658, 10888601). ADSL deficiency is diagnosed biochemically by the presence of two compounds, succinylaminoimidazole cardoxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado), that occur as a result of deficient ADSL enzyme function. At least 80 patients with ADSL deficiency have been reported to date with over 50 variants identified, including missense, nonsense, frameshift and in-frame indels (PMID: 25112391, 18524658, 10888601). Pathogenic ADSL variants result in decreased or impaired ADSL enzyme function, indicating homozygous loss-of-function as the mechanism of disease. The gene-disease association is further supported by biochemical and functional assays (PMID: 20127976). In summary, the ADSL gene is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ADSL deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Working Group on 09/07/2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d282f565-84e4-4a47-9acc-77ee31bbe9f6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
