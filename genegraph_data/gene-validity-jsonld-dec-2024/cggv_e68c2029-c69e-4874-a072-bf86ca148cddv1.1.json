The course is chronic progressive with additional episodes of rapid deterioration, provoked by fever and minor head trauma. A previous study showed that mutations in the genes encoding the epsilon- or the beta-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B, a complex consisting of five subunits, cause the disease in most patients. Seven unsolved patients remained. The unsolved patients were investigated by mutation analysis of the genes encoding the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subunit of eIF2B and the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of eIF2, because phosphorylation of this latter subunit regulates eIF2B activity. Mutations were found in the genes encoding the alpha- (1 patient), gamma- (2 patients), and delta-subunits (2 patients) of eIF2B, but no mutations were found in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of eIF2. In 2, both less typical patients, no mutations were found. Mutations in all five genes eIF2B subunit genes can cause VWM. eIF2B is essential for the initiation of translation of RNA into protein and is involved in regulation of the process, especially under circumstances of stress, such as fever. A defect in eIF2B may explain the sensitivity to stress factors in vanishing white matter patients.","dc:creator":"van der Knaap MS","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mutations in each of the five subunits of translation initiation factor eIF2B can cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e68c2029-c69e-4874-a072-bf86ca148cdd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e68c2029-c69e-4874-a072-bf86ca148cdd_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d48a0716-e06b-47fd-bde6-43917bd310c8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9561df3b-a56d-4565-91d2-e36527193d32","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"eIF2B is a decameric, a dimer of eIF2B (beta, gamma, delta, epsilon) tetramers stabilized by 2 copies of eIF2B.

Certain mutations in the EIF2B genes cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), an often serious neurological disorder. Comprising 5 subunits, α-ε (eIF2Bε being the catalytic one), eIF2B has always been considered an αβγδε heteropentamer. We have analyzed the subunit interactions within mammalian eIF2B by using a combination of mass spectrometry and in vivo studies of overexpressed complexes to gain further insight into the subunit arrangement of the complex. Our data reveal that eIF2B is actually decameric, a dimer of eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers stabilized by 2 copies of eIF2Bα. We also demonstrate a pivotal role for eIF2Bδ in the formation of eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers. eIF2B(αβγδε)2 decamers show greater binding to eIF2 than to eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers, which may underlie the increased activity of the former. We examined the levels of eIF2B subunits in a panel of different mouse tissues and identified different levels of eIF2B subunits, particularly eIF2Bα, which implies heterogeneity in the cellular proportions of eIF2B(αβγδε) and eIF2B(βγδε) complexes, with important implications for the regulation of translation in individual cell types.","dc:creator":"Wortham NC","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Analysis of the subunit organization of the eIF2B complex reveals new insights into its structure and regulation."},"rdfs:label":"Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e68c2029-c69e-4874-a072-bf86ca148cdd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2acd4962-98c7-4b7a-bfbf-abd15ec8a5ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9451953f-5405-4e9a-9235-bead8d3775fc","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Model recapitulates myelin defects seen in patients with VWM.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33517449","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Leukodystrophy with vanishing white matter (VWM), also called Childhood Ataxia with Central Nervous System Hypomyelination, is caused by mutations in the subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4 or EIF2B5. However, little is known regarding the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, and there is no curative treatment for VWM. In this study, we established the first EIF2B3 animal model for VWM disease in vertebrates by CRISPR mutagenesis of the highly conserved zebrafish ortholog eif2b3. Using CRISPR, we generated two mutant alleles in zebrafish eif2b3, 10- and 16-bp deletions, respectively. The eif2b3 mutants showed defects in myelin development and glial cell differentiation, and increased expression of genes in the induced stress response pathway. Interestingly, we also found ectopic angiogenesis and increased VEGF expression. Ectopic angiogenesis in the eif2b3 mutants was reduced by the administration of VEGF receptor inhibitor SU5416. Using the eif2b3 mutant zebrafish model together with in silico protein modeling analysis, we demonstrated the pathogenicity of 18 reported mutations in EIF2B3, as well as of a novel variant identified in a 19-month-old female patient: c.503 T > C (p.Leu168Pro).

We present the case of a patient with an infantileonset VWM with the pre-described specific clinical course, subsequent neurological aggravation induced by each viral infection, and the noted consequent progression into a comatose state. Although the initial brain magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal specific pathognomonic signs of VWM to distinguish it from other types of demyelinating leukodystrophy, the next-generation sequencing studies identified heterozygous missense variants in EIF2B3, including a novel variant in exon 7 (C706G), as well as a 0.008% frequency reported variant in exon 2 (T89C). Hence, the characteristic of unbiased genomic sequencing can clinically affect patient care and decisionmaking, especially in terms of the consideration of genetic disorders such as

white matter (VWM) disease, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, is one of the most prevalent inherited leukoencephalopathies in childhood. It is a hereditary human disease resulting from the direct defects during protein synthesis, with the gene defects in EIF2B1-5 (identified in 2001-2002) encoding the five subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF2B alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon), respectively. Most of the published studies were carried out in the white population. The analysis of clinical features and EIF2B mutation screening were performed in 11 Chinese patients for the first time. Mutations were identified exclusively in EIF2B5 and EIF2B3 in these patients, with six novel mutations, including five missense mutations (EIF2B5: c.185A>T, p.D62V; c.1004G>C, p.C335S; c.1126A>G, p.N376D; EIF2B3: c.140G>A, p.G47E; c.1037T>C, p.I346T) and one deletion leading to amino-acid deletion (EIF2B5: c.1827-1838del, p.S610-D613del). EIF2B3 mutation, accounting for 20% of the total number of mutations found in this study, is more prevalent than expected according to an earlier report (7%). A hot spot mutation in EIF2B3 was identified in this study. A unique EIF2B mutation spectrum in Chinese VWM patients was shown.

Individuals with EIF2B3-related leukoencephalopathy present with gait dysfunction, spasticity, cognitive decline, and white matter abnormalities on MRI.  Some individuals develop ovarian failure. Onset is variable from infancy to adulthood, and progression of disease is often in the setting of fever, trauma, or stress. Vanishing white matter disease has also been referred to as Childhood Ataxia with Central Nervous System Hypomyelination (CACH). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found that a phenotypic spectrum exists and there is no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, we chose to curate this gene-disease relationship under the disease term leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter 3 (OMIM:606273, MONDO:0957871). \n\nSixteen variants (missense, frameshift) that have been reported in 14 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 11835386, 37171481, 15136673, 28904586, 31072091, 21484434, 22312164, 35389136, 38872124, 28597716, 19158808) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, (PMIDs: 33517449, 24532666). The zebrafish model is associated with defects in myelin development and glial cell differentiation as well as increased expression of genes in the induced stress response pathway.  Protein interaction studies have shown that the subunit encoded by EIF2B3 interacts with the subunit of a previously curated gene EIF2B5.   In summary, definitive evidence supports the relationship between EIF2B3 and autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date October 16, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e68c2029-c69e-4874-a072-bf86ca148cdd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
