Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes produce the long-QT syndrome, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Here, we show that long-QT mutations located in the KCNQ1 C terminus impair calmodulin (CaM) binding, which affects both channel gating and assembly. The mutations produce a voltage-dependent macroscopic inactivation and dramatically alter channel assembly. KCNE1 forms a ternary complex with wild-type KCNQ1 and Ca(2+)-CaM that prevents inactivation, facilitates channel assembly, and mediates a Ca(2+)-sensitive increase of IKS-current, with a considerable Ca(2+)-dependent left-shift of the voltage-dependence of activation. Coexpression of KCNQ1 or IKS channels with a Ca(2+)-insensitive CaM mutant markedly suppresses the currents and produces a right shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation. KCNE1 association to KCNQ1 long-QT mutants significantly improves mutant channel expression and prevents macroscopic inactivation. However, the marked right shift in channel activation and the subsequent decrease in current amplitude cannot restore normal levels of IKS channel activity. Our data indicate that in healthy individuals, CaM binding to KCNQ1 is essential for correct channel folding and assembly and for conferring Ca(2+)-sensitive IKS-current stimulation, which increases the cardiac repolarization reserve and hence prevents the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.","dc:creator":"Shamgar L","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Calmodulin is essential for cardiac IKS channel gating and assembly: impaired function in long-QT mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Multiple"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3cc2a1ae-5f3d-445c-b124-f3d38fdd070a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3cc2a1ae-5f3d-445c-b124-f3d38fdd070a_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee549ca9-2b88-47ed-b50a-bc86ac245e6a","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee549ca9-2b88-47ed-b50a-bc86ac245e6a_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","caseCohort":{"id":"cggv:22e86a58-7f17-474e-80c2-a8339a5c013a","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":39,"alleleFrequency":0,"detectionMethod":"Exome sequencing, analysis focused on CALM genes, confirmation of variants by sanger sequencing","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee549ca9-2b88-47ed-b50a-bc86ac245e6a_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":0,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0002442"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"cggv:ddc2ed69-c89d-4090-bd3a-04d1abc03ef5","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":60706,"alleleFrequency":0.0003788752347379172,"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ee549ca9-2b88-47ed-b50a-bc86ac245e6a_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":23},"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969752","rdfs:label":"39 LQTS cases, mayo clinic"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No CALM3 mutations have been found in this study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"cggv:3cc2a1ae-5f3d-445c-b124-f3d38fdd070a_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8381f6a5-9a36-4005-94de-3a776efc7e82_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f5c8273f-4aab-4c12-baae-45c5b85e03eb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":3,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Clinical genetic testing Negative for KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:8381f6a5-9a36-4005-94de-3a776efc7e82_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:b3b36da0-52aa-49bc-a1e1-b59466883999","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005184.4(CALM3):c.286G>C (p.Asp96His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16616292"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28491681","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Chaix MA","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Novel CALM3 mutations in pediatric long QT syndrome patients support a CALM3-specific calmodulinopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28491681","rdfs:label":"02"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Very likely to be de-novo"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3cc2a1ae-5f3d-445c-b124-f3d38fdd070a_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3ea91da2-b7fe-4305-b06d-4ec769d61932_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:27dcd757-10e0-4eaf-8bf0-66d7e1487293","type":"Proband","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3ea91da2-b7fe-4305-b06d-4ec769d61932_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:57a2452d-4c50-4207-8f3a-5456a3f873bf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005184.4(CALM3):c.281A>C (p.Asp94Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16616071"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31170290","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Calmodulinopathies are rare life-threatening arrhythmia syndromes which affect mostly young individuals and are, caused by mutations in any of the three genes (CALM 1-3) that encode identical calmodulin proteins.

is a calcium-binding protein that is essential for multiple intracellular processes including modulation of cardiac ion channels. An exactly identical calmodulin protein is encoded by 3 separate genes, CALM1-3, located on different chromosomes (14, 2 and 19, respectively). \nIn 2013 Crotti et al. were the first to identify de-novo missense variants in CALM1 and CALM2 in 2 patients with a unique phenotype (PMID 23388215). Both were infants presenting with marked QT prolongation, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and intermittent AV block. Subsequent studies identified multiple similar cases with de-novo variants in one of the 3 CALM genes. Based on this evidence the Expert Panel classified all calmoudulin genes (CALM1-3) as having a 'Definitive' level of evidence for disease causation of LQTS with atypical features presenting in childhood. \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams were reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Expert Panel.
