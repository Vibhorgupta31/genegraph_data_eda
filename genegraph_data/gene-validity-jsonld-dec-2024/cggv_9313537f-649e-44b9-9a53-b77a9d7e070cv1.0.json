Unlike the aforementioned human syndrome, Nfix-deficient mice are unable to gain weight and die in the first 3 postnatal weeks, while they also present with a spinal deformation and decreased bone mineralization. These features prompted us to consider NFIX as a candidate gene for Marshall-Smith syndrome (MSS), a severe malformation syndrome characterized by failure to thrive, respiratory insufficiency, accelerated osseous maturation, kyphoscoliosis, osteopenia, and unusual facies. Distinct frameshift and splice NFIX mutations that escaped nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) were identified in nine MSS subjects. NFIX belongs to the Nuclear factor one (NFI) family of transcription factors, but its specific function is presently unknown. We demonstrate that NFIX is normally expressed prenatally during human brain development and skeletogenesis. These findings demonstrate that allelic NFIX mutations trigger distinct phenotypes, depending specifically on their impact on NMD.","dc:creator":"Malan V","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Distinct effects of allelic NFIX mutations on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay engender either a Sotos-like or a Marshall-Smith syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9313537f-649e-44b9-9a53-b77a9d7e070c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9313537f-649e-44b9-9a53-b77a9d7e070c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:15a8d0ac-2d64-43d3-ac5d-3a248de7be0e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b15e44ca-0da5-45d6-a8ee-e643041125a2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Model system is similar to Marshall-Smith syndrome in being associated with failure to thrive, ventricular dilatation and brain issue such as partial agenesis of the corpus callosum.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17353270","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The transcription factor family of nuclear factor I (NFI) proteins is encoded by four closely related genes: Nfia, Nfib, Nfic, and Nfix. A potential role for NFI proteins in regulating developmental processes has been implicated by their specific expression pattern during embryonic development and by analysis of NFI-deficient mice. It was shown that loss of NFIA results in hydrocephalus and agenesis of the corpus callosum and that NFIB deficiency leads to neurological defects and to severe lung hypoplasia, whereas Nfic knockout mice exhibit specific tooth defects. Here we report the knockout analysis of the fourth and last member of this gene family, Nfix. Loss of NFIX is postnatally lethal and leads to hydrocephalus and to a partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. Furthermore, NFIX-deficient mice develop a deformation of the spine, which is due to a delay in ossification of vertebral bodies and a progressive degeneration of intervertebral disks. Impaired endochondral ossification and decreased mineralization were also observed in femoral sections of Nfix-/- mice. Consistent with the defects in bone ossification we could show that the expression level of tetranectin, a plasminogen-binding protein involved in mineralization, is specifically downregulated in bones of NFIX-deficient mice.","dc:creator":"Driller K","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Nuclear factor I X deficiency causes brain malformation and severe skeletal defects."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse KO"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This model is not similar to Malan syndrome so was not scored for this disorder."},{"id":"cggv:5f6b13e3-63a8-4b2e-88d2-64cf69e155e7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2408b2d2-c1ea-450d-8482-feda0f848f78","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The neuroanatomical changes in NFIX+/-  brains likely contribute to deficits in cortically-controlled behavior, which may model intellectual disability and behavioral changes featured in Malan syndrome patients.\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30503862","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Nuclear Factor One X (NFIX) haploinsufficiency in humans results in Malan syndrome, a disorder characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly and intellectual disability.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, Malan overgrowth syndrome (OMIM:614753) and Marshall-Smith syndrome (OMIM:602535). The split curation for autosomal dominant Marshall-Smith syndrome has been curated separately. Malan overgrowth syndrome is characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism, behavioral issues, developmental delay, and abnormal bone morphology. The NFIX gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Malan overgrowth syndrome in 2010 (Malan et al., PMID 20673863). One nonsense, three missense and five unique frameshift alleles have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants reported in 10 unrelated individuals from four publications are included in this curation (PMID: 20673863; Yoneda at al., 2012, PMID: 22301465; Priolo et al., 2018, PMID: 29897170; Tabata et al., 2020, PMID: 32193017). There were no segregation data reported for these cases. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse model experimental data (Oishi et al., 2019, PMID: 30503862). Haploinsufficiency has been proposed as the mechanism of action for alleles associated with Malan overgrowth syndrome. In summary, NFIX is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Malan overgrowth syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 08.03.2022 (SOP Version 9).\nStudies replicated over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9313537f-649e-44b9-9a53-b77a9d7e070c"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
