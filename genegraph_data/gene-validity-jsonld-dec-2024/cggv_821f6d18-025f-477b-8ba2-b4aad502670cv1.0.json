Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"mitochondrial transcript processing & modification"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"scored according to rubric; >10 genes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:821f6d18-025f-477b-8ba2-b4aad502670c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0967df81-8af2-4120-ac96-9b22ee2d1712","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:28cd91f2-ff5c-4bb0-a633-3123dbdd5b56","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"recapitulation of myopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle but not anemia","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27197761","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial myopathy with lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) is an oxidative phosphorylation disorder, with primary clinical manifestations of myopathic exercise intolerance and a macrocytic sideroblastic anemia. One cause of MLASA is recessive mutations in PUS1, which encodes pseudouridine (Ψ) synthase 1 (Pus1p). Here we describe a mouse model of MLASA due to mutations in PUS1. As expected, certain Ψ modifications were missing in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs from Pus1(-/-) animals. Pus1(-/-) mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and were non-dysmorphic. At 14 weeks the mutants displayed reduced exercise capacity. Examination of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle morphology and histochemistry demonstrated an increase in the cross sectional area and proportion of myosin heavy chain (MHC) IIB and low succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) expressing myofibers, without a change in the size of MHC IIA positive or high SDH myofibers. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was significantly reduced in extracts from red gastrocnemius muscle from Pus1(-/-) mice. Transmission electron microscopy on red gastrocnemius muscle demonstrated that Pus1(-/-) mice also had lower intermyofibrillar mitochondrial density and smaller mitochondria. Collectively, these results suggest that alterations in muscle metabolism related to mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity may account for the reduced exercise capacity in Pus1(-/-) mice.","dc:creator":"Mangum JE","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Pseudouridine synthase 1 deficient mice, a model for Mitochondrial Myopathy with Sideroblastic Anemia, exhibit muscle morphology and physiology alterations."},"rdfs:label":"KO mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Pus1−/− mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and were non-dysmorphic.

The *PUS1* gene encodes pseudouridine synthase 1, which functions in mitochondrial transcript processing and modification. \n\nThe *PUS1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2004 (PMID: 15108122) when the molecular defects in families whose phenotype was described as a new syndrome of myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) in 1995 (PMID: 7726239) were identified. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *PUS1*-related disease, including autosomal recessive MLASA (MIM 600462), pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *PUS1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (four stop-gained variants, one frameshift variant, and one missense variant) identified in five individuals from five publications (PMIDs: 15108122, 17056637, 19731322, 25058219, 26556812). Additional evidence is available in the literature (PMIDs: 15971356, 28832011, 25227147), but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. The c.885C>T (p.Arg144Trp) variant is recognized as a founder variant in the Middle Eastern Jewish population. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mitochondrial RNA processing for translation) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and recapitulation of the myopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle observed in human patients in a knockout mouse model (PMID: 27197761). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *PUS1* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 1, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
