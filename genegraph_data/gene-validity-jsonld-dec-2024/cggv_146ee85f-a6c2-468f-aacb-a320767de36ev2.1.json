During the early stages, high levels of POMT1 expression were noted, while at later stages, relatively ubiquitous low-level expression was observed. At E8.5, intense Pomt1 expression was detected in the neuronal tissues. Transcripts were found throughout the neural tube and in the dorsal aspects of the neural folds of the future midbrain region. At E9.0, pronounced expression of Pomt1 transcripts was seen along the neural tube and in the developing eye. At E10.5, Pomt1 transcripts were detected in the somites, the limb-bud mesenchyme, and the developing trigeminal ganglion.

The first mammalian protein O-mannosyltransferase gene described was the human POMT1. Mutations in the hPOMT1 gene are responsible for Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), a severe recessive congenital muscular dystrophy associated with defects in neuronal migration that produce complex brain and eye abnormalities. During embryogenesis, the murine Pomt1 gene is prominently expressed in the neural tube, the developing eye, and the mesenchyme. These sites of expression correlate with those in which the main tissue alterations are observed in WWS patients. We have inactivated a Pomt1 allele by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells and produced chimeras transmitting the defect allele to offspring. Although heterozygous mice were viable and fertile, the total absence of Pomt1(-/-) pups in the progeny of heterozygous intercrosses indicated that this genotype is embryonic lethal. An analysis of the mutant phenotype revealed that homozygous Pomt1(-/-) mice suffer developmental arrest around embryonic day (E) 7.5 and die between E7.5 and E9.5. The Pomt1(-/-) embryos present defects in the formation of Reichert's membrane, the first basement membrane to form in the embryo. The failure of this membrane to form appears to be the result of abnormal glycosylation and maturation of dystroglycan that may impair recruitment of laminin, a structural component required for the formation of Reichert's membrane in rodents. The targeted disruption of mPomt1 represents an example of an engineered deletion of a known glycosyltransferase involved in O-mannosyl glycan synthesis.","dc:creator":"Willer T","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Targeted disruption of the Walker-Warburg syndrome gene Pomt1 in mouse results in embryonic lethality."},"rdfs:label":"Willer_Mouse embryonic expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:4d8424e5-3871-4c72-9aaa-adf1407b635d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:617d8017-6899-4633-a328-080b6f550108","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Expression plasmids with Myc-tagged human POMT1 cDNA and human POMT2 cDNA were transfected into HEK293T cells.

Many of these inherited disorders share a common etiology: defective O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin complex. Protein-O-mannosyl transferase 1 (POMT1) is the first enzyme required for the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and mutations in the POMT1 gene can lead to both Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2K (LGMD2K). WWS is associated with severe mental retardation and major structural abnormalities in the brain; however, LGMD2K patients display a more mild retardation with no obvious structural defects in the brain. In a screen for synaptic mutants in Drosophila, we identified mutations in the Drosophila ortholog of POMT1, dPOMT1. Because synaptic defects are a plausible cause of mental retardation, we investigated the molecular and physiological defects associated with loss of dPOMT1 in Drosophila. In dPOMT1 mutants, there is a decrease in the efficacy of synaptic transmission and a change in the subunit composition of the postsynaptic glutamate receptors at the neuromuscular junction. We demonstrate that dPOMT1 is required to glycosylate the Drosophila dystroglycan ortholog Dg in vivo, and that this is the likely cause of these synaptic defects because (1) mutations in Dg lead to similar synaptic defects and (2) genetic interaction studies suggest that dPOMT1 and Dg function in the same pathway. These results are consistent with the model that dPOMT1-dependent glycosylation of Dg is necessary for proper synaptic function and raise the possibility that similar synaptic defects occur in the congenital muscular dystrophies.","dc:creator":"Wairkar YP","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Synaptic defects in a Drosophila model of congenital muscular dystrophy."},"rdfs:label":"Wairkar_Drosophila"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The model shows that loss of POMT1 in the fly model leads to reduced alpha-dystroglycan, which is observed in patients with POMT1-related MDD.

Reported phenotypes range from severe congenital onset Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) with severe structural brain and eye involvement, to relatively mild adult onset limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). Specific clinical syndromes were originally described in association with mutations in any one of six demonstrated or putative glycosyltransferases. Work performed on patients with mutations in the FKRP gene has identified that the spectrum of phenotypes due to mutations in this gene is much wider than originally assumed. To further define the mutation frequency and phenotypes associated with mutations in the other five genes, we studied a large cohort of patients with evidence of a dystroglycanopathy. Exclusion of mutations in FKRP was a prerequisite for participation in this study. Ninety-two probands were screened for mutations in POMT1, POMT2, POMGnT1, fukutin and LARGE. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations were detected in a total of 31 probands (34 individuals from 31 families); 37 different mutations were identified, of which 32 were novel. Mutations in POMT2 were the most prevalent in our cohort with nine cases, followed by POMT1 with eight cases, POMGnT1 with seven cases, fukutin with six cases and LARGE with only a single case. All patients with POMT1 and POMT2 mutations had evidence of either structural or functional central nervous system involvement including four patients with mental retardation and a LGMD phenotype. In contrast mutations in fukutin and POMGnT1 were detected in four patients with LGMD and no evidence of brain involvement. The majority of patients (six out of nine) with mutations in POMT2 had a Muscle-Eye-Brain (MEB)-like condition. In addition we identified a mutation in the gene LARGE in a patient with WWS. Our data expands the clinical phenotypes associated with POMT1, POMT2, POMGnT1, fukutin and LARGE mutations. Mutations in these five glycosyltransferase genes were detected in 34% of patients indicating that, after the exclusion of FKRP, the majority of patients with a dystroglycanopathy harbour mutations in novel genes.","dc:creator":"Godfrey C","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Refining genotype phenotype correlations in muscular dystrophies with defective glycosylation of dystroglycan."}},{"id":"cggv:7b736c0a-f420-45f1-8542-10905fce4811_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bedc8ee9-dcbe-4aa2-8a36-8cc676c491af"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17878207"}],"rdfs:label":"Godfrey_Patient 6"},{"id":"cggv:b44e20ef-05fd-4bb2-ab8b-b34c1f29d4da","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b44e20ef-05fd-4bb2-ab8b-b34c1f29d4da_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The proband was compound heterozygous for a delins, Phe173_Asn175delinsAsp, and a missense variant, Arg601Thr.

A similar combination of symptoms is presented by two other human diseases, muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD). Although the genes underlying FCMD (Fukutin) and MEB (POMGnT1) have been cloned, loci for WWS have remained elusive. The protein products of POMGnT1 and Fukutin have both been implicated in protein glycosylation. To unravel the genetic basis of WWS, we first performed a genomewide linkage analysis in 10 consanguineous families with WWS. The results indicated the existence of at least three WWS loci. Subsequently, we adopted a candidate-gene approach in combination with homozygosity mapping in 15 consanguineous families with WWS. Candidate genes were selected on the basis of the role of the FCMD and MEB genes. Since POMGnT1 encodes an O-mannoside N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, we analyzed the possible implication of O-mannosyl glycan synthesis in WWS. Analysis of the locus for O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) revealed homozygosity in 5 of 15 families. Sequencing of the POMT1 gene revealed mutations in 6 of the 30 unrelated patients with WWS. Of the five mutations identified, two are nonsense mutations, two are frameshift mutations, and one is a missense mutation. Immunohistochemical analysis of muscle from patients with POMT1 mutations corroborated the O-mannosylation defect, as judged by the absence of glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. The implication of O-mannosylation in MEB and WWS suggests new lines of study in understanding the molecular basis of neuronal migration.","dc:creator":"Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé D","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mutations in the O-mannosyltransferase gene POMT1 give rise to the severe neuronal migration disorder Walker-Warburg syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé_Family 7-MZ twins"},{"id":"cggv:9e50024b-f46a-42fc-b9d8-849f18c63f87","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9e50024b-f46a-42fc-b9d8-849f18c63f87_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The proband and her twin sister were homozygous for the nonsense variant, Gln363Ter in exon 12/20.

Here, we present evidence that this distinct phenotype results from a common mutation (A200P) in the POMT1 gene. Our findings further expand the phenotype of glycosylation disorders linked to POMT1 mutations. Furthermore, the A200P mutation is part of a conserved core haplotype, indicating an ancestral founder mutation.","dc:creator":"Balci B","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"An autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2) with mild mental retardation is allelic to Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) caused by a mutation in the POMT1 gene."}},"rdfs:label":"Balci_Case 5"},{"id":"cggv:475ca64e-c596-473f-be7d-a3ecc4ea435e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:475ca64e-c596-473f-be7d-a3ecc4ea435e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:475ca64e-c596-473f-be7d-a3ecc4ea435e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 16698797 provides functional evidence for the POMT1-Ala200Pro missense variant by expressing the mutant POMT1 and WT POMT2 in HEK293T cells.

We performed targeted NGS covering 420 genes in 180 patients who were consecutively suspected of LGMDs and underwent muscle biopsies from January 2013 to May 2015. The association between genotype and myopathological profiles was analyzed in the genetically confirmed LGMD patients. With targeted NGS, one or more rare variants were detected in 138 patients, of whom 113 had causative mutations, 10 sporadic patients had one pathogenic heterozygous mutation related to a recessive pattern of LGMDs, and 15 had variants of uncertain significance. No disease-causing mutation was found in the remaining 42 patients. Combined with the myopathological findings, we achieved a positive genetic diagnostic rate as 68.3% (123/180). Totally 105 patients were diagnosed as LGMDs with genetic basis. Among these 105 patients, the most common subtypes were LGMD2B in 52 (49.5%), LGMD2A in 26 (24.8%) and LGMD 2D in eight (7.6%), followed by LGMD1B in seven (6.7%), LGMD1E in four (3.8%), LGMD2I in three (2.9%), and LGMD2E, 2F, 2H, 2K, 2L in one patient (1.0%), respectively. Although some characteristic pathological changes may suggest certain LGMD subtypes, both heterogeneous findings in a certain subtype and overlapping presentations among different subtypes were not uncommon. The application of NGS, together with thorough clinical and myopathological evaluation, can substantially improve the molecular diagnostic rate in LGMDs. Confirming the genetic diagnosis in LGMD patients can help improve our understanding of their myopathological changes.","dc:creator":"Yu M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutational spectrum of Chinese LGMD patients by targeted next-generation sequencing."}},{"id":"cggv:c73e7050-c8e5-49e2-9f17-5b4e53d27e32_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a0187730-da5d-4b34-be2a-cbf7debd1fff"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28403181"}],"rdfs:label":"Yu_Patient 100"},{"id":"cggv:c73e7050-c8e5-49e2-9f17-5b4e53d27e32","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c73e7050-c8e5-49e2-9f17-5b4e53d27e32_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The proband was compound heterozygous for a frameshift variant, NM_001077365.1:c.260dup (p.Leu87PhefsTer11), expected to result in NMD, and a missense variant, NM_001077365.1:c.1351T>C (p.Ser451Pro), reported in the paper as Ser473Pro (NM_007171.4).

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. The POMT1 gene is located on chromosome 9q34.13 and encodes multiple transcript variants. The commonly referred transcript in the literature (NM_007171.4) is 3.1 kb long with 20 exons encoding a 747-amino acid protein. The MANE select transcript, however, is NM_001077365.2, and has been referred in this curation. At least 70 pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive Muscular Dystrophy Dystroglycanopathy are recorded in ClinVar, ranging from small deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing to missense variants. POMT1-related myopathies encompasses a spectrum of phenotypes including severe forms asserted in the literature as Walker-Warburg syndrome and congenital muscular dystrophy with or without intellectual disability and milder forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with or without intellectual disability. LGMD patients often show an elevated serum creatine kinase and progressive muscle weakness. POMT1 has been reported in association with autosomal recessive POMT1-related myopathies as early as 2002 by Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé et al (PMID: 12369018). The first association with the LGMD phenotype was made in 2005 by Balci et al (PMID: 15792865). In curating evidence from the literature, several individuals who were reported to have an LGMD presentation were evaluated if they met the LGMD GCEP-specified phenotype criteria. A few probands (n=5) reported in PMIDs: 22549409, 31311558, 20065251 and 25088310 meet the LGMD phenotype definition specified by the LGMD GCEP.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 21 probands in 11 publications (PMID: 15792865, 12369018, 27193224, 28157257, 25088310, 22549409, 28403181, 20065251, 15792865, 31311558, & 1787820). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. Milder phenotypes have been proposed to arise due to hypomorphic variants. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, and functional assays. POMT1 product is an O-mannosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of O-mannose to alpha-dystroglycan and needs to interacts with the product of POMT2  to form a complex for its emzymatic function (PMID: 16698797). Pathogenic variants in POMT1 result in loss of POMT activity that can be assayed in patient cells as well experimental systems (PMID: 15522202). POMT1 is expressed ubiquitously, but during embryogenesis, it is found in neuronal tissues, including neural tube and eye, somites, and limb-bud mesenchyme (PMID: 15383666). Mice with homozygous knock out of POMT1 die early in embryogenesis, but loss of alpha-dystroglycan is eveident in these embryos. Similar loss of alpha-dystroglycan is also noted in fruit flies (PMID: 18385336).\n\nIn summary, the POMT1-autosomal recessive POMT1-related myopathies gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on ... (SOP Version 7).\n\nOMIM entities: Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies), type A, 1; Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with mental retardation), type B, 1; Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (limb-girdle), type C, 1. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability in the above mentioned disease entities. Therefore, all of the disease entities may be lumped into one disease entity. The LGMD GCEP recommended using the term, POMT1-related myopathies instead of the term, muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy.
