It is caused by mutations in NGLY1, which encodes an enzyme, N-glycanase 1, involved in deglycosylation of glycoproteins, an essential step in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. The disorder has been described in eight patients. We investigated the molecular basis and phenotype of NGLY1-related disorder in an additional patient. The proband is a 14-year-old who presented in early infancy with profound hypotonia and elevated transaminases. Liver biopsy showed lipid accumulation with dilated endoplasmic reticulum. He exhibited global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, seizures, involuntary body movements, muscle atrophy, absent reflexes, and poor growth. He had multiple procedures for lacrimal duct stenosis and strabismus and had intractable blepharitis. He had severe osteopenia and persistent hypocholesterolemia. Whole exome sequencing revealed two novel variants in NGLY1: a truncating mutation, c.347C > G (p.S116X), and a splicing mutation, c.881 + 5G (p.IVS5 + 5G>T), predicted to abolish the splice donor site of exon 5. This study, along with previously reported cases, suggests that mutations in NGLY1 cause a recognizable phenotype and targeted sequencing should be considered in patients with typical presentation. This study expands the molecular spectrum of NGLY1-related condition and suggests that osteopenia and hypocholesterolemia may be part of the phenotype.","dc:creator":"Heeley

Mouse Ngly1 spans 61kb and is composed of 12 exons, the organization of which is conserved throughout vertebrates. Comparison of the mouse and human genomic sequence identifies a conserved gene structure with significant sequence similarity extending into introns. A 2.6kb Ngly1 message was detected in all mouse tissues examined, with the highest abundance in the testis. In addition, a lower molecular weight transcript of 2.4kb was detected in the testis. From analysis of dbESTs the alternative transcript of Ngly1 is predicted to be present in the human placenta.

This association was made using case-level and experimental data. The NGLY1 gene is located on chromosome 3p24.2 and encodes multiple transcript variants. The MANE Select transcript is 2.5 kb long with 12 exons encoding a 654-amino acid protein. More than 50 pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive CDDG 1 are recorded in ClinVar, ranging from small deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing to missense variants. CDDG1 is an infantile-onset disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, abnormal urine oligosaccharides, global developmental delay and other neurological features. NGLY1 has been reported in association with autosomal recessive CDDG1 as early as 2012 by Need et al (PMID: 22581936).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 10 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 22581936, 24651605, 25220016, 27388694, 25707956).
