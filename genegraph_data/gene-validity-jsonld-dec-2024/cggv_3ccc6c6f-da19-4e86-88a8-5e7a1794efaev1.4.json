We sought to identify the underlying genetic etiology in a patient with short stature, irregular growth plates of the proximal phalanges, developmental delay, and mildly dysmorphic facial features. Exome sequencing identified a de novo, heterozygous, nonsense mutation (c.1606C>T:p.R536X) in QRICH1. In vitro studies confirmed that the mutation impaired expression of the QRICH1 protein. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of Qrich1 in primary mouse epiphyseal chondrocytes caused downregulation of gene expression associated with hypertrophic differentiation. We then identified an unrelated individual with another heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in QRICH1 who had a similar phenotype. A recently published study identified QRICH1 mutations in three patients with developmental delay, one of whom had short stature. Our findings indicate that QRICH1 mutations cause not only developmental delay but also a chondrodysplasia characterized by diminished linear growth and abnormal growth plate morphology due to impaired growth plate chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation.","dc:creator":"Lui JC","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"QRICH1 mutations cause a chondrodysplasia with developmental delay."},"rdfs:label":"Skeletal growth and developmental mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5061,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7ab95066-028b-405f-8953-22da86175b6f","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0000508","gene":"hgnc:24713","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.4","dc:description":"*QRICH1* variants were first reported in relation to autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability in 2018 (PMID: 28692176). *QRICH1 *ncodes a protein that functions as a mediator in the integrated stress response by controlling transcription of protein homeostasis under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Clinical features in affected individuals include developmental delay, intellectual delay, and mild dysmorphic facial features At least 7 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, deletion-insertion and missense) reported in  7 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 28692176, 30281152, 33009816) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including a mouse model (PMID: 30281152). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *QRICH1* and autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability.
