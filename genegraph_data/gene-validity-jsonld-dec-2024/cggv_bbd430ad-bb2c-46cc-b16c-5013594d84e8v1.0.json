MBD4-deficient polyps harbored somatic mutations in similar driver genes to sporadic colorectal tumors, although AMER1 mutations were more common and KRAS mutations less frequent.

Here, we report that the Mbd4 DNA glycosylase is protective in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) mouse model of inflammation-driven colon cancer. Mbd4 excises T and U from T:G and U:G mismatches caused by deamination of 5-methylcytosine and cytosine. Since the rate of deamination is higher in inflamed tissues, we investigated the role of Mbd4 in inflammation-driven tumorigenesis. In the AOM/DSS assay, Mbd4-/- mice displayed more severe clinical symptoms, decreased survival, and a greater tumor burden than wild-type (WT) controls. The increased tumor burden in Mbd4-/- mice did not arise from impairment of AOM-induced apoptosis in the intestinal crypt. Histopathological analysis indicated that the colonic epithelium of Mbd4-/- mice is more vulnerable than WT to DSS-induced tissue damage. We investigated the role of the Mbd4-/- immune system in AOM/DSS-mediated carcinogenesis by repeating the assay on WT and Mbd4-/- mice transplanted with WT bone marrow. Mbd4-/- mice with WT bone marrow behaved similarly to Mbd4-/- mice. Together, our results indicate that the colonic epithelium of Mbd4-/- mice is more vulnerable to DSS-induced injury, which exacerbates inflammation-driven tissue injury and cancer.","dc:creator":"Yu AM","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"The Mbd4 DNA glycosylase protects mice from inflammation-driven colon cancer and tissue injury."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded as a significant impact was seen in the isolated DSS treatment assay, but not in the isolated AOM assay.

This condition is a cancer predisposition syndrome with features such as acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, colorectal polyposis and carcinoma, and uveal melanoma. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, autosomal recessive tumor predisposition syndrome (OMIM: 619975) and autosomal dominant uveal melanoma (OMIM: 606660). This curation only focuses on the recessive tumor predisposition syndrome assertion. Susceptibility to uveal melanoma has been curated separately. Six variants (missense, in-frame deletion, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in at least 9 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 30049810, 35381620, 35460607; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2021-154221) are included in this curation. This gene encodes a protein that recognizes methylated CpG sites and has mismatch-specific glycosylase activity that functions in DNA repair. Deleterious variants lead to C>T mutations at CpG sites, which may be enriched in tumors. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a mouse model, functional alteration, and interaction evidence (PMIDs: 17285135, 27086921, 37957685). In the mouse model, homozygous null mice had more serious complications, reduced survival, and a higher tumor burden than wild-type controls. Also, functional alteration evidence showed that MBD4 is necessary for DNA methylation stability and G/T mismatch repair,  and enzymatic activity is impaired in mutants. Furthermore, the gene was shown to interact with the MLH1 and PMS2 genes, both of which are definitive for autosomal recessive mismatch repair cancer syndrome and autosomal dominant Lynch Syndrome. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Predisposition GCEP on the meeting date 7/8/2024 (SOP Version 10).\nThe total score should technically be 11.2 points, as the genetic evidence should sum to 8.2 points (the interface would not allow entry of the exact score of two cases, indicated in the notes for those cases).
