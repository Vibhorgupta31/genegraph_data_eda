ADP released from damaged vessels and red blood cells induces platelet aggregation through activation of the integrin GPIIb-IIIa and subsequent binding of fibrinogen. ADP is also secreted from platelets on activation, providing positive feedback that potentiates the actions of many platelet activators. ADP mediates platelet aggregation through its action on two G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes. The P2Y1 receptor couples to Gq and mobilizes intracellular calcium ions to mediate platelet shape change and aggregation. The second ADP receptor required for aggregation (variously called P2Y(ADP), P2Y(AC), P2Ycyc or P2T(AC)) is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through Gi. The molecular identity of the Gi-linked receptor is still elusive, even though it is the target of efficacious antithrombotic agents, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel and AR-C66096 (ref. 9).

In cells transfected with the Gbetagamma-scavenger beta-ARK1/GRK2 or Rap1GAPII, stimulation with 2MeSADP failed to enhance PKB phosphorylation demonstrating that the signalling proceeds through Gbetagamma-subunits and Rap1. Moreover, Rap1-GTP pull-down assays revealed that P2Y12 receptor stimulation induced a rapid activation of Rap1. Treatment of cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM and inhibition of Src and PLD2 with PP2 or 1-butanol, respectively, abrogated P2Y12 receptor-mediated activation of Rap1 and PKB. In addition inhibition of PKCzeta decreased basal and 2MeSADP-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB indicating a role for this PKC isoform in PKB signalling. Although the increased PKB phosphorylation was abolished in the presence of the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG 1024, 2MeSADP did not significantly increase receptor phosphorylation. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of a 120 kDa IGF-I receptor-associated protein was observed. The latter protein was identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS as the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) that co-operates with Src in a PLD2-dependent manner. Consistent with the signalling towards Rap1 and PKB, activation of Pyk2 was abrogated by Ca2+ chelation, inhibition of PLD2 and IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase activity. In conclusion, the data reveal a novel type of cross-talk between P2Y12 and IGF-I receptors that proceeds through Gbetagamma-, Ca2+-and PLD2-dependent activation of the Pyk2/Src pathway resulting in GTP-loading of Rap1 required for an increased PKB phosphorylation.","dc:creator":"Van Kolen K","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"P2Y12 receptor signalling towards PKB proceeds through IGF-I receptor cross-talk and requires activation of Src, Pyk2 and Rap1."},"rdfs:label":"P2Y12 receptor stimulation induced rapid activation of Rap1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"To confirm the role of Rap1 in P2Y12 receptor-mediated signaling, the authors performed Rap1-GTP pull-down assays at different time points after stimulation of C6 cells with 2MeSADP.

At least six unique variants (one frameshift, and four missenses, 1 start loss)  have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least five probands in five publications (PMIDs: Â 11196645; Â 24612435; 25428217;Â 12578987; 16194207). Strikingly, at least one proband and the family members showed to carry a concomitant mutation in another receptor (PMID: 24612435), which suggested that the variability in the phenotypes may be due to unexplored concomitant common or rare variants in other platelet or hemostatic genes. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function that P2Y12 receptor stimulation induced rapid activation of Rap1 (PMID:Â 16236484), expressionÂ A evidence that P2Y12 receptor is selectively expressed in platelets (PMID:Â 11196645), expression B evidence that reduced P2Y12 receptor expression in patients (PMID: 24612435 ), functional alteration in both patient (PMID:Â 12578987, 16194207) and non-patient cells (PMID:Â 24612435).In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hemostasis Thrombosis GCEP on 08/26/2020. It was reevaluated on 04/02/2023.
