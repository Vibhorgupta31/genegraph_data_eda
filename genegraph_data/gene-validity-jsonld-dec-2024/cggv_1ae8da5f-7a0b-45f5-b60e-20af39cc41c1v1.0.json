Affected individuals present with liver, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and coagulation symptoms; however, the most life-threatening complication is the early onset of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recently, we discovered that oral D-galactose supplementation improved liver disease, endocrine, and coagulation abnormalities, but does not alleviate the fatal cardiomyopathy and the associated myopathy. Here we report on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in 6 individuals with PGM1-CDG. LVEF was pathologically low in most of these individuals and varied between 10% and 65%. To study the pathobiology of the cardiac disease observed in PGM1-CDG, we constructed a novel cardiomyocyte-specific conditional Pgm2 gene (mouse ortholog of human PGM1) knockout (Pgm2 cKO) mouse model. Echocardiography studies corroborated a DCM phenotype with significantly reduced ejection fraction and left ventricular dilation similar to those seen in individuals with PGM1-CDG. Histological studies demonstrated excess glycogen accumulation and fibrosis, while ultrastructural analysis revealed Z-disk disarray and swollen/fragmented mitochondria, which was similar to the ultrastructural pathology in the cardiac explant of an individual with PGM1-CDG. In addition, we found decreased mitochondrial function in the heart of KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis of hearts from mutant mice demonstrated a gene signature of DCM. Although proteomics revealed only mild changes in global protein expression in left ventricular tissue of mutant mice, a glycoproteomic analysis unveiled broad glycosylation changes with significant alterations in sarcolemmal proteins including different subunits of laminin-211, which was confirmed by immunoblot analyses. Finally, augmentation of PGM1 in KO mice via AAV9-PGM1 gene replacement therapy prevented and halted the progression of the DCM phenotype.","dc:creator":"Balakrishnan B","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"AAV-based gene therapy prevents and halts the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy in a mouse model of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency (PGM1-CDG)."},"rdfs:label":"Balakrishnan_cKO rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Default points are awarded for the rescue of the cardiac phenotype in the DCM mouse model of PGM1."},{"id":"cggv:6f601cb2-dc3c-429a-807f-994cd577e5d5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:775a7752-87a9-41e6-aae5-85b0c25b86c8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Constitutive knock-out of Pgm2 (KO) leads to embryonic lethality, which included all homozygotes and several heterozygotes.

Redundancy of PGM1 activity in the brain correlates well with the absence of neurological phenotypes in patients with PGM1 deficiency. The primary role of phosphoglucomutase 1 is to catalyze the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, and it is involved in several crucial metabolic pathways including glycolysis, glycogenolysis, glycogenesis and N-linked glycosylation (PMID: 24499211, 28794993). The clinical manifestations of PGM1-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PGM1-CDG) include bifid uvula, myopathy, hepatopathy, short stature, hypoglycemia and dilated cardiomyopathy.\n \n*PGM1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive PGM1-CDG in 2009 (Stojkovic et al, 2009; PMID: 19625727). More than 30 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 2 publication (PMID: 19625727, 24499211). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached.\n \nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function.\n \nSummary of experimental data (6 points): \nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional studies, model organisms and rescue evidence. The function of *PGM1* is well understood and the onset of symptoms is associated with defects in glycosylation, which can be rescued to an extent by supplementing with galactose (PMID: 24499211, 28794993). Constitutive knock-out of *Pgm2*, the mouse ortholog of human *PGM1*, leads to embryonic lethality (PMID: 31077402). Cardiomyocyte-specific conditional knock-out of *Pgm2* in mice recapitulates the human dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype seen in some patients with PGM1-CDG (PMID: 36709920). The defect in cKO mice is rescued when AAV-mediated WT *Pgm2* is introduced into the affected animals (PMID: 36709920).\n \nIn summary, *PGM1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive PGM1-CDG. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on August 2nd, 2023.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1ae8da5f-7a0b-45f5-b60e-20af39cc41c1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
