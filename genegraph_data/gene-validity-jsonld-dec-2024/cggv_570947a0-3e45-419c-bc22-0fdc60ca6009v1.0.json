High-throughput genomic sequencing of a conservative estimate (24.2 Mb) of the disease locus on chromosome 9 using exon array capture identified independent mutations in TGFBR1 in three unrelated families. Subsequent dideoxy sequencing of TGFBR1 identified 11 distinct monoallelic mutations in 18 affected families, firmly establishing TGFBR1 as the causative gene. The nature of the sequence variants, which include mutations in the extracellular ligand-binding domain and a series of truncating mutations in the kinase domain, indicates a clear genotype-phenotype correlation between loss-of-function TGFBR1 mutations and MSSE. This distinguishes MSSE from the Marfan syndrome-related disorders in which missense mutations in TGFBR1 lead to developmental defects with vascular involvement but no reported predisposition to cancer.","dc:creator":"Goudie DR","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma is caused by a disease-specific spectrum of mutations in TGFBR1."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21358634","rdfs:label":"Family 4-10"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Increase points because 41 affected individuals from 7 Scottish families were reported.

There is abundant evidence published associating the TGFBR1 gene with MSSE, since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Goudie et al. (2011). Multiple case level studies have been performed with MSSE patients that have variants in the TGFBR1 gene. At least 11 different mutations in 18 families were reported. A significant amount of case-level data is available, however the maximum points for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points). Nonsense mediated mRNA decay or loss of heterozygosity were detected in patients' samples. Frequent TGFBR1 mutations are identified in human vemurafenib- or Sorafenib-induced skin lesions and in squamous cell carcinomas with loss of TGFb signalling.
