Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Bicuspid aortic valve, tricuspid atresia, atrioventricular septal defect, congenital heart disease, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular septal defect. Eight unique missense variants have been reported in eight probands in six publications (PMIDs: 23226213, 34363434, 25260786, 30007050, 34426522, 32859249). However, all the missense variants had high minor allele frequency (> 0.00001) in gnomAD v2.1.1 and very low REVEL score, so they were not scored. All of the experimental evidence was performed with these variants, and therefore was not scored (PMIDs: 30007050, 23226213, 34363434). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *NFATC1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *NFATC1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 7/17/2023 (SOP Version 9).\nLack of convincing genetic and experimental evidence","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f8524125-b985-4fa5-bf8c-2cb6202964eb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
