In addition to mesothelioma, some BAP1 mutation carriers developed uveal melanoma. We also found germline BAP1 mutations in 2 of 26 sporadic mesotheliomas; both individuals with mutant BAP1 were previously diagnosed with uveal melanoma. We also observed somatic truncating BAP1 mutations and aberrant BAP1 expression in sporadic mesotheliomas without germline mutations. These results identify a BAP1-related cancer syndrome that is characterized by mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. We hypothesize that other cancers may also be involved and that mesothelioma predominates upon asbestos exposure.

We observed spontaneous malignant tumors in 54 of 93 Bap1-mutant mice (58%) versus 4 of 43 (9%) wild-type littermates. All three Bap1-mutant models exhibited a high incidence and similar spectrum of neoplasms, including ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, lung and mammary carcinomas, and spindle cell tumors.

We show that mouse Bap1 gene deletion is lethal during embryogenesis, but systemic or hematopoietic-restricted deletion in adults recapitulates features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Knockin mice expressing BAP1 with a 3xFlag tag revealed that BAP1 interacts with host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), and the polycomb group proteins ASXL1 and ASXL2 in vivo. OGT and HCF-1 levels were decreased by Bap1 deletion, indicating a critical role for BAP1 in stabilizing these epigenetic regulators. Human ASXL1 is mutated frequently in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) so an ASXL/BAP1 complex may suppress CMML. A BAP1 catalytic mutation found in a MDS patient implies that BAP1 loss of function has similar consequences in mice and humans.","dc:creator":"Dey A","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Loss of the tumor suppressor BAP1 causes myeloid transformation."},"rdfs:label":"Loss of BAP1 causes myeloid transformation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The phenotype in the mouse model is corresponding to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but not mesothelioma and uveal melanoma."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":334,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5c75e040-c7fa-4415-8c95-d7a19978e86a","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013692","gene":"hgnc:950","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"There is abundant published evidence associating the BAP1 gene with BAP1-related tumor predisposition syndrome since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Testa et al. (2011). Multiple case level studies have been performed with patients that have variants in the BAP1 gene. \nImmunohistochemistry on mesotheliomas from multiple families revealed lack of BAP1 nuclear expression. BAP1+/− mice develop more malignant mesotheliomas and spontaneous tumor development was found in three different mouse models with germline heterozygous mutations in Bap1, including two models in which the knock-in mutations are identical to those reported in human BAP1 cancer syndrome families. Re-expression of BAP1 in BAP1-deficient mesothelioma cells markedly decreased colony-forming ability. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the BAP1 gene and BAP1-related tumor predisposition syndrome.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d70c33af-2e4f-4489-9c29-797655015b1d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
