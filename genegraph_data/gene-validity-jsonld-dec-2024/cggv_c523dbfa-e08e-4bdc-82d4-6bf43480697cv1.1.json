Collagen VI was almost completely absent from the UCMD2 extracellular matrix, and when compared with controls, UCMD4, matrix contained significantly less collagen VI. Additionally, Collagen VI tetramers were not detected in UCMD2 culture medium, while UCMD4 secreted reduced amounts of collagen VI. Negative staining electron microscopy was used to visualize the collagen VI tetramers that were secreted by the UCMD fibroblasts. Though tetramers were seen in the medium from UCMD2 cultures, they were extremely rare and microfibril formation was not quantitated. In control fibroblasts, ∼20% of the microfibrils were single tetramers and microfibrils containing up to 10 tetramers were seen. In contrast, medium from UCMD4 cells contained a larger proportion of single tetramers, accounting for 40–60% of the ‘microfibrils’, and microfibrils containing more than six tetramers were not seen.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15563506","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in the three collagen VI genes COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3 cause Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). UCMD, a severe disorder characterized by congenital muscle weakness, proximal joint contractures and marked distal joint hyperextensibility, has been considered a recessive condition, and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been defined in COL6A2 and COL6A3. In contrast, the milder disorder Bethlem myopathy shows clear dominant inheritance and is caused by heterozygous mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3. This model, where dominant mutations cause mild Bethlem myopathy and recessive mutations cause severe UCMD was recently challenged when a patient with UCMD was shown to have a heterozygous in-frame deletion in COL6A1. We have studied five patients with a clinical diagnosis of UCMD. Three patients had heterozygous in-frame deletions in the N-terminal region of the triple helical domain, one in the alpha1(VI) chain, one in alpha2(VI) and one in alpha3(VI). Collagen VI protein biosynthesis and assembly studies showed that these mutations act in a dominant negative fashion and result in severe collagen VI matrix deficiencies. One patient had recessive amino acid changes in the C2 subdomain of alpha2(VI), which prevented collagen VI assembly. No collagen VI mutations were found in the fifth patient. These data demonstrate that rather than being a rare cause of UCMD, dominant mutations are common in UCMD, now accounting for four of the 14 published cases.

Six different genes are recognized in mammalians, encoding six COLVI-chains that assemble as two 'short' (α1, α2) and one 'long' chain (theoretically any one of α3-6). In humans, defects in the most widely expressed heterotrimer (α123), due to mutations in the COL6A1-3 genes, cause a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders, collectively termed COLVI-related muscle disorders. Little is known about the function(s) of the recently described α4-6 chains and no mutations have been detected yet. In this study, we characterized two novel COLVI long chains in zebrafish that are most homologous to the mammalian α4 chain; therefore, we named the corresponding genes col6a4a and col6a4b. These orthologues represent ancestors of the mammalian Col6a4-6 genes. By in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR, we unveiled a distinctive expression kinetics for col6a4b, compared with the other col6a genes. Using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides targeting col6a4a, col6a4b and col6a2, we modelled partial and complete COLVI deficiency, respectively. All morphant embryos presented altered muscle structure and impaired motility. While apoptosis was not drastically increased, autophagy induction was defective in all morphants. Furthermore, motoneuron axon growth was abnormal in these morphants. Importantly, some phenotypical differences emerged between col6a4a and col6a4b morphants, suggesting only partial functional redundancy.

Reverse transcription-PCR amplification performed on RNA extracted from fibroblasts or muscle of three Ullrich patients followed by heteroduplex analysis displayed heteroduplexes in one of the three genes coding for collagen type VI (COL6). In patient A, we detected a homozygous insertion of a C leading to a premature termination codon in the triple-helical domain of COL6A2 mRNA. Both healthy consanguineous parents were carriers. In patient B, we found a deletion of 28 nucleotides because of an A --> G substitution at nucleotide -2 of intron 17 causing the activation of a cryptic acceptor site inside exon 18. The second mutation was an exon skipping because of a G --> A substitution at nucleotide -1 of intron 23. Both mutations are present in an affected brother. The first mutation is also present in the healthy mother, whereas the second mutation is carried by their healthy father. In patient C, we found only one mutation so far-the same deletion of 28 nucleotides found in patient B. In this case, it was a de novo mutation, as it is absent in her parents. mRNA and protein analysis of patient B showed very low amounts of COL6A2 mRNA and of COL6. A near total absence of COL6 was demonstrated by immunofluorescence in fibroblasts and muscle.

The protein's basic structural unit is a heterotrimer of the alpha1(VI), alpha2(VI), and alpha3(VI) chains additionally encoded by the genes *COL6A1* and *COL6A3* to form the triple helical structural element common to collagens. Mutations in Collagen VI have historically been reported in relation to two different conditions. The first, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, was first described in a series of papers in the 1930s by Otto Ullrich and was notable due to occurrence of both weakness and joint hypermobility (Kongenitale atonisch-sklerotische Muskeldystrophie, 1930) and was classically considered a recessive condition. The second, Bethlem myopathy, was reported by Bethlem and van Wijngaarden in 1976 as a dominant myopathy with development of joint contractures (PMID: 963533). Genetic analysis in patients with each of these disorders revealed both dominant and recessive defects in one of the *COL6A1*, *COL6A2*, or *COL6A3* genes that affect the final Collagen VI protein. On the basis of clinical as well as genetic findings, Ullrich CMD and Bethlem myopathy can justifiably be regarded as being positioned at the flanking ends of a continuous spectrum of disease, which also includes limb-girdle and myosclerosis phenotypes, rather than as distinct clinical entities (PMID: 21496625). As such *COL6A2* was curated in relation to a combined disease entity: Collagen 6-Related Myopathy. This disorder illustrates the important role that collagen VI has in skeletal muscle. In addition to progressive muscle weakness and wasting, patients have skin and tendon abnormalities that reflect a more generalized connective tissue disorder. \nDominant and recessive variants are found in patients across the clinical disease spectrum Collagen 6-Related Myopathy. Distinct variants are associated with dominant and recessive inheritance and have been curated separately by the Congenital Myopathies GCEP. Dominant inheritance occurs with dominant negative mutations in the collagen VI triple helical regions, including glycine substitution and exon skip mutations. In contrast, recessive inheritance occurs with loss of function variants; heterozygous carriers of *COL6A2* premature stop variants have no obvious phenotype but patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous premature stop variants completely lack collagen VI and tend to have severe disease.\nMore than 90 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans by ClinVar. Evidence supporting the relationship between *COL6A2* and autosomal recessive Collagen 6-Related Myopathy includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants included in this curation have been reported in at least 9 probands in five publications (PMIDs: 11381124, 15563506, 18852439, 19949035, 17785673). Many other cases are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease association is additionally supported by several pieces of experimental evidence, including its interaction with additional disease-causing genes *COL6A1* and *COL6A3* (PMID: 7768905), its function in the basement membrane surrounding muscle fibers (PMID: 9334230), which is disrupted in patient cells with altered expression in the extracellular matrix (PMID: 15563506), and models in both mice (PMID: 28650483) and zebrafish (PMID: 26362255). In summary, *COL6A2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive collagen 6-related myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
