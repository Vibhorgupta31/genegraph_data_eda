For the cardiac isoform, regulatory phosphorylation in vivo by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) upon adrenergic stimulation is linked to modulation of cardiac contraction. The sequence of human cardiac MyBP-C now reveals regulatory motifs specific for this isoform. Site-directed mutagenesis identifies a LAGGGRRIS loop in the N-terminal region of cardiac MyBP-C as the key substrate site for phosphorylation by both PKA and a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase associated with the native protein. Phosphorylation of two further sites by PKA is induced by phosphorylation of this isoform-specific site. This phosphorylation switch can be mimicked by aspartic acid instead of phosphoserine. Cardiac MyBP-C is therefore specifically equipped with sensors for adrenergic regulation of cardiac contraction, possibly implicating cardiac MyBP-C in cardiac disease. The gene coding for cardiac MyBP-C has been assigned to the chromosomal location 11p11.2 in humans, and is therefore in a region of physical linkage to subsets of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). This makes cardiac MyBP-C a candidate gene for chromosome 11-associated FHC.","dc:creator":"Gautel M","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Phosphorylation switches specific for the cardiac isoform of myosin binding protein-C: a modulator of cardiac contraction?"},"rdfs:label":"Rabbit Heart MyBP-C"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:5ea352a2-4fbd-4d79-8589-c76bd48b1046","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cad14e23-b69c-4684-89aa-521b442e0200","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"MYBPC3 mRNA localized in human and mouse embryonic heart tissue.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9440712","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Cardiac myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a substantial component of the sarcomere, with both structural and regulatory roles.

However, the mechanisms by which MyBP-C mutations cause disease and the function of MyBP-C are not well understood. Therefore, to assess deficits due to elimination of MyBP-C, we used gene targeting to produce a knockout mouse that lacks MyBP-C in the heart. Knockout mice were produced by deletion of exons 3 to 10 from the endogenous cardiac (c) MyBP-C gene in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and subsequent breeding of chimeric founder mice to obtain mice heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) for the knockout allele. Wild-type (+/+), cMyBP-C(+/-), and cMyBP-C(-/-) mice were born in accordance with Mendelian inheritance ratios, survived into adulthood, and were fertile. Western blot analyses confirmed that cMyBP-C was absent in hearts of homozygous knockout mice. Whereas cMyBP-C(+/-) mice were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, cMyBP-C(-/-) mice exhibited significant cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac function, assessed using 2-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography, showed significantly depressed indices of diastolic and systolic function only in cMyBP-C(-/-) mice. Ca2+ sensitivity of tension, measured in single skinned myocytes, was reduced in cMyBP-C(-/-) but not cMyBP-C(+/-) mice.

Mutation screening was done using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. The mutations in MYH7 were projected onto the protein data bank-structure (pdb) of myosin of striated muscle. In MYH7 two mutations (Ala223Thr and Ser642Leu) were found in two patients. Ser642Leu is part of the actin-myosin interface. Ala223Thr affects a buried residue near the ATP binding site. In MYBPC3 we found one missense mutation (Asn948Thr) in a male patient. None of the mutations were found in 88 healthy controls and in 136 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

Though most studies are performed in order to establish diagnoses in individuals with rare and clinically unrecognizable disorders, due to the constantly decreasing costs and commercial availability, whole-exome sequencing has gradually become the initial tool to study patients with clinically recognized disorders when more than one gene is responsible for the phenotype or in complex phenotypes, when variants in more than one gene can be the cause for the disease. Here we report a patient presenting with a complex phenotype consisting of severe, adult-onset, dilated cardiomyopathy, hearing loss and developmental delay, in which exome sequencing revealed two genetic variants that are inherited from a healthy mother: a novel missense variant in the CASK gene, mutations in which cause a spectrum of neurocognitive manifestations, and a second variant, in MYBPC3, that is associated with hereditary cardiomyopathy. We conclude that although the potential for co-occurrence of rare diseases is higher when analyzing undefined phenotypes in consanguineous families, it should also be given consideration in the genetic evaluation of complex phenotypes in non-consanguineous families.","dc:creator":"Reinstein E","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Exome sequencing identified mutations in CASK and MYBPC3 as the cause of a complex dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27173948","rdfs:label":"Reinstein case"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"gnomAD 0.00006.

Genetic mutations have long been considered to be associated with this disease. At present, mutations in over 50 genes related to DCM have been documented. This study was carried out to elucidate the characteristics of gene mutations in patients with DCM. The candidate genes that may cause DCM include MYBPC3, MYH6, MYH7, LMNA, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYPN, MYL3, TPM1, SCN5A, DES, ACTC1 and RBM20. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and subsequent mutation confirmation with traditional capillary Sanger sequencing analysis, possible causative non-synonymous mutations were identified in ~57% (12/21) of patients with DCM. As a result, 7 novel mutations (MYPN, p.E630K; TNNT2, p.G180A; MYH6, p.R1047C; TNNC1, p.D3V; DES, p.R386H; MYBPC3, p.C1124F; and MYL3, p.D126G), 3 variants of uncertain significance (RBM20, p.R1182H; MYH6, p.T1253M; and VCL, p.M209L), and 2 known mutations (MYH7, p.A26V and MYBPC3, p.R160W) were revealed to be associated with DCM. The mutations were most frequently found in the sarcomere (MYH6, MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNC1, TNNT2 and MYL3) and cytoskeletal (MYPN, DES and VCL) genes. As genetic testing is a useful tool in the clinical management of disease, testing for pathogenic mutations is beneficial to the treatment of patients with DCM and may assist in predicting disease risk for their family members before the onset of symptoms.","dc:creator":"Zhao Y","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing of candidate genes reveals novel mutations in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26458567","rdfs:label":"DCM-7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"No functional data.

Patients were genetically screened by capillary electrophoresis single strand conformation polymorphism and subsequently by bidirectional DNA sequencing of conformers in the coding regions of MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, ACTC, MYL2, MYL3, TNNT2, CSRP3 and TNNI3. Eight probands carried disease-associated genetic variants (26%). In MYH7, three novel mutations were found; in MYBPC3, one novel variant and two known mutations were found; and in TNNT2, a known mutation was found. One proband was double heterozygous. We find evidence of phenotypic plasticity: three mutations described earlier as HCM causing were found in four cases of IDC, with no history of a hypertrophic phase. Furthermore, one pedigree presented with several cases of classic DCM as well as one case with left ventricular non-compaction. Disease-causing sarcomere gene mutations were found in about one-quarter of IDC patients, and seem to play an important role in the causation of the disease. The genetics is as complex as seen in HCM. Thus, our data suggest that a genetic work-up should include screening of the most prominent sarcomere genes even in the absence of a family history of the disease.","dc:creator":"Møller DV","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"The role of sarcomere gene mutations in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19293840","rdfs:label":"M29 proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not sufficiently rare (gnomAD 0.0004).

We reviewed our database of 41 cases diagnosed with DCM before 18 years of age who underwent detailed clinical and genetic evaluation, and summarize here the evidence for mutations causing DCM in these cases from 15 genes (PSEN1, PSEN2, CSRP3, LBD3, MYH7, SCN5A, TCAP, TNNT2, LMNA, MYBPC3, MYH6, TNNC1, TNNI3, TPM1, and RBM20). Thirty-five of the 41 pediatric cases had relatives with adult-onset DCM. More males (66%) were found among children diagnosed after 1 year of age with DCM. Nineteen mutations in 9 genes were identified among 15 out of 41 patients; 3 patients (diagnosed at ages 2 weeks, 9 and 13 years) had multiple mutations. Of the 19 mutations identified in 12 families, mutations in TPM1 (32%) and TNNT2 (21%) were the most commonly found. Of the 6 patients diagnosed before 1 year of age, 3 had mutations in TPM1 (including a set of identical twins), 1 in TNNT2, 1 in MYH7, and 1 with multiple mutations (MYH7 and TNNC1). Most DCM was accompanied by advanced heart failure and need for cardiac transplantation. We conclude that in some cases pediatric DCM has a genetic basis, which is complicated by allelic and locus heterogeneity as seen in adult-onset DCM.

At least 70 have been reported in humans. All of these variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance. There were no reports of variants segregating with disease in large families. Ehlermann et al (2008,PMID: 18957093) reported segregation of a splicing variant in a family where two individuals had DCM, but the remainder had HCM. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in one large case-control study  at the aggregate variant level (Mazzarotto et al, 2020, PMID: 31983221). There was no enrichment of MYBPC3 truncating or nontruncating variants in two DCM cohorts vs. ExAC derived controls. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has been assessed separately (definitive, September 5, 2017). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and animal model data. However, expression studies are difficult to interpret given the strong association with HCM (Fougerousse, et al, 1998, PMID: 9440712; Gautel M et al, 1995, PMID: 7744002; Freiburg A et al, 1996, PMID: 8631348; Shaffer et al, 2009, PMID: 19269976). MYBPC3 animal models producing DCM are homozygote only. Heterozygote models produce HCM. Therefore, these animal models have not been scored (McConnell et al, 1999, PMID: 10545522; Harris et al, 2002, PMID: 11909824; Vignier et al, 2009, PMID: 19590044;  Ma et al, 2018, PMID: 31015724; Merkulov et al, 2012, PMID: 22855556)  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of MYBPC3 with DCM. The DCM GCEP made the decision to downgrade this classification to limited due to the genetic evidence being driven entirely by VUSs from cohort studies with no strong pedigree data and limited experimental evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on April 24, 2020.\nCuration group decision to downgrade classification to limited due to the genetic evidence being driven entirely by VUS's from cohort studies with no strong pedigree based data and limited experimental data. Furthermore the recent large cohort study Mazzarotto et al. (PMID:31983221) demonstrated no enrichment of MYBPC3 variants in cases vs. controls.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:652d0370-9574-450c-b7c4-eec86ade9046"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
