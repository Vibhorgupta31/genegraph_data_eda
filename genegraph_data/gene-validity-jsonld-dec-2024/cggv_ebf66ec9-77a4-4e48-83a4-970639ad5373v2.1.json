Hmx1 transcripts were detected in the nasal retina and lens as well as otic vesicles and pharyngeal arches by 24-32 hpf. Before this stage, transcripts were more uniformly expressed in the optic vesicle. Knockdown of hmx1 led to microphthalmia. Delayed withdrawal of retinal progenitors from the cell cycle resulting in retarded retinal differentiation was observed in morphant. The retina and brain also showed an increased cell death at 24 hpf. The polarized expression of hmx1 to the nasal part in the zebrafish retina strongly suggested an involvement in the nasal-temporal patterning.

Moreover, the expression level of uhrf1 and its partner dnmt1 was increased in the eye field in response to hmx1 overexpression.

In some cases, additional features have been reported, most commonly orodental anomalies. Eye and ear anomalies with oculoauricular syndrome are apparent at birth/in infancy. The HMX1 gene (NKX5-3) is part of the NKL subclass of ANTP homeobox genes on 4p16.1. It has a highly conserved 60 amino acid homeodomain. HMX1 is involved in DNA binding. Gene targets include EPHA6, which is a gene implicated in retinal axon guidance (Marcelli et al. 2014, PMID: 24945320). \n\nThree families have been reported in the literature with both the eye and ear phenotype. A consanguineous family with oculoauricular syndrome was first described by Franseschetti & Valerio in 1945. In 2008 Schorderet et al. (PMID: 18423520) reported additional information and family members for the original family and provided the first report of a homozygous HMX1 frameshift variant as the putative cause of disease. In this case, ERG evaluation of the proband revealed progressive rod-cone dystrophy. Since then, 2 additional consanguineous families with oculoauricular syndrome with homozygous HMX1 variants have been reported (Gillespie et al. 2015, PMID: 25574057; Abdel-Salam et al. 2018, PMID: 29140751). In addition, a 4th family, with two affected siblings, both with a homozygous nonsense variant, was identified (PMID: 35946463). In this curation, 4 probands, one from each family reported in the literature, were curated. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by zebrafish, mouse, and human expression data as well as morpholino and zinc-finger-nuclease knockdown/rescue studies in zebrafish (Schorderet et al. 2008, PMID: 18423520; Boisset et al. 2012, PMID: 23068565). Functional alternation studies indicate that an HMX1 mutant failed to activate transcription of reporter constructs (Gillespie et al. 2015, PMID: 25574057). In addition, the Dumbo mouse (dmbo), created in a forward mutagenesis screen, with large/protruding ears and microphthalmia, was found to have a nonsense variant in exon 1 of HMX1 (Munroe et al.2009, PMID: 19379485). \n\nIn summary, there is a definitive association between HMX1 and oculoauricular syndrome. This has been demonstrated multiple times over several years with experimental and genetic evidence.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina gene Curation expert panel on May 6, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ebf66ec9-77a4-4e48-83a4-970639ad5373"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
