More than 80 genes have been implicated to date, and with the advent of targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE+MPS) the rate of novel deafness-gene identification has accelerated. Here we report a family segregating post-lingual progressive autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). After first excluding plausible variants in known deafness-causing genes using TGE+MPS, we completed whole exome sequencing in three hearing-impaired family members. Only a single variant, p.Arg185Pro in HOMER2, segregated with the hearing-loss phenotype in the extended family. This amino acid change alters a highly conserved residue in the coiled-coil domain of HOMER2 that is essential for protein multimerization and the HOMER2-CDC42 interaction. As a scaffolding protein, HOMER2 is involved in intracellular calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal organization. Consistent with this function, we found robust expression in stereocilia of hair cells in the murine inner ear and observed that over-expression of mutant p.Pro185 HOMER2 mRNA causes anatomical changes of the inner ear and neuromasts in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, mouse mutants homozygous for the targeted deletion of Homer2 present with early-onset rapidly progressive hearing loss. These data provide compelling evidence that HOMER2 is required for normal hearing and that its sequence alteration in humans leads to ADNSHL through a dominant-negative mode of action.

Here, we have identified a novel pathogenic variant in HOMER2 in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant, non-syndromic hearing loss. This is the second family reported globally with hearing loss caused by a variant in HOMER2. The pathogenic variant c.840_841insC in HOMER2 (NM_199330), segregating with the hearing-loss phenotype in the family, leads to a premature stop codon producing a truncated protein. The coiled-coil domain in the C-terminal of HOMER2 protein is essential for protein multimerization and HOMER2-CDC42 interaction. We compared the phenotypes in the two families and found that hearing impairment in this Chinese family was more severe. Further, we found that the ability of this insertion mutant type HOMER2 (HOMER2MU ) to multimerize decreased more significantly than wild-type HOMER2 (HOMER2WT ) and the reported c.554G>C (NM_004839) mutant HOMER2. HOMER2MU protein tended to be distributed in a diffuse manner, whereas HOMER2WT and the reported mutant HOMER2 tended to cluster together. Our research provides a validating second family for variants in HOMER2 causing non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. HOMER2 homo-/hetero-multimerization might be the first step in exerting its normal function. This article is protected by copyright.
