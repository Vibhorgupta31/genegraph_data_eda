We further validated these findings through loss-of-function studies in mice and zebrafish. DZIP1L localizes to centrioles and to the distal ends of basal bodies, and interacts with septin2, a protein implicated in maintenance of the periciliary diffusion barrier at the ciliary transition zone. In agreement with a defect in the diffusion barrier, we found that the ciliary-membrane translocation of the PKD proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 is compromised in DZIP1L-mutant cells. Together, these data provide what is, to our knowledge, the first conclusive evidence that ARPKD is not a homogeneous disorder and further establish DZIP1L as a second gene involved in ARPKD pathogenesis.","dc:creator":"Lu H","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations in DZIP1L, which encodes a ciliary-transition-zone protein, cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease."},"rdfs:label":"HEK293T DZIP1L and SEPT2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:bca7f891-4a06-4c86-975e-f56095e043db","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f9924f1b-8c6e-407d-99bf-37f98f5be292","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Immunofluorescence and quantification revealed decreased PC1 and PC2 localization in the ciliary membrane in human dermal fibroblasts from affected individual B155 (p.Gln155*)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530676","rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence of DZIP1L and PC1, PC2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:f1e2d1d2-b77c-4f1a-b185-31e3a95aae9b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7ec56e2a-fbf6-485a-9d8a-0e0e4fae663a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:09a5b53d-b444-4805-8dac-7ff2005fa813","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Loss of Dzip1l causes mislocalization of PC1 and PC2 to the ciliary membrane","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530676","rdfs:label":"Dzip1l MEFs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:89173b30-1e5f-4c5b-be1b-135ad91cd432","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e8caf3dc-8e71-4fef-81aa-0b1ef8d954f2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Polycystic kidney and liver abnormality","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530676","rdfs:label":"Dzip1l loss-of-function mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:df98f5fc-e703-4288-aa28-a4096b394de6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7aa7de93-06b1-4a7b-bf33-ef1b49beee94","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Ciliary dysfunction and cystic kidney","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530676","rdfs:label":"dzip1l morpholino knockdown zebrafish model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:f1e2d1d2-b77c-4f1a-b185-31e3a95aae9b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56fd097f-3c6a-4c84-ba19-2d9392d5617c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:56fd097f-3c6a-4c84-ba19-2d9392d5617c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:57cf9051-54ab-492c-b0d0-0c7817c4874f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_173543.3(DZIP1L):c.193T>C (p.Cys65Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2635347"}},"phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000113","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a62bd3c1-5929-4cf1-add8-72674dc8d505_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:57cf9051-54ab-492c-b0d0-0c7817c4874f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35211789"},"rdfs:label":"VI:2"},{"id":"cggv:a62bd3c1-5929-4cf1-add8-72674dc8d505","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a62bd3c1-5929-4cf1-add8-72674dc8d505_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Known consanguinity;

Patients with homozygous *DZIP1L* pathogenic variants were reported to exhibit polycystic kidneys, enlarged kidneys, reduced cortico-medullary differentiation, arterial hypertension and end-stage renal disease. Of note, there was limited evidence for a liver phenotype in this cohort of ARPKD patients. Functionally, *DZIP1L* has been shown to interact with septin2 and ensures proper localization and translocation of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 within the cilium. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism OR inheritance pattern, therefore, we suggest referring to this single disease entity as “ARPKD - *DZIP1L*\". Four missense, 1 frameshift and 1 nonsense variants that have been reported in 7 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 28530676, 35211789) are included in this curation. Additionally, a pedigree segregating a *DZIP1L* missense and frameshift variant in two affected siblings was scored (unpublished). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function (LOF). A total of 12.1 genetic evidence points was reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by LOF mouse and zebrafish models, in vitro functional assays, and expression studies (PMIDs: 28530676, 35211789). \nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Kidney Cystic GCEP on 03/09/2022 and was reevaluated on 03/11/2024. As a result, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the revision of previously scored evidence using ClinGen’s latest SOP version for gene-disease validity process. No new evidence was scored in this recuration. In summary, there is Definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DZIP1L* and ARPKD. Three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the relationship without any valid contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney GCEP on the meeting date 03/11/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\nInclusion of a pedigree segregating a DZIP1L missense and frameshift variant in two affected siblings (unpublished) upgrades the final calculated classification.
