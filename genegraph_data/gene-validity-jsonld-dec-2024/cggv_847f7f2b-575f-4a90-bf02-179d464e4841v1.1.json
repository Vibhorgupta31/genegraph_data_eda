Pathogenic mutations on BTD gene cause BTD deficiency. Clinical features and mutation analysis of Chinese children with BTD deficiency were rarely described. Herein, for the first time, we reported the clinical features, BTD gene mutations and their functional studies of eight symptomatic children with BTD deficiency from southern China. Fatigue, hypotonia, proximal muscular weakness, hearing deficits, rash and respiratory problems are common clinical phenotype of our patients. Seizures are observed only in patients with profound BTD deficiency. Five novel mutations were detected, among which c.637delC (H213TfsTer51) was found in 50% of our patients and might be considered as a common mutation. In vitro studies confirmed three mild mutations c.1368A>C (Q456H), c.1613G>A (R538H), and c.644T>A (L215H) which retained 10-30% of wild type enzyme activity, and six severe mutations c.235C>T (R79C), c.1271G>C (C424S), c.1412G>A (C471Y), c.637delC (H213TfsTer51), c.395T>G (M132W), c.464T>C (L155P), and c.1493dupT (L498FfsTer13) which retained <10% of wild type enzyme activity. c.1330G>C (D444H) decreased the protein expression but not activity of BTD enzyme, and H213TfsTer51 was structurally damaging while L498FfsTer13 was functionally damaging.

It is classified into two levels based on the biotinidase enzyme activity: partial deficiency (10%-30% enzyme activity) and profound deficiency (0%-10% enzyme activity). The aims of this study were to evaluate our patients with BD, identify the spectrum of biotinidase (BTD) gene mutations in Turkish patients and to determine the clinical and laboratory findings of our patients and their follow-up period. Methods A total of 259 patients who were diagnosed with BD were enrolled in the study. One hundred and forty-eight patients were male (57.1%), and 111 patients were female (42.9%). Results The number of patients detected by newborn screening was 221 (85.3%). By family screening, 31 (12%) patients were diagnosed with BD. Seven patients (2.7%) had different initial complaints and were diagnosed with BD. Partial BD was detected in 186 (71.8%) patients, and the profound deficiency was detected in 73 (28.2%) patients. Most of our patients were asymptomatic. The most commonly found variants were p.D444H, p.R157H, c.98_104delinsTCC. The novel mutations which were detected in this study are p.D401N(c.1201G>A), p.A82G (c.245C>G), p.F128S(c.383T>C), c617_619del/TTG (p.Val207del), p.A287T(c.859G>A), p.S491H(c.1471A>G). The most common mutation was p.R157H in profound BD and p.D444H in partial BD. All diagnosed patients were treated with biotin.

This disease was thought to be rare in East Asia. In this report, we delineate the phenotype of biotinidase deficiency in our cohort. The genotypes and phenotypes of patients diagnosed with biotinidase deficiency from a medical center were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and molecular test results were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 6 patients were evaluated. Three patients (50%) were diagnosed because of a clinical illness, and the other three (50%) were identified by newborn screening. In all patients, the molecular results confirmed the BTD mutation. The three patients with clinical manifestations had an onset of seizure at the age of 2 to 3 months. Two patients had respiratory problems (one with apnea under bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy at night, and the other with laryngomalacia). Hearing loss and eye problems were found in one patient. Interestingly, cutaneous manifestations including skin eczema, alopecia, and recurrent fungal infection were less commonly seen compared to cases in the literature. None of the patients identified by the newborn screening program developed symptoms. Our findings highlight differences in the genotype and phenotype compared with those in Western countries. Patients with biotinidase deficiency benefit from newborn screening programs for early detection and management.","dc:creator":"Hsu RH","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Genotypic and phenotypic correlations of biotinidase deficiency in the Chinese population."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30616616","rdfs:label":"Hsu Proband 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Present in 2/18934 East Asian alleles in gnomAD .01%"},{"id":"cggv:5c10bd06-29c2-41ec-9f60-18211012adc7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e9e17d4-9477-4619-a46d-65024d1cbd07","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":22,"detectionMethod":"Candidate sequencing of BTD","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0000988","obo:HP_0002795","obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0000365"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:5c10bd06-29c2-41ec-9f60-18211012adc7_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:0a2acee7-44eb-4daa-9fb1-0ba1a2682cd8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001370658.1(BTD):c.594G>C (p.Glu198Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA278247"}},{"id":"cggv:c78c9929-7dde-4496-bc81-5a0f02eb4272","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000060.2(BTD):c.1052delC (p.Thr351Lysfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA278288"}}],"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15776412"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15776412","rdfs:label":"P965"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:8cb0e9e7-4342-4712-9681-77dd18a8de23_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e2873152-6058-483c-acbf-1bb9f4c1d47a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"Sanger of BTD","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"asymptomatic as of publication date","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:8cb0e9e7-4342-4712-9681-77dd18a8de23_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:d8941487-a023-44fb-a040-8c7d0784d185","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000060.4(BTD):c.1250_1251delinsAG (p.Val417Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913203572"}},{"id":"cggv:65ad66ee-571f-49ee-ad3d-eed43eead6f3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001370658.1(BTD):c.1246G>A (p.Glu416Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/422496"}}],"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30616616"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30616616","rdfs:label":"Hsu Proband 4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"c.1306G>A\nPresent in 9/19954 East Asian alleles in gnomAD (.045%) \nc.1250_1251delinsAG \nAbsent from gnomAD"},{"id":"cggv:ad284c94-1f20-40ef-b467-0f750db747d0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1929396a-2c47-48c6-a452-407b0d9deb83","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Candidate sequencing of BTD","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000509","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0001992","obo:HP_0008947","obo:HP_0001942","obo:HP_0000988"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:ad284c94-1f20-40ef-b467-0f750db747d0_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:6746e1d6-b2cc-438a-9b28-afa2432652f2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001370658.1(BTD):c.571del (p.Arg191fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/587719"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23481307","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of biotin metabolism leading to varying degrees of neurologic and cutaneous symptoms when untreated.

Mutation analysis revealed three novel mutations, c.del631C and c.1557T>G within exon 4 and c.324-325insTA in exon 3.

(PMID: 7509806). Profound biotinidase deficiency is defined as less than 10% of mean normal serum enzyme activity; partial biotinidase deficiency is defined as between 10% and 30% of mean normal serumactivity (PMID: 26810761). Patients with Biotinidase deficiency are treated with biotin. At least 200 unique variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data, including an animal model. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, BTD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Biotinidase Deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel in collaboration with the ClinGen General Gene Curation Working Group on 9/25/19.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:847f7f2b-575f-4a90-bf02-179d464e4841"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
