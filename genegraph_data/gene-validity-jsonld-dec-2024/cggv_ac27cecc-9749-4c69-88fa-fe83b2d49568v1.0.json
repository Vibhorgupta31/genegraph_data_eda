Given the observation of genetic mutations in a number of mRNA binding proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43, FUS/TLS and mtSOD1, we analysed the ARHGEF28 gene (approx. 316 kb) that encodes for RGNEF in FALS cases to determine if mutations were present. We performed genomic sequencing, copy number variation analysis using TaqMan real-time PCR and spinal motor neuron immunohistochemistry using a novel RGNEF antibody. In this limited sample of FALS cases (n=7) we identified a heterozygous mutation that is predicted to generate a premature truncated gene product. We also observed extensive regions of homozygosity in the ARHGEF28 gene in two FALS patients. In conclusion, our findings of genetic alterations in the ARHGEF28 gene in cases of FALS suggest that a more comprehensive genetic analysis would be warranted.","dc:creator":"Droppelmann CA","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Detection of a novel frameshift mutation and regions with homozygosis within ARHGEF28 gene in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac27cecc-9749-4c69-88fa-fe83b2d49568_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2037937f-24fc-43e7-892b-b37df83930a5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2037937f-24fc-43e7-892b-b37df83930a5","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":37,"allele":{"id":"cggv:8f3636fb-c03d-4014-812d-0a57180954f0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001177693.2(ARHGEF28):c.3769C>T (p.His1257Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA120896872"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR amplification and sequencing of 36 ARHGEF28 exons","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:adb6bfb7-2910-47e4-8d81-7dfd1346cf3b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:8f3636fb-c03d-4014-812d-0a57180954f0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31060816","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Over 90% of cases are sporadic (sALS) and 5%-10% are familial (fALS). So far, more than 20 genes/loci have been linked to ALS. C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS are noted as the most common ALS genes; however, mutations of these genes explain <10% of sALS cases. Recently, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, encoded by ARHGEF28, has been linked to the ALS pathogenesis, possibly by binding low-molecular-weight neurofilament mRNA and affects its stability. However, a systemic screening of ARHGEF28 mutations in ALS is lacking. In this study, we sequenced the entire coding sequence of ARHGEF28 in a Chinese cohort of 399 sporadic ALS and 327 elderly controls. A total of 73 coding variants were identified, including 26 synonymous and 47 nonsynonymous. Among the nonsynonymous variants, 33 were rare (minor allele frequency [MAF]<0.01), in which 18 were only identified in cases and 12 were only in controls. Three loss-of-function mutations were identified, including 2 truncations (p.Arg231Ter and p.Ser561Ter) and a frameshift deletion (p.Lys1070fs) in 2 cases and 1 control subject. The frequency of total and case-only rare variants was 7.5% (30/399) and 5.0% (20/399), respectively, in the patients. SKAT-O test suggested that the novel coding variants were marginally enriched in the cases (p = 0.049). Single-variant analysis suggested that the p.Asn1046Ser variant had a higher frequency in cases (8/399, 0.02) than in controls (1/327, 0.003) (OR: 6.67, 95% CI: 0.83-53.61; p = 0.046). By contrast, none of the low-frequency (MAF: 0.01-0.05) or common (MAF > 0.05) variants was associated with ALS (p > 0.05). Among all patients, 9 (2.3%) carried rare variants predicted to be deleterious, and the age at onset of these carriers (45.6 ± 10.9 years) was marginally younger than noncarriers (51.9 ± 10.7 years) (p = 0.11). Our results supported a possible genetic contribution of rare but not low-frequency and common coding variants to ALS. These data may have implications in the mechanisms and genetic counseling of the disease.","dc:creator":"Song Y","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Rare, low-frequency and common coding variants of ARHGEF28 gene and their association with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 3847"},{"id":"cggv:adb6bfb7-2910-47e4-8d81-7dfd1346cf3b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:adb6bfb7-2910-47e4-8d81-7dfd1346cf3b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"No information about testing for variants in other ALS-associated genes was provided.

Here, we observed that rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGNEF), the human homologue of p190RhoGEF, binds low molecular weight neurofilament mRNA and affects its stability via 3' untranslated region destabilization. We observed that the overexpression of RGNEF in a stable cell line significantly decreased the level of low molecular weight neurofilament protein. Furthermore, we observed RGNEF cytoplasmic inclusions in ALS spinal motor neurons that colocalized with ubiquitin, p62/sequestosome-1, and TAR (trans-active regulatory) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43).

In this study, we evaluated the expression of 10 ALS-associated proteins in spinal motor neurons (MNs) in ALS patients with mutations in C9orf72 (C9orf72(GGGGCC)-ALS; n = 5), SOD1 (mtSOD1-ALS; n = 9), FUS/TLS (mtFUS/TLS-ALS; n = 2), or TARDBP (mtTDP-43-ALS; n = 2) and contrasted these to cases of sporadic ALS (sALS; n = 4) and familial ALS without known mutations (fALS; n = 2). We performed colorimetric immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against TDP-43, FUS/TLS, SOD1, C9orf72, ubiquitin, sequestosome 1 (p62), optineurin, phosphorylated high molecular weight neurofilament, peripherin, and Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGNEF). We observed that RGNEF-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) can co-localize with TDP-43, FUS/TLS and p62 within spinal MNs. We confirmed their capacity to interact by co-immunoprecipitations. We also found that mtSOD1-ALS cases possess a unique IHC signature, including the presence of C9orf72-immunoreactive diffuse NCIs, which allows them to be distinguished from other variants of ALS at the level of light microscopy. These findings support the hypothesis that alterations in RNA metabolism are a core pathogenic pathway in ALS. We also conclude that routine IHC-based analysis of spinal MNs may aid in the identification of families not previously suspected to harbor SOD1 mutations.","dc:creator":"Keller BA","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Co-aggregation of RNA binding proteins in ALS spinal motor neurons: evidence of a common pathogenic mechanism."},"rdfs:label":"interaction with TARDBP, FUS, SQSTM1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"The physical interaction as shown by co-IP appears to be very weak, specificity of interaction is not clear; scored 0 points per GCEP discussion."},{"id":"cggv:80ad316e-af0d-4b5d-9f93-61692f7e0589","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e6253e6-f93e-40a6-99fd-4fc115f81e49","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"direct interaction as shown by split-ubiquitin assay in yeast","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32764283","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGNEF) protein encoded by the ","dc:creator":"Di Gregorio SE","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Inclusion Formation and Toxicity of the ALS Protein RGNEF and Its Association with the Microtubule Network."},"rdfs:label":"protein-protein interactions by split-ubiquitin assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":8513,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":2.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:071ea808-48e0-4a58-91c9-88b9b4c42bbb","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0004976","gene":"hgnc:30322","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"*ARHGEF28* encodes a multidomain protein with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity.

The gene was curated under a semidominant inheritance model due to limited genetic evidence and the presence of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance classifications in GenCC. \n\nTen variants that have been reported in 13 probands in four publications (PMIDs: 23286752, 24712971, 27154192, 31060816) are included in this curation. For nine of these variants, lack of information on testing for variants in other potentially disease-causing genes or the presence of such variants led to a score of 0 points. A predicted splice donor site variant in two probands was scored 0.5 points each due to very limited prior testing. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression and protein-protein interaction evidence. ARHGEF28 is expressed in the brain and spinal cord (PMID: 19488899) and forms cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons of fALS and sALS patients, but not in normal controls (PMID: 22835604). A split-ubiquitin assay in yeast showed that ARHGEF28 interacts directly with TARDBP (PMID: 32764283).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on March 28, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n ","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:ac27cecc-9749-4c69-88fa-fe83b2d49568"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
