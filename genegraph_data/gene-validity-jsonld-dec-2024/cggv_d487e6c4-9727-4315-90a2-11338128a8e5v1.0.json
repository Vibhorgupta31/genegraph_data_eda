De novo dominant mutations in different members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex have recently been described in individuals with Coffin-Siris (CSS) and Nicolaides-Baraitser (NCBRS) syndromes. Using a combination of whole-exome sequencing, NGS-based sequencing of 23 SWI/SNF complex genes, and molecular karyotyping in 46 previously undescribed individuals with CSS and NCBRS, we identified a de novo 1-bp deletion (c.677delG, p.Gly226Glufs*53) and a de novo missense mutation (c.914G>T, p.Cys305Phe) in PHF6 in two individuals diagnosed with CSS. PHF6 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex implicating dysfunction of a second chromatin remodeling complex in the pathogenesis of CSS-like phenotypes. Altogether, we identified mutations in 60% of the studied individuals (28/46), located in the genes ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCB1, SMARCE1, SMARCA2, and PHF6. We show that mutations in ARID1B are the main cause of CSS, accounting for 76% of identified mutations. ARID1B and SMARCB1 mutations were also found in individuals with the initial diagnosis of NCBRS. These individuals apparently belong to a small subset who display an intermediate CSS/NCBRS phenotype. Our proposed genotype-phenotype correlations are important for molecular screening strategies.","dc:creator":"Wieczorek D","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A comprehensive molecular study on Coffin-Siris and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes identifies a broad molecular and clinical spectrum converging on altered chromatin remodeling."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23906836","rdfs:label":"K2434"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The variant was also found in one additional unrelated individual in the same publication (PMID: 23906836) and one additional unrelated individual in another publication (PMID: 30349098)"},{"id":"cggv:46469e62-d5c9-4962-842c-0ecc0b07af3a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8878a63b-f142-4a22-b044-c5f0d9568365","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":84,"detectionMethod":"Libraries of all coding exons and exon–intron boundaries of the known Coffin-Siris syndrome genes ARID1A (NM_006015.4), ARID1B(NM_020732.3), SMARCA2 (NM_003070.3), SMARCA4 (NM_001128849.1), SMARCB1 (NM_003073.3), and SMARCE1 (NM_003079.4), as well as the candidate genes ARID2 (NM_152641.2), SMARCC1 (NM_003074.3), SMARCC2 (NM_003075.3), SMARCD1 (NM_003076.4), SMARCD2 (NM_001098426.1), SMARCD3 (NM_003078.3), ACTL6A (NM_004301.3), ACTL6B (NM_016188.4), PBRM1 (NM_018313.4), BRD7 (NM_001173984.2), PRMT5 (NM_006109.3), SMARCA1 (NM_003069.3), SMARCA5 (NM_003601.3), HELLS (NM_018063.3), CBL (NM_005188.3), C7orf11 (NM_138701) and SHOC2 (NM_007373.3) were prepared from 200 ng of genomic DNA from 41 index individuals.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) remains unknown. Here, we show that ARID1B is a repressor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Through whole-transcriptome analysis, we find that in individuals with intellectual disability and ARID1B loss-of-function mutations, Wnt/β-catenin target genes are upregulated. Using cellular models of low and high Wnt/β-catenin activity, we demonstrate that knockdown of ARID1B activates Wnt/β-catenin target genes and Wnt/β-catenin-dependent transcriptional reporters in a β-catenin-dependent manner. Reciprocally, forced expression of ARID1B inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling downstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. Both endogenous and exogenous ARID1B associate with β-catenin and repress Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription through the BAF core subunit BRG1. Accordingly, mutations in ARID1B leading to partial or complete deletion of its BRG1-binding domain, as is often observed in intellectual disability and cancers, compromise association with β-catenin, and the resultant ARID1B mutant proteins fail to suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Finally, knockdown of ARID1B in mouse neuroblastoma cells leads to neurite outgrowth through β-catenin. The data suggest that aberrations in chromatin-remodeling factors, such as ARID1B, might contribute to neurodevelopmental abnormalities and cancer through deregulation of developmental and oncogenic pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Arid1b haploinsufficiency also led to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, we found that Arid1b haploinsufficiency suppressed histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) overall and particularly reduced H3K9ac of the Pvalb promoter, resulting in decreased transcription. Arid1b-heterozygous mice exhibited abnormal cognitive and social behaviors, which were rescued by treatment with a positive allosteric GABAA receptor modulator.

Coffin-Siris syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability associated with coarse facial features, hypertrichosis, sparse scalp hair, and hypoplastic or absent fifth fingernails or toenails. More than 170 unique pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ARID1B have been reported in ClinVar, with the majority of them de novo truncating variants (van der Sluijs, et al., PMID: 30349098). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (Hoyer, et al., PMID: 22405089). The gene-disease association is also supported by animal and cell culture models. Noteworthy, Coffin-Siris syndrome can be caused by variants in additional genes, including ARID1A, SMARCB1, SMARCA4, SMARCE1, ARID2, DPF2, SMARCC2, SOX11, and SOX4 (see OMIM). In summary, ARID1B is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Coffin-Siris syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/02/19 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d487e6c4-9727-4315-90a2-11338128a8e5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
