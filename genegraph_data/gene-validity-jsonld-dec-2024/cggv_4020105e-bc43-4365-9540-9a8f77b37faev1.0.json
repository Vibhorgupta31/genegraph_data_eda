Cellular alterations in RBS include lack of cohesion at the heterochromatic regions around centromeres and the long arm of the Y chromosome, reduced growth capacity, and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. RBS is caused by mutations in ESCO2, which encodes a protein belonging to the highly conserved Eco1/Ctf7 family of acetyltransferases that is involved in regulating sister chromatid cohesion. We identified 10 new mutations expanding the number to 26 known ESCO2 mutations. We observed that these mutations result in complete or partial loss of the acetyltransferase domain except for the only missense mutation that occurs in this domain (c.1615T>G, W539G). To investigate the mechanism underlying RBS, we analyzed ESCO2 mutations for their effect on enzymatic activity and cellular phenotype. We found that ESCO2 W539G results in loss of autoacetyltransferase activity. The cellular phenotype produced by this mutation causes cohesion defects, proliferation capacity reduction and mitomycin C sensitivity equivalent to those produced by frameshift and nonsense mutations associated with decreased levels of mRNA and absence of protein. We found decreased proliferation capacity in RBS cell lines associated with cell death, but not with increased cell cycle duration, which could be a factor in the development of phocomelia and cleft palate in RBS.

Utilizing the natural transparency of zebrafish embryos, we have developed a novel technique to observe chromosome dynamics within a single cell during mitosis in a live vertebrate embryo. Within esco2 mutant embryos, we observed premature chromatid separation, a unique chromosome scattering, prolonged mitotic delay, and genomic instability in the form of anaphase bridges and micronuclei formation. Cytogenetic studies indicated complete chromatid separation and high levels of aneuploidy within mutant embryos. Amongst aneuploid spreads, we predominantly observed decreases in chromosome number, suggesting that either cells with micronuclei or micronuclei themselves are eliminated. We also demonstrated that the genomic instability leads to p53-dependent neural tube apoptosis. Surprisingly, although many cells required Esco2 to establish cohesion, 10-20% of cells had only weakened cohesion in the absence of Esco2, suggesting that compensatory cohesion mechanisms exist in these cells that undergo a normal mitotic division.

Since heterochromatin repulsion (HR) is characteristic for both disorders and is not complemented in somatic-cell hybrids, it has been hypothesized that the disorders are allelic. Recently, mutations in ESCO2 (establishment of cohesion 1 homolog 2) on 8p21.1 have been reported in RBS. To determine whether ESCO2 mutations are also responsible for SC, we studied three families with SC and two families in which variable degrees of limb and craniofacial abnormalities, detected by fetal ultrasound, led to pregnancy terminations. All cases were positive for HR. We identified seven novel mutations in exons 3-8 of ESCO2. In two families, affected individuals were homozygous--for a 5-nucleotide deletion in one family and a splice-site mutation in the other. In three nonconsanguineous families, probands were compound heterozygous for a single-nucleotide insertion or deletion, a nonsense mutation, or a splice-site mutation. Abnormal splice products were characterized at the RNA level. Since only protein-truncating mutations were identified, regardless of clinical severity, we conclude that genotype does not predict phenotype.

The short lower limbs, held in a frog-like position, had five digits bilaterally. The clitoris appeared enlarged, and internal organs showed no obvious anomalies. Symmetrical skeletal deficiencies were evident on radiographs (fig. 4A). Distal humeri were narrow, and radii and ulnae were absent.

ESCO2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Roberts syndrome and SC phocomelia syndrome in 2005 (Vega et al., 2005, PMID: 15821733). Both syndromes are characterized by mental retardation, craniofacial deformities, limb malformation, organ defects and growth retardation. SC phocomelia syndrome is described as a mild form of Roberts syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern and little difference in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities, Roberts syndrome and SC phocomelia syndrome, have been lumped into one disease entity, Roberts-SC phocomelia syndrome (OMIM:268300). Of the 31 different variants that have been reported in patients, 16 (13 truncating, 2 splicing, and 1 missense) in 22 probands in 3 publications (Vega et al., 2005, PMID: 15821733; Schule et al., 2005, PMID:16380922; Colombo et al., 2019, PMID: 31192177) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function (LOF). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, biochemical function, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays) (Whelan et al., 2012, PMID: 22101327; Percival et al., 2015, PMID: 26044958; Monnich et al., 2011, PMID: 21637801; Alomer et al., 2017, PMID: 28847955; Banerji et al., 2017, PMID: 29084713; Vega et al., 2010, PMID: 19574259; Gordillo et al., 2008, PMID: 18411254). Experimental evidence demonstrates that impairment of ESCO2 protein function is consistent with the observed phenotypes and other cohesinopathies, ESCO2 expression occurs in tissues relevant to the disease of interest and several model systems produce similar disease phenotypes, specifically impaired bone and tissue growth and impaired sister chromatid cohesion, a major diagnostic marker of Roberts-SC phocomelia syndrome. In summary, ESCO2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Roberts-SC phocomelia syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 3.19.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4020105e-bc43-4365-9540-9a8f77b37fae"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
