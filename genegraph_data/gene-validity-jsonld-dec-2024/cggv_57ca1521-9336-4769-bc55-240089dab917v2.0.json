Since 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid is the metabolite directly before methylmalonate semialdehyde, it follows that a decrease in MMSHD would result in a respective increase thereof. Other valine metabolites are also elevated, such as 3-hydroxypropionic and 2-ethyl-3-hydroxypropionic acid, due to the inability to properly process them.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21863277","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria is an organic aciduria with a poorly understood biochemical basis. It has previously been assumed that deficiency of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (HIBADH) in the valine catabolic pathway is the underlying enzyme defect, but more recent evidence makes it likely that individuals with 3-hydroxyisobutyryic aciduria represent a heterogeneous group with different underlying mechanisms, including respiratory chain defects or deficiency of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. However, to date methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency has only been demonstrated at the gene level for a single individual. We present two unrelated patients who presented with developmental delay and increased urinary concentrations of 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid. Both children were products of consanguineous unions and were of European or Pakistani descent. One patient developed a febrile illness and subsequently died from a hepatoencephalopathy at 2 years of age. Further studies were initiated and included tests of the HIBADH enzyme in fibroblast homogenates, which yielded normal activities. Sequencing of the ALDH6A1 gene (encoding methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) suggested homozygosity for the missense mutation c.785 C > A (S262Y) in exon 7 which was not found in 210 control alleles. Mutation analysis of the ALDH6A1 gene of the second patient confirmed the presence of a different missense mutation, c.184 C > T (P62S), which was also identified in 1/530 control chromosomes. Both mutations affect highly evolutionarily conserved amino acids of the methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase protein. Mutation analysis in the ALDH6A1 gene can reveal a cause of 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria, which may present with only slightly increased urinary levels of 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, if a patient is metabolically stable.","dc:creator":"Sass JO","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"3-Hydroxyisobutyrate aciduria and mutations in the ALDH6A1 gene coding for methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase."},"rdfs:label":"ALDH6A1 and Valine Catabolism"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Since the break in the valine catabolism pathway corresponds with the increase in 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid and other metabolites, which is seen in all current probands, and a reduced-valine diet is able to ameliorate many of the symptoms, this evidence is defaulted to .5 points.

Four prior MMSDD cases are published. We present a fifth case, along with functional and metabolomic analysis. The patient, born to non-consanguineous parents of East African origin, was admitted at two weeks of age for failure to thrive. She was nondysmorphic, had a normal brain MRI, and showed mild hypotonia. Gastroesophageal reflux occurred with feeding. Urine organic acid assessment identified excess 3-hydroxyisobutyrate and 3-hydroxypropionate, while urine amino acid analysis identified elevated concentrations of β-aminoisobutyrate and β-alanine. Plasma amino acids showed an elevated concentration of β-aminoisobutyrate with undetectable β-alanine. ALDH6A1 gene sequencing identified a homozygous variant of uncertain significance, c.1261C > T (p.Pro421Ser). Management with valine restriction led to reduced concentration of abnormal analytes in blood and urine, improved growth, and reduced gastroesophageal reflux. Western blotting of patient fibroblast extracts demonstrated a large reduction of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSD) protein. Patient cells displayed compromised mitochondrial function with increased superoxide production, reduced oxygen consumption, and reduced ATP production. Metabolomic profiles from patient fibroblasts demonstrated over-representation of fatty acids and fatty acylcarnitines, presumably due to methylmalonate semialdehyde shunting to β-alanine and subsequently to malonyl-CoA with ensuing increase of fatty acid synthesis. Previously reported cases of MMSDD have shown variable clinical presentation. Our case continues the trend as clinical phenotypes diverge from prior cases. Recognition of mitochondrial dysfunction and novel metabolites in this patient provide the opportunity to assess future patients for secondary changes that may influence clinical outcome.","dc:creator":"Dobrowolski SF","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Clinical, biochemical, mitochondrial, and metabolomic aspects of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency: Report of a fifth case."}},"rdfs:label":"DO"},{"id":"cggv:65e4791a-5500-4f99-805c-ab29fc06da65","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:65e4791a-5500-4f99-805c-ab29fc06da65_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The ample phenotypic evidence combined with variant-level evidence (small amount of MMSD detected via Western blot, increased levels of superoxides compared to controls) gives this proband default points."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a75d30c0-9fbc-442a-be66-715983321638_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a75d30c0-9fbc-442a-be66-715983321638","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:f5c18eed-62bd-4ad8-8b2a-1f1451d384e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005589.4(ALDH6A1):c.1336G>A (p.Gly446Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6617"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR amplification of the ALDH6A1 gene was performed, as well as RT-PCR of fibroblast RNA.

At least six unique missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 10947204, 21863277, 23835272, 32151545). No supporting segregation information is available. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss-of-function, with a deficiency in the MMSDH protein leading to an increase in valine metabolites such as 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid and potentially the phenotypes seen in conjunction with the biochemical abnormality. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is consistent with the finding of persistently elevated 3-hydroxypropionate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and β-aminoisobutyrate levels in patients with this condition (PMIDs: 3939535, 10971205, 32151545)\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. There is the question of whether the additional symptoms of some individuals are related to this disorder, although that is unrelated to the biochemical abnormality and the response to modified diet seems to indicate a connection. Although more evidence, genetic and experimental, is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 09/27/2019 (SOP Version 7). It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with no new evidence found. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:57ca1521-9336-4769-bc55-240089dab917"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
