The human retinal synaptic disease X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is characterized by impaired visual signal transmission through the retina and progressive visual acuity loss, and mice lacking retinoschisin (RS1) recapitulate human disease. Here, we demonstrate that restoration of RS1 via retina-specific delivery of adeno-associated virus type 8-RS1 (AAV8-RS1) vector rescues molecular pathology at the photoreceptor-depolarizing bipolar cell (photoreceptor-DBC) synapse and restores function in adult Rs1-KO animals. Initial development of the photoreceptor-DBC synapse was normal in the Rs1-KO retina; however, the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6/transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily M member 1-signaling (mGluR6/TRPM1-signaling) cascade was not properly maintained. Specifically, the TRPM1 channel and G proteins Gαo, Gβ5, and RGS11 were progressively lost from postsynaptic DBC dendritic tips, whereas the mGluR6 receptor and RGS7 maintained proper synaptic position. This postsynaptic disruption differed from other murine night-blindness models with an electronegative electroretinogram response, which is also characteristic of murine and human XLRS disease. Upon AAV8-RS1 gene transfer to the retina of adult XLRS mice, TRPM1 and the signaling molecules returned to their proper dendritic tip location, and the DBC resting membrane potential was restored. These findings provide insight into the molecular plasticity of a critical synapse in the visual system and demonstrate potential therapeutic avenues for some diseases involving synaptic pathology.

The gene involved in XLRS was identified recently. It encodes a protein with a disoidin domain, suggested to be involved in cell-cell interactions. We have screened the gene for mutations in 234 familial and sporadic retinoschisis cases and identified 82 different mutations in 214 (91%). Thirty one mutations were found more than once, i.e. 2-10 times, with the exception of the 214G-->A mutation which was found in 34 apparently unrelated cases. The origin of the patients, the linkage data and the site of the mutations (mainly CG dinucleotides) indicate that most recurrent mutations had independent origins and thus suggest the existence of a significant new mutation rate in XLRS1. The mutations identified cover the entire spectrum, from small intra-genic deletions (7%), to nonsense (6%), missense (75%), small frameshifting insertions/deletions (6%) and splice site mutations (6%). Since, regardless of the mutation type, no females with a typical RS phenotype were identified, RS seems to be caused by loss-of-function mutations only. Mutations occurred non-randomly, with hotspots at several CG dinucleotides and a C6stretch. Exons 1-3 contained few, mainly translation-truncating mutations, arguing against an important functional role for this segment of the protein. Exons 4-6, encoding the discoidin domain, contained most, mainly missense mutations. An alignment of 32 discoidin domain proteins was constructed to reveal the consensus sequence and to deduce the functional importance of the missense mutations identified. The mutation analysis revealed a high preponderance of mutations involving or creating cysteine residues, pointing to sites important for the tertiary folding and/or protein function, and highlights several amino acids which may be involved in XLRS1-specific protein-protein interactions. Despite the enormous mutation heterogeneity, patients have relatively uniform clinical manifestations although with great intra-familial variation in age at onset and progression.","dc:creator":"Anonymous","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Functional implications of the spectrum of mutations found in 234 cases with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis.

At the age of 9 years, best corrected visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Fundoscopy showed a bullous peripheral schisis and a flat schisis at the entire posterior pole with inner leaf hole formation in the right eye. In the left eye, a macular schisis with marked vitreous veils could be seen. Electroretinogram\n(ERG) recordings were consistent with the diagnosis of retinoschisis, that is, rod\nresponse was unrecordable in the right eye and residual in the left eye, there was a negative maximal response, and an unrecordable cone response in both eyes.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:b2ee7476-288a-400e-b427-ceb8019df5ae_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ea680fc5-dd1c-481f-b57a-5be8d5d6959e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000330.4(RS1):c.608C>T (p.Pro203Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA226813"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10636740","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Gehrig A","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"First molecular evidence for a de novo mutation in RS1 (XLRS1) associated with X linked juvenile retinoschisis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10636740","rdfs:label":"III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Absent in gnomAD.

At least 330 variants (e.g. missense, \n nonsense, frameshift, large deletion) have been reported in\nhumans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data including abolished secretion for some missense variants and knockout mouse models. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (18 pts.) has been reached. In summary, RS1 is definitively and specifically associated with X-linked Retinoschisis. Applying the PP4 criterion for rare RS1 variant identified in a patient with retinoschisis is recommended.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:061adaaf-8b09-42e4-ae31-9b9c03d6e944"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
