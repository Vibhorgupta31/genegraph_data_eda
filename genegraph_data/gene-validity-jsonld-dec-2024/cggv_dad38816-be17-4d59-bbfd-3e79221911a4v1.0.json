However, this diagnosis was excluded by HIBCH sequencing and normal enzyme activity. In contrast to HIBCH deficiency, the excretion of 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-carnitine was normal in the children, suggesting deficiency of short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1 gene). This mitochondrial enzyme is active in several metabolic pathways involving fatty acids and amino acids, including valine, and is immediately upstream of HIBCH in the valine pathway. Both children were compound heterozygous for a c.473C > A (p.A158D) missense mutation and a c.414+3G>C splicing mutation in ECHS1. ECHS1 activity was markedly decreased in cultured fibroblasts from both siblings, ECHS1 protein was undetectable by immunoblot analysis and transfection of patient cells with wild-type ECHS1 rescued ECHS1 activity. The highly reactive metabolites methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA accumulate in deficiencies of both ECHS1 and HIBCH and are probably responsible for the brain pathology in both disorders. Deficiency of ECHS1 or HIBCH should be considered in children with Leigh disease. Urine metabolite testing can detect and distinguish between these two disorders.

A combined respiratory chain deficiency was also observed. Targeted exome sequencing of 776 mitochondria-associated genes encoded by nuclear DNA identified compound heterozygous mutations in ECHS1. ECHS1 protein expression was severely depleted in the patient's skeletal muscle and patient-derived myoblasts; a marked decrease in enzyme activity was also evident in patient-derived myoblasts. Immortalized patient-derived myoblasts that expressed exogenous wild-type ECHS1 exhibited the recovery of the ECHS1 activity, indicating that the gene defect was pathogenic. Mitochondrial respiratory complex activity was also mostly restored in these cells, suggesting that there was an unidentified link between deficiency of ECHS1 and respiratory chain.

This is the first report of homozygosity for a truncating mutation in ECHS1, which may explain the severe phenotype.
