Children with SLOS have elevated serum 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) levels and typically have low serum cholesterol levels. On the basis of this biochemical abnormality, it has been proposed that mutations in the human sterol Delta7-reductase (7-DHC reductase; E.C.1.3.1.21) gene cause SLOS. However, one could also propose a defect in a gene that encodes a protein necessary for either the expression or normal function of sterol Delta7-reductase. We cloned cDNA encoding a human sterol Delta7-reductase (DHCR7) on the basis of its homology with the sterol Delta7-reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana, and we confirmed the enzymatic function of the human gene product by expression in SLOS fibroblasts. SLOS fibroblasts transfected with human sterol Delta7-reductase cDNA showed a significant reduction in 7-DHC levels, compared with those in SLOS fibroblasts transfected with the vector alone. Using radiation-hybrid mapping, we show that the DHCR7 gene is encoded at chromosome 11q12-13. To establish that defects in this gene cause SLOS, we sequenced cDNA clones from SLOS patients. In three unrelated patients we have identified four different mutant alleles. Our results demonstrate both that the cDNA that we have identified encodes the human sterol Delta7-reductase and that mutations in DHCR7 are responsible for at least some cases of SLOS.","dc:creator":"Wassif CA","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutations in the human sterol delta7-reductase gene at 11q12-13 cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Wassif 1998 Rescue experiment"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:7f2e4a2a-329c-473a-9236-e01a81b7c5fc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3f474ce1-7366-4570-aea7-6fb359b305e6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"There is increased incidence of intrauterine fetal demise or neonatal death in severely affected [SLOS] individuals (GeneReviews, SLOS).

The original aim was to drive robust DHCR7 expression in the developing CNS tissues. Though transgene-specific DHCR7 expression was detected in mouse brain and in no other tissue by RT-PCR, this level of expression was very low and no signal for transgene expression was detectable by Northern analyses of brain RNA. However, this minimally expressed transgene in a Dhcr7 null background resulted in a partial rescue of neonatal lethality, although this rescue was stochastic. Rescued Dhcr7−/− pups (TgRKO) died between postnatal 3 and 17 days and showed severe growth retardation, had an abnormal gait, impaired movement suggestive of a neurological dysfunction, and biochemical analyses showed profound cholesterol deficiency in brain as well as in peripheral tissues. We report here a characterization of these rescued animals. Despite the stochastic nature of rescue, the few pups that survived allowed us to examine postnatal neural development in a mouse model of SLOS. Our results suggest that a major cause of lethality in the mouse models for SLOS is likely to be severely disrupted CNS development and that the cause of defect is likely to be more subtle than defect(s) resulting from loss of bulk cholesterol.

One key feature of all of these is the presence of mental retardation and another is the lack of a robust genotype-phenotype correlation. Knockout mice defective in the 3beta hydroxysterol Delta7 reductase (Dhcr7), a model for the most common of such disorders in humans, the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, all die within 24 h of birth. The cause of this postnatal mortality in these mice has not been fully established. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that CNS dysfunction was a major cause of this lethality and investigated whether transgenic expression of normal human DHCR7 in neuronal tissues could rescue this neonatal lethality. Transgenic mice, expressing DHCR7 driven by murine nestin promoter, were bred onto Dhcr7 knock-out (Dhcr7(-1-)) background and resulted in a partial rescue of neonatal lethality in 11 of 91 (12%) of transgene-positive Dhcr7(-1-) pups. Despite biochemical analyses that showed continued profound cholesterol deficiency in brain, rescued animals survived between 3 and 17 days. Thus, one important conclusion to be drawn is that defects in CNS in Dhcr7 knockout mice may contribute to the early lethality. Another conclusion is that even small and subtle changes in the brain sterol metabolism were sufficient to enable rescue. These data also provide important clues as to the cause of the variable expressivity seen in SLOS.","dc:creator":"Yu H","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Partial rescue of neonatal lethality of Dhcr7 null mice by a nestin promoter-driven DHCR7 transgene expression."},"rdfs:label":"Yu 2005"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:c7db65e5-8489-481c-959d-8da28f76041f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13bb61bd-2fef-4ce1-a9b7-6a872d7009b8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"In patients with SLOS, there is decreased 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase protein expression and/or function.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9653161","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an inborn disorder of sterol metabolism with characteristic congenital malformations and dysmorphias.

Furthermore, establishing a molecular diagnosis can be complicated by finding variants of unknown clinical significance in such cases.","dc:creator":"Tucci A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"The p.Phe174Ser mutation is associated with mild forms of Smith Lemli Opitz Syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:42c06f0c-33aa-4561-a63b-9f89f8aff6f7_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4001cd84-833d-4301-9f36-028a17bae4df"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969503"}],"rdfs:label":"Tucci Proband"},{"id":"cggv:866a201a-0913-4047-976c-effee800f9d1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:866a201a-0913-4047-976c-effee800f9d1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Upgraded for recurrence (PMID: 15979035).

The phenotypic spectrum of SLOS is broad, ranging from a mild phenotype combining subtle physical anomalies with behavioral and learning problems, to a perinatally lethal multiple malformations syndrome. The fetal phenotype of SLOS has been poorly described in the literature. We report a series of 10 fetuses with molecularly proven SLOS. Even in young fetuses, the facial dysmorphism appears characteristic. Genital abnormalities are rare in 46,XX subjects. Gonadal differentiation appears histologically normal and in agreement with the chromosomal sex, contrary to what has been previously stated. We observed some previously unreported anomalies: ulnar hypoplasia, vertebral segmentation anomalies, congenital pulmonary adenomatoid malformation, fused lungs, gastroschisis, holomyelia and hypothalamic hamartoma. This latter malformation proves that SLOS phenotypically overlaps with Pallister-Hall syndrome which remains clinically a major differential diagnosis of SLOS.","dc:creator":"Quélin C","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Phenotypic spectrum of fetal Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome."}},{"id":"cggv:b4726902-eb58-4196-b42a-4d8905708e78_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:953dff2a-a382-40eb-85bf-46ad2bbc19c4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22226660"}],"rdfs:label":"Quelin Case 1"},{"id":"cggv:b4726902-eb58-4196-b42a-4d8905708e78","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4726902-eb58-4196-b42a-4d8905708e78_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:638043f0-cb4b-4518-ad49-2d5e3a6fc4c8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:638043f0-cb4b-4518-ad49-2d5e3a6fc4c8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0ab721ff-53a5-4fa9-8db5-04f1cebf2b06_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ab721ff-53a5-4fa9-8db5-04f1cebf2b06","type":"Proband","allele":[{"id":"cggv:0febbd65-34ab-4918-b8ab-6ea98c6ba800","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001360.3(DHCR7):c.292C>T (p.Gln98Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/188723"}},{"id":"cggv:31ba92c1-13d7-462f-af8c-1b6e5ab427e3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001360.3(DHCR7):c.278C>T (p.Thr93Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA221665"}}],"detectionMethod":"High-molecular-weight DNA of the probands was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes or fibroblasts with established procedures.

Mutations in the gene for Delta7-sterol reductase (DHCR7), which catalyzes the final step in cholesterol biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cause SLOS. We have determined, in 84 patients with clinically and biochemically characterized SLOS (detection rate 96%), the mutational spectrum in the DHCR7 gene. Forty different SLOS mutations, some frequent, were identified. On the basis of mutation type and expression studies in the HEK293-derived cell line tsA-201, we grouped mutations into four classes: nonsense and splice-site mutations resulting in putative null alleles, missense mutations in the transmembrane domains (TM), mutations in the 4th cytoplasmic loop (4L), and mutations in the C-terminal ER domain (CT). All but one of the tested missense mutations reduced protein stability. Concentrations of the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol and clinical severity scores correlated with mutation classes. The mildest clinical phenotypes were associated with TM and CT mutations, and the most severe types were associated with 0 and 4L mutations. Most homozygotes for null alleles had severe SLOS; one patient had a moderate phenotype. Homozygosity for 0 mutations in DHCR7 appears compatible with life, suggesting that cholesterol may be synthesized in the absence of this enzyme or that exogenous sources of cholesterol can be used.","dc:creator":"Witsch-Baumgartner M","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Mutational spectrum in the Delta7-sterol reductase gene and genotype-phenotype correlation in 84 patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"SLO14"},{"id":"cggv:938efb77-f8a2-4ac5-bcd8-c8009b93a43b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:938efb77-f8a2-4ac5-bcd8-c8009b93a43b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded per ID/A scoring guidelines.

Smith-Lemli-Opitz is characterized by a spectrum of affectedness with the most commonly reported features being delayed growth (including fetal growth restriction), microcephaly, and mild to severe intellectual disability. Other features such as polydactyly, facial dysmorphisms, cardiac defects, renal hypoplasia, increased fetal nuchal translucency, and abnormalities of male genitalia are also common. \n\nBased on a known carrier frequency, there is a lower observed disease prevalence than expected, possibly suggesting increased rates of pregnancy loss in carrier couples SLOS or subclinical presentation of the disease in affected individuals (PMIDs: 28166604, 20556518). There are a few discrepant publications to make such an argument. Analysis of a stillbirth cohort did not yield a significant number of cases with biallelic *DHCR7* pathogenic variants (PMID: 29433144). A study of pregnancies with the homozygous *DHCR7* variant c.964-1G>C (n=32) found intrauterine fetal demise, severe prenatal phenotypes, and death before three months of age (PMID: 32055014). Excess miscarriages were also observed in c.964-1G>C carrier couples (PMIDs: 37301908, 32055014). These observations suggest that homozygosity for *DHCR7* c.964-1G>C variant causes severe prenatal phenotypes and can result in early pregnancy loss but additional information is needed to understand the relationship between prenatal phenotypes and other variants in *DHCR7*. Currently there is no clear relationship of stillbirths in pregnancies with biallelic *DHCR7* pathogenic variants. There is also no data currently supporting the relationship between biallelic *DHCR7* variants and early miscarriages due to the lack of sequencing data are mostly unavailable. \n\nNine probands with twelve unique variants (splice, nonsense, missense) reported in seven publications are reported in this curation. Mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function (PMID: 27401223). \n\nExperimental evidence includes three mouse models of disease, rescue experiments showing normalized 7-DCH levels in patient-derived fibroblasts transfected with WT *DHCR7*, and additional studies demonstrating null or hypomorphic mRNA or protein expression in genes harboring pathogenic variants. Almost all SLOS patients demonstrate intellectual disability (Cunniff et al., 1997; Ryan et al., 1998) and about half meet the DSM-IV criteria for autism diagnosis (Tierney et al., 2000).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DHCR7* and  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. While the postnatal presentations of this disorder are relatively well understood, and several such features are observed prenatally, more evidence is needed to understand if there is an increased risk for pregnancy loss in affected pregnancies.\nThis curation was originally approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on September 9, 2018 (SOP 5). It was later evaluated by the Prenatal Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 15, 2023 (SOP 9). As of June 2024, this record underwent administrative updates to update scoring to be consistent with SOP Version 9 and additions to the evidence summary were made discussing the prenatal presentation. One new case was also added to capture the prenatal presentation of this condition (PMID: 28805615), however the original classification of Definitive remains the same. \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d5ed71c9-a76b-44c0-b5c0-44d604f2e0e9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
