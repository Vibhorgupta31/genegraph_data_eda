A founder Ashkenazi-Jewish disease-causing variant recently linked Hikeshi and its heat-shock protective function to leukoencephalopathy. In our patient, clinical features of lower limb spasticity, optic atrophy, nystagmus, and severe developmental delay were similar to reported patients. Additional features included vermian atrophy, epileptic seizures, and an ovarian tumor. Structural modeling and protein analyses revealed that modified interactions inside Hikeshi's hydrophobic pockets induce protein instability. The patient's cells showed impaired nuclear translocation of HSP70 during heat shock, and decreased ERO1-LÎ±, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidoreductase. Overall, we show that: (1) the clinical spectrum associated with Hikeshi deficiency extends to leukoencephalopathy with vermian atrophy and epilepsy; (2) the cellular disease process involves both nuclear chaperone and ER functions.","dc:creator":"Vasilescu C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Absence of Hikeshi, a nuclear transporter for heat-shock protein HSP70, causes infantile hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy."}},"rdfs:label":"Vasilescu Case1"},{"id":"cggv:0ae81eb7-7fcd-4dd4-be0e-385c761d74c9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ae81eb7-7fcd-4dd4-be0e-385c761d74c9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0ae81eb7-7fcd-4dd4-be0e-385c761d74c9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 28000699.

We hypothesized that the variant is disease-causing and aimed to rescue the cellular phenotype with vector-mediated gene replacement. HIKESHI mediates heat-induced nuclear accumulation of heat-shock proteins, including HSP70, to protect cells from stress. We generated skin fibroblasts from the proband and proband's mother (heterozygous) to compare protein expression and subcellular localization of HSP70 under heat stress conditions, and the effect of vector-mediated overexpression of HIKESHI in the proband's cells under the same heat stress conditions. Western blot analysis revealed absent HIKESHI protein from proband fibroblasts, contrasted with ample expression in parental cells. Under heat stress conditions, while the mother's cells displayed appropriate nuclear localization of HSP70, the proband's cells displayed impaired nuclear translocalization. When patient fibroblasts were provided exogenous HIKESHI, the transfected proband's cells showed restored heat-induced nuclear translocalization of HSP70 under conditions of heat stress. These functional data establish that the patient's variant is a pathogenic loss-of-function mutation, thus confirming a diagnosis of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 13 and that vector-mediated gene replacement may be an effective treatment approach for patients with this disorder.","dc:creator":"Mallack EJ","dc:date":"2024","dc:title":"A novel missense variant in HIKESHI: Clinical phenotype, in vitro functional testing, and potential for gene therapy."}},"rdfs:label":"Mallack Case1"},{"id":"cggv:d324539b-c106-4070-bf52-86e9bf841df6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d324539b-c106-4070-bf52-86e9bf841df6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d324539b-c106-4070-bf52-86e9bf841df6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 38922739.

Mutation in Hikeshi, encoding a nonconventional nuclear import carrier of heat shock protein 70 family (HSP70s), leads to inherited leukodystrophy; however, the pathological mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we showed that Hikeshi is essential for central nervous system (CNS) myelination. Deficiency of Hikeshi, which is observed in inherited leukodystrophy patients, resulted in murine oligodendrocyte maturation arrest. Hikeshi is required for nuclear translocation of HSP70s upon differentiation. Nuclear-localized HSP70 promotes murine oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after white matter injury. Mechanistically, HSP70s interacted with SOX10 in the nucleus and protected it from E3 ligase FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination degradation. Importantly, we discovered that Hikeshi-dependent hyperthermia therapy, which induces nuclear import of HSP70s, promoted oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination following inÂ vivo demyelinating injury. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Hikeshi-mediated nuclear translocation of HSP70s is essential for myelinogenesis and provide insights into pathological mechanisms of Hikeshi-related leukodystrophy.","dc:creator":"Li L","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"Nuclear import carrier Hikeshi cooperates with HSP70 to promote murine oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination."},"rdfs:label":"Conditional KO mice demonstrate reduced myelination"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9335,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"cggv:aa7edfe1-374c-4151-a2f4-85c2ed9ba821","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014813","gene":"hgnc:26938","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"HIKESHI was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-13 (OMIM: 616881) in 2016 (Edvardson et al., PMID: 26545878). Hikeshi protein function is essential to cell viability in conditions of heat stress and mediates the heat stress-induced nuclear import of heat shock protein (Hsp70) through a nuclear pore complex (Helman et al 2021, PMID: 34111619). This disease is clinically characterized by early onset global developmental delay, hypotonia evolving to dystonia or spastic quadriplegia, intellectual disability, and additional variable findings including neurodevelopmental regression, failure to thrive, ocular/visual abnormalities, and microcephaly (PMID: 34111619). Neuroimaging shows diffuse hypomyelination and thin corpus callosum (PMID: 34111619).\n\nThree unique missense variants that have been reported in the homozygous state in twelve probands across five publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 26545878, 28000699, 31912665, 34111619, 38922739). All three missense variants have supporting functional data. Of note, one variant (c.160C>G (p.Val54Leu)) was observed in 10 probands of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and is likely a founder variant in this population. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model. HIKESHI conditional knockout mice displayed a reduced number of myelinated axons when compared to wildtype mice, as well as decreased thickness of the myelin (PMID: 37865085). These characteristics resemble the human phenotype of hypomyelination. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between HIKESHI and autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-13 (MONDO:0014813), also known as HIKESHI-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date October 9, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\nClassified previously as \"Strong\" in error","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aaeeceab-84bc-471c-b8f2-8286d3781398"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
