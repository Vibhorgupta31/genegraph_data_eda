Analysis of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in Spg20-/- embryonic fibroblasts indicated that Smad1/5 phosphorylation is modestly elevated, possibly due to alterations in BMP receptor trafficking. Cytokinesis was impaired in embryonic fibroblasts cultured from Spg20-/- mice, and binucleated chondrocytes were prominent in epiphyseal growth plates of bones in Spg20-/- mice, perhaps explaining the short stature of patients.

Troyer Syndrome is an autosomal recessive form of complicated spastic paraplegia, typically with onset between the ages of 1-2 years. Affected individuals present with short stature, distal amyotrophy, dysarthria, and mild cognitive defects (Patel et al., PMID:12134148). At least 7 unique variants have been reported in 70 individuals, including one founder mutation (PMIDs: 12134148, 20437587, 31314595, 27539578). The molecular mechanism appears to be loss of function. Experimentally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays, in vitro studies, a mouse model that partially recapitulates the human phenotype (PMID:19307600, PMID: 20719964), and rescue experiments in C. elegans (PMID: 26114733). \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SPART and autosomal recessive Troyer Syndrome.
