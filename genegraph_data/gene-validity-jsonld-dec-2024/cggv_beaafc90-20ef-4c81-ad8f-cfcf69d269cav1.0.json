Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), while mutations in multiple genes cause autosomal dominant DCM. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a member of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family and has been implicated in both myogenesis and sarcomere assembly. In the latter role, it binds zyxin and alpha-actinin, both of which are involved in actin organization. An MLP-deficient mouse has been described; these mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Based upon these data, and the recent descriptions of mutations in MLP in patients with DCM or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we screened patients for mutations in the MLP and alpha-actinin-2 genes. We identified a patient with DCM and EFE, having a mutation in MLP with the residue lysine 69 substituted by arginine (K69R). This is within a highly conserved region adjacent to the first LIM domain involved in alpha-actinin binding. Analysis in cell culture systems demonstrated that the mutation abolishes the interaction between MLP and alpha-actinin-2 and the cellular localization of MLP was altered. In another individual with DCM, a W4R mutation was identified. However, this mutation did not segregate with disease in this family. In another patient with DCM, a Q9R mutation was identified in alpha-actinin-2. This mutation also disrupted the interaction with MLP and appeared to inhibit alpha-actinin function in cultured cells, in respect to the nuclear localization of actinin and the initiation of cellular differentiation.","dc:creator":"Mohapatra B","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in the muscle LIM protein and alpha-actinin-2 genes in dilated cardiomyopathy and endocardial fibroelastosis."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14567970","rdfs:label":"ML"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Possible phenocopy or non-DCM phenotype."},{"id":"cggv:9c566f23-1968-4307-9a8a-d9a5a5aa87d2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e26ecda-a420-412a-b8e0-90c6e809c3a7","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:9c566f23-1968-4307-9a8a-d9a5a5aa87d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:346b9f47-548d-4caa-a51f-78c114986ae2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003476.5(CSRP3):c.214G>A (p.Gly72Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5916623"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19412328","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"More than 20 genes have been reported to cause idiopathic and familial dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC/FDC), but the frequency of genetic causation remains poorly understood.","dc:creator":"Hershberger RE","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Coding sequence mutations identified in MYH7, TNNT2, SCN5A, CSRP3, LBD3, and TCAP from 313 patients with familial or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19412328","rdfs:label":"F.1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Case-level missense variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"cggv:beaafc90-20ef-4c81-ad8f-cfcf69d269ca_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:beaafc90-20ef-4c81-ad8f-cfcf69d269ca_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96240ddd-36fb-44d1-9bcc-9323c4b5c905","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ff86581-9b76-4a6e-a61c-3c62d1227c9c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In situ localization of CSRP3 in the developing mouse heart.

Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and case-control data. At least four missense variants have been reported in humans with DCM (Mohapatra et al. 2003, PMID 14567970; Hershberger et al. 2008, PMID 19412328; Shakeel M et al. 2018, PMID 29776034; and Zimmerman et al. 2010, PMID 20474083). Two case-control studies did not find evidence of enrichment of the missense variant in cases, however, the confidence intervals were wide due to limited sample size (Mazzarotto et al. 2020, PMID 31983221; Walsh et al. 2017, PMID 27532257). This gene-disease assertion is supported by experimental data from expression studies and animal, ex-vivo, and cell culture models. Arber et al. (1997, PMID 9039266) reported the phenotype of a transgenic homozygous CSRP3-null mouse, demonstrating defects of the cardiomyocyte cytoskeletal architecture with Z-disc misalignment and myofibrillar disarray. Knoll et al. (2002, PMID 12507422) demonstrated a defect in cardiomyocyte stretch-induced response. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of CSRP3 with DCM.
