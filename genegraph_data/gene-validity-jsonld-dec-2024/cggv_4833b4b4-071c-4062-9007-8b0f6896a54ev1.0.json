These SDH-deficient GISTs are known to be KIT/PDGFRA wild type, and most patients affected by this subset of GISTs are young. Some of these patients have germline mutations of SDH subunit genes SDHB, SDHC, or SDHD, known as Carney-Stratakis syndrome when combined with paraganglioma. More recently, germline mutations in SDH subunit A gene (SDHA) have also been reported in few patients with KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs. In this study we immunohistochemically examined 127 SDHB-negative and 556 SDHB-positive gastric GISTs and 261 SDHB-positive intestinal GISTs for SDHA expression using a mouse monoclonal antibody 2E3 (Abcam). Cases with available DNA were tested for SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD gene mutations using a hybridization-based custom capture next-generation sequencing assay. A total of 36 SDHA-negative GISTs (28%) were found among 127 SDHB-negative gastric GISTs. No SDHB-positive GIST was SDHA negative. Among 7 SDHA-negative tumors analyzed, there were 7 SDHA mutants, most germline. A second hit indicating biallelic inactivation of SDHA was present in 6 of those cases. These patients had no other SDH subunit gene mutations. Among the 25 SDHA-positive, SDHB-negative GISTs analyzed, we identified 3 SDHA mutations (1 germline), and 11 SDHB, SDHC, or SDHD mutations (mostly germline), and 11 patients with no SDH mutations. Compared with patients with SDHA-positive GISTs, those with SDHA-negative GISTs had an older median age (34 vs. 21 y), lower female to male ratio (1.8 vs. 3.1) but similar mitotic counts and median tumor sizes, with a slow course of disease in most cases, despite a slightly higher rate of liver metastases. SDHA-negative GISTs comprise approximately 30% of SDHB-negative/SDH-deficient GISTs, and SDHA loss generally correlates with SDHA mutations.","dc:creator":"Miettinen M","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Immunohistochemical loss of succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) signals SDHA germline mutation."},"rdfs:label":"Immunohistochemistry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"6 Gastric GIST with 4 different germline variants."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:4833b4b4-071c-4062-9007-8b0f6896a54e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4ee02ff-ff16-47fa-90c3-05e1b9e33736","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d4d518e-99b6-48ca-b2d0-49c79aa1ce43","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"The SDH1 null mutant (aW303DSDH1) could not grow in minimal glycerol/ethanol medium, an integrated copy of SDH1 (aW303 deltaSDH1/ST20) can rescue the growth, but an integrated copy of the Arg582Trp mutant gene (aW303deltaSDH1/ST19) could.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20484225","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mitochondrial succinate-coenzyme Q reductase (complex II) consists of four subunits, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD. Heterozygous germline mutations in SDHB, SDHC, SDHD and SDHAF2 [encoding for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex assembly factor 2] cause hereditary paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. Surprisingly, no genetic link between SDHA and paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma syndrome has ever been established. We identified a heterozygous germline SDHA mutation, p.Arg589Trp, in a woman suffering from catecholamine-secreting abdominal paraganglioma. The functionality of the SDHA mutant was assessed by studying SDHA, SDHB, HIF-1alpha and CD34 protein expression using immunohistochemistry and by examining the effect of the mutation in a yeast model. Microarray analyses were performed to study gene expression involved in energy metabolism and hypoxic pathways. We also investigated 202 paragangliomas or pheochromocytomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD loci by BAC array comparative genomic hybridization. In vivo and in vitro functional studies demonstrated that the SDHA mutation causes a loss of SDH enzymatic activity in tumor tissue and in the yeast model. Immunohistochemistry and transcriptome analyses established that the SDHA mutation causes pseudo-hypoxia, which leads to a subsequent increase in angiogenesis, as other SDHx gene mutations. LOH was detected at the SDHA locus in the patient's tumor but was present in only 4.5% of a large series of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas.

However, such approaches rely on accurate estimates of variant pathogenicity and disease penetrance, which may have been subject to ascertainment and reporting biases, although the recent provision of large population-based DNA sequence data sets may provide a potentially unbiased resource to aid variant interpretation. Thus, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the pathogenicity and penetrance of SDHA variants reported in literature-based PPGL cases by comparing their frequency to those occurring in the Genome Aggregation Database (GnomAD) data set, which provides high-quality DNA sequence data on 138,632 individuals. In total, 39 different missense or loss-of-function (LOF) SDHA variants were identified in 95 PPGL index cases. Notably, many of the PPGL-associated SDHA alleles were observed at an unexpectedly high frequency in the GnomAD cohort, with ~1% and ~0.1% of the background population harboring a rare missense or LOF variant, respectively. Although the pathogenicity of several SDHA alleles was supported by significant enrichment in PPGL cases relative to GnomAD controls, calculations of disease penetrance based on allele frequencies in the respective cohorts resulted in much lower estimates than previously reported, ranging from 0.1% to 4.9%. Thus, although this study provides support for the etiological role of SDHA in PPGL formation, it suggests that most variant carriers will not manifest PPGLs and are unlikely to benefit from periodic surveillance screening.","dc:creator":"Maniam P","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Pathogenicity and Penetrance of Germline SDHA Variants in Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PPGL)."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29978154","rdfs:label":"Index 3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This variant has been observed in an individual affected with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (PMID: 23612575) and in individuals affected with paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndromes (PMID: 25720320, 28384794).

The molecular mechanism is loss of function in one of the 4 genes comprising the succinate dehydrogenase and SDHAF gene for flavination of SDHA, and stabilization of the SDH complex. This is a curation for SDHA and SDHA associated Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma syndromes (PGL/PCC) with autosomal dominant inheritance (Paraganglioma 5, MIM: 614165). The autosomal recessive inherited Leigh syndrome (MIM: 256000), Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1GG (MIM: 613642) and Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Complex II deficiency (MIM: 252011) will be curated separately. SDHA encodes the flavoprotein subunit of the SDH-complex (succinate dehydrogenase). SDHA was first reported in relation to PGL/PCC in 1995 [Bourgeron et al., PMID: 7550341]. Germline loss-of-function mutations of SDHA gene have been described in only 3-7% of the patients with PGL/PCCs, in which most pathogenic variants are associated with very low disease penetrance, ranging from 0.1-4.9% [PMID: 29978154]. An initiation codon, two missense, four nonsense and two small deletion variants are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. Absence of SDHA staining specifically associated with SDHA germline mutation in PGL/PCC tumors was demonstrated in 6 cases with 6 germline variants [PMID: 23282968]. Yeast models with null Sdh1 and Arg582Trp Sdh1 mutants showed loss of SDH1 due to instability of the mutant protein. SDHB protein, the catalytic component, is lost in the SDHA mutant patient’s fresh adrenal paraganglioma tumor. WT yeast SDH1 can rescue the deficient growth of null Sdh1 mutant on minimal glycerol/ethanol but the yeast Arg582Trp Sdh1 mutant can not [PMID: 20484225]. In summary, the SDHA gene is definitely associated with autosomal dominant HPGL/PCC with low penetrance. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the genetic, and experimental, biochemical and functional studies, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:4833b4b4-071c-4062-9007-8b0f6896a54e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
