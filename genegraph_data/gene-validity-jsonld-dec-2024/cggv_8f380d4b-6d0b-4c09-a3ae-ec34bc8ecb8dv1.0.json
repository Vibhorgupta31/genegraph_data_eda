Meckelin localizes to the primary cilium, basal body and elsewhere within the cell. Here, we found that the cytoplasmic domain of meckelin directly interacts with the actin-binding protein filamin A, potentially at the apical cell surface associated with the basal body. Mutations in FLNA, the gene for filamin A, cause periventricular heterotopias. We identified a single consanguineous patient with an MKS-like ciliopathy that presented with both MKS and cerebellar heterotopia, caused by an unusual in-frame deletion mutation in the meckelin C-terminus at the region of interaction with filamin A. We modelled this mutation and found it to abrogate the meckelin-filamin A interaction. Furthermore, we found that loss of filamin A by siRNA knockdown, in patient cells, and in tissues from Flna(Dilp2) null mouse embryos results in cellular phenotypes identical to those caused by meckelin loss, namely basal body positioning and ciliogenesis defects. In addition, morpholino knockdown of flna in zebrafish embryos significantly increases the frequency of dysmorphology and severity of ciliopathy developmental defects caused by mks3 knockdown. Our results suggest that meckelin forms a functional complex with filamin A that is disrupted in MKS and causes defects in neuronal migration and Wnt signalling. Furthermore, filamin A has a crucial role in the normal processes of ciliogenesis and basal body positioning. Concurrent with these processes, the meckelin-filamin A signalling axis may be a key regulator in maintaining correct, normal levels of Wnt signalling.","dc:creator":"Adams M","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"A meckelin-filamin A interaction mediates ciliogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Meckelin and Filamin A interaction "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:8f380d4b-6d0b-4c09-a3ae-ec34bc8ecb8d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c66f2d73-10b0-4636-93ac-84967a476240","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f75a6240-b9a0-43a4-8047-b9e7a0eb6fef","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Patient cells had cilia that were longer than expected and had more than 2 centrosomes.

MKS is thought to be a ciliopathy because of the range of phenotypes and localization of some of the implicated proteins. However, limited data are available about the phenotypes associated with MKS1 and MKS3, and the published ciliary data are conflicting. Analysis of the wpk rat model of MKS3 revealed functional defects of the connecting cilium in the eye that resulted in lack of formation of the outer segment, whereas infertile wpk males developed spermatids with very short flagella that did not extend beyond the cell body. In wpk renal collecting duct cysts, cilia were generally longer than normal, with additional evidence of cells with multiple primary cilia and centrosome over-duplication. Kidney tissue and cells from MKS1 and MKS3 patients showed defects in centrosome and cilia number, including multi-ciliated respiratory-like epithelia, and longer cilia. Stable shRNA knockdown of Mks1 and Mks3 in IMCD3 cells induced multi-ciliated and multi-centrosomal phenotypes. These studies demonstrate that MKS1 and MKS3 are ciliopathies, with new cilia-related eye and sperm phenotypes defined.

Components of this complex co-localize at the transition zone, a region between the basal body and ciliary axoneme. Like Tctn1, loss of Tctn2, Tmem67 or Cc2d2a causes tissue-specific defects in ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition.

The association of retinal dystrophy and renal anomalies defines JS type B. JS is a genetically heterogeneous condition with mutations in two genes, AHI1 and CEP290, identified to date. In addition, NPHP1 deletions identical to those that cause juvenile nephronophthisis have been identified in a subset of patients with a mild form of cerebellar and brainstem anomaly. Occipital encephalocele and/or polydactyly have occasionally been reported in some patients with JS, and these phenotypic features can also be observed in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS). MKS is a rare, autosomal recessive lethal condition characterized by central nervous system malformations (typically, occipital meningoencephalocele), postaxial polydactyly, multicystic kidney dysplasia, and ductal proliferation in the portal area of the liver. Since there is obvious phenotypic overlap between JS and MKS, we hypothesized that mutations in the recently identified MKS genes, MKS1 on chromosome 17q and MKS3 on 8q, may be a cause of JS. After mutation analysis of MKS1 and MKS3 in a series of patients with JS (n=22), we identified MKS3 mutations in four patients with JS, thus defining MKS3 as the sixth JS locus (JBTS6). No MKS1 mutations were identified in this series, suggesting that the allelism is restricted to MKS3.","dc:creator":"Baala L","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"The Meckel-Gruber syndrome gene, MKS3, is mutated in Joubert syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"JS-05-1"},{"id":"cggv:d6c6af24-947c-4a62-ba72-8c4374f1998d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d6c6af24-947c-4a62-ba72-8c4374f1998d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Homozygous, no functional evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1fed2bda-b834-407d-8b5a-2e62e7c9fc59_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1fed2bda-b834-407d-8b5a-2e62e7c9fc59","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9edb4ba8-8d61-4bca-a3f4-c7bbd9859947","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142301.1(TMEM67):c.627-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212766"}},"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3579a551-96ef-4b6f-bca4-d6543f377943_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9edb4ba8-8d61-4bca-a3f4-c7bbd9859947"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16415887"},"rdfs:label":"73-1"},{"id":"cggv:3579a551-96ef-4b6f-bca4-d6543f377943","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3579a551-96ef-4b6f-bca4-d6543f377943_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Pedigree not included, can not determine number of unaffected individuals for scoring"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:658ef86a-db36-4731-b70e-e581509b020d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:658ef86a-db36-4731-b70e-e581509b020d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:bdd23ff1-c7e6-4182-be3b-6840c37ec4ba","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153704.6(TMEM67):c.1769T>C (p.Phe590Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210661"}},{"id":"cggv:9a93af25-1d0e-498c-b48c-de5a99802b60","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001142301.1(TMEM67):c.1718-2A>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA212768"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Liver transplant","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002419","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0000657","obo:HP_0001395","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002040","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0000639"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:394672b1-8163-49e6-96ad-ad0ce99128ee_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bdd23ff1-c7e6-4182-be3b-6840c37ec4ba"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19058225"},{"id":"cggv:02d243da-6853-43ec-940c-6bebc11a8dee_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9a93af25-1d0e-498c-b48c-de5a99802b60"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19058225"}],"rdfs:label":"COR09-14"},{"id":"cggv:394672b1-8163-49e6-96ad-ad0ce99128ee","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:394672b1-8163-49e6-96ad-ad0ce99128ee_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:394672b1-8163-49e6-96ad-ad0ce99128ee_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Amino acid is highly conserved among different species.

This is predicted to generate a shorter protein lacking 80 amino acids (p.A621_E700del) that are part of the loop between putative transmembrane domains 1 and 2, and of the second transmembrane domain (Figure 1B)."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c61a3952-0b0c-4c2f-89cf-ab712e08d6c8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":["Inconclusive","Supports"],"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c61a3952-0b0c-4c2f-89cf-ab712e08d6c8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:ca71bba1-b23f-45f1-84ed-b897d557cd93","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153704.6(TMEM67):c.579_580del (p.Gly195fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144492"}},{"id":"cggv:bdd23ff1-c7e6-4182-be3b-6840c37ec4ba"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001395","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000657","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002419","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0001251"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:9d1f0c6b-a734-49c4-8054-f80574531ce8_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bdd23ff1-c7e6-4182-be3b-6840c37ec4ba"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19058225"},{"id":"cggv:2d2bbf11-5ebe-40cf-a7a4-5e0bc94c8098_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ca71bba1-b23f-45f1-84ed-b897d557cd93"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19058225"}],"rdfs:label":"COR20-1991"},{"id":"cggv:9d1f0c6b-a734-49c4-8054-f80574531ce8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9d1f0c6b-a734-49c4-8054-f80574531ce8_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Review status - this variant was already scored for family COR09"},{"id":"cggv:2d2bbf11-5ebe-40cf-a7a4-5e0bc94c8098","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2d2bbf11-5ebe-40cf-a7a4-5e0bc94c8098_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:a10e0488-9c71-4ac8-ac42-c6e21639e178_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a10e0488-9c71-4ac8-ac42-c6e21639e178","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:56964cb9-281f-4d9c-aba6-0b49a33c8e21","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153704.6(TMEM67):c.2345A>G (p.His782Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4808285"}},{"id":"cggv:13e3619a-bb4e-4f0a-9d8b-b4710912444f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_153704.6(TMEM67):c.1115C>A (p.Thr372Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA279345"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000077","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0000589","obo:HP_0000657","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0033149","obo:HP_0002419","obo:HP_0001263"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:9cba4184-7ce1-4ac9-9296-36f7ebbf9e11_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:13e3619a-bb4e-4f0a-9d8b-b4710912444f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19058225"},{"id":"cggv:46286382-3809-4508-99e2-c15864699a1e_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:56964cb9-281f-4d9c-aba6-0b49a33c8e21"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19058225"}],"rdfs:label":"COR32-2002"},{"id":"cggv:46286382-3809-4508-99e2-c15864699a1e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:46286382-3809-4508-99e2-c15864699a1e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:46286382-3809-4508-99e2-c15864699a1e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Amino acid is highly conserved among different species.

(also found in the literature as MKS3) encodes the protein meckelin, located in the ciliary transition zone and plays an integral rile in ciliary structure and function. *TMEM67* has been associated with the following autosomal recessive disease entities: Meckel Syndrome Type 3 (MKS3, OMIM:607361); Joubert Syndrome 6 (JBTS6, OMIM:61088); COACH Syndrome 1 (OMIM:21630); Nephronophthisis 11 (NPHP11, OMIM:613550); and RHYNS Syndrome (OMIM:602152). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism AND/OR inheritance pattern. While these disease entities represent a wide range of clinical severity, the molecular mechanism is loss of function causing ciliopathy and the inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, ciliopathy (MONDO:0005308). Nomenclature for these disease entities is suggested to follow “Disease-Gene” system: MKS-*TMEM67*, JBTS-*TMEM67*, COACH-*TMEM67*, NPHP-*TMEM67*, RHYNS-*TMEM67*, and an overall proposed nomenclature is Ciliopathy-*TMEM67*.\n\nSummary of Case-Level Data: 12 points. Twenty-one unique variants (missense, frameshift, splice site) from 19 probands in 3 publications were curated (PMID:16415887, PMID:16415887, PMID:19058225). Homozygous variants were described as causative for MKS-*TMEM67* in four families with central nervous system, renal, hepatic, and polydactyly clinical features (PMID:16415887), and compound heterozygous variants in one family (PMID:17160906). One homozygous variant and two compound heterozygous variants were described in two families as causative for JBTS-*TMEM67* with hepatic, ocular, global developmental delay, and central nervous system clinical features (PMID:17160906). Seven families with COACH-*TMEM67* were described with twelve compound heterozygous variants, displaying central nervous system, hepatic, renal, growth delay, and ocular clinical features (PMID:19058225). More information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. *TMEM67* variants have also been associated with RHYNS-*TMEM67* in one family (PMID:29891882) and four families with nephronophthisis and liver fibrosis, NPHP-*TMEM67* (PMID:19508969). The mechanism for disease is homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function (PMID:16415887). \n\nExperimental Evidence: 6 points. This gene-disease association is supported by altered expression in patient liver tissue (PMID:16415887), characterization of the wpk rat model for Meckel Syndrome (PMID:16415887, PMID:19515853), mouse models (PMID:19211713, PMID:21725307), protein interactions between meckelin and filamen A, a transfection cell culture model system demonstrating a variant found in patients leads to loss of cilia formation and disrupts the meckelin-filamin A interatction, and a phenotype rescue in a mks3 zebrafish model displaying notochord, ocular, and renal abnormalities (PMID:22121117). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TMEM67* and autosomal recessive ciliopathy-*TMEM67*. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 7/14/21 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:8f380d4b-6d0b-4c09-a3ae-ec34bc8ecb8d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
