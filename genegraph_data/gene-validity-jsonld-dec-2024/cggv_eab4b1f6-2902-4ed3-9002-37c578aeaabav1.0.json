Different classes of mutations have been described at the protein level suggesting that this is a heterogeneous disease. It was previously demonstrated that porphobilinogen deaminase is encoded by two distinct mRNA species expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Analysis of the genomic sequences indicated that these two mRNAs are transcribed from two promoters and only differ in their first exon. The first mutation identified in the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene is a single-base substitution (G----A) in the canonical 5' splice donor site of intron 1. This mutation leads to a particular subtype of acute intermittent porphyria characterized by the restriction of the enzymatic defect to nonerythropoietic tissues. Hybridization analysis using oligonucleotide probes after in vitro amplification of genomic DNA offers another possibility of detecting asymptomatic carriers of the mutation in affected families.","dc:creator":"Grandchamp B","dc:date":"1989","dc:title":"Tissue-specific splicing mutation in acute intermittent porphyria."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eab4b1f6-2902-4ed3-9002-37c578aeaaba_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eab4b1f6-2902-4ed3-9002-37c578aeaaba_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6481ac7d-07df-4ac7-a954-c263b60764e4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ef61156d-117b-4e32-b73c-8ed74d92787d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RNA-seq data from the GTEx database (PMID: 23715323) indicate that HMBS expression is restricted to the blood and spleen.

To investigate the dramatically different manifestations, knock-in mice with human HD-AIP missense mutations c.500G>A (p.Arg167Glu) or c.518_519GC>AG (p.Arg173Glu), designated R167Q or R173Q mice, respectively, were generated and compared with the previously established T1/T2 mice with ~30% residual HMBS activity and the heterozygous AIP phenotype.

Central nervous system (CNS) histology was grossly intact, but CNS myelination was delayed and overall myelin volume was decreased. Heme concentrations in liver and brain were similar to those of T1/T2 mice. Notably, ALA and PBG concentrations in the cerebral spinal fluid and CNS regions were markedly elevated in R167Q+/+ mice compared with T1/T2 mice. When the T1/T2 mice were administered phenobarbital, ALA and PBG markedly accumulated in their liver and plasma, but not in the CNS, indicating that ALA and PBG do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.

PBGD is encoded by two distinct mRNA species expressed in a tissue-specific manner from a single gene. One transcript is expressed in erythroid tissues, while the housekeeping transcript is expressed in all tissues. In classical AIP (95% of cases) the housekeeping and the erythroid-specific enzymes both have half-normal activity in erythroid and non-erythroid tissues, whereas in the variant non-erythroid form of the disease the enzymatic defect is present only in non-erythroid cells. A large allelic heterogeneity of mutations (n>135) has been demonstrated in classical AIP, but to date only three different mutations have been characterized in the non-erythroid variant form of AIP. We describe the molecular abnormalities responsible for the non-erythroid variant form of AIP in two French and two German unrelated AIP patients with normal PBGD activity in the erythrocytes. Three different splicing defects located in the intron 1 donor splice site were identified: a 33+1 g-->a mutation, previously described in a Dutch family, was found in two patients; two novel mutations (33+2 t-->a, 33+5 c-->g) affected the two remaining patients. All the mutations resulted in the activation of a cryptic splice site 67 bp downstream in intron 1, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon in exon 4. Mutations in the exon 1 donor splice site are involved in eight of the nine non-erythroid variant AIP families reported in the literature. These data show that most mutations causing the non-erythroid variant AIP are exon 1 splice defects, in contrast with classical AIP, where missense mutations are chiefly involved. Moreover, the allelic heterogeneity of PBGD gene defects causing the non-erythroid variant AIP is demonstrated, with five different mutations identified. These mutations could be easily detected by a single denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis which also allows the presymptomatic detection of gene carriers in the affected families.","dc:creator":"Puy H","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Exon 1 donor splice site mutations in the porphobilinogen deaminase gene in the non-erythroid variant form of acute intermittent porphyria."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Puy_1998_Patient_3"},{"id":"cggv:501ac7f1-25f2-4bd6-9814-7cc905fece8a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:501ac7f1-25f2-4bd6-9814-7cc905fece8a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:501ac7f1-25f2-4bd6-9814-7cc905fece8a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"The pathogenicity of the variant is supported by Figure 3, showing that this variant disrupts the canonical splice site and triggers activation of a cryptic splice site 67bp downstream in intron 1, causing a frameshift and premature stop codon in exon 4.

Affected individuals have since emerged from a diverse range of ethnicities, with a consistent majority of carriers remaining unaffected throughout their lifetimes. Affected individuals generally present with an acute attack of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, sometimes accompanied by other gastrointestinal, neurological, and/or psychiatric symptoms. Onset of such an attack typically occurs during adolescence or later, and can be triggered by barbiturate or sulfonamide drugs known to activate heme synthesis or by low caloric intake, infection, alcohol consumption, or hormones (PMID: 10343207). Among published probands, the most common phenotypes are elevated urinary levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and related porphyrin metabolites during an attack. Abdominal pain and vomiting during an episode can be accompanied by paralysis or other abnormalities of movement and abnormal sensations such as paresthesia, and can be followed by lasting symptoms such as chronic hypertension or renal impairment. The majority of affected individuals exhibit reduced HMBS enzymatic activity in erythrocytes, although a subset of patients do not and are characterized as having a non-erythroid form of acute intermittent porphyria that is associated with particular *HMBS* variants but is otherwise clinically indistinguishable. More recent studies have detected rare, severe cases of acute intermittent porphyria that harbor biallelic *HMBS* variants (PMID: 1577472, PMID: 15534187). These cases generally have onset in early childhood, present with additional neurological phenotypes including developmental abnormalities of the brain, ataxia, dysarthria, and seizures, and can have ocular issues such as cataracts and optic nerve hypoplasia. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (HMBS loss-of-function) was found to be consistent between the acute intermittent porphyria cases with biallelic variants and those with monoallelic variants. In addition, the phenotypic differences between the biallelic and monoallelic cases (including the non-erythroid subtype) appeared to represent a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *HMBS* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity referred to as acute intermittent porphyria (MONDO:0008294, MIM #176000), with a semidominant mode of inheritance.\n\nNine suspected pathogenic variants have been scored as part of this curation (four missense, one single codon deletion, and four triggering splicing defects), which have been collectively reported in eleven probands in six publications (PMID: 2563167, PMID: 9860299, PMID: 15534187, PMID: 1577472, PMID: 11013452, PMID: 2789372). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic or biallelic loss of *HMBS* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. None of the published biallelic cases harbored two alleles predicted to result in complete loss of function (PMID: 1577472, PMID: 15534187). Nine out of eleven probands were heterozygous for their respective variants, while two probands were homozygous or compound heterozygous. Five of the heterozygous probands exhibited the less common non-erythroid subtype and harbored variants disrupting the splice site of the isoform-specific intron 1 (PMID: 2563167, PMID: 9860299). Segregation evidence was available in one of these publications (PMID: 2563167) and has contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. Additional case-level evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 7757070, PMID: 2246851) but was not included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported experimental evidence demonstrating that *HMBS* encodes the human enzyme responsible for catalyzing hydroxymethylbilane synthesis from porphobilinogen (PMID: 4019471, PMID: 2875434). This represents a critical step in the heme biosynthesis pathway and is consistent with the accumulation of heme precursors in the urine of affected patients. Among human tissues, the blood and spleen express the highest levels of *HMBS* mRNA, reflecting the relative importance of its erythroid-specific isoform (PMID: 3816774). Genetically engineered mouse and naturally occurring cat models have shown that either biallelic (PMID: 8563760, PMID: 30615115, PMID: 19934113) or monoallelic (PMID: 19934113) HMBS loss-of-function can recapitulate many of the molecular and systemic phenotypes observed in human patients, including urinary accumulation of heme precursors and neuromotor and muscular dysfunction.\n\nIn summary, *HMBS* is definitively associated with acute intermittent porphyria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 27th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:eab4b1f6-2902-4ed3-9002-37c578aeaaba"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
