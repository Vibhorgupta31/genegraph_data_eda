Over 70% of PME cases can now be molecularly solved. Known PME genes encode a variety of proteins, many involved in lysosomal and endosomal function. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 84 (78 unrelated) unsolved PME-affected individuals, with or without additional family members, to discover novel causes. We identified likely disease-causing variants in 24 out of 78 (31%) unrelated individuals, despite previous genetic analyses. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher for individuals studied as trios or families (14/28) versus singletons (10/50) (OR = 3.9, p value = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). The 24 likely solved cases of PME involved 18 genes. First, we found and functionally validated five heterozygous variants in NUS1 and DHDDS and a homozygous variant in ALG10, with no previous disease associations. All three genes are involved in dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation, a pathway not previously implicated in PME. Second, we independently validate SEMA6B as a dominant PME gene in two unrelated individuals. Third, in five families, we identified variants in established PME genes; three with intronic or copy-number changes (CLN6, GBA, NEU1) and two very rare causes (ASAH1, CERS1). Fourth, we found a group of genes usually associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, but here, remarkably, presenting as PME, with or without prior developmental delay. Our systematic analysis of these cases suggests that the small residuum of unsolved cases will most likely be a collection of very rare, genetically heterogeneous etiologies.","dc:creator":"Courage C","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Progressive myoclonus epilepsies-Residual unsolved cases have marked genetic heterogeneity including dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation pathway genes."}},"rdfs:label":"Courage PME7"},{"id":"cggv:b6a58067-eb48-4afc-ae71-25b18a7d1b2c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b6a58067-eb48-4afc-ae71-25b18a7d1b2c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded due to consanguinity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.2},{"id":"cggv:b06288c1-72ae-4ed0-8a27-f886547a8808_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b06288c1-72ae-4ed0-8a27-f886547a8808_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b5eef4e1-8b78-4935-a5be-293a4db67947","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:42909d8f-b9bb-4fee-b0f7-ec42dbb001a7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Although the mouse model does not present with spontaneous seizures, the mouse model demonstrates ataxia and cerebellar degeneration similar to the presentation in humans.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21625621","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Sphingolipids, lipids with a common sphingoid base (also termed long chain base) backbone, play essential cellular structural and signaling functions. Alterations of sphingolipid levels have been implicated in many diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. However, it remains largely unclear whether sphingolipid changes in these diseases are pathological events or homeostatic responses. Furthermore, how changes in sphingolipid homeostasis shape the progression of aging and neurodegeneration remains to be clarified. We identified two mouse strains, flincher (fln) and toppler (to), with spontaneous recessive mutations that cause cerebellar ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration. Positional cloning demonstrated that these mutations reside in the Lass1 gene. Lass1 encodes (dihydro)ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1), which is highly expressed in neurons. Both fln and to mutations caused complete loss of CerS1 catalytic activity, which resulted in a reduction in sphingolipid biosynthesis in the brain and dramatic changes in steady-state levels of sphingolipids and sphingoid bases. In addition to Purkinje cell death, deficiency of CerS1 function also induced accumulation of lipofuscin with ubiquitylated proteins in many brain regions. Our results demonstrate clearly that ceramide biosynthesis deficiency can cause neurodegeneration and suggest a novel mechanism of lipofuscin formation, a common phenomenon that occurs during normal aging and in some neurodegenerative diseases.","dc:creator":"Zhao L","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A deficiency of ceramide biosynthesis causes cerebellar purkinje cell neurodegeneration and lipofuscin accumulation."},"rdfs:label":"Zhao Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Both mouse models were combined to give a sum of 2 points for experimental evidence."},{"id":"cggv:fea8c8fe-25ba-47a7-8fc1-5a454b581f09","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a026062-4539-4d0e-ac67-f54de8c7f6a6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Although spontaneous seizures are not reported in the mouse model, the mouse model demonstrates motor impairment, structural brain abnormalities, and biochemical findings consistent with the human phenotype.

To elucidate the biological function of CerS1-derived sphingolipids in the brain, we generated CerS1-deficient mice by introducing a targeted mutation into the coding region of the cers1 gene. General deficiency of CerS1 in mice caused a foliation defect, progressive shrinkage, and neuronal apoptosis in the cerebellum. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed up to 60% decreased levels of gangliosides in cerebellum and forebrain. Expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein was also decreased by about 60% in cerebellum and forebrain, suggesting that interaction and stabilization of oligodendrocytic myelin-associated glycoprotein by neuronal gangliosides is due to the C18 acyl membrane anchor of CerS1-derived precursor ceramides.

Phenotypic features in individuals with biallelic *CERS1* variants include action myoclonus, myoclonic jerks, seizures (tonic clonic and febrile), truncal and appendicular ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and progressive cognitive deterioration with onset in early to late childhood (Vanni et al., PMID: 24782409; Ferlazzo et al., PMID: 27618929; Goderio Junior et al., PMID: 30800706; Courage et al., PMID: 33798445). Cerebellar and brainstem atrophy have been reported on brain MRI. Seven affected individuals from 3 families with unique homozygous variants are included in this curation (Vanni et al., PMID: 24782409; Ferlazzo et al., PMID: 27618929; Goderio Junior et al., PMID: 30800706; Courage et al., PMID: 33798445). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function of CerS1 activity responsible for the synthesis of C18 ceramides (Vanni et al., PMID: 24782409). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models (Zhao et al., PMID: 21625621; Ginkel et al., PMID: 23074226). A frameshift variant expected to result in nonsense mediated decay arose spontaneously in “flincher” mice at Jackson Laboratory and, although homozygous mice do not develop spontaneous seizures, they developed cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration. A second CerS1 deficient mouse model homozygous for a deletion of the catalytic domain demonstrates decreased synthesis of gangliosides, cerebellar degeneration, and behavior and locomotion defects. The genetic evidence score is 4.2 points, and the experimental evidence score is 2 points for a total of 6.2 points. This score falls between the limited and moderate classification. The GCEP elected to classify this gene as moderate as the collective evidence supports a valid gene disease relationship, but this condition appears to be very rare. In summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *CERS1* and autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date July 16, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:b06288c1-72ae-4ed0-8a27-f886547a8808"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
