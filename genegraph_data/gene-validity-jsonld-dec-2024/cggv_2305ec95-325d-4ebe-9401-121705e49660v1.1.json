Loss-of-function mutations in KAL1 and FGFR1 underlie the X chromosome-linked form and an autosomal dominant form of the disease, respectively. Mutations in these genes, however, only account for approximately 20% of all Kallmann syndrome cases. In a cohort of 192 patients we took a candidate gene strategy and identified ten and four different point mutations in the genes encoding the G protein-coupled prokineticin receptor-2 (PROKR2) and one of its ligands, prokineticin-2 (PROK2), respectively. The mutations in PROK2 were detected in the heterozygous state, whereas PROKR2 mutations were found in the heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous state. In addition, one of the patients heterozygous for a PROKR2 mutation was also carrying a missense mutation in KAL1, thus indicating a possible digenic inheritance of the disease in this individual. These findings reveal that insufficient prokineticin-signaling through PROKR2 leads to abnormal development of the olfactory system and reproductive axis in man. They also shed new light on the complex genetic transmission of Kallmann syndrome.","dc:creator":"DodÃ© C","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Kallmann syndrome: mutations in the genes encoding prokineticin-2 and prokineticin receptor-2."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2305ec95-325d-4ebe-9401-121705e49660_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:60a04de2-3d9b-4c5b-bbd6-f6750c8a7c85_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:60a04de2-3d9b-4c5b-bbd6-f6750c8a7c85","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a7932dcf-e5ce-433a-94ea-3106ddf95403","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001126128.2(PROK2):c.364C>T (p.Arg122Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2491951"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:6c808035-c6b5-4711-80b8-1dc6bb16cbdc_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a7932dcf-e5ce-433a-94ea-3106ddf95403"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24031091","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder that associates hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia.

hormone (GnRH) deficiency in the human presents either as normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH) or with anosmia [Kallmann syndrome (KS)]. To date, several loci have been identified to cause these disorders, but only 30% of cases exhibit mutations in known genes. Recently, murine studies have demonstrated a critical role of the prokineticin pathway in olfactory bulb morphogenesis and GnRH secretion. Therefore, we hypothesize that mutations in prokineticin 2 (PROK2) underlie some cases of KS in humans and that animals deficient in Prok2 would be hypogonadotropic. One hundred IHH probands (50 nIHH and 50 KS) with no known mutations were examined for mutations in the PROK2 gene. Mutant PROK2s were examined in functional studies, and the reproductive phenotype of the Prok2(-/-) mice was also investigated. Two brothers with KS and their sister with nIHH harbored a homozygous deletion in the PROK2 gene (p.[I55fsX1]+[I55fsX1]). Another asymptomatic brother was heterozygous for the deletion, whereas both parents (deceased) had normal reproductive histories. The identified deletion results in a truncated PROK2 protein of 27 amino acids (rather than 81 in its mature form) that lacks bioactivity. In addition, Prok2(-/-) mice with olfactory bulb defects exhibited disrupted GnRH neuron migration, resulting in a dramatic decrease in GnRH neuron population in the hypothalamus as well as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

The reproductive phenotype of KS results from the primary interruption of the olfactory, vomeronasal, and terminal nerve fibers in the frontonasal region, which in turn disrupts the embryonic migration of neuroendocrine gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesizing cells from the nose to the brain. This is a highly heterogeneous genetic disease, and mutations in any of the nine genes identified so far have been found in approximately 30% of the KS patients. PROKR2 and PROK2, which encode the G protein-coupled prokineticin receptor-2 and its ligand prokineticin-2, respectively, are two of these genes. Homozygous knockout mice for the orthologous genes exhibit a phenotype reminiscent of the KS features, but biallelic mutations in PROKR2 or PROK2 (autosomal recessive mode of disease transmission) have been found only in a minority of the patients, whereas most patients carrying mutations in these genes are heterozygotes. The mutations, mainly missense mutations, have deleterious effects on PROKR2 signaling in transfected cells, ranging from defective cell surface-targeting of the receptor to defective coupling to G proteins or impaired receptor-ligand interaction, but the same mutations have also been found in apparently unaffected individuals, which suggests a digenic/oligogenic mode of inheritance of the disease in heterozygous patients. This non-Mendelian mode of inheritance has so far been confirmed only in a few patients. However, it may account for the unusually high proportion of KS sporadic cases compared to familial cases.","dc:creator":"DodÃ© C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"PROK2/PROKR2 Signaling and Kallmann Syndrome."}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Previously Unpublished"},{"id":"cggv:043a4139-c12b-49fe-b8fc-ed76148d015f","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:043a4139-c12b-49fe-b8fc-ed76148d015f_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:879e3732-a064-4000-916a-53c6909a8f18_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:879e3732-a064-4000-916a-53c6909a8f18","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":23,"allele":{"id":"cggv:d9324da4-03a8-4cd7-a49e-0daca05a247b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001126128.2(PROK2):c.297dup (p.Gly100fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2491964"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Decreased serum testosterone concentration, prepubertal basal and GnRH-stimulated gonadotropins","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000771","obo:HP_0000054","obo:HP_0000458"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:a753e8b6-1ff1-47a7-b31a-565fe11ec39b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d9324da4-03a8-4cd7-a49e-0daca05a247b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18682503"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Case 1"},{"id":"cggv:a753e8b6-1ff1-47a7-b31a-565fe11ec39b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a753e8b6-1ff1-47a7-b31a-565fe11ec39b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduced scored from 1 point per variant due to homozygosity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1272276f-3fb4-4ebb-876f-11826dbbb282_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1272276f-3fb4-4ebb-876f-11826dbbb282","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2fd7be36-aaac-4001-a492-f6908ac5c090","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001126128.2(PROK2):c.301C>T (p.Arg101Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2491963"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:64d51a9e-f50b-4b1d-a2c6-55e1c0496a75_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2fd7be36-aaac-4001-a492-f6908ac5c090"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24031091"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"},"rdfs:label":"Patient with KS (2nd missense variant)"},{"id":"cggv:64d51a9e-f50b-4b1d-a2c6-55e1c0496a75","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:64d51a9e-f50b-4b1d-a2c6-55e1c0496a75_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:2305ec95-325d-4ebe-9401-121705e49660_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2305ec95-325d-4ebe-9401-121705e49660_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b9299928-bb75-4b28-9165-c0eec606b4c5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9a3083d-7ec2-463b-a03c-fdd38c1ded88","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"PROK2 expression appeared restricted to testis and peripheral blood leukocytes.

Prokineticin 2 (PK2), a clock-controlled gene that encodes a secreted protein, has been indicated as a candidate SCN clock output signal that regulates circadian locomotor rhythm. Here we report the generation and analysis of PK2-null mice. The reduction of locomotor rhythms in PK2-null mice was apparent in both hybrid and inbred genetic backgrounds. PK2-null mice also displayed significantly reduced rhythmicity for a variety of other physiological and behavioral parameters, including sleep-wake cycle, body temperature, circulating glucocorticoid and glucose levels, as well as the expression of peripheral clock genes. In addition, PK2-null mice showed accelerated acquisition of food anticipatory activity during a daytime food restriction.

Loss of one copy of PK2 or PKR2 gene caused elongated and irregular estrous cycle in the female mice. The alterations in the estrous cycle were more pronounced in PK2-null and PKR2-null compound heterozygous mice. Consistent with these observations, administration of a small molecule PK2 receptor antagonist led to temporary blocking of estrous cycle at the proestrous phase in female mice.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This can be caused by an isolated defect in gonadotropin-releasing hormone release, action, or both. Other associated nonreproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, diabetes, sleep disorder, and sensorineural hearing loss, occur with variable frequency. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 4 with or without anosmia (OMIM:610628), Kallman syndrome (KS), and  normosic congenital (idiopathic) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH) in a semidominant inheritance pattern. Eighteen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, duplication, and insertion) that have been reported in 23 probands in 14 publications (PMIDs: 17054399, 17959774, 18559922, 18682503, 18985070, 23082007, 23596439, 24002956, 24031091, 25077900, 26141714, 30098700, 32870266, 33140874) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, expression studies, biochemical function, and protein interaction) (PMIDs: 12427552, 12604792, 15976302, 17093083, 17959774, 19784373, 24633064). One mouse model phenocopies hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and the expression study demonstrates PROK2 involvement in olfactory bulb neurogenesis. Another mouse model demonstrates that LOF in PROK2 can cause attenuated estrous cycles along with other circadian rhythms including sleep cycles and blood glucose regulation. PROK2 is expressed in the olfactory bulb and testis, proposed to modulate GnRH release as an SCN output molecule regulating circadian rhythms, and interacts with PROKR2 which is definitively associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In summary, PROK2 is definitively associated with semidominant Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 4 with or without anosmia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This has been approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 03/22/2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2305ec95-325d-4ebe-9401-121705e49660"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
