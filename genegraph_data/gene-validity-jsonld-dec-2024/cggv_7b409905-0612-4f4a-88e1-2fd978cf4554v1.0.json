These animals exhibited various situs defects including left isomerism. The asymmetric expression of nodal was prolonged and the expression of Pitx2 was upregulated in the mutant embryos. The absence of Lefty2 conferred on Nodal the ability to diffuse over a long distance. Thus, Nodal-responsive genes, including Pitx2, that are normally expressed on the left side were expressed bilaterally in the mutant embryos, even though nodal expression was confined to the left side. These results suggest that Nodal is a long-range signaling molecule but that its range of action is normally limited by the feedback inhibitor Lefty2.","dc:creator":"Meno C","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Diffusion of nodal signaling activity in the absence of the feedback inhibitor Lefty2."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model homozygous mutants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"This model is not scored as there is no scorable genetic evidence, these are homozygous mutants while the human condition is autosomal dominant, and only a small portion of the mice examined were found to have cardiac anomalies.

Three variants (a missense, a nonsense, and a chromosomal segment deletion) that have been reported in three probands in two publications (PMIDs: 10053005, 25516202) are included in this curation. However, none were scored. The missense and nonsense mutations are too frequent in the general population, and the chromosomal segment deletion included other CHD-associated genes. The only experimental evidence, a mouse model, was not scored due to the lack of scorable genetic evidence and only a low portion of mice exhibiting cardiac anomalies (PMID: 11703930). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *LEFTY2* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *LEFTY2* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 2/6/2022 (SOP Version 10).\nThere is no scorable genetic evidence, and thus the only experimental evidence, a mouse model, was not scored. There is no remaining evidence supporting the gene-disease association.
