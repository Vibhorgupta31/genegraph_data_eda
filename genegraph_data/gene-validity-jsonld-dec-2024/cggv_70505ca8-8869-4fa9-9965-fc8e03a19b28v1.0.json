Over 15 years after FOXP2 was identified, most speech and language impairments remain unexplained at the molecular level. We sequenced whole genomes of nineteen unrelated individuals diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech, a rare disorder enriched for causative mutations of large effect. Where DNA was available from unaffected parents, we discovered de novo mutations, implicating genes, including CHD3, SETD1A and WDR5. In other probands, we identified novel loss-of-function variants affecting KAT6A, SETBP1, ZFHX4, TNRC6B and MKL2, regulatory genes with links to neurodevelopment. Several of the new candidates interact with each other or with known speech-related genes. Moreover, they show significant clustering within a single co-expression module of genes highly expressed during early human brain development.

Recent studies have emphasized the involvement of de novo mutations (DNMs) in ID but the extent to which they contribute to its pathogenesis and the identity of the corresponding genes remain largely unknown. Here, we report a screen for DNMs in subjects with moderate or severe ID. We sequenced the exomes of 41 probands and their parents, and confirmed 81 DNMs affecting the coding sequence or consensus splice sites (1.98 DNMs/proband). We observed a significant excess of de novo single nucleotide substitutions and loss-of-function mutations in these cases compared to control subjects, suggesting that at least a subset of these variations are pathogenic. A total of 12 likely pathogenic DNMs were identified in genes previously associated with ID (ARID1B, CHD2, FOXG1, GABRB3, GATAD2B, GRIN2B, MBD5, MED13L, SETBP1, TBR1, TCF4, WDR45), resulting in a diagnostic yield of ∼29%. We also identified 12 possibly pathogenic DNMs in genes (HNRNPU, WAC, RYR2, SET, EGR1, MYH10, EIF2C1, COL4A3BP, CHMP2A, PPP1CB, VPS4A, PPP2R2B) that have not previously been causally linked to ID. Interestingly, no case was explained by inherited mutations. Protein network analysis indicated that the products of many of these known and candidate genes interact with each other or with products of other ID-associated genes further supporting their involvement in ID. We conclude that DNMs represent a major cause of moderate or severe ID.","dc:creator":"Hamdan FF","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"De novo mutations in moderate or severe intellectual disability."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25356899","rdfs:label":"Individal 1861.653"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:36459f75-dbd2-4b8d-bdff-ce27236fc6e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d586da42-f427-4dfa-aa76-41f7a5bd0409","type":"Proband","ageType":"cggv","ageUnit":"cggv","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Childhood apraxia of speech, oral apraxia, dysarthria, moderate ID, seizures, and motor impairments.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0011098","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001270"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:36459f75-dbd2-4b8d-bdff-ce27236fc6e2_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:0e7183d5-c3ac-4166-b533-7faf21ef0a35","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015559.3(SETBP1):c.2665C>T (p.Arg889Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/636309"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000880"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463886"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463886","rdfs:label":"Eising et al. exome case"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1547,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:a82bf512-3e33-49e2-85c5-41ecb52882ed","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100038","gene":"hgnc:15573","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"SETBP1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder as early as 2011 (Filges et al., PMID: 21037274). Clinical features observed in individuals with variants in SETBP1 include intellectual disability, autism, speech difficulty, motor and developmental delays, seizures, hypotonia, behavior challenges, and facial dysmorphisms. At least 20 unique loss-of-function (LOF) variants (nonsense, frameshift, large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. This curation includes 7 probands described in 4 publications to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points; PMIDs: 23020937, 25217958, 29463886, 25356899); however, more evidence is available in the literature. The mechanism of disease is proposed to be haploinsufficiency (PMID: 21037274). Of note, germline missense variants in SETBP1, particularly variants affecting amino acids 868-871, have been implicated in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, which will be assessed separately. Clinical features of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome include severe intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, and congenital anomalies. The proposed mechanism of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome is gain-of-function (GOF) causing SETBP1 protein to accumulate (PMID: 28346496). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms between LOF variants associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorder and GOF missense variants associated with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. In summary, SETBP1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
