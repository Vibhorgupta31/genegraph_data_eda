Expression profiling of Dcaf17 showed highest expression in testis. Analyses of Dcaf17 transcripts during post-natal development of testis at different ages displayed gradual increase in Dcaf17 mRNA levels with the age. Although Dcaf17 disruption did not have any effect on female fertility, Dcaf17 deletion led to male infertility due to abnormal sperm development. The Dcaf17 -/- mice produced low number of sperm with abnormal shape and significantly low motility. Histological examination of the Dcaf17 -/- testis revealed impaired spermatogenesis with presence of vacuoles and sloughed cells in the seminiferous tubules. Disruption of Dcaf17 caused asymmetric acrosome capping, impaired nuclear compaction and abnormal round spermatid to elongated spermatid transition.

The syndrome is caused by mutation of the C2orf37 gene. Here we studied a cohort of seven new cases from three ethnic backgrounds, presenting with the hallmarks of WSS, in an effort to extend the mutational spectrum of this disorder. Genetic analysis revealed a novel mutation in each of the four families investigated, of which three were nonsense mutations and the fourth was a splice site ablation. We also examined a separate collection of 11 cases presenting with deafness and dystonia, two constituents of WSS, but found no pathogenic changes. This study doubles the number of known mutations for this disorder, confirms that truncating mutations in C2orf37 are the only known cause of WSS, and suggests that mutations in this gene do not contribute significantly to cases presenting with isolated elements of WSS such as deafness and dystonia. The lack of correlation between clinically expressivity of WSS and the site of the eight truncating mutations strongly supports that they are equally null, while the intrafamilial variability argues for an important role of modifiers in this disease.","dc:creator":"Alazami AM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"C2orf37 mutational spectrum in Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome patients."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20507343","rdfs:label":"Italian patient"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"downgraded because of consanguinity"},{"id":"cggv:0c36dcb8-f76e-4093-b66b-87c209ec43ff_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4890fa0a-8503-479c-88e0-2bd3989fac36","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0000819","obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0001249"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:0c36dcb8-f76e-4093-b66b-87c209ec43ff_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:ddf52bb1-6423-4e4c-8bb9-bea710048fa4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025000.4(DCAF17):c.535C>T (p.Gln179Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA349277026"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29178422"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29178422","rdfs:label":"Family B(III-4)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"2 proximal stops predicted to lead to NMD.

Neurologic involvement includes childhood-onset moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, mild intellectual disability adolescent- to young adult-onset of extrapyramidal findings, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Brain imaging typically reveals iron deposition in the globus pallidus and periventricular leukodystrophy. We report the case of a 31-year-old Portuguese female, the only child of a consanguineous couple. She presented with cognitive impairment, spastic paraparesis, lower limb dystonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. She also had hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism associated with primary amenorrhea, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with retinopathy, primary hypothyroidism, moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and alopecia.

Alopecia, hypogonadism, loss of hearing, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus (DM) and neurological disorders are the components of this syndrome. The syndrome is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in DCAF17, and has recently been implicated in the development of both male and female gonads, thus resulting in hypogonadism. Case report A 16-year-old girl with consanguineous parents was admitted to our hospital with absence of breast development and amenorrhea. Hypogonadism was detected, in the form of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify the genetic etiology underlying the hypogonadism. A novel homozygous variant c.1091 + 1G > A was detected in DCAF17. Both parents were sequenced and identified as heterozygous for the same mutation. Conclusions We report a novel mutation detected in the DCAF17 gene and discuss the clinical findings in patients with previously reported mutations. Various manifestations of WSS, such as alopecia, endocrinological and neurological disorders, do not emerge until later in life, and therefore this situation can be challenging to diagnose particularly in pediatric cases, as in the present report. Careful attention should be paid to these additional findings, which may lead to early diagnosis and reduced genetic analysis costs, in patients with hypogonadism. In addition, there was no obvious genetic-phenotype correlation in reported cases.","dc:creator":"Kurnaz E","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A novel DCAF17 homozygous mutation in a girl with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome and review of the current literature."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31472064","rdfs:label":"Proband (Kurnaz et al)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"downgraded for consanguinity"},{"id":"cggv:ccbb49eb-463a-445f-8690-2d412c41ee24_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8a6fa4d3-78b5-4ab5-b74c-e90824bba2bf","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0000819","obo:HP_0001332","obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0001249"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ccbb49eb-463a-445f-8690-2d412c41ee24_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:2088e50d-d7be-43da-8721-c86fe1ea303d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025000.4(DCAF17):c.906G>A (p.Trp302Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/31581"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20507343"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20507343","rdfs:label":"Central Italian patient"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"no consanguinity known in family."},{"id":"cggv:25c6b6d6-74ab-4993-8e28-3a6fcd399898_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4651e448-adf0-4f99-864d-8835523eb392","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000819","obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0000135"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:25c6b6d6-74ab-4993-8e28-3a6fcd399898_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:46e8b2fb-5e8b-4c52-ba06-40862ff58a79"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21304230","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a combination of hypogonadism, alopecia, diabetes mellitus (DM), mental retardation and extrapyramidal signs, not described previously in Israel.

Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS. Considerable phenotypic heterogeneity exists in WSS with regard to severity, organs involvement and age of onset, both in inter-familial and intra-familial cases. In this study, the genetic characterization of a consanguineous pedigree showing mild features of WSS was performed, followed by structural analysis of truncated protein. Exome sequencing identified a novel single base deletion variant (c.270delA; K90Nfs8*) in third exon of the gene DCAF17 (RefSeq; NM_025000), resulting in a truncated protein. Structural analysis of truncated DCAF17 revealed absence of amino acid residues crucial for interaction with DDB1. Taken together, the data confirmed the single base pair deletion as the underlying cause of this second report of WSS from Pakistan. This signifies the vital yet unexplored role of DCAF17 both in development and maintenance of adult tissues homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Ali RH","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Exome sequencing revealed a novel biallelic deletion in the DCAF17 gene underlying Woodhouse Sakati syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26612766","rdfs:label":"Pakistani patient (Ali et al)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded for consanguinity."},{"id":"cggv:eee1c9a4-f4d1-4c32-8b9a-bc3ac53d4e6b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:84b7cd30-ca49-4fdf-8e14-a72bc5be269e","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001596","obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000365"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:eee1c9a4-f4d1-4c32-8b9a-bc3ac53d4e6b_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:46e8b2fb-5e8b-4c52-ba06-40862ff58a79"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21964978"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21964978","rdfs:label":"Saoudi patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Founder Saoudi variant, already scored"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":9}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":3175,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:21624d9d-71af-4038-9c71-5f616cc11913","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009419","gene":"hgnc:25784","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The DCAF17 gene is located on chromosome 2 at 2q31.1 and encodes the DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 17 protein, which is involved in protein ubiquitination.\nDCAF17 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome in 2008 (Alazami et al., 2008 PMID 19026396). At least 18 nonsense, frameshift or splice site variants in DCAF17 have been reported in humans (Alazami et al., 2008, PMID 19026396; Alazami et al., 2010 PMID 20507343; Habib et al., 2011 PMID 21963443; Abdulla et al., 2015 PMID 26440089; Ali et al., 2016 PMID 26612766; Gurbuz et al., 2017 PMID 29178422; Sendur et al., 2019 PMID 31152917; Kurmaz et al., 2019 PMID 31472064; Louro et al., 2019 PMID 31347785; Shah et al., 2020 PMID 31323129). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 22 probands in 15 publications. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in additional family members. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function variants. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and mouse models that reproduce part of the human phenotype Alazami et al., 2008, PMID 19026396; Gurbuz et al., 2017, PMID 29178422; Ali et al., 2018, PMID 29907856). Male DCAF17 knockout mice have hypogonadism and infertility. \n\nIn summary, biallelic loss of function variants in DCAF17 are definitely associated with autosomal recessive Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome. Woodhouse Sakati syndrome is a recognizable condition that is often clinically diagnosed. The association between DCAF17 and Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome has been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 18Dec2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nDCAF17 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome in 2008 (Alazami et al 2008, PMID 19026396).
