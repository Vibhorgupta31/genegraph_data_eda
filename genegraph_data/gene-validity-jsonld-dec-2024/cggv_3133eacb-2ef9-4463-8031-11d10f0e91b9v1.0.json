The interactions of collagen types I and V were studied using an in vitro self-assembly system. Collagens were purified from lathyritic chick embryos in the presence of protease inhibitors. The type V collagen preparations contained higher molecular weight forms of the alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V) chains constituting 60-70% of the total.

In vitro, this purified type V collagen formed thin fibrils with no apparent periodicity, while type I collagen fibrils had a broad distribution of large diameters. However, when type I collagen was mixed with increasing amounts of type V collagen a progressive and significant decrease in both the mean fibril diameter and the variance was observed for D periodic fibrils. The amino-terminal domain of the type V collagen molecule was required for this regulatory effect and in its absence little diameter reducing activity was observed. Electron microscopy using collagen type-specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the fibrils formed were heterotypic, containing both collagen types I and V.

The majority of mutations lead to a non-functional COL5A1 allele, as a result of the introduction of a premature stopcodon in one COL5A1 transcript. A minority of mutations affect the structure of the type V collagen central helical domain. We show that mutations in the signal peptide (SP) domain of the preproá1(V)-collagen chain cause classic EDS. The missense mutations (p.L25R and p.L25P) are located in the crucial hydrophobic SP core, which is indispensible for preprotein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, mutant type V procollagen is retained within the cell, leading to a decreased amount of type V collagen in the extracellular matrix and disturbed collagen fibrillogenesis.

Eight of 28 probands with classical EDS who were heterozygous for expressed polymorphisms in COL5A1 showed complete or nearly complete loss of expression of one COL5A1 allele. Reduced levels of proalpha1(V) mRNA relative to the levels of another type V collagen mRNA, proalpha2(V), were also observed in the cultured fibroblasts from EDS probands. Products of the two COL5A1 alleles were approximately equal after the addition of cycloheximide to the fibroblast cultures. After harvesting of mRNAs from cycloheximide-treated cultured fibroblasts, heteroduplex analysis of overlapping reverse transcriptase-PCR segments spanning the complete proalpha1(V) cDNA showed anomalies in four of the eight probands that led to identification of causative mutations, and, in the remaining four probands, targeting of CGA-->TGA mutations in genomic DNA revealed a premature stop at codon in one of them.

Several explanations for this failure to detect mutations have been proposed, including genetic heterogeneity, failure of allele expression, and technical difficulties. Genetic heterogeneity has been confirmed as an explanation for such failure, since causative mutations have been identified in the COL5A1, COL5A2, and tenascin X genes and since they have been inferred in the COL1A2 gene. Nonetheless, in the majority of families with autosomal dominant inheritance of EDS, there appears to be linkage to loci that contain the COL5A1 or COL5A2 genes. To determine whether allele-product instability could explain failure to identify some mutations, we analyzed polymorphic variants in the COL5A1 gene in 16 individuals, and we examined mRNA for the expression of both alleles and for alterations in splicing. We found a splice-site mutation in a single individual, and we determined that, in six individuals, the mRNA from one COL5A1 allele either was not expressed or was very unstable. We identified small insertions or deletions in five of these cell strains, but we could not identify the mutation in the sixth individual. Thus, although as many as one-half of the mutations that give rise to EDS types I and II are likely to lie in the COL5A1 gene, a significant portion of them result in very low levels of mRNA from the mutant allele, as a consequence of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.","dc:creator":"Schwarze U","dc:date":"2000","dc:title":"Null alleles of the COL5A1 gene of type V collagen are a cause of the classical forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (types I and II)."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10796876","rdfs:label":"P10"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The frameshift variant c.3887del (p.Pro1296ArgfsTer?) generates a premature stop codon in exon 58 of 66 and is expected to result in NMD."},{"id":"cggv:38af9226-6f65-4b00-8bf9-b5a0f8031bb4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:69981b4a-245e-4ed3-9df3-e88d14f481bc","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":32,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was amplified and sequenced across all exons.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001075","obo:HP_0001027","obo:HP_0000978","obo:HP_0000974","obo:HP_0001382"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"COL5A2 was sequenced across the full coding sequence.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:38af9226-6f65-4b00-8bf9-b5a0f8031bb4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:135cce11-cc54-453f-94a2-f5c1ecf9aa89","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000093.5(COL5A1):c.4203dup (p.Gly1402ArgfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139532061"}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10796876"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10796876","rdfs:label":"P4"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The frameshift variant c.4203dup (p.Gly1402ArgfsTer?) generates a premature stop codon in exon 57 of 66 and is expected to result in NMD."},{"id":"cggv:c882ccef-0d15-4f34-a268-4349794467f4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:63adeff4-6f1b-437b-9df3-d5ff8738ede8","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Heteroduplex analysis was performed and PCR products showing size variants, as well as their corresponding COL5A1 exons and exon/intron junctions, were sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001075","obo:HP_0000974","obo:HP_0001382"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Did not determine whether haploinsufficiency of COL5A2 was present in the study population.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:c882ccef-0d15-4f34-a268-4349794467f4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:dcd9a0d1-ae24-4e20-9f6e-7f4e7116df66","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000093.5(COL5A1):c.2430+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16612796"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10777716"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10777716","rdfs:label":"EDS43"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"The splice variant c.2430+1G>A was determined by RT-PCR to result in the inclusion of 178bp of intron 28 (due to use of an alternative splice donor site) which causes a frameshift and premature stop codon.

Nine discrete clinical subtypes have been classified. We have investigated the molecular defect in a patient with clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes types I/II and VII. Electron microscopy of skin tissue indicated abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis with longitudinal sections showing a marked disruption of fibril packing giving very irregular outlines to transverse sections. Analysis of the collagens produced by cultured fibroblasts showed that the type V collagen had a population of alpha 1 (V) chains shorter than normal. Peptide mapping suggested a deletion within the triple helical domain. RTPCR amplification of mRNA covering the whole of this domain of COL5A1 showed a deletion of 54 bp. Although six Gly-X-Y triplets were lost, the essential triplet amino acid sequence and C-propeptide structure were maintained allowing mutant protein chains to be incorporated into triple helices. Genomic DNA analysis identified a de novo G+3-->T transversion in a 5' splice site of one COL5A1 allele. This mutation is analogous to mutations causing exon skipping in the major collagen genes, COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1, identified in several cases of osteogenesis imperfecta and EDS type IV. These observations support the hypothesis that type V, although quantitatively a minor collagen, has a critical role in the formation of the fibrillar collagen matrix.","dc:creator":"Nicholls AC","dc:date":"1996","dc:title":"An exon skipping mutation of a type V collagen gene (COL5A1) in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8950675","rdfs:label":"Nicholls Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"The intronic variant c.3906+3G>T was predicted to disrupt a donor splice site causing skipping of exon 49.

Childhood bruising is often the first presentation of classical EDS, which is characterized by joint laxity, fragile, hyperextensible skin, poor wound healing, widened, atrophic scars, and other manifestations of connective tissue weakness (reviewed in PMID: 20847697). The relationship of COL5A1 to autosomal dominant Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic type was first reported through linkage analysis in 1995 (Loughlin et al., 1995; PMID: 8541855). In 1996, the first variants were identified in patients by Nicholls et al. (PMID: 8950675) and Wenstrup et al. (PMID: 8923000). Over 150 unique variants have been reported in humans (152 Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic variants are reported in ClinVar), the majority being frameshift, nonsense, and splicing variants resulting in null alleles, but missense and in-frame indel variants have also been reported. The mechanism for disease is primarily haploinsufficiency; the COL5A1 gene encodes the α1 chain of heterotrimeric type V collagen, which comes together with type I collagen to form collagen fibrils, thus COL5A1 haploinsufficiency is a limiting factor for sufficient production of heterotrimers, thereby compromising its regulatory role in fibril assembly (reviewed in PMID: 28192633). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Fifteen unique variants from 15 probands in 6 publications were curated (PMIDs: 9042913, 8950675, 10796876, 18972565, 8923000, 10777716). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 19 additional family members (PMIDs: 10777716, 8923000, 18972565, 9042913). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by the function of type V collagen in fibril organization (PMID: 2384532), which is consistent with the connective tissue dysfunction associated with EDS. This function is altered in patient cells (PMID: 15095409 and PMID: 14970208), but can be restored by treatment with exogenous type V collagen (PMID: 18305566). Further support is provided by a mouse model, which recapitulates many features of EDS (PMID: 16492673). In summary COL5A1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date March 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3133eacb-2ef9-4463-8031-11d10f0e91b9"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
