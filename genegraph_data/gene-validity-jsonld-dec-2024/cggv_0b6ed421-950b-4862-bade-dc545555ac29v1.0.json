Here, we show that DOCK7, a member of the DOCK180 family of proteins, regulates RGC proliferation versus differentiation. Silencing of DOCK7 in RGCs of developing mouse embryos impedes neuronal differentiation and maintains cells as cycling progenitors. In contrast, DOCK7 overexpression promotes RGC differentiation to basal progenitors and neurons. We further present evidence that DOCK7 influences neurogenesis by controlling apically directed interkinetic nuclear migration of RGCs. DOCK7 exerts its effects by antagonizing the microtubule growth-promoting function of the centrosome-associated protein TACC3. Thus, DOCK7 interaction with TACC3 controls interkinetic nuclear migration and the genesis of neurons from RGCs during cortical development.","dc:creator":"Yang YT","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"DOCK7 interacts with TACC3 to regulate interkinetic nuclear migration and cortical neurogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"DOCK7 is important for interkinetic nuclear migration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0b6ed421-950b-4862-bade-dc545555ac29_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0b6ed421-950b-4862-bade-dc545555ac29_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9a5f845a-3702-4394-9d38-55a5bc79c1b4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea6972e0-8234-44d0-9d87-ccbdd35d0e92","type":"Proband","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0100704","obo:HP_0001999"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"CMA not informative","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:9a5f845a-3702-4394-9d38-55a5bc79c1b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:fdb04fe4-3d5d-47ca-91e5-9812bdf0f037","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001367561.1(DOCK7):c.3350T>A (p.Leu1117Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340607397"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30771731","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Turkdogan D","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A novel truncating mutation of DOCK7 gene with an early-onset non-encephalopathic epilepsy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30771731","rdfs:label":"30771731_Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"Full points given for this homozygous variant using SOP 8 because phenotype is unique enough to reduce the likelihood of phenocopies."},{"id":"cggv:f20aca79-8be8-4496-8845-d6b6ce089d6a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdd7b066-e616-43b6-93ae-a6f6fed9bd7f","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"\"whole exome sequencing (WES) of genomic DNA for most of the patients, while a few were diagnosed by relevant gene panels\"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001250","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:f20aca79-8be8-4496-8845-d6b6ce089d6a_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:4c3ec01a-9f4b-4d81-bd0f-313c0bb2a548","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001367561.1(DOCK7):c.884del (p.Lys295ArgfsTer15)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA523548640"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31054490","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Epileptic encephalopathies (EE), are a group of age-related disorders characterized by intractable seizures and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities that may result in cognitive and motor delay.

We describe here three girls from two nonconsanguineous families affected by a clinical entity characterized by dysmorphic features, early-onset intractable epilepsy, intellectual disability, and cortical blindness. In individuals from each family, brain imaging also showed specific changes, including an abnormally marked pontobulbar sulcus and abnormal signals (T2 hyperintensities) and atrophy in the occipital lobe. Exome sequencing performed in the first family did not reveal any gene with rare homozygous variants shared by both affected siblings. It did, however, show one gene, DOCK7, with two rare heterozygous variants (c.2510delA [p.Asp837Alafs(∗)48] and c.3709C>T [p.Arg1237(∗)]) found in both affected sisters. Exome sequencing performed in the proband of the second family also showed the presence of two rare heterozygous variants (c.983C>G [p.Ser328(∗)] and c.6232G>T [p.Glu2078(∗)]) in DOCK7. Sanger sequencing confirmed that all three individuals are compound heterozygotes for these truncating mutations in DOCK7. These mutations have not been observed in public SNP databases and are predicted to abolish domains critical for DOCK7 function. DOCK7 codes for a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor that has been implicated in the genesis and polarization of newborn pyramidal neurons and in the morphological differentiation of GABAergic interneurons in the developing cortex. All together, these observations suggest that loss of DOCK7 function causes a syndromic form of epileptic encephalopathy by affecting multiple neuronal processes.

Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (24814191, 30771731, 30807358, 31054490). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is recessive loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro and in vivo functional assays. In summary, DOCK7 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.
