Electron and confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that monocytes from a patient homozygous for the mutation differentiated into osteoclasts normally, but when cultured on dentine discs, the osteoclasts failed to form ruffled borders and showed little evidence of bone resorption. The presence of both RUN and pleckstrin homology domains suggests that Plekhm1 may be linked to small GTPase signaling. We found that Plekhm1 colocalized with Rab7 to late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles in HEK293 and osteoclast-like cells, an effect that was dependent on the prenylation of Rab7. In conclusion, we believe PLEKHM1 to be a novel gene implicated in the development of osteopetrosis, with a putative critical function in vesicular transport in the osteoclast.","dc:creator":"Van Wesenbeeck L","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Involvement of PLEKHM1 in osteoclastic vesicular transport and osteopetrosis in incisors absent rats and humans."}},"rdfs:label":"II-2"},{"id":"cggv:f6201a9c-a5fc-400f-81d9-804f753194ae","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f6201a9c-a5fc-400f-81d9-804f753194ae_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f6201a9c-a5fc-400f-81d9-804f753194ae_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from cultured lymphoblasts resulted in 2 larger products in the affected patient.

Western blot analysis demonstrated that the Plekhm1 protein was not present in lysates of osteoclasts generated from PBMCs from the affected patient. To determine the localization of the mutated Plekhm1 proteins, they transfected HEK293 cells with truncated human or rat Plekhm1-dsRedM constructs corresponding to the mutations found in the osteopetrotic patient and the ia rat.

It encodes a protein that is required in the late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles and bone resorption. Multiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. According to criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their molecular mechanism and phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 6 (MIM#611497 ) and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis 3 (MIM#618107). This is a curation of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 6 (MONDO:0012679). *PLEKHM1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 6 in 2007 (Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2007 PMID: 17404618). \n\nOne variant (canonical splice-site) reported in one publication has been included in this curation (PMID: 17404618). An additional case harboring 2 heterozygous *PLEKHM1* mutations in exon 4 and exon 7 was published, although segregation data and the nature of the variants was not revealed (PMID: 28290981). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss-of-function. A total of 3.0 genetic points was reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical, and mouse and rat models (PMID: 17404618, 27777970, 2122370). \n\nIn summary, there is Moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *PLEKHM1* and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 6. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date (03/06/24) (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d1d3ccf3-6b4a-4182-ae30-0c68c907715a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
