We used whole-exome sequencing of a parent-offspring trio to identify the cause of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy in a boy with neonatal seizures, movement disorders, and multiple congenital anomalies who died at the age of 17 months because of respiratory illness and identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation (c.3979A>G; p.Ile1327Val) in SCN8A (voltage-gated sodium-channel type VIII alpha subunit) gene. The variant was confirmed in the proband with Sanger sequencing. Because the clinical phenotype associated with SCN8A mutations has previously been identified only in a few patients with or without epileptic seizures, these data together with our results suggest that mutations in SCN8A can lead to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with a broad phenotypic spectrum. Additional investigations will be worthwhile to determine the prevalence and contribution of SCN8A mutations to epileptic encephalopathies.

Electrophysiological recordings were  performed, and the N1768D expressing cells showed enhanced neuronal excitability, suggesting GoF mechanism for the mutation in SCN8A. Gave maximum points, but question as authors mentioned the NRP2 and UNC13 mutations being contributory, but all the mutations are too high in the general population (gnomAD) to be considered causitive (and most found in homozygous state)."},{"id":"cggv:b9c34415-7da3-4c0e-af36-ca47ee1d8e03_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e4a6806b-b460-4309-99d6-c10b4e5d3236","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"MIP capture of SCN8A and/or Sanger sequencing of SCN8A exons","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"First seizure was nocturanl bilateral convulsive with cyanosis.
