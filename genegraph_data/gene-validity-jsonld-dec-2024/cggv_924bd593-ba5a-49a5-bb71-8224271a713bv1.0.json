Mitochondiral function in wid-type and mutant cells was assessed, demonstrating that glucose response from mutant and WT cells was preserved but that glutamine stimulation abnormally generates ATP in mutant cells.Calcium stimulation was also activated by both glutamine and glucose in mutant cells while only being affected by glucose in WT.

Mutations associated with HI/HA were identified in the Glud1 gene, encoding for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). We aimed at identifying the molecular causes of dysregulation in insulin secretion and ammonia production conferred by the most frequent HI/HA mutation Ser445Leu. Following transduction with adenoviruses carrying the human GDH-wild type or GDH-S445L-mutant gene, immunoblotting showed efficient expression of the transgenes in all the investigated cell types. Enzymatic activity tested in INS-1E beta-cells revealed that the mutant was much more sensitive to the allosteric activator ADP, rendering it highly responsive to substrates. INS-1E cells expressing either the wild type or mutant GDH responded similarly to glucose stimulation regarding mitochondrial activation and insulin secretion. However, at basal glucose glutamine stimulation increased mitochondrial activity and insulin release only in the mutant cells. In mouse and human islets, expression of mutant GDH resulted in robust elevation of insulin secretion upon glutamine stimulation, not observed in control islets. Hepatocytes expressing either the wild type or mutant GDH produced similar levels of ammonia when exposed to glutamine, although alanine response was strongly elevated with the mutant form. In conclusion, the GDH-S445L mutation confers hyperactivity to this enzyme due to higher sensitivity to ADP allosteric activation. This renders beta-cells responsive to amino acid stimulation, explaining protein-induced hypoglycemia secondary to non-physiological insulin release. Hepatocytes carrying mutant GDH produced more ammonia upon alanine exposure, which underscores hyperammonemia developed by the patients.","dc:creator":"Grimaldi M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Identification of the molecular dysfunction caused by glutamate dehydrogenase S445L mutation responsible for hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia."},"rdfs:label":"S498L Variant Expression Study"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The pathogenic mechanism demonstrated here seems to be common to all known GOF variants in GLUD1.

GDH transgenic mice were generated to express the human GDH-HI H454Y mutation and human wild-type GDH in islets driven by the rat insulin promoter. H454Y transgene expression was confirmed by increased GDH enzyme activity in islets and decreased sensitivity to GTP inhibition. The H454Y GDH transgenic mice had hypoglycemia with normal growth rates. H454Y GDH transgenic islets were more sensitive to leucine- and glutamine-stimulated insulin secretion but had decreased response to glucose stimulation. The fluxes via GDH and glutaminase were measured by tracing 15N flux from [2-15N]glutamine. The H454Y transgene in islets had higher insulin secretion in response to glutamine alone and had 2-fold greater GDH flux. High glucose inhibited both glutaminase and GDH flux, and leucine could not override this inhibition. 15NH4Cl tracing studies showed 15N was not incorporated into glutamate in either H454Y transgenic or normal islets. In conclusion, we generated a GDH-HI disease mouse model that has a hypoglycemia phenotype and confirmed that the mutation of H454Y is disease causing. Stimulation of insulin release by the H454Y GDH mutation or by leucine activation is associated with increased oxidative deamination of glutamate via GDH.

At least 30 unique variants, the vast majority of which are missense, have been reported in humans. Notably, this gene has a number of mutational hotspots and de novo variants are responsible for a large percentage of known pathogenic variation. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, limited segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in three publications (PMIDs: 9571255, 11214910, 26759084), with many more case reports and publications available in the literature. A variant in this gene also segregated with disease in 4 additional members of a single family. The known mechanisms for disease are caused by both neomorphic and hypermorphic variants, either decreasing the sensitivity to GDH's inhibitors or increasing the sensitivity/adding new activators and causing a hyperactive protein (PMIDs: 16574664, 28911206). This gene-disease association is additionally supported by a transgenic mouse model that recapitulates the biochemical abnormalities observed in human probands and functional studies of one particular gain-of-function variant that defines the consistent pathogenic mechanism in this gene.\nIn summary, GLUD1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic\nsettings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:924bd593-ba5a-49a5-bb71-8224271a713b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
