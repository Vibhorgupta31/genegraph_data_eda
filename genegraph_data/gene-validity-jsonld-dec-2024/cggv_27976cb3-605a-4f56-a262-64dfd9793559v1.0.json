It presents in infancy with nystagmus, jerky head movements, hypotonia and developmental delay evolving into spastic tetraplegia with optic atrophy and variable movement disorders. A clinically similar phenotype caused by recessive mutations in GJC2 is known as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease. Both genes encode proteins associated with myelin. We describe three siblings of a consanguineous family manifesting the typical infantile-onset Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease-like phenotype slowly evolving into a form of complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia with mental retardation, dysarthria, optic atrophy and peripheral neuropathy in adulthood. Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy were consistent with a demyelinating leukodystrophy. Using genetic linkage and exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous missense c.399C>G; p.S133R mutation in MAG. This gene, previously associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, encodes myelin-associated glycoprotein, which is involved in myelin maintenance and glia-axon interaction. This mutation is predicted to destabilize the protein and affect its tertiary structure. Examination of the sural nerve biopsy sample obtained in childhood in the oldest sibling revealed complete absence of myelin-associated glycoprotein accompanied by ill-formed onion-bulb structures and a relatively thin myelin sheath of the affected axons. Immunofluorescence, cell surface labelling, biochemical analysis and mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies in a variety of cell types demonstrated a devastating effect of the mutation on post-translational processing, steady state expression and subcellular localization of myelin-associated glycoprotein. In contrast to the wild-type protein, the p.S133R mutant was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and was subjected to endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation by the proteasome. Our findings identify involvement of myelin-associated glycoprotein in this family with a disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous system, and suggest that loss of the protein function is responsible for the unique clinical phenotype.","dc:creator":"Lossos A","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Myelin-associated glycoprotein gene mutation causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease-like

Hereditary spastic paraplegia refers to a group of inherited disorders that are characterised by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. The term ‘complex’ is included as all individuals presented with additional neurological phenotypes such as ataxia, eye phenotypes, cognitive impairments, and vibratory sense deficits. Age of onset was typically in infancy and early childhood. Symptoms were slowly progressive and can sometimes present early as a static clinical course.  \n\n\n\n\nTen variants (missense and nonsense) have been reported in 8 families in 5 publications. We have included 6 probands and 7 variants in this curation (PMIDs: 26179919, 32629324, 27606346). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) had been reached (additional PMID: 24482476, 31402626). There was no functional evidence for any of the nonsense variants; however, functional evidence for two missense variants were included in the curation. The p.Ser133Arg variants showed accumulation of terminally misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum leading to their degradation (PMID: 26179919), and p.Arg118Ala/Asp variants demonstrated loss of activity of a highly conserved sialic acid binding site (PMID: 9298990). These studies support the assumption that variants in *MAG* are responsible for the patients’ phenotypes by acting through a loss of protein function activity. \n\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is further supported by a *MAG* knockout murine model (PMID: 34546337). The gene was disrupted by insertion of PGK-neo cassette into exon 5. Absence of gene expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of brains from 26-day-old homozygous mutant mice. Mice showed abnormal Schwann cell morphology, abnormal axon morphology, axon degeneration, and demyelination.  \n\n\nIn summary, there is a definitive relationship between *MAG* and autosomal recessive complex HSP. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th November, 2023 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:27976cb3-605a-4f56-a262-64dfd9793559"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
