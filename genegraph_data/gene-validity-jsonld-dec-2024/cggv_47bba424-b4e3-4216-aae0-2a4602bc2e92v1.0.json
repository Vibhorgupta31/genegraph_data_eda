The members of this subfamily have a bipartite structure: a carboxyl-terminal half with the characteristic features of the mitochondrial solute carrier superfamily and an amino-terminal extension harboring various EF-hand domains. A member of this subfamily (that we have termed Aralar) was cloned from a human heart cDNA library. The corresponding cDNA comprises an open reading frame of 2037 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 678 amino acids. The carboxyl-terminal half of Aralar (amino acids 321-678) has high similarity with the oxoglutarate, citrate, and adenine nucleotide carriers (28-29% identity), whereas the amino-terminal half (amino acids 1-320) contains three canonical EF-hands. Aralar amino-terminal half was shown to bind calcium by 45Ca2+ overlay and calcium-dependent mobility shift assays. The subcellular localization of the protein in COS cells transfected with Aralar was exclusively mitochondrial. Antibodies against Aralar amino-terminal fusion protein recognized a 70-kDa protein in brain mitochondrial fractions. Northern blot analysis showed that the protein was expressed in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. The domain structure, mitochondrial localization, and presence in excitable tissues suggests a possible function of Aralar as calcium-dependent mitochondrial solute carrier.","dc:creator":"del Arco A","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Molecular cloning of Aralar, a new member of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily that binds calcium and is present in human muscle and brain."},"rdfs:label":"SLC25A12 mRNA expressed in brain, muscle and heart "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Expressed in affected tissue (brain)"},{"id":"cggv:72c39a30-a5e2-4184-80ac-368f61c63d9c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3b718320-e898-4cf4-9e4e-cfa12bd5bbe5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"GOT2, MDH2 are both on the mitochondrial side of the malate aspartate shuttle\n\nBoth conditions are associated with developmental epileptic encephalopathies in OMIM (not yet curated by Mito GCEP)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008954","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"AGC1/Aralar/Slc25a12 is the mitochondrial carrier of aspartate-glutamate, the regulatory component of the NADH malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) that transfers cytosolic redox power to neuronal mitochondria.

Aralar-/- mice were growth-retarded, exhibited generalized tremoring, and had pronounced motor coordination defects along with an impaired myelination in the central nervous system. Analysis of lipid components showed a marked decrease in the myelin lipid galactosyl cerebroside. The content of the myelin lipid precursor, N-acetylaspartate, and that of aspartate are drastically decreased in the brain of Aralar-/- mice. The defect in N-acetylaspartate production was also observed in cell extracts from primary neuronal cultures derived from Aralar-/- mouse embryos.

These patients were clinically characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, and hypomyelination; however, there has been discussion in the literature as to whether this hypomyelination is primary or secondary to a neuronal defect. Here we report a 12-year-old patient with variants in SLC25A12 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at multiple ages. Novel compound heterozygous, recessive variants in SLC25A12 were identified: c.1295C>T (p.A432V) and c.1447-2_1447-1delAG. Clinical presentation is characterized by severe intellectual disability, nonambulatory, nonverbal status, hypotonia, epilepsy, spastic quadriplegia, and a happy disposition. The serial neuroimaging findings are notable for cerebral atrophy with white matter involvement, namely, early hypomyelination yet subsequent progression of myelination. The longitudinal MRI findings are most consistent with a leukodystrophy of the leuko-axonopathy category, that is, white matter abnormalities that are most suggestive of mechanisms that result from primary neuronal defects. We present here the first case of a patient with compound heterozygous variants in SLC25A12, including brain MRI findings, in the oldest individual reported to date with this neurogenetic condition.","dc:creator":"Kavanaugh BC","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Longitudinal MRI findings in patient with SLC25A12 pathogenic variants inform disease progression and classification."}},{"id":"cggv:31305f81-6edc-4eae-86a0-85cba3931d16_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:d95c3fc6-3724-4317-8c93-83f909974c76"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31403263"}],"rdfs:label":"Kavanaugh et al 2019 Proband "},{"id":"cggv:31305f81-6edc-4eae-86a0-85cba3931d16","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31305f81-6edc-4eae-86a0-85cba3931d16_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:31305f81-6edc-4eae-86a0-85cba3931d16_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant + WES)"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant + WES)"},{"id":"cggv:e6fb605f-4a83-43fe-af92-9a162a6384d4","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e6fb605f-4a83-43fe-af92-9a162a6384d4_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:e6fb605f-4a83-43fe-af92-9a162a6384d4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant + WES) + 0.4 (abolishes canonical splicing position - impact not confirmed by trasncriptome analysis)"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"0.1 (rare variant + WES) + 0.4 (abolishes canonical splicing position - impact not confirmed by transcriptome analysis)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.6}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":7561,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":9.6,"subject":{"id":"cggv:d741d44e-a58a-43e8-8c98-92cc1e99cc25","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:10982","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *SLC25A12* (also referred to as *AGC1* and *Aralar*) and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 21, 2023. *SLC25A12* encodes the muscle and brain specific isoform of mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier (Ca2+ binding), which is the regulatory component of the NADH malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) that transfers cytosolic redox power to mitochondria. \n\n*SLC25A12* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2009 (PMID: 19641205), in a patient with epilepsy, spasticity, and developmental delay. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SLC25A12*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SLC25A12* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (three missense, one nonsense, one intronic 2bp deletion predicted to impact splicing) in four probands from three publications (PMIDs: 24515575, 31403263, 32700846). Features seen in affected individuals include epilepsy, spasticity, developmental delay, developmental regression, and optic neuropathy. Brain MRI findings include bilateral basal ganglia lesions, thin corpus callosum, hypomyelination, and cerebellar atrophy. Notably, muscle respiratory chain enzyme assays may not show deficiency in affected individuals, but ATP production, particularly in the presence of glutamate and malate, and decreased NAA on brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are common in affected individuals.  \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence given the association of *SLC25A12* with *GOT2* and *MDH2*, which both act in the mitochondrial malate aspartate shuttle and are associated with similar phenotypes (PMID: 35008954), expression in relevant brain and muscle tissue (PMID: 9722566), and *SLC25A12* knockout studies performed in mice (PMID: 15987682). Of note, a canine model of inflammatory myopathy was reviewed (PMID: 31594244) and excluded from scoring given there are no case reports of an inflammatory myopathy in humans to date. \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *SLC25A12* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:47bba424-b4e3-4216-aae0-2a4602bc2e92"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
