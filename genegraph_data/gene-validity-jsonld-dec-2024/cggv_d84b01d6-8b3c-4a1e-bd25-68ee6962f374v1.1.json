The visual field showed a central vision on 10–12 degrees, a large infero-temporal remnant of vision between 50–80 degrees, and a few spots of vision in the superior visual field.

It is caused by loss-of-function mutations in CHM, which has an X-linked inheritance, and is thus an ideal candidate for gene replacement strategies. CHM encodes REP1, which plays a key role in the prenylation of Rab GTPases. We recently showed that an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSc)-derived RPE model for CHM is fully functional and reproduces the underlying prenylation defect. This criterion can thus be used for testing the pathogenic nature of novel variants. Until recently, missense variants were not associated with CHM. Currently, at least nine such variants have been reported but only two have been shown to be pathogenic. We report here the characterisation of the third pathogenic missense CHM variant, p.Leu457Pro. Clinically, the associated phenotype is indistinguishable from that of loss-of-function mutations. By contrast, this missense variant results in wild type CHM expression levels and detectable levels of mutant protein. The prenylation status of patient-specific fibroblasts and iPSc-derived RPE is within the range observed for loss-of-function mutations, consistent with the clinical phenotype. Lastly, considering the current climate of CHM gene therapy, we assayed whether the presence of mutant REP1 could interfere with a gene replacement strategy by testing the prenylation status of patient-specific iPSc-derived RPE following AAV-mediated gene transfer. Our results show that correction of the functional defect is possible and highlight the predictive value of these models for therapy screening prior to inclusion in clinical trials.","dc:creator":"Torriano S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Pathogenicity of a novel missense variant associated with choroideremia and its impact on gene replacement therapy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28911202","rdfs:label":"CHM6, III-9"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"This male and a first cousin have findings consistent with chroideremia and are hemizygous for a missense variant, p.Leu457Pro, in CHM.

It is caused by loss-of-function of the CHM gene product, the Rab escort protein 1 (REP1) that is involved, together with its homologue REP2, in prenylation of Rab GTPases, key regulators of intracellular vesicular traffic. Here, we report the molecular characterization of 20 unrelated Italian families affected by CHM. We identified 19 different mutations, nine of which are new. In most cases, we analyzed the effect of the mutations at the mRNA level. Furthermore, we demonstrated, by in vitro trancription/translation assays, that the mutated mRNAs produced truncated proteins in all cases but one. In fact, we also identified a novel REP1 missense variant (c.1520A>G; p.H507R) associated to CHM. Thus far, only two other CHM-associated missense mutations have been identified, one of which was a splicing alteration. We investigated the impact of the p.H507R amino acid change on REP1 structure and function, thus providing the first experimental demonstration that correlates a missense mutation in CHM with a functional impairment of REP1. Overall, our results indicate that the REP1-Rab geranyl-geranyl transferase interaction and consequently REP1-mediated Rab prenylation is essential for RPE and photoreceptor function.","dc:creator":"Esposito G","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Comprehensive mutation analysis (20 families) of the choroideremia gene reveals a missense variant that prevents the binding of REP1 with Rab geranylgeranyl transferase."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21905166","rdfs:label":"17 (AC)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This male with clinical diagnosis of choroideremia has a missense variant, p.His507Arg, in CHM.

When compared to controls (n=5), they found that BRV-transformed lymphocytes from CHM patients (n=4; all male with reduced or absent CHM mRNA in lymphocytes) efficiently prenylate the majority of its Rab proteins, except for Ram/Rab27. There was a 2-3 times higher apparent Km in the in vitro prenylation of Ram/Rab27 when REP-2 was present as compared to REP-1. This suggested a lower affinity of REP-2 for Ram/Rab27 compared to REP-1 for Ram/Rab27, and therefore indicated a mechanism for deficient prenylation in CHM cells. The effect of deficient prenylation of Ram/Rab27 in CHM cells was demonstrated in immunolocalization studies showing that in normal lymphoblasts the protein is mostly membrane bound, but in CHM cells Ram/Rab27 is predominantly cytosolic.\n\n\nFrom Western blot and immunolocalization studies, Ram/Rab27 is expressed at high levels in the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris, the two sites of earliest degeneration in CHM, but not significantly expressed in photoreceptors. The authors propose a mechanism for the retinal degeneration in CHM. Ram/Rab27 is thought to play role in the regulation of a specific vesicular transport step in RPE and/or choriocapillaris cells. The inability to efficiently prenylate Ram/Rab27 in these cells leads to a functional defect that ultimately results in cellular death.

Using recombinant Rab geranylgeranyl transferase and REPs to label unprenylated cytosolic proteins, we identified one unprenylated protein in choroideremia lymphoblasts that was prenylated in vitro more efficiently by REP-1 than by REP-2.

A critical question for potential treatment of choroideremia is whether photoreceptor degeneration results from autonomous defects in opsin transport within the photoreceptor or as a nonautonomous and secondary consequence of RPE degeneration. To address this question, we have characterized the retinal pathology in zebrafish rep1 mutants, which carry a recessive nonsense mutation in the REP1 gene. Zebrafish rep1 mutants exhibit degeneration of the RPE and photoreceptors and complete loss of visual function as measured by electroretinograms. In the mutant RPE, photoreceptor outer segment material was not effectively eliminated, and large vacuoles were observed. However, opsin trafficking in photoreceptors occurred normally.

Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and underlying choroid.  Affected males present with progressive retinal degeneration leading to night blindness in childhood or teens, develop loss of peripheral vision, and have complete loss of vision by middle age. Heterozygous females are usually asymptomatic, but characteristic areas of chorioretinal degeneration can be observed, most likely representing clonal areas of disease due to random X inactivation (Mosajee et al, 2014, PMID 23963298; MacDonald et al, 2015, PMID 20301511; Dimopoulos et al, 2017, PMID 28520608). \n The CHM gene product, known as the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP1), is involved in the lipid modification (prenylation) of Rab GTPases, a process which is essential for the role of Rab GTPases in intracellular vesicular transport (Mitsios et al, 2018, PMID 30627697).\nRearrangements in this gene, including deletions and translocations, were first reported in 1990 (Cremers et al, PMID: 2215697), and single nucleotide variants were first published in 1992 (van den Hurk et al, PMID 1598901). Since then, over 300 variants in CHM have been identified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for choroideremia (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/CHM/unique). The majority of variants are loss of function, such as nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants. However, a few missense variants have been reported (Dimopoulos et al, 2017, PMID 28520608). \nIn this curation, data from 18 probands (17 male and 1 female) with unique variants were collected (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, initiator codon, missense) (Van den Hurk et al, 1992, PMID 1598901; Bozbeyoglu et al, 2007, PMID 25390790; Esposito et al, 2011, PMID  21905166; Torriano et al, 2017, PMID 28911202). More data is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of REP1 (Mitsios et al, 2018, PMID 30627697), functional alteration studies in monocytes and fibroblasts (Seabra et al, 1995, PMID 7592656; Strunnikova et al, 2009, PMID 20027300), zebrafish and mouse models (Krock et al, 2007, PMID 17360570; Tolmachova et al, 2010, PMID 20445111), and the results of gene therapy trials (MacLaren et al, 2014, PMID 24439297).\nMore experimental data to support this gene-disease relationship is available in the literature.\nIn summary, CHM is definitively associated with choroideremia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
