Recently the locus for autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia was mapped to chromosome 19p13.3, and this disease is now attributable to mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase (the ELA2 gene). The authors hypothesized that congenital neutropenia is also due to mutations of neutrophil elastase. Patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome were referred to the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry. Referring physicians provided hematologic and clinical data. Mutational analysis was performed by sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA for each of the 5 exons of the neutrophil ELA2 gene and 20 bases of the flanking regions. RNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells was used to determine if the affected patients expressed both the normal and the abnormal transcript. Twenty-two of 25 patients with congenital neutropenia had 18 different heterozygous mutations. Four of 4 patients with cyclic neutropenia and 0 of 3 patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome had mutations. For 5 patients with congenital neutropenia having mutations predicted to alter RNA splicing or transcript structure, reverse transcriptase-PCR showed expression of both normal and abnormal transcripts. In cyclic neutropenia, the mutations appeared to cluster near the active site of the molecule, whereas the opposite face was predominantly affected by the mutations found in congenital neutropenia.

These observations provide further insight into potential mechanisms by which NE mutations cause neutropenia and suggest that abnormal protein trafficking and accelerated apoptosis of differentiating myeloid cells contribute to the severe SCN phenotype resulting from the G185R mutation.","dc:creator":"Massullo P","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Aberrant subcellular targeting of the G185R neutrophil elastase mutant associated with severe congenital neutropenia induces premature apoptosis of differentiating promyelocytes."},"rdfs:label":"Immunoblot assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:80fd22a1-7cfb-46c2-a330-47956323e5eb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62e11400-b1ea-48ee-8b7c-143fc138d780","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"G185R [NM_001972.4(ELANE):c.640G>A (p.Gly214Arg)] demonstrated altered subcellular distribution, predominantly to the nuclear and plasma membrane, not normally to the cytoplasmic compartment, which may contribute to the increased apoptosis leading to neutropenia in this patient.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15657182","rdfs:label":"immunoblot analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0cf625d7-4e47-4dbd-a664-4e1251c043dc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7dff4ba-f4ff-4da4-9d88-61b9a02ddce4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"G185R [NM_001972.4(ELANE):c.640G>A (p.Gly214Arg)] demonstrated accelerated (~3 folds) apoptosis in differentiating HL-60 cells.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15657182","rdfs:label":"Flow cytometry"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:492d9cd6-bf5d-4979-951c-ceda88098be7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3bac6f16-6151-4695-987d-59d545a9d2ae","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"NE (neutrophil elastase) G185R [NM_001972.4(ELANE):c.640G>A (p.Gly214Arg)] variant had no effect on HL-60 cell proliferation, but affect differentiating.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15657182","rdfs:label":"Analysis of cell growth and differentiation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:e51682ec-1365-48f1-b61c-beb03eec505f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c3db5296-d456-4dda-87ad-4b5382b98502","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"G185R [NM_001972.4(ELANE):c.640G>A (p.Gly214Arg)] demonstrated the aberrant processed NE.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15657182","rdfs:label":"Pulse chain analysis of metabolically labeled cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:259c43d2-b114-43bd-9e4e-a7beeb644323_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ac35ac0c-5ee1-43e4-8045-706d8c7454e6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e53841c-0ab2-4d25-84ad-abdcc3cf7256","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"This study showed all 9 SCN patients with 8 different variants of ELANE gene had eosinophilia and neutrophenia, the ROS profiles of eosinophils from these patients are similar to that from healthy control, but eosniophilia cannot compensate for the neutropenia regarding ROS-mediated function in these patients due to different ROS profiles of eosinophiles and neutropenia.

We hypothesized that inhibitors of NE, acting either by directly inhibiting enzymatic activity or as chaperones for the mutant protein, might be effective as therapy for CyN and SCN. We investigated Î²-lactam-based inhibitors of human NE (Merck Research Laboratories, Kenilworth, NJ, USA), focusing on 1 inhibitor called MK0339, a potent, orally absorbed agent that had been tested in clinical trials and shown to have a favorable safety profile. Because fresh, primary bone marrow cells are rarely available in sufficient quantities for research studies, we used 3 cellular models: patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); HL60 cells transiently expressing mutant NE; and HL60 cells with regulated expression of the mutant enzyme. In all 3 models, the cells expressing the mutant enzyme had reduced survival as measured with annexin V and FACS. Coincubation with the inhibitors, particularly MK0339, promoted cell survival and increased formation of mature neutrophils. These studies suggest that cell-permeable inhibitors of neutrophil elastase show promise as novel therapies for ELANE-associated neutropenia.","dc:creator":"Makaryan V","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Elastase inhibitors as potential therapies for ELANE-associated neutropenia."},"rdfs:label":"FACS analysis of annexin V stain for cell apoptosis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:9b3055d9-a628-4322-9286-298250413041","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d333db70-97dc-40b4-9528-3dd4edbce54f","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"HL60 cells transiently expressing G214R showed increased proportion of annexin V-positive cells, i.e., apoptosis.

Cyclic neutropenia is usually diagnosed within the first year of life based on oscillation of neutrophils and fever with approximately 21 day periodicity. Congenital neutropenia is generally diagnosed right after birth and my present with omphalitis. Individuals with ELANE-related neutropenia are at risk of developing myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most reported pathogenic variants are missense, splicing defects, small in-frame deletions, frameshift deletions or premature stop codons with dominant negative effect. Full gene deletions leading to haploinsufficiency do not cause neutropenia (PMID: 31427279). At least 100 pathogenic variants have been reported in over 100 individuals from more than 40 families. This curation includes both familial and de novo missense, small deletion and splicing variants in individuals with CyN or SCN from 4 studies (PMID: 11001877, 10581030, 10581030 and 20803142). Three studies (PMID: 15657182, 31176364 and 28754797) were evaluated encompassing biochemical function, protein interaction, functional alteration from patients cells with different variants, and cell models expressing different variants further confirm the gene and disease validity. In summary, ELANE is definitively associated with CyN and SCN. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:259c43d2-b114-43bd-9e4e-a7beeb644323"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
