Single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses reveal HERG mutations in six LQT families, including two intragenic deletions, one splice-donor mutation, and three missense mutations. In one kindred, the mutation arose de novo. Northern blot analyses show that HERG is strongly expressed in the heart.

Data on long-term outcomes of families with SQTS are limited. Methods and Results Seventeen patients with SQTS in 7 independent families (48% men; median age, 42.4 years; corrected QT interval, 324.9±40.8 ms) were followed up for 13.5±2.5 years. A history of sudden cardiac death was documented in 71% of families. A large number of them showed sudden cardiac deaths at a younger age, with a predominance of men (67%). Five patients had syncope (29%) and 9 (53%) had atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. An SQTS -related gene was found in 76% of the patients as follows: KCNH 2 ( SQTS 1) in 4, CACNA 1C ( SQTS 4) in 3, and CACN b2 ( SQTS 5) in 6. Five patients (29%) received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and 5 patients received long-term prophylaxis with hydroquinidine. During follow-up, 1 patient received an appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock attributable to ventricular fibrillation. The patient received no further implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks after treatment with hydroquinidine. Conclusions The risk of sudden cardiac death in SQTS families is high.

We describe a different mutation in the KCNH2 gene in a Chinese family with clinical evidence of SQTS. A Chinese family with a markedly short QT interval (QTc=316 ± 9 ms, n=4) and a strong family history of sudden death was investigated. Analysis of candidate genes contributing to ventricular repolarization identified a C1853T mutation in the KCNH2 gene coding for the HERG channel, resulting in an amino acid change (T618I) that was found to 100% co-segregate with the SQTS phenotype (n=4). Whole cell voltage clamp studies of the T618I mutation in HEK-cells demonstrated a 6-fold increase in maximum steady state current (146.1 ± 16.7 vs 23.8 ± 5.5 pA/pF) that occurred at a 20 mV more positive potential compared to the wild type channels. The voltage dependence of inactivation was significantly shifted in the positive voltage direction (WT -78.6 ± 6.8 vs T618I -29.3 ± 1.7 mV). Kinetic analysis revealed slower inactivation rates of T618I but faster rates of recovery from inactivation. Quinidine (5 μM) and sotalol (500 μM) had similar inhibitory effects on steady currents measured at +20 mV in WT and T618I but were less effective in inhibiting tail currents of mutant channels. The altered function of T618I-HERG channels suggests that this mutation in the KCNH2 gene is responsible for the SQTS phenotype in this family. Both quinidine and sotalol may be therapeutic options for patients with the T618I HERG mutation.","dc:creator":"Sun Y","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A novel mutation in the KCNH2 gene associated with short QT syndrome."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21130771","rdfs:label":"II5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":7}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2613,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0a0e2c4c-4d2f-4157-a611-75866f061bac","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0000453","gene":"hgnc:6251","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.2","dc:description":"KCNH2 encodes the alpha subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier cardiac potassium channel (Ikr).

Experimental evidence derived from non-patient cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cells and a rabbit animal model (PMID  30496390) all support this gene’s relationship with SQTS.
