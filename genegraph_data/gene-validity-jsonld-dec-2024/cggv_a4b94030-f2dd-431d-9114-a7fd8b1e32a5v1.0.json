Some of these classifications suffered from shortcomings, such as lack of a mechanism for continuous update in light of a rapidly evolving field, or lack of widespread input from the metabolic community at large. Our classification-the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or International Classification of Inborn Metabolic Disorders (ICIMD)-includes 1450 disorders, and differs from prior approaches in that it benefited from input by a large number of experts in the field, and was endorsed by major metabolic societies around the globe. Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features. As new disorders are discovered, we will seek the opinion of experts in the advisory board prior to inclusion in the appropriate group of the ICIMD, thus guaranteeing the continuing relevance of this classification via regular curation and expert advice.","dc:creator":"Ferreira CR","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"An international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD)."},"rdfs:label":"Mitochondrial translation defects"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes associated with PMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a4b94030-f2dd-431d-9114-a7fd8b1e32a5_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:13a3e097-42f1-4312-b4cf-005fbf438bb8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72449b8d-c8cd-4261-9d46-e644ffe27412","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Inhibition of complex IV (with the specific inhibitor KCN) reduced thiazide-sensitive 22Na+ absorption in NCC-transfected HEK293 cells by 45%.

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the progression of inherited kidney diseases, while mitochondrial-transfer RNA (mt-tRNA) variants and their pathogenic contributions to kidney disease remain largely unclear. In this study, we identified the pathogenic mt-tRNAPhe 616T>C mutation in 3 families and documented that m.616T>C showed a high pathogenic threshold, with both heteroplasmy and homoplasmy leading to isolated chronic kidney disease and hyperuricemia without hematuria, proteinuria, or renal cyst formation. Moreover, 1 proband with homoplamic m.616T>C presented ESRD as a child. No symptoms of nervous system evolvement were observed in these families. Lymphoblast cells bearing m.616T>C exhibited swollen mitochondria, underwent active mitophagy, and showed respiratory deficiency, leading to reduced mitochondrial ATP production, diminished membrane potential, and overproduction of mitochondrial ROS. Pathogenic m.616T>C abolished a highly conserved base pair (A31-U39) in the anticodon stem-loop which altered the structure of mt-tRNAPhe, as confirmed by a decreased melting temperature and slower electrophoretic mobility of the mutant tRNA.

The *MT-TF* gene encodes the mitochondrial tRNA for phenylalanine, which is located from m. 577 – 647 on the heavy strand of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n\n*MT-TF* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 1998 (PMID: 9771776), in a woman with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and a wide spectrum of associated features has been reported over time. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TF*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TF* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 16 unique variants (m.582T>C, m.583G>A, m.586G>A, m.590A>G, m.591C>T, m.602C>T, m.611G>A, m.616T>G, m.616T>C, m.618T>C, m.618T>G, m.622G>A, m.625G>A, m.641A>T, \nm.642T>C, m.643A>G) in 30 probands across 19 publications (PMIDs: 14659412, 9771776, 16806928, 21060018, 31463198, 32419253, 34607911, 21424749, 15184630, 20142618, 28267784, 31722346, 35472031, 9636664, 21882289, 16769874, 21914246, 31009750, 18977334). Cybrid studies and single fiber testing further supported the pathogenicity of several of these variants (PMIDs: 14659412, 16806928, 21060018, 32419253, 15184630, 21882289, 16769874, 18977334, 28267784). Age of onset in affected individuals varied from childhood to >60 years. Clinical features in affected individuals included mitochondrial myopathy, MELAS, myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF), chronic external progressive ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), Gitelman syndrome, epilepsy, epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), chronic kidney disease, retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, neuropathy, and neurologic/cognitive/psychiatric decline. Some affected individuals had normal brain imaging while others had cerebral, cerebellar, and/or brainstem atrophy. Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers, COX-negative fibers, and decreased respiratory chain enzyme activities in some cases, although activities were normal in other individuals.  Labs showed variable lactate levels (normal to elevated in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and/or urine) and elevated creatine kinase (CK).  Heteroplasmy levels in affected individuals were highest in muscle when multiple tissues were assessed, and ranged from 58%-homoplasmic in muscle; 0-70% in hair, 0-homoplasmic in blood, fibroblast, and urine; and in one individual was 63% in a buccal sample.\n\nThe mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.  This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 33340416, 35472031, 34607911).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MT-TF* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 16, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a4b94030-f2dd-431d-9114-a7fd8b1e32a5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
