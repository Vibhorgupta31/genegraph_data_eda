Since its first description, however, no further associated CMT families have been published. Contrarily, the only reported variant has been found in a homozygous state in 4 unaffected individuals (GnomAD). Re-assessing the first and only reported family by WES, Leal et al. identified a homozygous stop mutation in PNKP, a gene that is located in the same linkage region (Leal et al., 2018; PMID: 11112660). The authors identified 5 further families carrying biallelic loss-of-function mutations in PNKP as well, pointing towards the pathogenicity of this gene over MED25. With no further strong experimental evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between MED25 and CMT2B, we thereby classify the gene as “DISPUTED”. The likewise associated, autosomal recessive Basel-Vanagaite-Smirin-Yosef syndrome has a congenital age at onset and does not include neuropathy in its phenotypic spectrum. \n\nOnly one CMT2B family described with one mutation, WES identified another gene in the same family.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c0e0d66f-c68d-4df3-bab2-71afc448e4b0"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
